            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>R. THOMAS HOOKER was one of the moſt eſteemed Divines in <hi>England, Holland,</hi> and <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in his Day; for great Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, a piercing Judgment, ſolid Learning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Sanctity, deep Acquaintance with the Scriptures and experimental Divinity, and for awakening and ſucceſsful Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And his Name and Writings were very dear to Multitudes of the moſt ſerious Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in thoſe diſtant Countries.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> tells us, —That <q>He was born at <hi>Marfield,</hi> in <hi>Liceſterſhire</hi> in ENGLAND, about the Year 1586. His natural Temper was chearful and courteous; but accompanied with ſuch a ſenſible <hi>Grandeur of Mind,</hi> as caus'd his Friends to prognoſticate that he was born to be <hi>conſiderable:</hi> His Parents gave him a liberal Education, and ſent him to <hi>Cambridge;</hi> where he was choſe a <hi>Proctor</hi> of the <hi>Univerſity,</hi> [whoſe <hi>Office</hi> is to ſee good Orders and Exerciſes duely performed there.] where the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he had on the Reformation of ſome growing Abuſes, ſignaliz'd him; and he became a <hi>Fellow</hi> of <hi>Emanuel Colledge:</hi> The Ability and Fidelity wherewith he acquitted himſelf in his <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> was ſenſible to the

whole Univerſity; and while he was in this Employment, the more effectual <hi>Grace</hi> of GOD gave him the Experience of a true <hi>Regeneration.</hi> It pleaſed the SPIRIT of GOD very powerfully to break into the Soul of this Perſon, with ſuch a Senſe of his being expoſed to the <hi>juſt</hi> Wrath of Heaven, as fill'd him with the moſt unuſual Degrees of Horror and Anguiſh, as broke not only his <hi>Reſt</hi> but his <hi>Heart</hi> alſo, and caus'd him to cry out, <hi>While I ſuffer thy Terrors, O</hi> LORD <hi>I am diſtracted:</hi> He long had a Soul har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed with ſuch Diſtreſſes. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gave this Account of himſelf; <hi>That in the Time of his Agonies, he could reaſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the</hi> RULE, <hi>and conclude there was no Way but Submiſſion to</hi> GOD, <hi>and lying at the Foot of his Mercy in</hi> CHRIST JESUS, <hi>and waiting humbly there, 'till he ſhould pleaſe to perſwade the Soul of his Favour: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, when he came to apply this</hi> RULE <hi>to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in his own Condition, his Reaſoning would fail him, he was able to do nothing.</hi> Having been a conſiderable while thus troubled with ſuch Impreſſions from the SPIRIT of <hi>Bondage,</hi> as were to fit him for the great Services and Employments which GOD intended him; at length he receiv'd the SPIRIT of <hi>Adoption,</hi> with well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſwaſions of his Intereſt in the New-Covenant. It became his Manner at his

laying down for Sleep in the Evening, to ſingle out ſome certain <hi>Promiſe</hi> of GOD, which he wou'd repeat and ponder, and keep his Heart cloſe to it, until he found that Satisfaction of Soul wherewith he could ſay, <hi>I will lay me down in Peace and ſleep; for thou, O</hi> LORD <hi>makeſt me dwell in Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> And he would afterwards counſel Others to take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Being well got thro' the Storm of Soul, which had helped him to a <hi>moſt experimental Acquaintance</hi> with the Truths of the Goſpel, and the Way of employing and applying thoſe Truths; he was willing to ſerve the Church of GOD in the Miniſtry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Leaving the <hi>Univerſity,</hi> he now had <hi>no Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,</hi> and <hi>ſcarce any Equal,</hi> for the Skill of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a troubled Soul: He publickly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preach'd about <hi>London;</hi> and in a little Time grew famous for his miniſterial Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but eſpecially for his notable Faculty at the wiſe and fit Management of <hi>wounded Spirits.</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> of <hi>Dedham,</hi>

As his <hi>Perſon</hi> was adorned with <hi>Learning,</hi> ſo his <hi>Preaching</hi> was ſet off with a <hi>Livelineſs</hi> extraordinary: Yet the <hi>Vigour</hi> in his Miniſtry being raiſed by <hi>a Coal from the Altar,</hi> it wou'd be a Wrong to the good SPIRIT of GOD, if HE ſhould not be acknowledged the Author of it: That SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT accordingly gave a wonderful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Succeſs to the Miniſtry, wherein he ſo remarkably breathed. Hereby was <hi>a great Reformation</hi> wrought, not only in the <hi>Town,</hi> but in the <hi>adjacent Country;</hi> from all Parts whereof they came to hear the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the LORD JESUS CHRIST in the

            <p>'The Joy of the People in this Light, was but for a Seaſon: The conſciencious Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity of Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> to ſome Rites of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> then vigorouſly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, eſpecially on ſuch able and uſeful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as were moſt likely to be laid aſide by their ſcrupling thoſe Rites, made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him to lay down his Miniſtry at <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> when he had been about <hi>four Years</hi> employed there, in it. Hereupon, at the Requeſt of ſeveral eminent Perſons, he kept a <hi>School</hi> at his own hired Houſe, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Mr. <hi>John Eliot</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">This was afterwards the reverend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> of <hi>Roxbury</hi> in <hi>N. Eng.</hi>

In a Manuſcript written by our bleſſed <hi>Eliot,</hi> he gives a very great Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>little Academy</hi> then maintained in the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Hooker;</hi> and among other Things, he ſays, <q>

               </q>
               <q>While he continued thus in the Heart of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and in the Hearts of the People there; he ſignaliz'd his Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in many other Inſtances: The <hi>godly Miniſters</hi> round about the Country wou'd have Recourſe to him, to be directed and reſolved in their <hi>difficult Caſes;</hi> and it was by his Means that thoſe godly Miniſters held their <hi>monthly Meetings,</hi> for <hi>Faſting, Prayer,</hi> and profitable <hi>Conferences.</hi> He was indeed a <hi>general Bleſſing</hi> to the Church of GOD. And that which made the <hi>ſilencing</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> more unaccountable, was, that <hi>ſeven and forty conformable Miniſters</hi> of the neighbouring Towns, underſtanding the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> pretended Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Miniſtry to be injurious or offenſive to <hi>them,</hi> ſubſcribed a <hi>Petition</hi> to the Biſhop for his Continuance in the Miniſtry at <hi>Chelmsford:</hi> Yet all would not avail.

any further into the Hands of his Enemies; ſent the Sum into Court; and having by the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> a private Receſs for a Time, he fled from the Purſevants to take his Paſſage for the LOW COUNTRIES: At parting with ſome of his Friends, one of them ſaid, <hi>Sir, what if the Wind ſhou'd not be fair when you come to the Veſſel?</hi> Whereto he inſtantly replied, <hi>Brother, Let us leave that with Him who keep the Wind in the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of his Hand:</hi> And it was obſerv'd, that tho' the Wind was croſs 'till he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, yet it immediately then came about fair and freſh; and he was no ſooner under ſail, but the <hi>Officer</hi> arriv'd at the Sea-ſide, happily too late to come at him.</q>

               <q>Arriving in HOLLAND, he was invited to a Settlement with Mr. <hi>Paget</hi> at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> But being ſecretly willing Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſhould not accept the Invitation, he went to <hi>Delft;</hi> where he was moſt kindly receiv'd by Mr. <hi>Forbs</hi> an aged and holy <hi>Scotch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> under whoſe Miniſtry many <hi>Engliſh Merchants</hi> were then ſettled.

               <p n="1">I. FIRST, Such <hi>Hinderances</hi> as really <hi>keep
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005214_0017_1016E54A175B0CB8"/>
Men from coming to take hold of Chriſt at all;</hi> which are briefly theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Blind, Careleſs, or Preſumptuous Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> whereby Men content themſelves with their preſent Condition, preſuming all is well with them, when there is no ſuch matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Being convinced of this, they <hi>bethink how to ſave themſelves by their own Strength;</hi> and thereupon ſet upon a Reformation of Life, thinking to make God amends by reforming ſome Sins which they hear themſelves reproved of by the Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Sinner being convinced of his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inability to pleaſe God in himſelf, at length gets up a Stair higher, and ſees all his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and Prayers, and Duties to be of no power in themſelves, but that he muſt leave all, and cleave only unto Chriſt by Faith; and this he thinks he can do well enough, and ſo <hi>thruſts himſelf upon Chriſt, thinking all the work is then done, and no more to be looked after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. If he ſees this fails him too, then he goes yet further, and confeſſeth he cannot come to Chriſt, except Chriſt give him his Hand, and help him up; therefore now he will <hi>attend on the Ordinances, and labour and beſtir himſelf hard in the uſe of all good Means, conceiving thereby to hammer out at laſt a Faith of his own</hi> to make him happy. And here he reſts, hanging as it were upon the outſide of the Ark ſo long, till
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005214_0018_1016E572FA715D60"/>
at laſt the waves and winds growing fierce and violent, he is beaten off, and ſo ſinks for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Beſides theſe, there are OTHER kinds of <hi>Hindrances</hi> which do not indeed deprive a Man of Title and Intereſt to eternal Happineſs, but <hi>make the way tedious and uncomfortable, ſo that be cannot come to Chriſt ſo readily as he deſires and longs to do:</hi> The ground whereof is this; when Men, out of carnal Reaſon, contrive another way to come to Chriſt than ever he ordained or revealed; when we <hi>ſet up our Standards by God's Standard,</hi> or <hi>our Threſhold by his,</hi> Ezek. 43.8. and out of our own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, make another ſtate of believing than ever Chriſt required or ordained. No marvel that we come ſhort of him: For thus we put Rubs, and make Bars in our way: We mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle our Hands, and fetter our Feet, and then ſay that we cannot take, nor go: Thus it is with you poor Chriſtians, and the Fault is your own But, amongſt many, there be <hi>three Hindrances</hi> which are chiefly to be obſerved,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Three</hi> main <hi>Hindrances</hi> which <hi>keep</hi> Men from <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  </note> by which many <hi>gracious Hearts</hi> are marvelouſly hindered from coming to, and from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that Comfort from Chriſt which they might, and he is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to impart unto them.</p>
               <p n="1">[1] <hi>Firſt;</hi> The diſtreſſed Soul, being (haply) truly humbled, takes notice of the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005214_0019_1016E5A773A7A200"/>
                  <hi>Beauty of Holineſs,</hi> and the Image of God ſtampt on the Hearts of his Children, and of all thoſe precious Promiſes which God hath made to all that are his; now the Soul ſeeing theſe, begins thus to Reaſon with it ſelf and ſaith, <q>Surely if I were ſo holy and ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then I might have hope to receive the pardon of my Sins: Or were my Heart ſo enlarged to Duties, and could my Heart be ſo carried with Power againſt my Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to maſter them, then there were ſome Hope: But when I have <hi>no Power</hi> againſt Sin, nor any Heart to ſeek ſo importunately for a Chriſt, how dare I think that any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy </q>belongs to me, having ſo many Wants? Thus they dare not come to the Promiſe; and they will not venture upon it, becauſe they have not that Enlargement to Duties, and that Power againſt Corruption which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Saints of God have.</p>
               <p>But we muſt know, this doth not hinder; and that we make that a Hindrance, which, in Truth, is none. For (obſerve it) we muſt not think to bring our Enlargements and Hope to the Promiſe, but go to the Promiſe for them: Hope muſt be ſtirred, and Deſire quickned, and Love and Joy kindled by the Promiſe. But who made this Condition of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> That a Man muſt have ſo much of Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before he can come to the Promiſe? Our Saviour being our Huſband, requires no
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005214_0020_1016E575C0541B40"/>
Portion with us, nor ever look'd after any: All that he looks for is meer Poverty and Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs. If thou haſt nothing, yet he will have thee with thy nothing; provided that thou wilt have him. Therefore it is thus written, <hi>The Rich he ſends away empty;</hi> but the Poor he ſatisfies, and the Thirſty he refreſhes with Good; and ſo, as that there is nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on our Side but to receive him as a Huſband: For, <hi>Buy without Money</hi> is the Text. You muſt not come and think to buy a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: The Lord looks for no Power or Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency from you, of yourſelves; nor of your ſelves any Power againſt Corruption, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement to Duties: If you will be content that Chriſt ſhall take all from you, and diſpoſe of you and all; then take a Saviour, and then you have him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the poor Soul ſaith, <hi>If I go thus hood-wink'd, how ſhall I know that I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, and how ſhall I know that I have a true Title to the Promiſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer: There is no better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in the World to prove that thou haſt an Intereſt in Chriſt, than this, which is thy taking of the Lord Chriſt as a Saviour wholly, and as an Huſband only, John 1.12. <hi>As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as received him, to them he gave Power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> He doth not ſay, To as many as had ſuch Enlargement to Duties, and ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005214_0021_1016E5AB915174D8"/>
Power againſt Corruption; but if thou wilt take Chriſt upon thoſe Terms on which he offers himſelf: There is no better Argument under Heaven than that, to prove that thou haſt a Title to the Promiſe. Indeed there is a deſperate Deſpair that often ſeizeth upon the Hearts of diſtreſſed Sinners.</p>
               <p n="2">[2.] Therefore in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Place, as the Sinner looks upon the <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and of <hi>Grace,</hi> and upon <hi>his own Inſufficiency</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which makes him that he will not venture upon the Promiſe; ſo he looks too <hi>altogether</hi> upon his own <hi>Sinfulneſs and Worthleſsneſs,</hi> and therefore dare not venture upon it: He views the Number of his Sins ſo many and vile, and the Continuance of them ſo long, and durable; and he ſeeth the Floods of Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations coming in ſo amain upon his Soul, and Satan to boot, (who helps him forward in all this,) therefore he dares not make out unto Chriſt. But this is the Policy of the Devil, who (if he can) will make a Man to ſee Sin thro' his own Spectacles, or not to ſee it at all; and then to ſay, There is Mercy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in a Saviour, and therefore I may live as I liſt. But when the Sinner will needs ſee his Sin, then he will let him ſee nothing but Sin; and this, to the End that he may deſpair for ever.</p>
               <p>Now here the poor Sinner is at a ſtand, and can go no further: For tell him of the Mercy
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005214_0022_1016E55888992818"/>
of God, and of the plenteous Redemption in Chriſt, and of the Riches of the Freeneſs of God's Grace: <q>What (ſaith he) ſhould I think there is any Mercy for <hi>me,</hi> and that I have any Intereſt in Chriſt? That were ſtrange.</q> And thus the Soul is always por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and always too much faſtned and ſettled upon his Corruptions, ever ſtirring the Sore, without ever going to the Phyſician. Where note, That a Man is as well kept from looking to Chriſt by <hi>Deſpair,</hi> as by <hi>Preſumption.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſees his Sin, he thinks his Condition is good, and that he hath a Sufficiency of his own, and needs not go to Chriſt; and when he ſees his Sin, then he beholds ſo much Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in himſelf, and in it, that he dares not go to Chriſt, leſt when he comes before him, he ſends him down to that ever-burning Lake of Fire and Brimſtone. Herein the Devil is very ſubtile: But this doth not hinder our Title to Chriſt; neither ought it to diſcourage us from laying hold on Salvation. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> (Obſerve it) For whom did Chriſt come into the World, and for whom did he die when he was come? Was it for the <hi>Righteous?</hi> Such needed him not: It was for the <hi>poor Sinner</hi> that judgeth himſelf, that condemns himſelf, and that finds he cannot ſave himſelf. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 Tim. 1.15. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave Sinners, of whom I am the chief:</hi> And the Prophet, Zech.

13.1. <hi>There is a Fountain opened for Sin and for Uncleanneſs;</hi> that is, for all ſorts of Sins, and kind of Sinners; be their Iniquities never ſo great, and never ſo vile, there is a Fountain ſet open for them; come who will. There was never any ſaved that was not a Rebel firſt; nor any received to Mercy, that firſt oppoſed not the Mercies of God, and his Grace in Chriſt. The fiery Serpents did ſting the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Wilderneſs; firſt then they were ſtung, and being ſtung, there was a brazen Serpent to heal them. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve the Folly of this Plea: What Scripture ever ſaid, that the Greatneſs of <hi>Man's Sin</hi> could hinder the Greatneſs of <hi>God's Mercy?</hi> No Scripture ſaith ſo; we ſee <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayeth to the contrary, Pſal. 25.11. <hi>Have Mercy upon me, O Lord, and pardon my Sins, for they are great:</hi> Nay, God himſelf doth the quite contrary, Iſai. 43.24, 25. <hi>Thou haſt made me ſerve with thy Sins, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me with thine Iniquities; yet I am he that blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out thy Tranſgreſſions for my Names Sake.</hi> When the Jews did tire God with their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered Manners, and burthened him with their ſinful Courſes; then the Lord, for his own Names ſake, would not ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their Iniquities againſt them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again obſerve, That Sins, tho' they be never ſo heinous of themſelves, yet if the Soul can ſee them, and the Heart be burdened with
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005214_0024_1016E5798AB005E0"/>
them, they are ſo far from hindering the Work of Faith, and from making thee uncapable of Mercy, that they fit thee the rather to go to Chriſt. The Truth is (which I pray you to take Notice of) it is not properly our <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs,</hi> but our <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Haughtineſs</hi> that hinders us from coming to Chriſt; for we would have ſomething from ourſelves, and not all from him. But to the diſtreſſed Soul, that ſees the Vileneſs of his Sins; I ſay, ſuppoſe thy Sins were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; yet upon ſuch a Suppoſe, thou would'ſt not go to Chriſt, as perſwaded of the Freeneſs of his Grace; but becauſe thy Sins are not many, and upon Conceit that thou haſt a Worthineſs in thy ſelf, and would'ſt bring ſomething to Chriſt, and not receive all from him; therefore thou keepeſt back. And is it not plain (then) that it is thy <hi>Pride</hi> and thy <hi>Self-conceitedneſs</hi> that hinders thee? Thou thinkeſt thou muſt have thus much Grace and Holineſs; and Chriſt muſt not juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Ungodly, but the godly Man. But I tell thee, that, upon ſuch Terms, he will never juſtify thee, or any Man while the World ſtands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But the Soul replies again; <hi>My Sins are worſe than ſo, not only becauſe they are many, but becauſe of the Mercy and Salvation that I have rejected, and which hath been offered me from Day to Day.</hi>

There is no Limitation of the Riches of God's free Grace, except the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; therefore ſaith Chriſt, Rev. 3.20. <hi>I ſtand at the Door and knock:</hi> Though he cry 'till he be hoarſe, and ſtand 'till he be weary, yet he ſtands ſtill: If any adulterous or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Wretch open, the Lord will come in, and bring ſtore of Comfort to him, and ſup with him.</p>

                  <q>Oh, all that is true, (ſaith the poor Soul) had I but a Heart to <hi>mourn</hi> for my Baſeneſs. See my Sins I do, but this is my Miſery, I cannot be burdened with them; I have a Heart that cannot break and mourn

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Hurts not neither; provided that thy Heart be weary of it ſelf, becauſe it cannot be weary of Sin, Mich, 7.18. <hi>The Lord ſheweth Mercy, becauſe he will ſhew Mercy:</hi> It is not becauſe <hi>thou</hi> canſt pleaſe him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mercy pleaſeth him. When did the Lord ſhew Mercy to <hi>Paul?</hi> I ſay, When, but even when <hi>Paul</hi> did expreſs moſt Malice againſt him? Acts 16. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> He perſecutes Chriſt, and yet Chriſt pities him, and ſhews him Mercy: And ſo the churliſh Jaylor, when he was moſt oppoſite againſt the <hi>Means of Grace,</hi> the Lord even then ſhewed moſt Compaſſion upon him.

Why, what tho' <hi>Paul</hi> and the Jaylor were bad enough, ſo bad as you ſay? Yet they were made better by the Means: But this is my hopeleſs Condition, that the Means of Grace prevail nothing on me. Oh, is there ſuch an heart in Hell as I have? For how bad muſt it needs be,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005214_0027_1016E545B8001328"/>
when all the Means in the World can do it no more Good! And now, methinks I feel my Heart more hard and inexorable under all God's Ordinances, than when at firſt I believed. My Condition therefore is (moſt certainly) hopeleſs, ſeeing the Means that ſhould ſoften me, do but harden me, and make me worſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is <hi>the laſt Plea</hi> whereby the Devil keeps in, and poſſeſſeth the Heart of a poor heartleſs Sinner. But let me anſwer thee, and for Anſwer, I ſay: This hurts not neither: For here at leaſt thou mayſt have Hope of Mercy? And here obſerve the <hi>three</hi> Things by Way of <hi>Anſwer;</hi> and know that.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt;</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Means of Grace</hi> do work Good, if they make thee more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of thy Hardneſs and Deadneſs. Tho' haply they work not <hi>that Good,</hi> and <hi>after that Manner</hi> that thou deſireſt; yet if they make thee to ſee thy Baſeneſs, thy Hardneſs of Heart, and Dulneſs of Spirit, in Regard of that Body of Death which hangs upon thee, then the Word and they work in the beſt Manner; becauſe it is after God's Manner, howſoever not after thine. That Phyſick works moſt kindly, that makes the Party ſick before it works: So it is with the Word. Before, thou hadſt a proud Heart, and didſt therefore lift up thy ſelf in thine own Abilities, and didſt truſt in thine own Strength, and thou tho'tſt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005214_0028_1016E57E09B15A90"/>
that thy Care, and the Improvement of the Means, would work Wonders: But now the Word works ſweetly, when it makes thee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, that a wounded Soul is the Gift of God, not of Man, nor of the Means; when it makes thee look up to God for it, and to prize it when thou haſt it; and to wait upon God with thy daily Prayers, ſtill to continue it ſo. To feel Deadneſs, is Life; and to feel Hardneſs is Softneſs: Only remember this one <hi>Caution;</hi> except there be ſome Luſt or Diſtemper that thy Heart hankers after, (for then the Word will harden thee, becauſe thou hardneſt thy ſelf) that one I ſay excepted, thou art in a good Way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly;</hi> (Mark this, I beſeech you) Thou art the Cauſe why thy Heart is not ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and why the <hi>Word</hi> works not upon thy Soul: The Diſtemper of thine own Heart, hinders the working of the Word, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of God's Providence, and the Tenour of the Covenant of Grace. Thou thinkeſt to limit the holy One of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but that may not be: For, his Covenant is a Covenant of Grace; and the Lord (who is free) will not ſtand bent to thy Bow, or give thee Grace when thou wilt; for,<note place="margin">Wait for Mercy.</note> 
                  <hi>it is not for</hi> us <hi>to know the Times and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> What if the Lord will not give thee Grace this Year, nor the next, nor all thy Life? If at the laſt Gaſp he will drop in a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005214_0029_1016E5B0F0221CF0"/>
little of his Favour, it is more than he owes thee. Therefore hear to Day, and wait to Morrow, and continue in ſo doing, becauſe thou knoweſt not when God may bleſs his own Ordinances. Complain not of Delays, but wait, for God hath waited for you long; and therefore if he make you wait for Peace of Conſcience, and Aſſurance of his Love, he deals but equally with you, and as ſhall be beſt with you. God gives <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> he will; therefore wait for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Know and conſider, that thou haſt reſted upon thine own Duties and Endeavours,<note place="margin">Reſt not upon Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> and ſo doeſt not go to God, that bleſſeth both the Means, and all the Endeavours of his this Way. The Fault therefore is thine own, (I ſay) thine own, becauſe thou reſteſt in thine own Performances, and in the Power of the Means that thou apprehendeſt, and doeſt not go to God, that would have wrought more than all they can: For, did a Man depend upon God's Power and Mercy in his Ordinances, he ſhould always find ſome proportionable Succour, as well when he finds no Succeſs, as when he finds any. God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give, and ſometimes delays to give: But God's Love is as conſtant when he gives not, as when he gives. Therefore labour to quit all carnal Confidence in holy Duties. Reſt not in thine own Performances, but look beyond
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005214_0030_1016E58210181630"/>
all Duties to God in Chriſt, and deſire him to give thee the Succeſs above them.</p>
               <p>Watch how thy Soul behaves it ſelf after the naked Diſcharge of a Duty: All quiet and calm, notwithſtanding he lives in a daily Courſe and Practice of Sin; ſo that he prays and lies, faſts and cozens, and yet this makes all whole: I tell you, it is an undoubted Argument, that the Soul did place a carnal Confidence in his own Performances, and as yet never attained to a Lord Chriſt in the Duty: For he that ſeeks a Saviour in his Duties, and reſts not in Self-Performances, this Man brings a Saviour a Chriſt into his Soul. And mark what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; Chriſt brings <hi>pardoning</hi> Vertue, and <hi>purging</hi> Vertue with him, and gives him more <hi>Power</hi> againſt Corruptions, and more <hi>Suſpicion</hi> over his own Soul than ever he had before: So that the Soul begins to quarrel with it ſelf, and lies down with Shame, and ſays, What ſhall I think of my praying and hearing? Where is the Virtue and Power of it? Did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Chriſt hear my Prayers, or come into my Soul by his Ordinances? Where is the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtue then, to clear me of my Sins? Where is the purifying Virtue to cleanſe me of my Corruptions? This is a Ground of a gracious Heart, that placeth not any Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in holy Duties, but only in the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:005214_0031_1016E5430DBABD70"/>Do not content yourſelves in this, that you ſee a Need of a Saviour, becauſe your Minds are enlightned therein, and your Reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded thereof; when in the mean Time you place a kind of Confidence in the Duty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and Service diſcharged, and think thereby to bring Chriſt at your Beck, and you in the mean while do what you pleaſe: This is a wonderful cunning Craft of Satan. This I ſay then, a Man may ſee a Need of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; but do not quiet thy Soul becauſe thou knoweſt it muſt be ſo, and becauſe thou find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by Experience thou canſt not help thy ſelf, the Guilt of Sin ſtill ſticks upon thee, and therefore a Saviour now muſt help thee: I ſay content not thy ſelf with the meer Notion of it, to ſay, I ſee it ſhould be ſo, and it muſt be ſo, and reſt thy ſelf contented in the <hi>Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> of <hi>Services,</hi> and think to bring a Saviour at thy Beck, to do what thou wilt for thy Soul; this is a Slight that Satan has pinn'd to thy Soul. Many think to have a ſovereign Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Chriſt, when they have performed Duties: So that he does not uſe the Means to be led to Chriſt, but he takes up his Duties to be commanders of Chriſt, and that he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Chriſt for his own Turn; ſo that he makes Chriſt an Abetter of his own Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not a Subduer of his Corruptions. <hi>This is a marvellous Deceit, when Men reſt in their own Abilities, and ſo abuſe Chriſt.</hi> And this will appear in theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:005214_0032_1016E584C07E6760"/>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> Watch how thy Heart is in the Performance of Duty. Doth thy Prayer, and Hearing, and performing of Services, make thee venturous and fool-hardy to meddle with Corruptions? Then it's a certain Ground thou placeſt carnal Confidence in thine own Performances. As for Example: If a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor ſhould ſay, What if I do now and then ſin? And what if I do now and then pilfer, and uſe falſe Weights and Meaſures? I'll but pray ſo much the more, and faſt ſo much the oftner: Will not my Conſcience then be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied? It ſhall be ſatisfied; I will command it: I will put in Bail for my Sin, and pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Now I beſeech you obſerve it; this praying and performing of Duties, is meerly to command a Saviour to give Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to Sin, that ſo he may commit it freely. As who would ſay, I have Authority over my Saviour, and he ſhall pardon my Sin, and give me Allowance to commit Sin. O the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Villany that is in this Man's Heart! Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is thy Eſtate, whoſoever thou art, that makeſt thy Performances an Abettor of thy Diſtempers: So that thou doeſt thy Duties not to convey Chriſt, that he may help thee to prevent Sin, but that Chriſt may take off the Venome and Indignation of Sin, that ſo thou may'ſt commit Wickedneſs without either Suſpicion or further Diſtraction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005214_0033_1016E53F44EE9A90"/>
                  <hi>Many a Man makes his Services his Saviours.</hi> For, he makes them the Bottom to bear up his Conſcience: The Ground whereof is this: Haply he finds and feels by woful Experience what the Fruits of Sin are: He ſees the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom of his Corruptions, and the lamentable Effects of all his ſinful Practices: He tho't it before, a fine Thing to ſwear, and lie, and drink, and follow baſe Company; but now they are Gravel to his Heart, and Gall to his Soul. His Conſcience flieth in his Face, and he is ready to ſink down to Hell under the Burden of his miſ-order'd Life. Conſcience ſaith, Theſe be thy Sins, and theſe will be thy Damnation: They have been thy Delight, but they will prove thy Shame and Confuſion in the End; and ſhortly thou ſhalt find the Smart of them: To Hell therefore, be pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gone.</p>
               <p>Now this Man hath no other Cure for his Conſcience in ſuch a Caſe, but this; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats Conſcience to be quiet. He confeſſeth he hath lived in baſe Courſes, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be very miſerable; but now he will reform all. He hath neglected Prayer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, but now he will pray: He hath hated God's Servants, but now he will love them: His Ways have been exceeding evil, but now he will reform them, and now he will turn over a new Leaf. This he ſaith, and this (he thinks) will ſerve his Turn. And thus many
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005214_0034_1016E58649D3E650"/>
poor Souls uſe the <hi>Means</hi> as <hi>Mediators,</hi> and ſo fall ſhort of Chriſt. But a gracious Heart doth not only <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>receive,</hi> and uſe all poſſible <hi>Means</hi> to obtain CHRIST, but is reſtleſs and unſatisfied 'till he enjoy and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs CHRIST in the <hi>Means.</hi> He reſts not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bare Performance of any Duty, neither thinks by Virtue of any ſuch his Endeavours to get into Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I will expreſs this Particular more fully in this Manner. A rich Uſurer that is ſick of ſome Diſeaſe; tell him ſuch a Phyſician can cure him, but he ſtands upon State, and will not come without a great deal of Charge. Charge (ſaith he) I do not ſtand upon that; I have Money enough by me, enough to fetch him hither. Such a Man now placeth all his Confidence in his Money. So when the Soul ſees the Guilt of Sin is not removed, and that Conſcience is ſtill ſnarling, and that (the Law condemning him) Chriſt is the only Saviour, and he only that can ſatisfy and cure all. But now, How ſhall Chriſt be procured? Why? His <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Faſting,</hi> and <hi>Performances,</hi> may command ſo much, and that by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Merit of the Work done. The Voice of a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and proper Language of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt.</hi> But what Promiſe is there for it? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-book none. But thus Fools reſt on their own Performances, and ſo fall ſhort of Chriſt and Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:005214_0035_1016E5B27A17D768"/>Object <hi>But oh</hi> (ſaith a poor Sinner) <hi>fain would I go out of my ſelf. I ſee too well now, that I have reſted, and do reſt upon Duties done; but I cannot deny my ſelf as I would.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I <hi>anſwer,</hi> It is Satan's Subtilty to keep us in ourſelves, by endeavouring <hi>thus</hi> to make us go out of ourſelves: For <hi>by our own Strength</hi> he would have us to do it; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us we may. But this is a marvellous Deepneſs of his, wherein he ſhews both Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Cunning in the ſuparlative. For here he makes us believe (and we, out of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are perſwaded as he would have us) that we have <hi>the Staff in our own Hands,</hi> that is, <hi>the Power</hi> to get out of our ſelves. But is it ſo? Oh no, it is a ſupernatural Work to be quite out of our ſelves. The ſame Hand muſt bring us out of our ſelves, that muſt bring us to Chriſt: And this is <hi>Self-denial:</hi> And <hi>Self-denial</hi> is, when the Soul knoweth it hath nothing,<note place="margin">Self-denial, what it is.</note> and therefore is ſo over-powered with the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Hand of God, and the Work of his Spirit, that it doth not ſo much as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any Power or Ability from it ſelf, or from the Creature, in the doing of any Good: For it knows it is dead, and therefore cannot help it ſelf, much leſs can the Creature do it any Good, It therefore looks up to Heaven, and ſeeks all Sufficiency from God alone. For (obſerve it) whiles I thus think that I have A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005214_0036_1016E554BB92C738"/>
to go out of my ſelf; do I not then ſay, I have a Principle within me to deny my ſelf? But it is not ſo; rather it is quite contrary: For to deny a Man's ſelf, is to know he hath no Power in himſelf to do any ſpiritual Duty: Therefore we muſt look only to the Voice that calleth us, the Voice of Chriſt, and know that he that calls us from the Ways of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and out of our ſelves, muſt and will bring us out. Therefore expect only Power from Chriſt to pluck thee out of thy ſelf, and to make thee a Believer; for the ſame Hand muſt do both, or it will never be.</p>
               <p>I would not have a poor Creature think thus with himſelf: If this <hi>Means,</hi> and theſe Ordinances will do me no good, nor work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Heart, I ſhall never have Comfort: But ſpeak thus unto God, and ſay, In truth, Lord, I expect no Power from my ſelf, nor from the Means; but my Reſolution is, to look up to him that hath hid his Face yet from his poor Servant. I will not look any lower, as here within my ſelf, for any ſuch Power: No, Lord, but to the higheſt in Power and Gifts. Nor will I look to the Miniſter, or to the Means, but I will wait upon thee (O Lord) and look up to thy Power, to work by thine own Means. Remember what the Prophet ſaith: Iſai. 50.20. <hi>Who is amongſt you that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the Voice of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that walketh in Darkneſs, and hath no

Light,</hi> (of Comfort) <hi>let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay himſelf upon his God.</hi> Then when all other Things in the World fail, let the Soul look up to the Lord, and get away from it ſelf. For then is the fitteſt Time of all to meet with God. I would have a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian chuſe this Time above all Times, the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wherein to meet his Saviour, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint Satan: For, as I ſaid, it is the laſt Refuge that the Devil hath: And if he miſs of this, his Force is gone for ever. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Sinner, partly ſeeing the <hi>Beauty of Grace,</hi> will not; and partly ſeeing the <hi>Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own Heart,</hi> will not dare to come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">[3.] But the next <hi>Complaint,</hi> in the next Place, is, <hi>Want of Senſe and Feeling,</hi> ſuch as a Chriſtian muſt have, and finds not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſtreſſed Soul ſaith, <hi>Alas!

This <hi>Joy</hi> is a Fruit that proceeds from <hi>Faith</hi> after much wreſtling; and doth not preſently flow from Faith, not ſo ſoon as ever a Chriſtian begins to believe, but after a Time, and then the Heart is joyous; but never filled with <hi>Joy</hi> before <hi>believing.</hi> Afterwards, and when a Man hath had the ſweet Dew of the Promiſes dropping upon him; but many a Day after, let him look for this <hi>Joy.</hi>

And <hi>Job</hi> truſted upon God when he had but little Feeling; as when he ſaith, <hi>Thou makeſt me a But to ſhoot at; yet I will truſt in thee tho' thou kill me.</hi> Therefore build not your Comfort upon Senſe and Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005214_0039_1016E53935D99178"/>
which is to build upon the Sand; but go to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> as to the Rock, for it.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But how comes this</hi> Deſire <hi>after Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>anſwer:</hi> There are no more but <hi>two Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> in the Soul to <hi>abſent Good,</hi> God infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe having ſo framed it; and theſe two are <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Deſire.</hi> The <hi>Underſtanding</hi> ſays, ſuch a Thing is profitable &amp; comfortable if I had it; then <hi>Hope</hi> is ſent out to wait for that Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and if it comes not, then <hi>Deſire</hi> is ſent out to meet that Goodneſs: <hi>Hope</hi> ſtands and waits for it; but <hi>Deſire</hi> wanders up and down ſeeking and enquiring after a LORD JESUS, and goes from Coaſt to Coaſt, from Eaſt to Weſt; O that I could, O that I might, and when ſhall I? And how may I come to the Speech of a Lord Chriſt? As it was with the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles;</hi> when her Beloved was gone, ſhe wandered up and down ſeeking him, and enquiring of the Watchmen if they did not ſee him whom her Soul loved; ſo wanders from this Thing to that, from this Place to that Place, and never ceaſeth to ſeek and ſee if ſhe can gain Notice of Chriſt. It goes to Prayer, to ſee if that will entreat a Chriſt; it goes to the Word, to ſee if that will reveal a Chriſt: It goes to Conference, to ſee if it can hear of Chriſt there: Then it comes to the Congregation, and to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſee if it can hear of any News of a Lord Chriſt, and of Mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005214_0040_1016E55211DE43B8"/>The Soul thus continues wandring and ſeeking, till at laſt the Lord Chriſt comes into the Soul, when the Soul hath thus hungred and longed for him. At length the Lord Chriſt is pleaſed to ſhew himſelf in view: <hi>Behold, the King cometh:</hi> ſo the Soul ſays, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away thy Sins.</hi> O thou poor broken-hearted Sinner, here is thy Saviour; he is come down from Heaven to ſpeak Peace to thy Soul in the Pardon of thy Sins. Thou that hungreſt for a Chriſt, here he is to ſatisfy thee: Thou that thirſteth after Chriſt, here he is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh thee. Thou that haſt long ſought him, he ſaith, Here I am, and all my Merits are thine.</p>
               <p>Now when the Lord Jeſus is pleaſed to preſent himſelf to the Soul, now <hi>Deſire</hi> hath met with the Lord.</p>
               <p>It is in this Caſe with a Sinner, as it is with a <hi>Traytor</hi> who is purſued, and takes a ſtrong Hold, and is there beſieged: And now he ſeeth no hope of Favour, nor no hope of Eſcape; therefore he is content to ſubmit, and lay his Head on the Block, that he may receive Puniſhment for his Offence: Now coming to Execution, he hears an inkling from the Meſſenger there is yet <hi>Hope</hi> he may be pardoned. The poor Traytor in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with that is ſtirred up to hope. Nay, then he hears by another Meſſenger from the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005214_0041_1016E5B51D728360"/>
King himſelf, if he will come to the Court, and ſeek to his Majeſty, and importune his Grace for Mercy and Favour, it's like he ſhall be pardon'd. Then he makes haſte, and <hi>Deſire</hi> carries him to the Court to ſue for Favour from the King. So that now he will be liſtening and enquiring of every one there, Did you hear the King ſpeak nothing of me? How ſtands the King's Mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me? Pray how goes my Caſe? Then ſome tell him, the Truth is, the King hears you are humbled, and that you are ſorry for what you have done: At laſt the King looks out of the Window, and ſees the Malefactor, and ſays, Is this the Traytor? One ſays, Yes, if it pleaſe your Highneſs, this is the Man that is humbled and pleads for Mercy, and deſires nothing ſo much as Favour. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the King being full of Mercy, tells him, The Truth is, his Pardon is a drawing, and coming towards him. With that his Heart leaps in his Bowels, and his Heart is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged towards his Majeſty; and he ſays, God bleſs your Majeſty; never was there ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Prince to ſo poor a Traytor. His Heart leaps for Joy, becauſe his Pardon is coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. Haply it is not ſealed yet: Now when it is ſealed, and all done, the King calls him in, and delivers it.</p>
               <p>So it is with a poor Sinner, he is the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. You that have committed High-Treaſon,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005214_0042_1016E58BF4F1E8C8"/>
you think not of it: But take heed, God will purſue you one Day. Haply God lets you alone for the preſent, but he will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize you on a ſudden, and Conſcience will pluck thee by the Throat, &amp; carry thee down to Hell. And now the Lord purſues him with a heavy Stroke and Indignation, and lets fly at his Face, and ſets Conſcience at work as a Purſevant, and that ſays; Theſe are thy Sins, and to Hell thou muſt go, God hath ſent me to execute thy Soul. Now the poor Soul ſees he can no Way eſcape from the Lord, and to purchaſe any Favour he ſees it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; therefore he is reſolved to lie down at God's Feet, and hope. Now <hi>Hope</hi> is a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Soul to look out for Mercy:</hi> As a Man that is in Expectation of the Coming of his Friend, goeth to the Top of a Hill, looks round about him, to ſee if he can underſtand any Thing of his Friend; ſo the Soul hopes and waits, and ſtretches it ſelf out for Mercy. When will it be, Lord? When will this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don come? The Soul gets up and ſtands as it were a tip-toe: O when will it come, Lord?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How does God ſtir up the Heart to hope? It's worth the while to conſider how this is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt;</hi> The Lord ſweetly ſtays the Heart, and perſwades it that <hi>his Sins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable,</hi> and that the Good he wants may be ſupplied; this is a great Support to the Soul.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005214_0043_1016E5B8EF421D30"/>
                  <hi>Hope</hi> is always of a Good to come. Now when a poor Sinner ſees his <hi>Sins,</hi> the <hi>Number</hi> of them, the <hi>Nature</hi> of them, the <hi>Vileneſs</hi> of them, the Curſedneſs of his Soul, that he can take no Reſt; he ſees no Reſt in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor in himſelf. Tho' he pray all Day, yet he cannot get the Pardon of one Sin: The Soul is out of any Expectation of Pardon, or Power of Mercy in any Thing he hath or doth: Though all Means, all Helps, tho' all Men and Angels ſhould join together, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pardon one Sin of his. Now the Lord lifts up his Voice, and ſays from Heaven, thy Sins are pardonable. O the Infiniteneſs of God's Power! tho' the Guilt of Sin is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to condemn the Soul. But when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power of the Lord is conſidered, as able to over-power all his Sins, this lifteth up the Heart in ſome Expectation that the Lord will ſhew Mercy to a Man; tho' it is a hard Thing to hope, when the Soul is thus troubled, (Can this Heart be broken? Can theſe Sins be pardoned? Can this Soul be ſaved?) Now comes in the Power of God: God can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them. Never meaſure the Power of God by that ſhallow Conceit of thine. All Things are poſſible to God, tho' not to Men. And as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, He hoped above Hope;</hi> he looked to the Lord that was able to do what he had promiſed: He conſidered not that he had a dead Body, but that he had a
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005214_0044_1016E55080DEDEB0"/>
living God to hope on. Juſtice cannot be ſo ſevere to revenge thee, as Mercy is gracious to do Good unto thee. If thy Sins be never ſo many, God's Juſtice never ſo great; yet Mercy is above all thy Sins, above all thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions. This may ſupport thy Soul.</p>
               <p>So there you have the <hi>firſt Ground</hi> to ſtir up <hi>Hope;</hi> thy <hi>Sins</hi> are <hi>pardonable.</hi> There is more Power in God to ſhew Mercy to thee, than Power in Sin to deſtroy thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt came to ſeek and to <hi>ſave that which was loſt;</hi> it was the <hi>Scope</hi> of his coming. Now ſaith the broken and humble Sinner, I am loſt. Did Chriſt come to ſave Sinners? Then Chriſt muſt fail of his End, or I of my Comfort. God ſays, <hi>Come to me all ye that are weary and heavy laden:</hi> I am weary: Unleſs the Lord intended good to me, why did he invite me, and bid me come? Surely he means to ſhew Mercy to me.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Oh take heed of Deſpair.</hi> Queſtion thy Eſtate thou mayeſt, thou muſt; but <hi>to caſt away all Hope is very heinous in the Eyes of the Lord.</hi> Caſt away all carnal Confidence thou muſt, and yet thou muſt hope. <hi>Let</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>hope in the Lord, for in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord takes this very ill at our Hands. Thou goeſt to the deep Dungeon of thy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and there thou ſayeſt theſe Sins can never be pardoned: I am ſtill proud, and more ſtubborn: This Diſtreſs God ſeeth not,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005214_0045_1016E537ADD805E0"/>
God ſuccoureth not, his Hand cannot reach, his Mercy cannot ſave. Now mark what the Prophet ſaith to ſuch a perplexed Soul, Iſaiah 40.27. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou thy Way is hid from the Lord?</hi> The Lord ſaith, Why ſayeſt thou ſo? <hi>The young Man ſhall faint and be weary; but they that wait on the Lord ſhall renew their Strength.</hi> Is any Thing too hard for the Lord? You wrong God exceedingly: You think its Matter of Humility, to count your ſelf ſo vile. Can God pardon ſuch a Wretches Sin as mine? Mark that Place of the Pſalmiſt; they ſpake againſt the Lord, <hi>Can the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Table in the Wilderneſs?</hi> They ſpake not againſt <hi>themſelves,</hi> but againſt the LORD. So we ſpeak againſt God, and charge God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It is true, ſays the Soul, <hi>Manaſſeth</hi> was pardoned, <hi>Paul</hi> was converted, God's Saints have been received to Mercy; But can my Sin be pardoned? Can my Soul be quickned? No, no, my Sins are greater than can be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, ſaith the deſpairing Soul. Conſider <hi>how injurious this is to God,</hi> to make the Power of Sin greater to condemn thee, than the Power of God to ſave thee: To make the Power of Satan ſtronger to ruinate thee than the Power of God to relieve thee, and ſuccour thee. And what can you ſay more? And what can you do more againſt the Lord? Is not this to make God an Underling to Satan, and to Sin? This is juſt as to ſay, The Almightineſs of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005214_0046_1016E58FB70C6C28"/>
God is weaker than the Weakneſs of Sin; the Sufficiency of God is weaker than the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Satan. It is ſo; poor humble Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners many Times will make bitter Complaints this Way; and they think they ſpeak againſt <hi>themſelves.</hi> No, no, they ſpeak againſt the LORD. They ſpake againſt the Lord, when they ſaid, <hi>Can the Lord prepare a Table in the Wilderneſs?</hi> So you ſpeak in this deſperate Manner: Why truth, Lord, this proud Heart will never be humbled; if any thing would have wrought, it would have been done e'er this Day: How many Sermons, how many Mercies, how many Judgments, how many Prayers? And yet this proud Heart, this ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Heart will not be reformed. You think you ſpeak againſt your ſelves now: No, no, you ſpeak againſt the Lord. And know, this is one of the greateſt Sins thou committeſt, to ſay thy Sins cannot be forgiven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly;</hi> As this Sin is <hi>injurious to God,</hi> ſo it's <hi>dangerous to thy own Soul.</hi> It is that which takes up the Bridge, and cuts off all Paſſages, and there can no ſpiritual Comfort or Conſolation come into the Soul of a poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Luke 3.5, 6. <hi>Every Valley</hi> (or <hi>Ditch) ſhall be filled, and then all Fleſh ſhall ſee the Salvation of the Lord.</hi> What are theſe Ditches? Why nothing elſe but thoſe deep Gulfs and Ditches of Deſpair: And unleſs theſe be filled, no Man can ſee the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005214_0047_1016E5BBA0215B68"/>
Truth is, this Deſpair of the Soul is that which cuts the Sinews of Man's Comfort, and takes off the Power &amp; Edge of all the Means of Grace; it daunts all a Man's Endeavours; nay, it plucks up Endeavours by the very Roots: For <hi>that which a Man deſpairs off, he will never labour after.</hi> It's here, as with a Man in the Pangs of Death: Unto ſuch a Man, as all Things are unavailable for his Good: His Bed will not eaſe him, Meat will not refreſh him, chafing will not revive him; at laſt we ſay he is gone, he is a dead Man; Friends leave him, Phyſicians leave him: They may go and pray for him, and mourn for him, but they cannot recover him. So this Deſpair of Soul makes a Man caſt off all Hope, and lie down in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn Condition, expecting no Good to come. Alas, ſaith the poor Soul, what ſkilleth for a Man to pray? What profiteth it a Man to read? What Benefit in all the Means of Grace? The Truth of it is, the Stone is rolled upon me, and my Condemnation is ſealed for ever, and therefore I will never look after Chriſt, Grace and Salvation any more. Let him come to hear the Word, and mark how he caſts off the Benefit of it. It was marvellous, ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and profitable, it was the good Word of God unto ſuch as have ſhare therein: Why then may not you expect Benefit therefrom? No, ſaith the Soul, the Time of Grace is paſt, the Day is gone. If Miniſters would pray for
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005214_0048_1016E54DDC3943F8"/>
him, and good People pray for him, he bids them ſave their Labour; for Hell is his Portion, and his Condemnation is ſealed in Heaven. See now and conſider what deſperate <hi>Danger</hi> Deſpair brings to a poor Heart, and carries him beyond the reach of Mercy. That's a ſweet paſſage of <hi>David's,</hi> Pſalm 77.7. <hi>Will the Lord caſt me off for ever? I ſaid this is my Infirmity,</hi> ſaith the Text. The Word in the Original, <hi>This is my Sickneſs,</hi> as who ſhall ſay, This would be my Death: What, is Mercy gone for ever? then my Life is gone, then is all my Comfort gone, my Hope gone: Therefore take heed of this, it takes off the edge of all our Endeavours and God's Ordinances that might do us good.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>Secondly.</hi> This marvellouſly condemns that great Sin of <hi>Preſumption;</hi> a Sin more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and if it be poſſible, more dangerous. The Preſumption of carnal Hypocrites that bolſter themſelves up with marvellous Boldneſs in their courſe. It is as true here, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you obſerve it, as they ſaid <hi>Saul hath ſlain his thouſands, and</hi> David <hi>his ten thouſands:</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair hath ſlain his thouſands, but <hi>Preſumption</hi> his ten thouſands. That Men may ſwear, and lie, and cozen, and break all Commands, and yet hope to be ſaved. They hope Grace will ſave them, and yet reſiſt Grace. They hope Jeſus Chriſt will ſave them, and yet op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Chriſt. This is that which hath ſlain
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005214_0049_1016E5BD28339870"/>
many thouſands among us; and they are few that have not ſplit upon this Rock. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, this ſerves to reprove the Baſeneſs of ſuch Hypocrites that boaſt themſelves, and compare their Hopes with the Hopes of the Saints. It is true, ſay they, I cannot walk ſo freely, I cannot repeat a Sermon, I have not thoſe Parts that they have; yet I hope to be ſaved as well as they. This is that which hath ſlain ſo many thouſands of Souls that are now roaring in Hell; and they may thank <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>Now this Hope is not the Hope of the Saints. The Hope of the Saints is a grounded Hope; but theſe Hopes hang upon ſome idle Pleas and fooliſh Pretences, and ſome carnal Reaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I tell you they will fail, and ſink into the bottomleſs Pit ere they are aware. It is the Command and Counſel of <hi>Peter,</hi> That <hi>every Man ſhould be ready to give an account of his Faith and Hope that is in him.</hi> Look to the Reaſons that carry you, and to the Arguments that perſwade you; ſee they be not groundleſs and fooliſh Hopes. You hope to be ſaved, and you hope to go to Heaven, and you hope to ſee the Face of God with Comfort. Look about, I ſay; <hi>good Hope hath good Reaſons,</hi> grounded Hope grounded Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The Saints of God many times are deprived of Comfort; not becauſe God with-holds it, but <hi>becauſe they put it from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:005214_0050_1016E5E4F3116CE0"/>
and will not have it though he offer'd it; as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 77. <hi>My Soul refuſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</hi> He was a ſullen Child that will not eat his Milk, becauſe he cannot have it in the golden Diſh. So ſometimes, and becauſe God doth not for us what we would, we will have nothing at all. Theſe are the main Hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and I might add many more; for carnal Reaſon is very fruitful this way, and we thro' our own Folly, and the Devil's Craft, are apt to abuſe things, and to make them Hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in our way to Happineſs eternal.</p>

We muſt not look too long, nor pore too much, or unwarrantably upon our own Corruptions within, ſo far as
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005214_0051_1016E5350CF79480"/>
to be feared or diſheartned by them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Riches of God's Grace. For this is a ſure and everlaſting Truth, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Sight of Sin unfits a Man for Mercy, when he may take it, and it is offered, that ſight of Sin is ever ſinful, tho' it have never ſo fair an outſide of Sorrow and deep Humiliation. Namely, as when we think, and ſay, (as often we do) Had I a Soul ſo thorowly humbled, and bruiſed, and ſoftened, and ſo forth, I could do well enough. And thus the Devil keeps us in Sin,<note place="margin">The godly Sorrow what it is.</note> by poring too long and much upon our Sins; as thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to get from them. But ſuch a courſe is a ſinful courſe. Tell not me of Sorrow, and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Humiliation; all that Sorrow, and Humiliation, and Repentance, is naught, that keeps a Man from receiving Mercy when there is need, and it is offered. See this in <hi>Abraham,</hi> he had this Promiſe, that he ſhould have a Son in his old Age: And Rom. 4.19. <hi>He being not weak in Faith, regarded not his old Age or Deadneſs, nor the Barrenneſs of</hi> Sarah <hi>'s Womb, but believed in him who had promiſed it.</hi> There he reſts, and there he ſtays; he ſaw his Body was dead, yet there was a living Promiſe; and what tho' <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Womb was barren, yet the Promiſe was fruitful. He knew his own Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and her Barrenneſs; but he ſtood not long there. As <hi>Abraham</hi> therefore, ſo we may
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005214_0052_1016E5E7A07163B0"/>
ſee our Sins, and conſider our many Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but muſt not ſo ſettle upon them, or conſider of them as to be hindered by them from coming to God for Mercy, which he freely offers us, and we ſtand in need of: For, while the Soul of a Man is daily plodding upon his own Miſery and diſtempered Life, theſe two things follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt.</hi> Stop the Stream of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and let down the Sluce againſt it, ſo that the Promiſe cannot enter into us.</p>
               <p>And 2. <hi>Secondly.</hi> We ſet open the Stream and Floodgate of Corruption, and make it to run moſt violently down, and to flood in upon us; and in the end to over-whelm us. Now the Inconvenience ariſing hereby, is enough to ſlay the beſt Chriſtian in the World; for what can a Man get out of his Corruption? He can have no more thereof than is to be had; and it is in vain to look for Comfort where it is not to be had: All this, and the leaſt of all this may diſhearten us, but will not encourage us, or put Heart into us. See the Humility and Wiſdom of the Woman of <hi>Canaan, Mat.</hi> 15.17. ſhe follows Chriſt; but he liſtens not to her, but gives her a ſore Foil, and calls her <hi>Dog;</hi> and ſaith, you Gentiles are <hi>Dogs;</hi> and the Goſpel of Grace and Salvation is the <hi>Children's Bread.</hi> Now if ſhe had only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the Words of Chriſt, and only looked into her ſelf and her own Baſeneſs, ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

come to have received either Mercy or Comfort from him.

Yet tho' I am a Dog, I will not go out of Doors, but lie under the Table for Mercy: There's her Wiſdom. And thus ſhe; and ſo we muſt, and ſhould when our Corruptions (as I ſaid) flood in upon us, and we ſee ourſelves quite loſt, and damned in our Sins, we muſt then ſay, In truth Lord, I am as bad as thy Word can make me, yet let me not fly from Mercy, but lie at the Feet of my Saviour's Mercy, 'till he look upon me as once upon <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 22.61.</p>
               <p>It is fit, and we ought to ſee our Sins: But ſtay we muſt not too long there: See them we muſt, but not faſten on them, ſo as to ſhackle us from coming to Chriſt. I have ſaid it, and will ſay it, That that Sight of Sin which doth not drive a Man to Chriſt for Mercy, is ever ſinful. Labour therefore to ſee thy Sins, and that thus;</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly;</hi> And ſo ſee them, that thou may'ſt by that Sight behold an abſolute Neceſſity of Chriſt to ſuccour thee, and then away ſpeedily to him that can only help thee, and dwell no longer on thy Sins, but go to the Throne of Grace, where is plentiful Redemption, whence iſſue out Pardons in Abundance to remove that Guilt that Sin hath brought upon thy Soul; and where is Power enough to enable thee to be more than Conqueror over thy Corruption. Briefly, every Soul ſhould ſay thus; It is true, Lord, my Sins are many and great, for I have departed from thee the Fountain of Bliſs: But ſhall I go on, and ſo further from thee, and perſiſt in Evil? God forbid. All this while I ſpeak to broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Chriſtians. You prophane ones, you have your Portion already, and ſhall have more of it in Hell hereafter; therefore for a while ſtand you by, and let the Children come to their Bread.</p>

to thee I ſpeak. Therefore when upon theſe Grounds thou concludeſt that thy Caſe and Eſtate is naught; ſee and conſider againſt how many Commandments thou offendeſt.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thou diſhonoureſt God, and the Work of his Grace, by denying that which God hath done for thee: Alſo, and ſpeakeſt <hi>unreverently</hi> againſt him; beſides thou art a Murderer, for that thou woundeſt thine own Soul. Further, thou robbeſt thy ſelf of much Comfort, and ſo art a <hi>Thief; and thou bareſt falſe Witneſs</hi> againſt thy ſelf, yea, againſt Chriſt, and the Spirit of Chriſt, and the Work of Grace already wrought in thee. Alſo thou joineſt with the Devil againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Are theſe no Sins?</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, <hi>I ſpeak as I think.</hi> Yet that hinders not, but that thou beareſt falſe Witneſs.

So thou ſay'ſt thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when thou doſt but only fear it, and ſuſpect it, and doſt not feel it.

that he may partake of theſe and ſuch Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. Oh how carefully doth he liſten, and how diligently doth he attend what the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſaith?

Contrarily, A wicked graceleſs Perſon is never better than when the Word works leaſt, or never a whit upon him. But when he thinks the Miniſter will come cloſe to his Sore and Soul, he will not be at home that Day, he will be ſure to be out of the Town, or not in Place.

not elected, therefore God will not look upon me to do me any Good. Or, it is a vain Thing for me to uſe the Means of Mercy, my Time of Mercy being out. Oh the Days of Grace that I have ſeen, when the Lord knocked ſweetly at my Heart, and was pleaſed to reveal my Sins unto me at ſuch a Time: But then (hard-hearted Wretch that I was) I ſhut the Door upon him, and now he is gone and paſt, and now there is no Hope for the Viſit of Grace, or that Chriſt ſhould return again to ſhew me any Mercy. If the Devil can have thee here, all thy Comfort is gone; for upon this Ground a Man ſhall never receive Reſt to his Soul, come what Days will. And how can he?

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt;</hi> Let the Soul in this Caſe bear upon the Almightineſs of the Power of God, who ſaid to <hi>Abraham, I am God all-ſufficient,</hi> Gen. 17.1. For if thou be perſwaded of the All-ſufficiency of God, that Aſſurance cannot but ſtay thee (ſlipping) from falling. And here remember that God can do more than thou canſt think. He is able, and doth thee good, tho' thou know it not. And further, conſider that the Soul cannot doubt of God's Will, but with that very Doubt makes ſome Queſtion of his Power. This for the firſt Rule.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Second.</hi> And ſecondly, it bids check to thine own Heart for meddling with God's Secrets, and for prying ſo into his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of hidden Counſels. For no Man ſhould go beyond his Bounds; and it appertains not to thee to look into this Ark of Matters ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. Deut. 29.29. <hi>Secret Things belong to God, but revealed Things belong to us.</hi> And <hi>who hath known the Mind of God?</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.16. Mark this, you that will be climbing up the Ladder of God's eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Predeſtination, and going up into the Skies to know what God's ſecret Mind is. Keep your Stations wiſely; for neither the Devil, nor all the Devils in Hell, ever knew the Mind of the Lord. When <hi>Jonah</hi> cried againſt
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005214_0065_1016E5CAD6529980"/>
                     <hi>Nineveh,</hi> ſaying, Within forty Days all you; that is, all you Drunkards, and Adulterers, and Murderers, and others, ſhall be deſtroyed: Mark here how the King reſolves; his Words are, Jonah 4.19. <hi>Who can tell if the Lord will repent, and ſtay his fierce Wrath that we periſh not?</hi> Therefore when the Devil tells thee thus much, and ſaith, God hath appointed a Way to Salvation, and you have had the Means, and did not profit by them, therefore God will never ſhew you Mercy, nor give you Grace. Thus the Devil. But how can he tell that? Surely all the Devils in Hell cannot tell it: Say with thy ſelf, Let me walk in that Courſe which God hath appointed and commanded, and do that which I ought; and then I may ſay, and with Comfort ſay it, Who knows but God may break the Heart of a proud, rebellious, contrarying Sinner, ſuch as mine is, and ſuch as I am? None ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily but God knows whether or no. The third and laſt Rule follows.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly;</hi> Therefore meaſure not the Riches of God's Love, and the Sweetneſs of his ſaving Grace according to your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits; nor do you think that becauſe you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive it, therefore God will not do it, for the Prophet ſaith, Iſaiah 55.7, 8, 9. <hi>Let the Wicked for ſake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts;</hi> that is, All you wicked Ones, and you that have lived lewdly, return
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005214_0066_1016E50E9AD50C90"/>
from your wicked Ways, and vain Thoughts, and he will abundantly ſhew Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But will the Lord pardon all my Sins,</hi> ſaith the poor doubting Soul? <hi>I cannot think it: If I my ſelf were a God, I ſhould never paſs by ſuch intollerable Things as have been done by me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But I <hi>anſwer:</hi> Becauſe you cannot, you think God cannot or will not: Yes, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I can abundantly pardon: For my Thoughts are not your Thoughts, nor my Ways as your Ways.</hi> A poor Creature thinks his Sins are unpardonable, and that he ſhall never get Aſſurance of God's Favour, or Hope of his Love. But you are <hi>Men,</hi> ſaith the Lord, and have finite Thoughts; but I am a GOD, and in Mercies infinite, when you think I will have no Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But were ever any ſuch received to Mercy as I, ſaith the drooping Soul? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould I be the only Man?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I ſay: When Chriſt had wrought many ſtrange Miracles, the People ſaid there were never any ſuch Things done in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And therefore it is plain not to be doubted, that God can do Things that never like were done: Job 9.10. <hi>He doth great Things paſt finding out, and Wonders without Number,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job:</hi> And therefore judge not either God's Power or Love by thy Scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="unknown:005214_0067_1016E5CEAFE11C50"/>The beſt Chriſtians are moſt ſuſpicious of themſelves, and none fuller of Doubts and Fears, than thoſe that have leaſt Cauſe to fear or doubt that their Eſtates are broken and bad. Therefore Satan makes it his chief Work to grieve and terrify ſuch. Beſides their own diſtruſtful Hearts are always ready to join Iſſue with his falſe Reports againſt them, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſe Surmiſes againſt themſelves, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Mercy from them; as if they were hired by the Devil to take his Part in pleading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own ſure Salvation. Therefore it is worth the Time to hear what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 42.8. <hi>The Lord ſhall command his Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Kindneſs in the Morning.</hi> It is a Phraſe taken from Princes and great Men, whoſe Words are a Law of Command. For ſo God will ſend forth, as by a Commandment, his loving Kindneſs to a truly humble Chriſtian. As if it ſhould be ſaid: Go <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>everlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Mercy,</hi> take thy Commiſſion; and I charge thee go to that poor broken-hearted Sinner, go to that poor, hungry, and thirſty Soul: Go and proſper, and prevail, and ſtamp my Love upon his Heart, and there let it ſtand whether he will or no. Thus the Lord charges his loving Kindneſs to do good to poor Sinners, and by his own Almightineſs bears up the Soul, when it is ready to ſink under the weighty Burden of its many Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="unknown:005214_0068_1016E5EFF9F99D20"/>Object. <hi>But what? Shall I have Mercy? No, no,</hi> (ſaith the poor doubting Heart) <hi>Will the Lord Jeſus accept me? No, ſurely. Could I pray ſo, and ſo, and had I theſe and thoſe Parts, and could I perform Duties after this and that Manner, then there were ſome Hope; but all is contrary, and therefore wo and alas, there is no Mercy for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But to <hi>anſwer</hi> this alſo, Let me tell thee, whoever thou art, that God invites thee in particular, as by Name, and that all the Sweetneſs in Chriſt, and in his precious Promiſes appertain to thy Soul, and thou haſt as great an Intereſt in them as any Servant of God in the World whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>

before his Eyes; ſilence all his Doubts and Fears: And when this is done, I charge you go home to that broken Soul, and to chear and refreſh it with the Senſe of my ſweet Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and with the Aſſurance of my Love to fill it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>While we were Enemies,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8. And here the Lord ſends from Heaven to a poor miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature, and ſaith, Commmend my Love, commend my Mercy to ſuch a diſtreſſed Soul, and tell it, Tho' it hath been an Enemy to me, yet I am a Friend to it. Tell it, Tho' it hath been a Traytor to me, I have been a good King to it. And tell it, that tho' it hath been a Rebel to me, I have yet been a loving God to it. Tell the Man (whoſe Heart that is) that his Sins are pardoned, his Perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and that his Soul ſhall be ſaved. Tell him his Sighs and Groans are not loſt, and that his Prayers are heard in Heaven. Let him know that the Lord Jeſus died for Sinners when they were Sinners. Make all this good to his Soul, I charge you before you come back. So much for the third Help.</p>

                     </note>The <hi>fourth Cure</hi> is this. And it is eſpecially to be obſerved by a Chriſtian above all, in his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with himſelf in Bar of judgment; and that is, Paſs no haſty Sentence againſt thy ſelf but according to the Evidence of the Word.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:005214_0070_1016E50BEF8A0F28"/>
If thou art to be approved, let the Word of God do it: And let the ſame Word examine thee, if thou comeſt to be examined, If this Word ſpeak for thee, no matter, tho' all Men and Angels ſpeak againſt thee, and if it condemn thee, no matter who ſpeaks for thee: By it thou riſeſt or falleſt to thine own Maſter. What tho' ſome wrangling Fellow ſtep in, and will be determining Cauſes before the Judge comes: Shall his Word ſtand? No: Therefore a wiſe Man will ſtay till the Judge himſelf do come, and wait upon the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Mouth. Deal thou no otherwiſe with thine own Soul: Put not the Caſe to be tried by a Company of peeviſh carnal Reaſons, but ſtay till the Word (which is the Judge) come; and judge thy ſelf by that, and hold to that for thy Life, and the Life of thy Soul. <hi>The Light is that which manifeſteth all Things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. His Meaning is: The Light of the Word, and the Evidence of God's Truth, manifeſted to the Souls of God's People; Theſe properly are the Judges: The other are but wrangling Caſes, not to be admitted. And here Senſe and Feeling, grounded upon carnal Matter, are like Foggs and Miſts, which make a Man in caſe that he cannot ſee his Way, but upon clearing up his State and Condition, is open before him; and then it is manifeſt what it is, <hi>Learn of me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, Mat. 11.29.) <hi>and you ſhall find
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:005214_0071_1016E527E18E7058"/>
Reſt to your Souls:</hi> And the Pſalmiſt ſaith; <hi>I will enquire what the Lord will ſay.</hi> So ſay thou, I will not hearken what carnal Reaſon will ſay; I will hear what God ſaith. The Want of this, is the Cauſe why we have ſo many Diſtractions and Diſquiets, and why we are ſtill in our Doubtings; even becauſe he that teacheth, and can perſwade with us, is a Deluder.</p>
                  <p>And hereof it is, that the poor Soul ſaith: What, ſhall I have an Intereſt in Chriſt? ſhall I have a Title to the Promiſes? Nay, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to thoſe that are broken-hearted. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if I had ſuch Power againſt Corruption, ſuch Heavenly-mindedneſs, and this and that precious Grace, there were ſome Hope; but I am ſo full of Weakneſs, and many Times led Captive by ſuch a rebellious Heart, that it is too apparent I never had ſaving Grace: Nay, I fear I never ſhall have it truly wro't in my Soul.</p>
                  <p>This you ſay, poor Soul: But who told you ſo? and where learned you that Religion? I am ſure you never learn'd it of Chriſt. For who, or what Word tells you, if I have ſuch a Load of Corruptions, I ſhall never have Grace? Not the Word of Chriſt, I am ſure: Wherefore I charge you hold to the Truth of the Word; Learn of <hi>me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and put not your Caſe to be decided by carnal Reaſon; neither regard what it telleth you:
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:005214_0072_1016E5F186D62328"/>
For if you take that Way, and turn not back, you can never come to Chriſt, no Way to him that Way. Learn of the Lord Chriſt, (for his Word is faithful, and his Promiſe ſure) and there you ſhall find a Tower of Reſt as ſtrong as Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> It is that Word whereby we ſhall be judged at the laſt great Day, when Senſe and Feeling ſhall be caſt over the Bar for Deceivers, and never come into Court again</p>
                  <p>And thus much of the four Cures. It reſts that I now propound four Rules, by which a Man may know how to order himſelf, and ſo to walk, that he may keep a ſtrait Courſe by the Word, and not turn aſide to the one Hand, or to the other, from that Guide, of his Way. And thus walking, he may get into his Hands the Evidences that can aſſure him of a Reſt perpetual, and eſtabliſh his Mind with perfect Peace, For they work none I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity, that walk in this Way.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe <hi>Rules</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to uſe the Word of God aright: for as thou muſt in all Things that concern thy Soul repair to the Word; ſo thou muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thine own Uprightneſs by it, and ſee what Work is in thy Soul that is able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Word, and to teſtify that the Work of Grace is there. And here be ſure to take thy Soul at the beſt: Do not always pore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the worſt that is in it, nor upon thy Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor that that can only accuſe thee; but if there be any Thing there that may juſtly ſpeak for thee, neglect not that. It is an Injuſtice for any Court ſo hear one Side and not another. The Scripture is a Text of Juſtice, and the Lord doth not lye at catch with his Children, but takes them at the beſt as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.22. it is therefore ſaid that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:005214_0074_1016E508256107E0"/>
believed the Promiſe, and it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi> Indeed, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. he had ſome Doubtings; but God took him at the beſt: And ſpeaks this of his Faith. So <hi>Sarah</hi> is ſpoken of as of a gracious Woman, and of a Pattern for Women, by calling her Huſband <hi>Lord;</hi> which was a Sign of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to her Huſband, and an humble Heart to the Lord: And yet we read that ſhe deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Meſſage of the Lord by the Angel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.12. The Lord buries that, and only ſpeaks of that which was to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and ſo took her at her beſt too. Now as the Lord dealt with theſe, ſo ſhould we with our ſelves: Whatſoever is found ſincere and upright in us, that ſhould we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as well as that which is not ſo; nay, that rather and before the other. If a Man ſhould have his Cauſe handled in any Court of Juſtice after this Faſhion; namely, that (there) ſhould only be obſerved what is failing in the Cauſe, and never that that makes for it; the beſt Cauſe that is might go to the Ground: Therefore the Court will hear all read: As every Bond or Bill that ſhall come in, and every Matter of Agreement; briefly, every Thing: The Cry will be, Let all be read. Again, ſuppoſe a Man have a Bond or other Inſtrument in Court, and that the Lawyer only doth open and read the Failings in it, and that which ſeems to make againſt the Party:
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:005214_0075_1016E5D163B8F948"/>
If the Judge only hear that, how can it but go againſt that Side? Therefore that Party ſaith, Good my Lord hear all. Now when all is read, thoſe Defects are corrected, and the Cauſe goes well, which had not been ſo, if that Bond or Deed, or other Inſtrument had been read to Halves, not thoroughly. So when Men ſhall bring in ſo many and main Indictments againſt themſelves, and ſay, Oh what Pride and Stubbornneſs is in my Heart! Oh how weak am I, and dull, and dead, and backward to holy Duties; Oh how careleſs of enjoying Communion with God! How negligent in ſifting and trying my own Heart, in watching over my Senſes, and mourning in ſecret for my daily Failings! Tho' this were ſo, yet if Men will ſee no more (and theſe too much) no marvel if they trouble their own Houſe, or if Satan by their own Words judge them. To ſuch an one therefore I ſay, All that thou ſayeſt may be true, but art thou not troubled with theſe Failings? And are they not the greateſt Grief that thy Soul hath? Yes, ſaith the poor Soul, I confeſs my Heart is vexed, and my Soul grieved for them; and I could be content to be any Thing that I could not be ſo. Now hear on this Side, and take the beſt. For as it is with a Man's Hand and the Staff, ſo it is here. I compare the Promiſe to a Staff: You know the back of a Man's Hand cannot
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:005214_0076_1016E5F480541B40"/>
take hold of the Staff; but the Palm of his Hand can. So turn thou the right Side of thy Soul to the Promiſe, and then thou may'ſt take by it: But we take not by it, becauſe we turn the back-ſide of our Hearts to the Promiſe: For then, the Soul ſaith, Oh my Stubbornneſs is great, and mine Inabilities grievous, and Corruptions many. But this is the wrong Side; which will ever hinder thee from taking hold of the Promiſe. But turn to the right Side, and then ſay, My Soul hates theſe, and my Soul is right-weary of them. Oh this is the right Side; turn to that, and thou art well. This for the firſt Rule.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>ſecond;</hi>

For if there be any Want of the Aſſurance of God's Love, and if the Evidence of the Work of Grace come not roundly in, but there be ſome Guilt of Sin ſtill remaining, Conſcience will make new Stirs, and breed new Broils, and continually move and unquiet the Heart: Therefore as it is good to have our Judgment informed by the Word, when we ſee the Good that is in us, ſo it is meet we ſhould make Conſcience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of if, ſo as Conſcience may ſpeak for us, and all be made ſtrait. Otherwiſe, as
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:005214_0077_1016E523A9346E70"/>
the Debtor that is indebted to many Creditors, if he agree not with all, or with all ſave one, that one may come upon him as well as all the reſt: So for the poor diſtreſſed Soul that lies at the Mercy of the Lord, and is ſo deep in Arrearages to the Law, that he cannot wind out; if he labour not to ſtill Conſcience, and what is elſe againſt him, in every Point as well as in ſome; if he leave one undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, that one may ſet his Conſcience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, as well as an hundred.</p>
               <p>The Want of this, is the Cauſe why new Suits and new Bills are daily put in againſt us: Only becauſe Conſcience is not pacified, nor all quieted. And now take a poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that hath all his Doubts and Objections anſwered; come to him, and ſay, Are all theſe all your Doubts and Objections? he will ſay, Yea. And are they all anſwered? here he will ſay, Yea too. And have you now any Thing to ſay againſt that which hath been made known unto you? No not now. But ſay to him again, Did your Conſcience ſay to you, It is a Sin to ſay you have no Grace? Here he demurs and ſtops, and ſays, No, I dare not ſay ſo, but I rather ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And now mark what he ſays: All the Books are croſt, and all Objections an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and yet Conſcience puts in a new Plea, becauſe haply it was not ſatisfied to the full, and in every Parcel of Aberration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:005214_0078_1016E5F8BA019C00"/>And now come to him again, and ſay, You are ſometimes captivated by Sin, are you not? And are you willing to be at God's free Diſpoſe, and that he ſhould pluck away all your Corruptions, as it were Shackles from you, are you not?</p>
               <p>Oh, ſaith the poor Sinner, I muſt needs yield to that. Then I affirm to thy Soul, that this is a Work of true Grace. Here (therefore) let Conſcience be fully ſatisfied. But how ſatisfied? Thus: Cancel all Self-Accuſations, and this will quit all Scores, and clear the Heart, ſcattering all Clouds that miſt it. This will caſt out all Cavils, and all new Bills againſt us: <hi>For if our Conſciences condemn us not, then we have Boldneſs towards God.</hi> We muſt then ſtop the Mouth of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; that is, be convinced, and agree, that it is a Sin to ſay, God hath not wrought this Work of Grace in the Heart, when it is ſo clear he hath. For tho' Senſe and Feeling be (as it ſometimes will be) gone, yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience remembers the Day and Year when the Sinner had a clear Evidence of God's Love, and therefore ſaith, Lord thou knoweſt it, and thou didſt ſay out of thy Word at ſuch a Time, that the Heart of this poor Soul was upright and ſincere before thee.</p>
               <p>And here it ſhould be with a poor Sinner, as with a wiſe Man, when he would make his Lands ſure unto him and his Poſterity by
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005214_0079_1016E5221F8EF2F0"/>
Evidences and Writings ſealed: He is not content here only to have his Evidences in his own keeping, but will have them inrolled in Chancery, ſuch a Year, and ſuch a Day: That if he ſhould loſe his Deeds, he might be ſure where to find them. So it ſhould be with the diſtreſſed Soul; it ſhould not only be willing to have all Objections to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of it anſwered; but it ſhould further get them recorded in the Court of Conſcience, as in Chancery; that when Senſe and Feeling are loſt, yet it may readily go to that high Court of Conſcience, and there find the Day and Year when God's Love was made ſure unto it. This for the ſecond Rule.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rule</hi> 3.</note>For the <hi>third:</hi> Thirdly We ſhould ſtrive, and that mightily, to have our Hearts over-powered with the Evidence that Reaſon and Conſcience make good unto us; that ſo we may quietly receive, and calmly welcome it; yea, and yield and ſubject our Hearts to the Truth of it. But here we all ſtick: And there are <hi>three Things</hi> in the <hi>Soul</hi> of a Man; <hi>three,</hi> I ſay, that abet all theſe Quarrels and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions againſt the Evidences of the Word in that Man.

The <hi>Will</hi> of Man will not ſubmit. And here we find by Experience, that when a Man hath ſtilled
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:005214_0080_1016E503F10DC510"/>
Conſcience, and ſilenced all Reaſons to the contrary of his Peace; yet ſuch is the Iron of the ſtubborn Heart, that nothing can bar it; but ſtill it maintains, and will, ſome Gain-ſaying and ſome new Quarrels againſt the Truth and it ſelf. Beſides, it keeps on foot even that that hath been long ago anſwered, and let down: Nay, that a Man would think had been buried in a deep Grave (as deep as Hell) never to riſe again. Now in this Caſe it is with a poor Sinner, as with a Man that hath a contentious Adverſary. Haply the Cauſe that they two have in Hand, hath been tried in all Courts of Law, and at laſt comes to the Chancery: And there it is concluded againſt the cavilling Adverſary, as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courts; there all Matters are as well ſtated and ordered as a Man would wiſh, and as an honeſt Man would grant: Yet will not this Man, that is ſo contentious, be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, or ſo yield, but will to the Law again with a back Suit, and then, and upon that old Grudge, ſtake down all he hath, and ſell all to his Shirt. His Will he will have, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt him. Nor will he give over, till the Judge doth come to take notice of him, and ſo to caſt out his Cauſe with himſelf, whom therefore he commits to Priſon, and ſaith, Sirrah, theſe Matters were (all of them) long ago anſwered, and will you trouble us again, not with new Matters, but with old Quarrels?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:005214_0081_1016E5D2EC12AB48"/>Juſt ſo it is with the Heart even of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Man ſometimes, and one that is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in ſome Meaſure; and could be content to yield to the commanding Power of God's Word, and to the Witneſs of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: And therefore ſaith, My Condition is better than I thought it was; yet there is an old proud, ſelf-will'd Heart ſtill in me; an Heart that will not be quieted nor ſaid unto; but ſtill will be quarrelſome, and maintain the old Exception. For tho' all Reaſons are well confuted, and Conſcience bears witneſs it is ſo; and the Miniſter, as the Judge under Chriſt, caſt out the Cauſe: Yet (obſerve it) the poor diſtreſſed Sinner will keep the old Road of objecting againſt himſelf: And tho' he hath been anſwered fully, and to every Point, not many Hours before; yet he keeps old Matters ſtill freſh, and out of the Salt, till they yield a foul Scent to all that come within the hearing of them. And thus, even when a Man would think he ſhould not dare to come in Court with ſuch old caſhier'd Stuff; yet that proud ſelf-will'd Heart will be doing ſtill; nor will yield or give over. Have we not juſt Cauſe then to labour our Hearts ſo far as to get them over-powered with the Authority of the Truth concerning whatſoever God reveals to them for their Good? Oh therefore, poor Soul, do not reject the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which God makes known, and paſſeth
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:005214_0082_1016E5FB6490DAE8"/>
upon thee for thy ſure Welfare eternally. Do not, becauſe thou haſt not that Comfort that thou wouldſt, reject all; as if thou wouldſt have none at all. So then the Fault here is not properly becauſe thou canſt not, but becauſe thou wilt not receive the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: And this is that that ſo wracks and torments thy Spirit; this is that which breeds the Quarrel ſo hard to be compounded; and hence it is, that when Reaſon is ſatisfied, and Conſcience convinced, yet the Soul is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed ſtill. For put this Queſtion to it, and ſay unto it, Are you perſwaded that the Lord hath done you this Good, that he will ſhew an everlaſting Mercy to your Soul? And it will ſay, No; and that all the World ſhall not perſwade it of that. Miniſters are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful (will ſuch a diſtempered Soul ſay) and Chriſtians are charitable, and loth to diſpleaſe too much, or to diſcourage one in my Caſe, or do to me as I ſhould do to them: But did they know me indeed, they would never think thus of me: Certainly I ſhall never find it ſo. What? Have I Grace? All the World ſhall never perſwade me to it. Mark what I ſay: This is meerly thy Pride and Self-willedneſs, that will not receive that Good which God is willing to give thee. But repent, or this Pride of thy pettiſh Heart will coſt thee dear, one Day; I wiſh not.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, I ſay, (and mark what I ſay) it is intolerable Pride againſt the Majeſty of Heaven: And this I make good by theſe two Things. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> For a Man to follow his own Conceits and Self-willedneſs againſt the Truth, the Force of Reaſon, and the Witneſs of the Servants of God, and his own Conſcience, cannot but be Pride.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> And for a Man, becauſe he hath not what he would, to be (therefore) off the Hinges ſo, as throw away all God's Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to deny the Grace that is given him: And this becauſe he cannot be Conqueror as he deſires; is not this Pride? That Meaſure of Mercy which God hath already ſhewed to thy Soul, is incomprehenſible, beyond Man's Reach; and yet becauſe thou canſt not have what thou wouldeſt, thou wilt have nothing at all. Juſt as if a Man that hath the Law on his Side, and his Eſtate ſettled on him, ſhould, becauſe his Evidences are not written in great golden Letters, nor in the largeſt royal Paper, throw all away. This is your Caſe: For ſo you, becauſe you have not ſo much of Grace, or with ſuch a Sweetneſs as you would, you deny you have any. But
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:005214_0084_1016E5025A338500"/>
have you no Humility, becauſe none to your Mind, or not ſo much, or not in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as you require? Oh Pride; and Pride in the higheſt Degree!</p>
               <p>Theſe Things conſidered, labour to bring your Hearts more down in a holy Subjection to God's Meaſure and Time. And think it your Duty, as well to receive Comfort when God offers it upon good Terms, as to do any Duty commanded. And know that it is as truly a Sin (tho' of a higher ſize) to reject Mercy when God offers it, as to kill a Man, which God hath forbidden. I ſay, Not as much; for I know there is odds in the Degree. Therefore you (the Saints of God) that have been thus peſter'd, and thus poſſeſt to become your own Enemies, remember (when your Hearts thus begin to ſlide away) to take your Hearts unto you, and not to give them the Reins at ſuch deſperate Concluſions againſt God and Conſcience. Deal better with your Souls, and ſay, Good Lord, this is the proud unyielding Diſtemper of this vile Heart of mine. For, what would I have? Is not God's Word clear in this Point, and my Conſcience ſatisfied? Do not the Miniſters of God affirm my State to be good? And ſhall I thus diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, and ſlight them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But what ſaith the poor Soul to this? <hi>Muſt I eat my own Words? Muſt I ſay and unſay? Say I have Grace, when before I ſaid, I had none?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:005214_0085_1016E51F700555C0"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, and be thankful too to God that you may ſay ſo. Is it not better for you to croſs your own Fleſh, than to croſs God's Spirit? Take Notice of this, and fear leaſt that proud and peeviſh Soul of yours (which now refuſeth Conſolation when God offers it) be forced to fare as a Man that eats his own Fleſh, and ſo to come upon her Knees for Comfort, and get none to her dying Day.

               <p>One would have thought it had been great Humility in <hi>Peter</hi> to refuſe to let Chriſt <hi>waſh his Feet;</hi> but it was no ſuch Matter. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing leſs; therefore Chriſt takes him up roundly for it (which is indeed the only Way to cure ſuch a Diſtemper as this) John 13.8, 9. <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no Part in me.</hi> If you will needs have your own Way, and humour yourſelf, &amp; will not be perſwaded; you may go down to Hell in the Mind. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> might have pauſed here, and taken Breath, but did not: His ſtout Stomach quickly came down, and he preſently ſaid, Then, <hi>Lord, not only my Feet, but my Hands, and my Head,</hi> and all. It is the Humility of a good Heart, to take what God offers. Moſt Chriſtians think they are humble-hearted, when yet they are ſo far proud, as to give Way to this ſullen Diſpoſition. Therefore labour to over-maſter
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:005214_0086_1016E500D0C891E0"/>
this over-ſoaring Heart of thine, with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Word of God; and be ſure to receive Mercy while God offers it, leſt he draw in, and take away the Comfort of his Spirit from thee, and make thee go howling and roaring to thy Grave. Tho' he bring thee to Heaven in the End; yet thou may'ſt have an uncomfortable Hell before thou comeſt thither. So for the third <hi>Rule,</hi> the <hi>laſt</hi> followeth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>laſt Rule</hi> is this:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rule</hi> 4.</note> Maintain the good Work which thy Heart hath ſubmitted unto, and keep it as the beſt Thing in thy Houſe, and (of Treaſure) the beſt under Heaven. And then, when thou haſt by it obtained certain Evidence that thy Eſtate is good; hear nothing againſt it, but ſtick faſt to it, as to thy Life. Regard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (what is not in the Word) to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of that Evidence of thy Salvation; that I mean which thou haſt been perſwaded of by the Word of Truth. And here, if Satan or carnal Reaſon have any Thing to ſay againſt thee, let them bring Scripture, and then yield to it in the true Senſe; but without the Word hear nothing. Look as it is with a Man that is at Law for Lands; if he have his Adverſary on the Hip, and have gotten ſome Advantage againſt him, he will keep him there, and hold him to the Point. So do thou in a better Caſe. For if a Man will follow
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:005214_0087_1016E5D9E15B8918"/>
every wrangling Lawyer at every impertinent <hi>Quibble</hi> or Out-leap, he muſt never look for an End of lawing: And it is the Faſhion of many Attornies, rather to breed Quarrels, than to kill them in the Conception. So in this Caſe, he that will <hi>quarrel</hi> where he may <hi>reſolve,</hi> ſhall never have done. And therefore hold to the main Point. Deal with <hi>Satan</hi> as with a ſubtil Adverſary, that is full of Wiles and Fetches. It is the Cunning of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to lead you aſide: And he will have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vegaries, if you be in a good Way, to bring you out: But be ſure to hold to that Truth which you have received from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the <hi>Word,</hi> and the Witneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

                     <hi>Satan</hi> deals in this Caſe with the Soul, as the Enemies in War: When <hi>Joſhua</hi> defeated the Men of <hi>Ai,</hi> he got them out of the City; and then they that lay in Ambuſh went and took it, and burnt it with Fire, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 8.19. So the Devil doth. Our Caſtle or City is the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of GOD: Now if the Devil can but get you out of this Caſtle, he hath you where he would: If you will look after every Bird that flies, and liſten after every Word of carnal Reaſon and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that comes, you are gone: If he can get you from the ſure Hold of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> he will entangle you in his Snare of Unbelief, and ſo prevail againſt you.</p>

                     <hi>Little Children, if ye abide in God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, ye abide in God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.28.

                  <p>The Iſſue of the Point is this: Judge thy Soul by <hi>the Word,</hi> and look upon that ſacred Piece in the Glaſs of it ſelf: And here, let it bear Witneſs for thee: And what <hi>the Word</hi> of GOD doth evidence to thee, that do thou

maintain, and hear nothing againſt it. This is the Way to receive conſtant Comfort, and the Way to go on chearfully in thy chriſtian Courſe. Let Quarrels, Troubles, and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations come, yet keep cloſe within Doors, and reſt thy ſelf upon the Riches of that Grace that is in CHRIST JESUS.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T reſteth that I ſhew you ſome <hi>Means,</hi> whereby a Man may ſo improve his Time, that at laſt he may obtain this bleſſed Eſtate of being glad in the Lord. The <hi>Means</hi> are <hi>four.</hi> But before I begin with them, you muſt firſt know that we may uſe the <hi>Means,</hi> and yet
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:005214_0092_1016E600C52185B8"/>
find no Means under Heaven to do it, except God ſtrike the Stroke. You muſt therefore wait upon GOD, and the SPIRIT of GOD in the Uſe of the Means for this Matter, by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly to your Aſſurance. For, ſo the Text ſaith, Phil. 1.19. <hi>To you it is given to believe:</hi> It muſt be given therefore: And <hi>Faith is the</hi> free <hi>Gift of God,</hi> Eph. 2.8. It is GOD then that muſt do it; who yet will not do it without us, being reaſonable Men and Women in the Power of Willing. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, The LORD affords us <hi>Means;</hi> yet not to uſe them, and give HIM the ſlip. And here it is a good Saying; <hi>Let the</hi> LORD <hi>do what he will, and let us do what we ſhould.</hi> We muſt not think when we have the Means, that we can get Faith preſently: For, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Eph. 1.10. <hi>The ſame Power that raiſed up Jeſus from the Dead, muſt make us able to believe;</hi> or elſe all the Angels in Heaven, and all the Miniſters on Earth, and all the Help that Men and Means can give us, will do us no Good.</p>
               <p>Now the Means are of divers Kinds: As, <hi>Hearing,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which are the Conduit-Pipes thro' which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates Faith. But I let them paſs, and faſten upon thoſe which are needful for feeble Chriſtians, to the bringing of them into this bleſſed State of rightly believing. And theſe are ſuch as follow.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:005214_0093_1016E5DE3A3ECFF8"/>1. <hi>Means. Firſt;</hi> We muſt, as much as in us lies, labour to pull away all thoſe <hi>carnal outward Stays</hi> that the Soul leans upon, and all other like Succours, and whatſoever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment it is, which a poor Sinner doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelf to, as to his Refuge for Relief and Help; that when all theſe are taken from us, we may be forced to go for Succour thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where right Succour is to be had. It is a Thing natural to us all, even from our firſt Parents, a Deſire to have the Staff in our own Hands, and to be able to ſupply our ſelves of all Neceſſaries, without being beholden to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or to any.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, the Way to make the Soul to lean upon CHRIST, is, to pluck away all thoſe <hi>deceiving Props.</hi> The laſt Thing we fly unto is the <hi>Promiſe;</hi> which if we could find Good any where elſe than in CHRIST, we would never go to him for it. GOD hears laſt of us: And therefore here we ſhould do with ourſelves, as the Enemy doth with a City beſieged, when he would make the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, or thoſe that keep it, to yield; The Way he takes is to famiſh them, to cut off all Proviſion, and ſtop all Paſſages, ſo that none can come to relieve them; then they preſently yield themſelves to the Mercy of the Aſſailant: So it is with our Nature. And ſeeing it is ſo that we are ſtill truſting to <hi>our own Strengths,</hi> and relying upon <hi>ſomething of
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:005214_0094_1016E60258F41F60"/>
our own;</hi> the beſt Way were to famiſh the Heart, by cutting off all the Means and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts whereby the ſame is ſuccoured, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, but not rightly in Chriſt. For when the Heart is thus famiſhed, it will then ſeek out to a SAVIOUR, and there betake it ſelf, becauſe there is no other Thing or Means o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to help it.</p>
               <p>The poor Woman in the Goſpel had ſpent all her Goods upon the <hi>Phyſicians, Matth.</hi> 5.26, 27. and if ſhe had had but a little Means left, yea, but one Farthing-token (for any Thing that I know, or doth appear) ſhe would never have gone to CHRIST: But when all theſe failed, then ſhe was forced to ſeek to CHRIST, that was ready and willing to do that for her, and more than ſhe deſired. Our Souls muſt have ſomething to bear upon, and they cannot ſubſiſt without ſome Under-Props. Hereupon therefore, when all our carnal Hopes are taken from us, we ſtay (as we muſt needs) upon the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> becauſe we have nothing elſe to reſt upon. Yet it is not required (tho' I thus ſpeak) that a Man ſhould caſt away <hi>all outward Comforts,</hi> ſuch as GOD affords him for the Interim here: Oh no: But only this; That (though he have much this Way) yet that he labour to get his Heart to ſee and acknowledge the Inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and Nothingneſs of them all, 'till he have the ſuparlative Comfort, CHRIST, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:005214_0095_1016E518875428E0"/>
above all; and not to repoſe in <hi>them</hi> (having them) as ſome do, making them our whole Contentment, and ſole Reſt: For then they are but lying Vanities, and broken Staves, which will not only cozen us, but pierce us too, and that deeply.</p>
               <p>And now when the Soul ſeeth that theſe Things cannot ſuccour it, but lay it in a worſe Caſe; a Man will then be content to have his Heart divorſed from them. And here it is with the Soul as it was with <hi>Noah's Dove,</hi> when the Ark began to reſt upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Ararat: Noah</hi> then ſent out the Dove; but the Dove <hi>found no Reſt for the Sole of her Foot.</hi> No queſtion there were many dead Carcaſes to ſettle upon; but the Dove found no Reſt, 'till ſhe came to the Ark again. So when a Man finds no Reſt in any Thing the Creature affords, and can get no Footing for the Soul there to ſtay it ſelf upon; then it betakes it ſelf to CHRIST the <hi>Ark,</hi> and goes home to the Promiſe, and reſts there, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from thence what is needful for it. As (therefore) in the Art of Swimming; he that will ſwim, muſt pluck his Feet from the Bottom, and commit himſelf to the Stream to bear him up: So in this our Purpoſe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we muſt draw our Hearts from theſe vain Things below, and theſe from them; and tho' we have Honour and Preferments, yet we muſt put no Confidence in them, but
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:005214_0096_1016E52CD3E4ED10"/>
pluck our Affections, as it were Feet from them, and learn by our Believing to commit our ſelves wholly to the Power of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and thence to receive Comfort, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent abiding.</p>
               <p>Let not the Gods of this World, then, as Honour, and Profit, and Pleaſures, deceive thee. Did the Pride of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him? Did the Riches of the rich Man in Hell ſave him? Did <hi>Herod</hi>'s Applauſe that he had, do him any good? Did theſe Gods ſecure them? Nay, have they not left them in the Lurch? Therefore let us take our Hearts off from theſe Things, and (in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to thoſe of our better Life) have a baſe Eſteem of them, and ſee ſo great a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Emptineſs, and Inſufficiency in them all; that we may be forced to ſeek to Chriſt, and ſay as <hi>David, Help Lord; for vain is the Help of Man.</hi> Labour we further to ſee the privy Wiles of our own Hearts, and to hunt out all thoſe Mazes, and Turnings, and Windings of our ſubtle Souls: For here it is wonderful to ſee how the Soul is ready to hang her Comforts upon every Hedge, and to ſhift and ſhirk in every By-corner for them. Now when thou ſeeſt thine Heart thus ſeeking Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in vain Helps, call it from them, and pluck them away, and up by the Roots, and ſee the Emptineſs of them: Then will thy
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:005214_0097_1016E5E0EFCCF428"/>
Heart be fit and ready to make out to CHRIST. And this for the <hi>firſt Means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly;</hi> Therefore when this is done, there is in ſome Part, ſome Way made for the Promiſe to come into thy Soul; therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour thou in the <hi>ſecond Place,</hi> to have thy Heart poſſeſſed thoro'ly, and perſwaded ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually of the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of <hi>that Good</hi> which is in the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and of that <hi>ſatisfactory Mercy</hi> and <hi>Freeneſs</hi> of the <hi>Grace</hi> that is in CHRIST; ſo that the Soul may be eſtabliſh'd with that full Content which is to be had in the <hi>Riches</hi> of the <hi>Promiſe.</hi> But mark what I ſay; Let us perſwade our Hearts firſt; and not content our ſelves that we are able to diſpute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what fully of the Excellency of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and of thoſe Riches in it, thro' the free Grace of GOD in CHRIST. For, what is it to purpoſe that the Heart knows this, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, to be ſo fore-ſtall'd, that it can never come to the <hi>Promiſe?</hi> Therefore leave not thy Heart 'till it come to value the Promiſe by that which the Word ſpeaketh of it, in a true Account. I ſay, leave not thy Heart, 'till thou ſee the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Grace moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in thine Eye; and that thy Heart may get ſome Earneſt touching the Goodneſs of GOD, and the Riches of his Grace towards thee by the ſame. And here bring thy Heart to know and ſee, that the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is better than all the Riches and Honours that thou
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:005214_0098_1016E6068EB9E9A8"/>
canſt have, or the World can beſtow: For ſo we read, Pſal. 9.10. <hi>They that</hi> know thee, <hi>will truſt in thee; for thou, Lord, haſt never failed them that ſeek thee.</hi> If thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and wilt believe <hi>this,</hi> this Kind of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Perſwaſion cannot but breed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Reſolution, and (conſequently) quiet the Heart. We dare truſt a Friend whoſe Faithfulneſs we have tried; and we reſt upon that which we know by the ſure Card of Experience. The <hi>Promiſes</hi> of GOD are (all of them) as true as Goſpel. Seek from one End of the Heaven to the other, turn all the Bible over; and ſee if ever any Man leaned on the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and the Lord did not perform what he had promiſed for the Good of his Soul. <hi>Except the Lord had been my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, I ſhould have periſhed in my Trouble,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.92.) <hi>My Fleſh faileth, and my Heart alſo; but thou art the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion forever.</hi> Pſal. 73.26.</p>
               <p>But here lies a great Matter, a Work of marvellous Difficulty and great Neceſſity; and therefore, that thy Heart may ſit down ſatisfied with the Sufficiency of the <hi>Promiſe:</hi> I will propound <hi>three Rules</hi> how the <hi>Promiſe</hi> may be <hi>improved</hi> and conduce to thy <hi>ſingular Benefit</hi> here and hereafter.</p>

And here, we ſhould deal with our Hearts as Men will with a corrupt Juſtice, when they would have him to be on their Side; there, the only Way is to bribe him; but tho' this be ſinful in that Caſe, yet it is good to bribe (as it were) the corrupt Heart with the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>Promiſe;</hi> that ſo the Heart may cleave to it, and long after it. Do Honours, or Riches, or the Applauſe of Men, or any earthly Pleaſures offer thee Content and Satisfaction? Then perſwade thy Heart there is a greater <hi>Worth</hi> in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> than can be had in all them. For here is <hi>an exceeding Weight of Glory:</hi> And he that hath it ſhall be made a <hi>King,</hi> and ſhall have that Glory that will <hi>never fade.</hi> Further, Doth thy Heart hanker after earthly Joy and Mirth? Thou ſhalt find more Joy in the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> than in the cracking of theſe Thorns.
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:005214_0100_1016E62C8733E328"/>
Doth thy Heart hanker after Riches? Tell thy Heart that there are <hi>unſearchable Riches in</hi> CHRIST, and that thro' him we have a Title to all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of this Life and a better. We know that he that offers moſt for the Bargain hath it; therefore we ſhould obſerve the goings-out of our Hearts, and what Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers are made to give them the beſt Content, and with ſuch to preſent them. This the <hi>Promiſe</hi> doth; and this with a greater Good in GOD, than in all Things in the World beſide. Therefore, <hi>Oh the Height, and Depth, and Length, and Breadth of the Love of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>which paſſeth Knowledge!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conſideration of ſo much, ſhould not only work a Longing after CHRIST, and the <hi>Promiſe;</hi> but fill our Faces with Shame and Confuſion, that ever we ſhould ſet ſo light by ſuch Riches of Mercy, and walk unworthy of ſo great Salvation. Could we comprehend the unmeaſurable Dimenſions of GOD'S Love and Goodneſs revealed in his Word; O how would our Hearts be enflamed towards him! When the Sinner thinks thus with himſelf; I that have done all that I could againſt ſo <hi>good</hi> a GOD, that my Heart even bleeds to think of it; there was no Name under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that I tore in Pieces more, or ſo much, as God's Name; his <hi>Wounds,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Heart-Blood</hi> I have rent and torn a thouſand Times. Nay, there was no Command in
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:005214_0101_1016E60AC0B45410"/>
the World that my Soul ſo much deſpiſed, as the Command of the LORD JESUS. There was no Spirit which ever ſpake to me, which I ſo much reſiſted as the Spirit of the <hi>Almighty.</hi> Oh how many ſweet Motions hath the LORD let into my Soul, thereby to force me from my Courſes ſo baſe, and Practices ſo ſinful? By how many Mercies hath he allured me; by how many gracious Promiſes hath he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me; by how much of his Goodneſs provoked me to forſake my Sins, and to turn to him? But I have flown in the Face of his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and BLESSED SPIRIT, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all Terms of Reconciliation. If I had lien in a Dungeon, and been plagued with Torments all my Life-Time, yea, though I could have had another World full of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to live in; I ſhould count it infinite Mercy, ſo the Lord would paſs by my ſinful Miſcarriages, and pardon theſe inward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections.</p>
                  <p>But that GOD ſhould ſend his deareſt SON to love me, and that ſo incomparably, and ſo unconceivably as that I could not poſſibly hate him ſo much, as he loved and affected me; that I could not ſo exceed in Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards him, as he hath exceeded in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Kindneſs towards me; What a Love is this? What Unkindneſs for ſo great Love? Were it not righteous with GOD, never to ſpeak Comfort more to my Soul, that have ſo
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:005214_0102_1016E630B8A743F0"/>
lightly eſteemed his Promiſe, and ſweet word of Comfort? Had it not been juſt with him now to take all this (as he well might) for an Advantage againſt me? Was it not juſt that I, who have lived in Sin, ſhould have periſhed in my Sins? And as juſt that I who have ſo much loved Corruption, ſhould have reaped the bitter Fruit of it, long e're this? But that the LORD ſhould find an Enemy, and not ſlay him; nay, that he ſhould give his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved SON out of his own Boſom to ſave him, is a Love not to be expreſſed. O the <hi>Height</hi> of this Mercy, beyond all Deſire or Tho't! Oh the <hi>Breadth</hi> of this Mercy, a Breadth without any Bounds! Oh the <hi>Length</hi> of this Mercy, a Length beyond all Times! Oh the <hi>Depth</hi> of this Mercy, a Profundity beyond all Expreſſion!</p>
                  <p>Labour here (therefore) to have <hi>Acceſs</hi> to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and to bring thy Soul unto it. Here ſpeak a good Word for it, and ſay, <hi>Stand off Profits, and Pleaſures, and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Room for the</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST. Thus ſpeak, and ſet a peerleſs moſt excellent Price upon the <hi>Promiſe:</hi> And be ſure of this (for it is a ſure Rule) <hi>Whatſoever the Soul doth account as beſt, that it will chooſe, and leave all others for it.</hi> Therefore if the Soul could once out-bid the World, and out-ſhoot the Devil in his own Bow, and put by all thoſe Things which the Devil caſts as Rubs
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:005214_0103_1016E65897ED6978"/>
in it's Way of coming to the <hi>Promiſe;</hi> this Labour would be a Work of great Gain, and uſher in the <hi>Promiſe</hi> it ſelf. For <hi>Example,</hi> as thus: When thou ſeeſt thy Heart look after <hi>Friends;</hi> let thoſe Friends uſher the Way to think on the infinite Love and Favour of GOD in CHRIST, that Friend, as he calls himſelf: And when thy Heart would hunt after <hi>Wealth,</hi> let this uſher a Way to the Promiſe, and ſay, <hi>If the Heart find ſuch Content in Riches, what ſhould it find in the Riches of</hi> GOD'S <hi>Grace in</hi> CHRIST! And thus preſent a greater Good from the Promiſe, than from any Thing elſe; and thou dealeſt ſafely and well for thy ſelf. This for the <hi>firſt Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond Rule</hi> is; Labour to bring thy Heart to this, That <hi>all the Things in the World</hi> without the Promiſe, are <hi>nothing:</hi> And that if thou had'ſt all that the Earth can afford, and not the Promiſe, thou haſt gotten but the Wind, or that which will rather be a Curſe to thee than a Bleſſing: For, <hi>Faith is the Subſtance of Things hoped for,</hi> Heb. 11.1. It gives a Kind of Being and Subſiſtence to all. So that there is no Subſiſtence in <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Riches,</hi> if they ſubſiſt not by <hi>Faith;</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith they are Cloggs and Snares to us, no Helpers: Except Faith give them their Denomination, and a Bleſſing therewith, they are poor and empty Things. Our Prayers, if they want Faith in the Promiſe, are Prayers
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:005214_0104_1016E62AF92B3D18"/>
of no Subſtance; Words, and nothing elſe. On the other Side, the moſt broken and chattering Prayers of a poor Soul, when a poor Creature can ſcarce utter five Words with any Senſe; yet theſe (how weak ſoever) mingled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Faith, are a very powerful Prayer. So all your Hearing, and my Preaching hangs upon <hi>Faith;</hi> otherwiſe they are but loſt Labour, wanting that which gives a Kind of Being to whatſoever I ſpeak, or you hear. This for the <hi>ſecond Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>third Rule</hi> in this <hi>ſecond</hi> of <hi>Means,</hi> is this: Labour to acquaint thy Heart with <hi>that Good</hi> which the Promiſe promiſeth: And this, before carnal Reaſon comes and poſſeſſes thy Heart. Remember here that the Promiſe is moſt ſure, and will come when it ſhall be moſt ſeaſonable, and beſt for thee, and when God ſees it moſt fit; for then, we ſhall moſt certainly have it. Heb. 4.16. <hi>Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may receive Comfort and Mercy in Time of Need.</hi> Not when we ſee it fit, but when God ſees it fit and profitable. But this it is which carries away many. Sometimes they are a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Excellency of the Riches of GOD'S Grace in CHRIST, and ſeeing what great things the Lord hath done for their Souls, they ſay, <hi>O that I were ſuch a one; and O that I might die the Death of the Righteous!</hi> But when it comes ſo to paſs that they have not
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:005214_0105_1016E60934269600"/>
what preſently they expect, then they caſt away their Hope; and then the good <hi>Promiſe</hi> of GOD being out of requeſt, the Devil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſteps in and wonderfully prevails with them: They ſhould ſay with the Prophet, Heb. 3.17. <hi>When the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, neither ſhall the Fruit be on the Vine, when the Labour of the Olive ſhall fail, and yield no Fruit; then will I rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of my Salvation:</hi> But where no Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms are, nor Fruits appear, there all Joy goes to the Ground. We do not conſider that Comfort from the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and from the Lord JESUS, is then moſt ſeaſonable, when we have moſt need, and (conſequently) may receive moſt good by it: For then may we be ſure to have the <hi>Promiſe</hi> ſo to ſurpriſe our Hearts, that they ſhall be poſſeſſed and made happy with the All-ſufficiency of GOD. But we go not ſo far. This for the <hi>ſecond Rule,</hi> under the <hi>ſecond Means.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3. <hi>Means.</hi>
                     </note>In the <hi>third place,</hi> look for <hi>all the good which thou needeſt</hi> and canſt deſire from that Sufficiency which is in the <hi>Promiſe;</hi> and do not think of thy ſelf to add any good unto it, but go to it for all thy good. For, <hi>there</hi> are all the Cords of Mercy that muſt draw thee; and <hi>there</hi> is that All-ſufficiency that can ſupply thee; and therefore look for all from thence; but think to bring nothing thither, nothing (I ſay) that
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:005214_0106_1016B8CD18510D48"/>
can be of Power to enable thee to a Power of believing.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>And here, it is a weak Plea for a Man to ſay, I dare not look to the</hi> Promiſe, <hi>I cannot</hi> believe <hi>it; for if I could (and O that I could) then I might expect ſome good Fruit from it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To anſwer this, Thou ſhalt never believe upon theſe Terms; for, thou muſt not firſt have <hi>Faith,</hi> and then go to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> but muſt firſt go to the <hi>Promiſe</hi> for the Power of that <hi>Faith:</hi> From the <hi>Promiſe</hi> thou muſt receive <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Believe.</hi> And therefore ſay with the Prophet, Pſal. 119.49. <hi>O Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy Word to thy Servant, wherein thou haſt cauſed me to Truſt.</hi> When Men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in Love to a Man, and make fair Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Promiſes unto him; this perſwades him to truſt unto them, and to rely upon them for good to come; therefore he ſaith, <q>I durſt never ſo much as have thought of it, much leſs expected it, if you had not <hi>promiſed</hi> ſo much.</q> And even ſo here; the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of GOD (made to the Soul) makes the Soul to reſt upon what is promiſed.</p>
                  <p>To expect <hi>Faith</hi> without a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> is as if a Man ſhould expect a Crop of Corn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Seed; for the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is the immortal Seed of GOD'S Word, whereby the SPIRIT breeds this <hi>Faith</hi> in the Hearts of all that are his. So Chriſt, John 5.25. <hi>The Hour is
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:005214_0107_1016B8D1F9A0B368"/>
coming, and now is, when the Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the</hi> SON <hi>of</hi> GOD, <hi>and they that hear it, ſhall live:</hi> It is ſpoken of raiſing of a dead Man from the Grave of Sin: Firſt, There is the <hi>Voice</hi> of CHRIST to the Soul, before there can be an Eccho again of that Soul to CHRIST; and ſo the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Promiſe</hi> muſt firſt come to the Soul, and we muſt firſt hear the Voice of GOD in the Promiſe, before we can return an Eccho back again to the LORD: The LORD muſt ſay, <hi>Come to me,</hi> before the Soul can ſay, <hi>I come, Lord.</hi> Therefore when thou ſeeſt much Deadneſs, and dead unfitneſs of Heart in thee to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> do not thou then leave, and give off, and ſay, 'Thus I am, and ſo it is with me,' and ſo an End; but go to the Promiſe and ſay, 'Whatſoever Frailties I find in my ſelf, yet I will look to the LORD, and to his <hi>Promiſe;</hi> for if I want <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>Promiſe</hi> muſt ſettle me, and I muſt not bring <hi>Faith</hi> to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> but receive Faith from it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and therefore I will wait upon GOD till he pleaſe to work it. Thus for the <hi>third Means.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now in the laſt Place, and laſtly;<note place="margin">4. <hi>Means.</hi>
                     </note> Labour to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to the moſt equal <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> not making more Conditions there than GOD hath made. Now <hi>the Promiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no more of a Man, but that he come and
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:005214_0108_1016E62846F02F20"/>
lay hold of Mercy;</hi> therefore do thou require no more. There is enough in the <hi>Promiſe</hi> to do thee good; therefore do thou expect all Good from it, and be content there to take of GOD whatſoever he hath therein offered to thy Faith. <hi>Buy without Money,</hi> ſaith the Prophet: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.1, 2. This is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that GOD offers Mercy upon, <hi>buy Wine and Milk,</hi> that is, Grace and Salvation; <hi>without Money,</hi> that is, without any Sufficiency of your own. If a Man ſhould go running up and down to borrow Money before he comes to buy, he may famiſh before he can come: So the LORD offering CHRIST'S Mercy and Salvation without our Coſt, and ſaying, <hi>Come, take it without Money;</hi> and yet we will run up and down to borrow Money of our <hi>Prayers</hi> and other <hi>Duties</hi> alſo, and from our <hi>Prayer againſt Corruption,</hi> we may be ſtarved ſpiritually before we can buy at that Hand. If we go this Way to Work, we may quickly loſe our Labour, and our Selves. And therefore make GOD'S Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities no dearer than GOD himſelf makes them. Many a poor Soul not remembring this, is kept from coming to the <hi>Promiſe:</hi> For, O ſaith one, 'If I were able to maſter my Sins and Diſtempers as ſuch a one can do, then I might with Boldneſs believe.' But this is to bring <hi>Money:</hi> But art thou not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have CHRIST of free Coſt; ſo as he
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:005214_0109_1016E65A20B57D48"/>
may have thee, and rule in thee, and ſupply what is wanting to thee, and open thy Sores, and heal thy Corruptions? Then why goeſt thou not to the <hi>Promiſe</hi> with an empty Heart; that the LORD may ſupply thee, and maſter all thy Riſings, and make thee <hi>a clean Heart?</hi> But <hi>that</hi> muſt come afterwards, as the Lord ſaith, Ezek. 16.6, to 10. <hi>When I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in thine own Blood, behold thy Time was the Time of Love; and I ſpread my Skirt over thee, and covered thy Nakedneſs; yea, I ſware unto thee, and entered into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with thee, and thou becameſt mine:</hi> (that is, thou waſt content that GOD ſhould marry thee in all thy Rags) <hi>then I waſhed hee with Water, yea, I thoroughly waſhed away thy Blood from thee, and anointed thee with Oyl; I cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee alſo with broidered Work,</hi> &amp;c. Here we ſee that CHRIST firſt marrieth the Church to himſelf; and then gives Grace, and paſſeth over his Eſtate to his Spouſe. And now, were it not a wonderful great Folly, if ſome great King ſhould make Love to a poor Milk-Maid, and ſhe ſhould put it off, and refuſe the Match, till ſhe were a QUEEN; where if ſhe will <hi>match</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> ſhe may be ſure to be made a <hi>Queen</hi> preſently. But this comes after, and not before the Marriage. So we muſt not look for Sanctification the firſt Day, nor till we come to the LORD in our chriſtian Vocation: For this is all the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:005214_0110_1016E63625752C20"/>
Lord requires of us, namely, to ſee our Sins, to be weary of them, to be content that the Lord Jeſus ſhall reveal unto us what is amiſs, and ſeal a Pardon for it, and take it away; and (further) give us his Grace to take down the old Building, and to ſet up a new one in us after his Image: For then the Lord will bring us to himſelf, and into the Wedding-Chamber; and then thro' his great Mercy, all our Corruption ſhall fall to the Ground.</p>
                  <p>And when the LORD hath brought thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Heart to <hi>Believe;</hi> then labour to <hi>huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band this Grace well,</hi> and to <hi>improve it for thy beſt good,</hi> and <hi>live by it.</hi> It is a marvellous great ſhame to ſee thoſe that are born to <hi>fair Means,</hi> I mean the poor Saints of GOD that have a Right and Title to Grace and CHRIST, yet live at ſuch an under-rate: I would have thee live above the World, tho' thou haſt not a Coat to cover thee, nor a Houſe to put thy Head in; yet if thou haſt Faith, thou art a rich Man; therefore huſband thy Eſtate well. It's a ſhame to ſee ſome live, and huſband not that Eſtate they have; they live as if they had it not, ſo full of Want, ſo full of Care, ſo full of Pride, ſo weak, and ſo unable to maſter their Sins; whereas the fault is not in the Power of <hi>Faith,</hi> nor the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> nor in the LORD; for GOD doth not grudge his People of Comfort, but would have his People live chearfully and have ſtrong Conſolations and
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:005214_0111_1016E65CC2BA3E00"/>
mighty Aſſurance of his Love; and therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord always, and again I ſay, rejoyce,</hi> Phil. 4.4. And ſo Heb. 6.18. <hi>God hath ſworn; that by two immutable things, wherein it's impoſſible for God to lie, we might have ſtrong Conſolations.</hi> Nay, the Lord rejoyceth in the Proſperity of his Servants, and therefore hath richly provided for <hi>you,</hi> that <hi>you</hi> may rejoice; and in not ſo doing, we offer a great deal of Wrong to the Lord and his Promiſes, and bring an ill Report upon that Grace and Mercy of his: And we hereby alſo open the Mouths of the Wicked, and make them ſay, "Oh, theſe preciſe People talk of Quiet and Contentment, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt! There is great Talking of theſe Things, but we could never ſee it yet." O Brethren, it's a great Shame: Are the Riches and Revenues of Faith ſo great, that a Chriſtian may live like a Man all his Days? Let all the Drunkards and malicious Wretches againſt God, laugh and be merry; yet they cannot ſee one of thoſe Days that a poor Saint can; yea, tho' he lay in Priſon all his Life long, Matth. 17.20. <hi>If a Man had but Faith as a Grain of Muſtard-Seed, and ſhall ſay to this Mountain, Go hence, it ſhall be done.</hi> Whether this be ſpoken of juſtifying Faith, or no, I will not now diſpute; but this I am ſure of, <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee from you,</hi> Jam. 4.7. And you may trample under
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:005214_0112_1016E62419651D28"/>
all your Luſts and Corruptions. This is the Life of Faith; and this Life we <hi>may</hi> live, this Life we <hi>ought</hi> to live. If a Tradeſman have a fair Stock and quick Returns, if he goes down the wind, and begin to decline and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay; every Man will ſay, He was left mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous well, but either he knew not how to uſe it, wanting Skill, or elſe attended not on it wanting Care; Another Man would have lived bravely upon half of that Means which he had: So there is never a poor Chriſtian, which trades in a Chriſtian Courſe, but he hath a fair Eſtate, and may live like a Man. <hi>One Promiſe is enough to make a Man live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably all his Days, tho' he were in never ſo much Want:</hi> But if he be caſt behind-hand, and goes down the Wind with Comfort and Joy; and ſinks becauſe of his Pride, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, and Vexation: The Fault is not in the Eſtate; for the Lord left him very well; he had a Child's Portion, had he had an Heart to fear God and love him; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Oh be merciful unto me, as thou uſeſt to do unto thoſe that love and fear thy Name.</hi> The Fault was not in the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> that they could not, nor in his <hi>Faith</hi> that it would not help him: But he let the <hi>Promiſes</hi> lie by; they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Table, but he never caſt them up, nor huſbanded them aright: He had a World of Conſolations, that would have given a Man Liberty in Priſon, Honour in Shame and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:005214_0113_1016E660B3DE32C0"/>
and Comfort in Time of Diſtreſs; but he did not huſband them: And therefore be adviſed to do as the Tradeſman doth; he will not ſpend of his Stock, but live of his Trading: O I would have every Chriſtian live of his <hi>Faith.</hi> Whatever Strength thou needeſt, fetch it from Grace in Chriſt; and whatever Comfort thou wanteſt, fetch it from Chriſt; but live by <hi>Faith,</hi> and make a good Living of it too; and then thou haſt improved the <hi>Promiſe</hi> aright: Bring but an empty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Heart with thee, and the Oil will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail, and the Meal in the Barrel will never decay, but continually ſupply thee, as it did that poor Widow.</p>

So it is in a Chriſtians courſe; many poor Chriſtians that are newly ſet up, and are not aforehand in the World, they want even <hi>Matter</hi> for their <hi>Faith;</hi> I mean ſome are <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>cannot read,</hi> and ſome have not means of a <hi>preaching-Miniſtry,</hi> others have but <hi>ſmall Parts</hi> and <hi>cannot hear,</hi> and <hi>little do they retain</hi> of what they do hear: The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> of GOD not underſtood, nor remembred, nor rightly applied; they live marvellouſly poor, when they might live very comfortably in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="unknown:005214_0115_1016E6635C05E788"/>Now the <hi>Matter</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> is the <hi>whole Word</hi> of GOD. As it is with the <hi>Bee</hi> in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Honey: As the <hi>Spider</hi> gathers Poiſon out of every Flower; ſo the <hi>Bee</hi> gathers Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of the ſame Flower, and out of the ſweeteſt Flower ſhe ſucks the moſt Honey. Oh the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, how full of ſweet Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is it! There is the ſharpeſt Terrors, and the fearfulleſt Plagues too: A gracious Heart will gather Sweetneſs out of both of theſe. But above all, the Sweet of the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the Goſpel, the ſap and ſweet therein, and the Blood of the LORD JESUS CHRIST that is communicated thereby: Oh the faithful Soul ſucks moſt there. Now that we may provide <hi>Matter</hi> for our <hi>Faith,</hi> obſerve <hi>theſe Rules,</hi> which are commonly obſerved in all Proviſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they provide and lay in, <hi>in ſeaſon,</hi> timely, as ſoon as they can: This is the Practice of him that would huſband his Eſtate wiſely; his care is to buy at the beſt hand: So I would have a good Chriſtian to ſtore up all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of GOD, in all the good <hi>Word</hi> of GOD <hi>ſeaſonably:</hi> I mean when all thy Parts and Abilities are ſtrong, and Nature is able to ſight it out; and while the fair day of GOD'S Favour laſteth; and while the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are diſpenſed; this is the <hi>beſt time</hi> to lay in ſpiritual Proviſions, that we may not want them, when we have uſe of them. It is a marvellous ſtrange and prepoſterous courſe
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:005214_0116_1016E639891151D0"/>
when a Man is weak, his Eyes dim, and his Heart and Strength faileth, and even ready to give up the Ghoſt; then to lay in Grace and Proviſion of Mercy; and then for him who hath hated the Miniſters, and loathed the Means of Grace, and abuſed the Patience and Long-ſuffering of God; Oh then to have a Miniſter come to him, and have a Promiſe in the day of Perſecution; then for a Man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think himſelf of the Promiſes and Comforts of the Goſpel; when a Man ſhould ſpend on the Promiſes, then to be getting of them; this is ill huſbandry. The better way is this, to be buying and getting in at every turn: And this is the reaſon why our SAVIOUR ſaith, Luke 19.42. <hi>O if thou hadſt known, in this thy Day, the Things that belong unto thy Peace!</hi> While the Word, and thy Life, and the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and the Ordinances laſt; this is thy Day; we know not how ſoon the LORD may take all from us. Oh the Eſtate of the poor <hi>Palatinates!</hi> if it be true we hear of them, they have loſt all the Means of Grace, and they have Idolatry now amongſt them, and their Enemies force them to go to Maſs againſt their Conſciences; and they cannot ſee a good Miniſter, nor a good Chriſtian, but they weep to conſider the times they once had. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us labour to be wiſe in the Lord, now while the Fair is; and conſider how GOD deals with his Children: Pſalm 48.9. <hi>We
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:005214_0117_1016E664E5F1E9B8"/>
have thought of thy Loving kindneſs, O God, in the midſt of thy Temple.</hi> It is ſpoken there of the Goodneſs of GOD towards <hi>Sion:</hi> She was a Cup of Poyſon, and a Stone of ſtumbling: When he had ſpoken of all the Bulwarks that GOD had made, and all the Goodneſs and Mercy he had ſhewed to his People, and the Malace and Wrath of his Enemies: he ſaith, <hi>This God is our God</hi> even <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> v. 14. as if he had ſaid, The LORD did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his People, in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and overthrew proud <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that ſet himſelf againſt GOD; and this is <hi>our</hi> GOD: When thou art in the Wilderneſs, this GOD is thy GOD; when thou art in Perſecution, this GOD is thy GOD, and the GOD of all: Thus he ſtores up while the Seaſon laſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Note this, as thou muſt obſerve what GOD doth <hi>to others,</hi> ſo labour to <hi>treaſure up thy own Experiences,</hi> he <hi>hath delivered</hi> us, and he <hi>doth</hi> and <hi>will deliver</hi> us, ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle:</hi> 2 Cor. 1.10. &amp; 1 Tim. 4.18.

David</hi> is afore-hand with GOD now; he is not come to buy Food juſt at the time of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, but it's laid up before-hand. Lay in abundantly of all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of all kinds; you had better <hi>leave</hi> than <hi>lack;</hi> and its the Wiſdom of a Man to have ſomewhat to ſpare, and to have an over-plus afore-hand; that a Man may not live feebly and poorly, and be at his Wits end at every turn, and know not which way to ſhift for himſelf, and have no Bread in his Houſe; I mean, no Proviſion of Promiſes by him: Iſa. 42.23. <hi>Who is wiſe, let him hear for the Time to come:</hi> As if he had ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You muſt not only lay in <hi>Promiſes</hi> for the <hi>preſent,</hi> but ſtore them for <hi>afterwards;</hi> as the <hi>Chapman</hi> ſaith, I ſhall want this at ſuch a time; and ſo the <hi>Huſbandman</hi> ſaith, I ſhall have occaſion for this or that at ſuch a time, and ſo get it afore-hand. Oh that GOD would give us theſe Hearts! It is good, as we may ſay, to keep <hi>Promiſes</hi> in Store, that we may ſpend them at leaſure. <hi>In the Days of Famine,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Thou ſhalt have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi> Pſal. 37.19. Theſe precious <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> will be good Meat in Lent; when haply thou ſhalt ſit under a hollow Tree, and creep among the Buſhes, then three or four of theſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> will give a Man a good meal of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; therefore ſtore them up, they will do you no harm: And when you are driven from Houſe and Home, and Friends, and all, theſe
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:005214_0119_1016E63373C0C398"/>
will exceedingly refreſh. Oh how ſweetly are they ſcattered up and down in the <hi>Word,</hi> according to the Saints ſeveral Neceſſities and Occaſions. Bring this precious Proviſion home, leave it not in the Market; it's a folly to ſay, I have good Proviſion, but it is not here. <hi>Let the Word of God dwell plenteouſly in you, and richly in all Wiſdom,</hi> Col. 3.16. Obſerve, It muſt be plenty, not ſcant; it muſt dwell in you, that you may but ſtep aſide and have it; there is the <hi>Matter</hi> for your <hi>Faith</hi> to work on. So alſo</p>
               <p n="2">II. In the next Place, we are to <hi>ſit</hi> Faith for the <hi>Service;</hi> that it may ſucceed with more Comfort and better Speed. Tho' a Man be a Believer, yet there is a great deal of Dullneſs and Bluntneſs comes upon this Grace, tho' he have it. See how our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour chides his Diſciples, <hi>Oh Fools, and ſlow and dull of Heart to believe,</hi> &amp;c. So we ought to whet our <hi>Faith,</hi> that it may line and ſquare the <hi>Promiſes</hi> (as it is in the Hebrew) that it may pierce thro' the Veil of all the Riches of the Freeneſs of GOD'S Grace, and ſo bring Comfort to us. It's with the <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as it is with the <hi>Hand</hi> of the <hi>Body;</hi> if it be nummed, ſtiff, or frozen, a Man muſt rub it, or warm it, before he can hold any thing; ſo it is with the <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> for <hi>Faith is the Hand of the Soul,</hi> it takes hold of that Mercy which GOD hath provided for us in
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:005214_0120_1016E63ED63AAC80"/>
CHRIST JESUS. Now <hi>Faith</hi> is ſometimes numm'd and ſtiff thro' Careleſneſs and Looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; therefore it's not enough for a Man to have <hi>Faith,</hi> but he muſt ſupple and oil the <hi>Sinews</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> that he may more freely take hold of the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of Life, and receive Comfort from thence. And that this may be done, we muſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Maintain the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> once gotten: With queſtion undeniable, this Grace of <hi>Faith</hi> once gotten, is to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mark it, I ſpeak not of thoſe that have not Faith; it is in vain to bid a Man live by Faith, who hath none: But it's for thoſe in whoſe Hearts GOD hath been pleaſed to work this bleſſed Grace: This muſt be the Care of thoſe that have gotten <hi>Faith;</hi> they muſt know the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> and of <hi>this Faith</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> whether it be of that Faith which <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of; for there is a great deal of Copper-Faith in the World. As, that JESUS CHRIST came into the World to ſave Sinners, and the like. Now when thou haſt gained <hi>Evidence</hi> that thou haſt <hi>Faith,</hi> then fill it up, and keep it by thee, and labour to make the Demonſtration of it ſo plain to thy Soul, that it may be undeniable. What a great Folly is it for a Man to queſtion, when he ſhould uſe it? The Work muſt needs be much hindred, tho' he have never ſo much <hi>Faith,</hi> when he begins to cavil with
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:005214_0121_1016E667ECF15F00"/>
it, and to queſtion whether it be good or no. It's a proverbial Speech; <hi>He that doubts of his Way, miſſeth his Way;</hi> for while he is doubting, he goes no Way in Concluſion: So he that queſtions whether he hath Faith or no, gets little good at preſent by it. Tell a poor Sinner of living by Faith, and he ſays, It's good News if he had it. 'Tis poor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to bid a Man go warm him when he hath no Fire; ſo it's poor Comfort to bid a Man live by that which he never had. Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling and Doubting when a Man hath it, hinders the Uſe and Benefit of Faith: Here is a Man that is quarrelling about it, when he ſhould live on it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.22,—31. When the Diſciples ſaw JESUS walking on the Sea, they tho't it was <hi>a Spirit;</hi> but JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS ſaid unto them, <hi>Be of good Comfort, it is I:</hi> Now when <hi>Peter</hi> knew it was CHRIST, being ſomewhat too venturous, he ſaid, <hi>If it be thou, Lord, bid me come unto thee on the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> and CHRIST ſaid, <hi>Come;</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> going, the Water began to be boiſterous, his Heart began to ſink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and CHRIST ſaid unto him, <hi>O thou of little Faith, why doſt thou Doubt?</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>It's now no Time of Doubting, but a Time of Believing.</hi> The LORD bid him come, and he had Ground enough to come, and ſtrength of Faith to come; but when he ſaw the Waves great and troubleſome, inſtead of Believing, he fell
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:005214_0122_1016E61FA789D768"/>
a Queſtioning and Quarrelling with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. As it is with a foul ruſty Muſket; ſhoot ſuch a one off, and it will recoil. When Faith grows ruſty with Doubting, we ſit down diſmay'd and unſettled; the very Queſtioning and Quarrelling againſt the <hi>Work</hi> of Faith, many Times doth as much diſable a Man to put forth the <hi>Power</hi> of Faith, as if he had no Faith at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> When thou haſt maintained the Clearneſs of the Work of Grace before gained, then labour to bring thy Heart to marvellous <hi>Stillneſs</hi> and <hi>Calmneſs</hi> from Time to Time. <hi>Stayedneſs</hi> and <hi>Stillneſs</hi> of the Soul, frames the Heart to hold the Shield ſteadily, and bear off the Blow comfortably when it comes. Thoſe boiſterous Affections, thoſe Crowds and Troops of troubleſome Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, as <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Jealouſy;</hi> theſe unrank the Frame of the Soul, that it is not at the Command of <hi>Faith.</hi> As it is in an <hi>Army,</hi> when Ranks and Files are broken, they are at a Rout; be the Commander never ſo ſkillful, he cannot in that Condition march on: So though we had never ſo vigorous a <hi>Faith,</hi> yet if the Soul were hurled up and down with thoſe boiſterous Diſtempers, the Soul could not command Faith. When it was told the Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.41. that CHRIST was riſen from the Dead, and had manifeſted himſelf to them; the Text ſaith,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:005214_0123_1016E66C293DF7D8"/>
                  <hi>They believed not, and wondered:</hi> They would not believe for a while; and it was thro' the Violence of their Joy, which made them they had no Leiſure to believe. As it's true of <hi>moderate Affection,</hi> ſo it's true of <hi>ſtrong Fear,</hi> and Cares and Diſtempers; becauſe theſe hurry the Soul violently, and tranſport it ſo, that he cannot believe. As it is in a Road, the <hi>Traveller</hi> is fitted to go his Journey, but he is hindred becauſe the Crowd is ſo great and ſtrong, that they croſs him, and oppoſe him, and are ready to carry him another Way againſt his Will; juſt ſo it is with a Soul thus troubled with tumultuous Thoughts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Melancholy, and thoſe other Enemies of the Soul, as vain Imaginations, ſinful Fears, ſinful Sorrow, diſtemper'd Tho'ts and Cares; that tho' the Heart is willing and able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, yet thoſe Stirrings of boiſterous Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they croſs <hi>Faith</hi> in the Way, and bear it down. There <hi>David</hi> chides his Heart in Pſalm 42.5, 11. and 43.5. even rocks it aſleep, and would bring it quiet, ſaying, <hi>Why art thou ſo diſquieted, O my Soul, why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> &amp;c. There are three Things fit our Purpoſe in this Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a tumultuous Diſtemper of Heart makes a Man lie flat upon his Back, as 'twere, and ſink into a Swound.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hinders the Work of Faith. Mark what follows: <hi>Hope thou in God.</hi> As if he
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:005214_0124_1016E641CC320E18"/>
had ſaid, Leave thoſe Diſtempers of Heart, and reſt upon the Freeneſs of GOD'S Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>David</hi> yet looks up to GOD for Mercy: <hi>For he is</hi> yet <hi>my God.</hi> The virtue of this Rule we find by Experience; eſpecially in melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Perſons, when they have ſwarms of Thoughts buzzing in their Minds; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reſtleſs Fears, that do chaſe their Hearts, as the Hound does the Deer in the Foreſt; and after this comes another Affection, and after that another; and ſo at laſt they come all together: Sometimes the Horror of a Man's Conſcience makes Hue and Cry after him, and makes him ſay, <q>Oh how my Heart ſmites me! Methought I ſaw Hell gaping for me, and the Devil even ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at my Elbow, ready to carry me down to everlaſting Deſtruction:</q> This makes his Soul to have ſuch an Amazement and Gaſtlineſs of Spirit, that he cannot reach the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of GOD. Well, take the LORD'S Advice by the Prophet: Exod. 14.13. <hi>Fear not,</hi> but <hi>ſtand ſtill, and ſee the Salvation of the Lord:</hi> That is, lay aſide thoſe reſtleſs Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and thoſe Crowds of fooliſh Conceits; ſtand ſtill, and be quiet, and with the Eye of Faith behold the Salvation of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>third Rule</hi> how Faith may be <hi>fitted</hi> for the <hi>Work:</hi> Take notice of this; In the <hi>Want</hi> of any <hi>Means,</hi> do <hi>not firſt ſeek</hi> for them; and in the <hi>Preſence</hi> of any <hi>Means</hi> GOD affords,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:005214_0125_1016E66ED3F36430"/>
                  <hi>look not firſt</hi> to them for Succour and Supply, but <hi>firſt</hi> go to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> that it may ſupply what you need, and that the <hi>Promiſe</hi> may bleſs what Means you have. It is an uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and diſorderly Courſe, for a Man barely and firſtly to look at thoſe Things which are within the Compaſs of Senſe, and ſo range up and down in the Uſe of the Means, when the <hi>Promiſe</hi> and CHRIST are the laſt Tho't of in our Hearts. As for Inſtance: In a Time of Poverty, how doth the Soul unfit it ſelf for the <hi>Promiſe?</hi> When a Man ſees his Eſtate low, and he is like to come to Miſery, he ſaith, <q>I have ſome good Friends that will not ſee me Want, I have ſo much Means left yet, and I have my Health and Strength, and I hope to get a poor Living.</q> Not one Word all this while of a <hi>Promiſe:</hi> But what ſay you to this? If Death take away all thy Friends, Sickneſs take away thy Health and Strength, Fire or Thieves take away all thy Goods, whither wilt thou now go? Why then at a dead Lift, as we commonly ſay, he is fain to go to that <hi>Mercy</hi> which <hi>endureth for ever.</hi> Oh Friend, are you there now? Why came you not thither at firſt? Well, ſince thou art come, reaſon thus: I am like to be poor, and my Friends may die, and Thieves may rob me of all my Goods, but <hi>the Mercy of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi> So a <hi>Miniſter</hi> that is faithful, deſires to preach
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:005214_0126_1016E61BD4BE97B8"/>
fruitfully, and to the Benefit of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and then we catch at the Helps that are near at Hand, and we go to our Books and Studies, our Wits and Pains, and think theſe will do the Deed. We do well in all this; but the Fault is in the <hi>Order</hi> of doing them. Haply GOD knocks off Man's Wheels, and a Man is not able to come to the Bottom of the Point; and if he be able to compaſs the Truth in ſome Meaſure, yet GOD blaſts all he doth, and there is no good comes to the Souls of his People; at laſt he is fain to go to the <hi>Promiſe;</hi> and then the poor Miniſter ſaith, <q>LORD, thou haſt ſaid thou wilt <hi>be with</hi> thy faithful Miniſters <hi>to the end of the World;</hi> Little Strength there is in us; but be thou with us LORD:</q> Now the Work goes on again. The <hi>Tradeſman</hi> is honeſt and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and he hopes to campaſs a good Eſtate by his Calling; his Stock is good and great, and his Skill is ſufficient, and his Pennyworth ſhall be as reaſonable as any others, and his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are many: Then GOD blaſts all theſe, and then he comes to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> as in Pſal. 1.3. <hi>Whatſoever the Righteous doth, it ſhall proſper:</hi> Hold here now, and ſay, I expect all from the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> Mercy and Succour from the <hi>Promiſe.</hi> This was the courſe that <hi>Jacob</hi> took, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9. firſt he wreſtled with GOD and overcame him; then he wreſtled with his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>O God of my Father</hi>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:005214_0127_1016E6705B2EA610"/>
Abraham, <hi>and God of my Father</hi> Iſaac, which ſaidſt unto me, <hi>Return into thine own Country, and I will do thee good; I am not worthy the leaſt of all thy Mercies: Lord deliver me from the hand of my Brother</hi> Eſau, <hi>for I fear him.</hi> Thus he wreſtled with the LORD by Virtue of a <hi>Promiſe,</hi> overcame him, and then overcame his Brother <hi>Eſau.</hi> So Heb. 13.5. <hi>Let your Converſation be without</hi> COVETEOUSNESS; <hi>and be content with ſuch Things as ye have:</hi> But how will you have help againſt this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteouſneſs?</hi> A <hi>Man</hi> would have ſaid thus; <q>You have got a good Portion, and but little Charge, and many Friends:</q> But GOD takes ſuch a Courſe as this; for he ſaith, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> And thus when I have chaſed away <hi>Doubting,</hi> then Faith is ready, and the Shield is ſcoured.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Now for the <hi>Ordering</hi> of Faith in the <hi>Work;</hi> there are two Things to be attended to.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How the Soul ſhould <hi>get to</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. How the Soul ſhould <hi>take, receive,</hi> and <hi>improve this Sufficiency</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> that is in GOD, thro' CHRIST and the <hi>Promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1.] How the Soul ſhould <hi>get to</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:</hi> You ſee all is ready, the Way open, and Faith is fitted; there are <hi>three Rules</hi> to be obſerved, how the Soul may <hi>get to</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:005214_0128_1016E64354137720"/>1. Throw off all Power and Ability in thy ſelf. <hi>Nevertheleſs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. It is not I that live by any Power of my ſelf, but CHRIST liveth in me. It was CHRIST'S quickning, reviving, and enabling, tho' he had Faith. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, Jer. 10.23. <hi>that the Way of Man is not in himſelf, neither is it in Man to direct his own Steps.</hi> So do thou ſay, if ever thou wouldſt have thy Heart fitted to <hi>go to</hi> the Promiſe; ſay, <q>It is not here, LORD, it is not in this vain Mind, it is not in the Power of this dead Heart, or any Paſſage that ever I received, whereby I am able to believe in thee.</q>
I mean the Principle of Life is not here, the Root of Faith is in the Promiſe, and from thence it comes into the Soul. As it is with a <hi>Mariner,</hi> when the Ship is upon the Ground in the Ebb and low Water, he doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to tug his Ship to the Shore by any Power of himſelf: So, <q>It is not in my Wiſdom that can direct me, and it is not in my Weapon that can defend; it is not this Humility that can bring my Soul down; It is not here, it is not I, LORD, that can reſt, or go to a Promiſe; even all our Abilities are at a low Ebb:</q> All that we are, or can do, is to empty our ſelves, and fit our ſelves, and get up the main Maſt; that is, let the Soul be ready for a Promiſe,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:005214_0129_1016E6730BC8E820"/>
and by Virtue of that be carried Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and Chriſt-ward. Take Notice of this in your own Souls, that the Heart would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at home: If a Temptation come, the Heart of it ſelf would overcome it; and if a Duty be to be done, the Heart of it ſelf would perform it; and if Oppoſition come, the Heart of it ſelf would reſiſt it. O remember that a Man offers an injury againſt Reaſon, Senſe, and Religion, and all. Now thy Faith begins to wreſtle with him and his dealing; and Conſcience checks, and thou wilt tear thy own Heart out of thine own Boſom. Brethren, this will not do it: When a Ship of an hundred Ton is upon the Ground, the Mariners may pull and tug their Hearts out, ere they make her go. Oh go then and ſay, It is not I that can be patient, and put up a Wrong, be quiet, expect it not from hence. Let the Heart lie ſtill, till the Wind and Tide, and Promiſe come, and that will carry thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond Rule.</hi> Bring the Promiſe home <hi>to thy Heart,</hi> that the Promiſe may bring thy Heart to it. And thus I would have you reaſon: The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by the Power of his SPIRIT, is in the Promiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably, and undoubtedly, and unſpeakably accompanying in his Manner, as he ſhall ſee fit. This I ſay, That the almighty Power of CHRIST doth really and continually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Promiſe for the Good of his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="115" facs="unknown:005214_0130_1016E619153BDA20"/>
Hence it is called, <hi>The</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of Promiſe;</hi> for there is an almighty creating Work goes along with the <hi>Promiſe.</hi> And I reaſon thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Word that diſcerns the Thoughts of the Hearts of Men, that Word muſt needs have the almighty Work of GOD'S SPIRIT accompanying of it: So far as GOD hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it, not when thou haply think'ſt it fit, but when GOD ſees it fit. He doth it as a voluntary Workman; therefore thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt that there is an almighty Power, and a Fulneſs in the Promiſe: Then lay that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe upon thy own Heart, and conclude it, and look for Virtue from thence, to draw thy Soul to it again.</p>
               <p>I have ſeveral Paſſages to expreſs this more fully. <hi>Jacob</hi> would not believe that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was alive; or if he were alive, he had but little Means, and was poor, Gen. 45.26, —29. <hi>But when he ſaw the Chariots that</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph <hi>had ſent him, then he believed, and ſaid, I have enough;</hi> Joſeph <hi>my Son liveth.</hi> The Chariots ſent from <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> brought <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Joſeph.</hi> So every believing Soul is poor and feeble, and diſabled to go to GOD, and to believe in the LORD JESUS CHRIST: Therefore look thou unto the Chariots of <hi>Iſrael</hi> firſt, and that will convey thee to the Promiſe. As it is with the Miller, firſt he prepares the Mill fitly, and orders all the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions thereof; and when the Stones are fit,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:005214_0131_1016E675C6F1F440"/>
and laid to go, yet it will not, till the Sluce be pulled up, and the Water run that drives the Mill: So the Soul is humbled, and lies level with the Lord and his Truth, and is content to yield to his Conditions; but now the Soul of it ſelf, in it ſelf cannot go, it hath not the Principle of Going; but let down the Sluce of the Promiſe, and let that come to thy Heart, and it will bring thy Soul home to the Lord. As Luke 19.9. <hi>This Day is Salvation come to this Houſe:</hi> Not to the Walls of thy Houſe, but to Men that are in thy Houſe. They did not come to Salvation, but Salvation came to them. The Lord ſent Salvation to ſalute the Houſe of little <hi>Zaccheus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>third Rule.</hi> When the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is thus come home to thee, and thou ſeeſt the Sufficiency and Authority of it, then all thou haſt to do is this; In the <hi>Stream</hi> of that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> be carried home to the <hi>Promiſe.</hi> The Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. is ſaid to be like a <hi>loſt Sheep.</hi> (Mark this, for it concerns you, poor Creatures.) The poor Sheep is wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down, now in the Mouth of the Lion, and then in the Briars, and ſometimes in the Pit. The Text ſaith, <hi>He leaveth ninety nine to ſeek that;</hi> That is, in compariſon of what care he expreſſeth to the loſt Sheep; he leaveth a Man regenerate not careleſly, but he will not expreſs ſo great Love as to a poor loſt Man; And tho' thou canſt not find the way
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:005214_0132_1016E64668B6DDE8"/>
to Heaven, yet he will find it for thee; lie thou upon the Shoulders of JESUS CHRIST. When thou findeſt thy Heart feeble and weak and thy ſelf unable to believe; then the LORD JESUS CHRIST brings THE SPIRIT of Grace, and that comes to ſeek, and JESUS CHRIST lays that Soul of thine upon his Shoulders, that is, upon the Riches of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Grace: Therefore let thy Heart be tranſported by the Power of that Grace, and by the Virtue of that Mercy which GOD hath made known to thee for thy everlaſting good. When the Chariots are come, get up into them. The LORD JESUS CHRIST is gone up to Heaven, and hath ſent theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots for thee; therefore get thee up, and ſay, "LORD, take me up with thee." When the <hi>Mariner</hi> hath Sea-room enough, he cares for no Man, if he can but obſerve the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; he looks not ſo much at his Oar, or any thing, ſo that he can but obſerve the Channel. This Channel is the full Tide of <hi>Promiſe;</hi> therefore lay thy ſelf upon the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and ſay, <q>LORD, in the virtue of that Grace, and in the Power of that SPIRIT, carry me; and in the Riches of that Mercy of thine, LORD convey the Heart of this poor Sinner, and make me happy with thy ſelf for ever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Never let a <hi>quick Stock</hi> lie dead by you; it's monſtrous ill Huſbandry not to be
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:005214_0133_1016E6798957F3D8"/>
trading with a quick Stock. As it is in the World with Temporals, even ſo it is in our Spiritual Eſtate. Tho' a Man have a little for the preſent, yet if he have ſome <hi>old Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> to come, it will refreſh his Heart, and bear him up in time of Poverty and Miſery; and he ſaith, If he can make but a ſcrambling Shift for a while, for ſo long time, then he hopes to live as well as any Man in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. So there are ſome of the <hi>Promiſes</hi> we have in Poſſeſſion: Oh, but there is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>old Promiſes,</hi> old Rents. As <hi>old Rents</hi> of Farms that were let long ago, when the Leaſes come out, they are worth treble the Rent they were let for at the firſt: So there are old Rents of Comfort and Mercy; as, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.</hi> Then no more Tears, no more Trouble, no more Sorrow, no more Sin. Oh get thoſe into your Hands, and have them in uſe, and ſay, <q>The Day will come when we ſhall have Happineſs and Joy beyond all that the Tongue of Man can expreſs, or the Heart conceive. Tho' we are buffeted with many Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and wearied with a world of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, yet we ſhall be ſaved, ſaith <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </q> Thus a Man may make a pretty good ſhift to live upon theſe terms, tho' we have nothing elſe to live upon in the World. Remember what I ſpeak now, and labour to faſten this
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:005214_0134_1016E64A6D1B1A98"/>
Truth upon thy Heart; That <hi>there is not only preſent good in</hi> thy ſelf, <hi>but in</hi> ANOTHER, <hi>and reſerved by</hi> ANOTHER <hi>for thy Comfort, and be thou content it ſhould be ſo;</hi> not only to look and ſee what thou haſt, but conſider that the greateſt part of thy Glory, is in the Glory of CHRIST; and the greateſt part of thy Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is in the Wiſdom of CHRIST; and the greateſt part of thy Liberty, is in the Liberty of CHRIST; and thy Riches, in the Riches of CHRIST. And know, <hi>whatever is in</hi> CHRIST <hi>thou haſt it all as thine,</hi> 1 John 3. 1, 2. <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we are now the Sons of God!</hi> I tell you Brethren, this is a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Priviledge; and if you had no more but this, you had a Child's Portion: But it appears not what we ſhall have, we have but a Glimpſe now; what think you will the Harveſt be? Now we have but the ſips of it, what ſhall then the full Cups be when <hi>we ſhall ſee</hi> CHRIST <hi>as he is?</hi> Thus did <hi>Moſes</hi> improve his Eſtate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. He bore all Afflictions comfortably; yea, <hi>he eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater Riches than the Treaſures of</hi> Egypt; why, <hi>becauſe he had an Eye to the Recompence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> We account not of a Man's Eſtate for what he hath in preſent Poſſeſſion; but what is like to befall him, and what he is born unto. What <hi>Moſes</hi> did, do thou,: Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thou haſt a good Stock upon the Ground,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:005214_0135_1016E67C2F4A3380"/>
which will pay all thy Debt, and yet live like a Man too. Tho' thou haſt many Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, many Diſgraces caſt upon thee; tho' thou haſt little Strength, and art at a great loſs in point of Comfort; yet there is enough in Heaven, enough in CHRIST, both of Riches and Comfort. Let thy Soul then be careful to make all theſe preſent with thee for thine own good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome will ſay, <hi>How may a Man</hi> expect THAT <hi>from the</hi> PROMISE, <hi>which</hi> GOD intends, <hi>and will undoubtedly</hi> beſtow?</p>
               <p>For <hi>Anſwer</hi> hereunto, I will ſhew WHAT <hi>thou</hi> may'ſt <hi>expect,</hi> and WHAT GOD will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly <hi>beſtow.</hi> If thou doſt believe, <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Salvation</hi> are certainly thine, and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance</hi> to the End, and <hi>that Manner and Meaſure of Aſſiſtance,</hi> that may make thee fit for Perſeverance: Theſe <hi>three Things</hi> grow here. But for <hi>temporal Bleſſings</hi> which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and <hi>that Meaſure</hi> of <hi>ſpiritual Bleſſings</hi> which we would have; ſo much Grace, and ſo much Aſſiſtance, and ſo much Abilities to do Duties; God doth not engage himſelf to beſtow theſe. But that which God engageth himſelf to beſtow, both for temporal and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings, it may be diſcovered in <hi>theſe three Particulars:</hi> So much Grace and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God's Love, and ſo much Comfort in Grace as he ſees fit for thee, after his own Order, and in his own Time. I will open
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:005214_0136_1016E61600EAAA38"/>
them all, becauſe many do here bungle won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Firſt;</hi> He will beſtow them <hi>in his own Order,</hi> not thy Order. Firſt, He will make thee fit, and make thee good, that thou may'ſt be able to digeſt them, and then he will beſtow them on thee. Haply a poor Man is driven to deſperate Hazard, and is brought miſerably under, and therefore the Heart cries earneſtly for ſome more <hi>Supply;</hi> and he calls and GOD anſwers not; and he labours to look up to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> where GOD ſaith, <hi>Nothing ſhall be wanting to him,</hi> and yet it cometh not. I ſay, GOD will give theſe in his own Order-Firſt, GOD will make thee fit for this Eſtate, and then give it. I never knew a good Man deſperately poor, but his Heart was deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proud; therefore the Lord will make him good, and make his proud Heart yield, and then beſtow theſe Things: Look for that firſt, and then for the other.</p>
               <p>Again, Another Chriſtian labours exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of GOD'S Love, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain it; and ſeeks to GOD in the Uſe of the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and yet he cannot find it ſetled. Well, GOD will give thee Comfort and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, but <hi>in his own Order.</hi> And know this, that commonly the Lord never debars the Soul of Comfort, but he ſees the Heart is not fit for it. Thy Heart would be proud and careleſs, and GOD would hear no more of
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:005214_0137_1016E67DDB907CF0"/>
thee, and thy Sail would overturn the Boat; therefore when God has abaſed thy Heart, and made thee content to want what he ſhall deny, then he will give thee Aſſurance, but it muſt be <hi>in his own Order.</hi> And this is the Reaſon why the moſt ſmoak out their Days in Diſcontent; the Reaſon is, There is a <hi>proud Heart</hi> and a ſturdy Diſpoſition of Spirit that will not come unto God's Terms. As it is with a Phyſician; he will not give a Cordial to his Patient, when he will: For if he were in a burning Fever, it were the next Way to ſend him going; but firſt he purges him, and makes him fit, and then gives him a Cordial: So it is in theſe Things which thou craveſt; the Lord will give thee them, when thou ſhalt not ſurfeit of Comfort, and Aſſurance, and Proſperity; and when thy Heart is emptied and purged, and able to digeſt theſe Things, then the Lord will give them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly;</hi> The Lord will give us tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſſings, and <hi>that Meaſure</hi> of <hi>Spiritual,</hi> in his <hi>own due Time;</hi> not when thou and I would, but when he ſees moſt fit; as <hi>John</hi> 2. 3, 4. The Mother of JESUS comes to our Saviour, and ſaith, <hi>They have no Wine.</hi> She tho't ſhe had Chriſt at command: But he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers her, <hi>Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine Hour is not yet come.</hi> So it is with our Souls; we want Comfort, and we want Strength againſt our Corruptions, and we
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:005214_0138_1016E64D14E716E8"/>
want Aſſurance, and Aſſiſtance: But what have I to do with that proud Heart, ſays our Saviour? <hi>My</hi> Time <hi>is not yet come.</hi> You would have it <hi>now,</hi> as they ſaid, Acts 1.6. <hi>Lord, wilt thou</hi> NOW <hi>reſtore the Kingdom to</hi> Iſrael? GOD will do <hi>in his own Time,</hi> and we muſt wait his Leiſure. This is one Thing that doth neceſſarily accompany the Covenant of Grace, as I have ſhewed before that the Lord ſhould diſpenſe the Bleſſings of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom when HE pleaſeth, and not when we will. When the Lord ſees theſe Bleſſings of ſpiritual Mercies and temporal Favours are ripe and moſt ſeaſonable to thy Neceſſity; then thou ſhalt have them: But <hi>the Time</hi> is in GOD'S Hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly;</hi> The Lord doth <hi>not</hi> promiſe in <hi>ſuch a Manner</hi> and <hi>Meaſure,</hi> and <hi>ſuch a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Thing,</hi> to give that temporal Bleſſing, and that ſpiritual Aſſiſtance we deſire; but the Lord will do <hi>that which he knows moſt fit:</hi> For ſo the Text ſays, Prov. 30.8. <hi>Feed me with Food convenient for me.</hi> There was <hi>Faith</hi> now; he wholly refers himſelf to God, When a Man comes to the Taylor to have a Garment made, he doth not cut out the Garment him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but refers it to the Judgment of the Workman. So muſt we do, refer our ſelves to GOD; and know, <hi>God promiſeth nothing, but as he ſees it fit for thy Good.</hi> It may be thou ſhalt not have this Bleſſing, or that Grace.
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:005214_0139_1016E680E0BCB4F0"/>
As it is with a Potter, he is minded to make ſo many Veſſels of Honour: So if the Lord will make thee a Veſſel of Honour, go away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; whether thou haſt ſo much Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo much Good, or no, and ſo much Grace, it matters not ſo much; it is enough that thou art elected to eternal Happineſs.</p>
               <p>Now you ſee how to manage and improve the Promiſe aright for your beſt Advantage, and to expect <hi>that</hi> from the Promiſe which it will yield.</p>
               <p n="2">[2.] Again, <hi>Another Particular</hi> in this third Rule of <hi>living by Faith,</hi> is this; <hi>How to take, and how to enjoy the Sap and Sweet of the Promiſe, and to live by it.</hi> When the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman hath ſown his Ground, and his Fruit is ripe, and he hath reaped it, then he muſt gather in his Corn that he may live upon it. So let us gather in the <hi>Promiſes</hi> when we ſee the beſt Advantage; Now let us take the Gain, and live by it, and that comfortably too, in the Proof of God's <hi>Goodneſs</hi> therein. For this End, let me ſuggeſt theſe <hi>five Directions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt:</hi> Thou ſeeſt <hi>what</hi> GOD <hi>is</hi> in the Promiſe, and thou expecteſt no more than GOD is there: Then, eye <hi>that particular Good</hi> in the Promiſe which thou ſtandeſt in need of; eye that Good in Chriſt and in the Promiſe, and then ſet God's Power and Faithfulneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work to bring that Good, and his Wiſdom to continue it. As for <hi>Inſtance:</hi> I am in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:005214_0140_1016E614732B1730"/>
and either I would have Deliverance and Safety, that I might not be impriſoned; or elſe Comfort and Refreſhment, if the Lord carry me thither; and therefore I would ſee all this in the Promiſe, ſtill reſerving the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions before-mentioned. If thou art in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, eye Liberty and Preſervation in Chriſt; he that is the great Deliverer of his People, and carrieth his People in his own Hands: And then ſet God's Power and Faithfulneſs a-work, that can do it; and his Wiſdom, that can continue it for thy Good. That which thou ſeeſt and needeſt in the Promiſe, that the Power and Wiſdom of God may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to thy Soul. This is the Meaning of that Place, Pſal. 37.5. <hi>Commit thy Ways unto the Lord, truſt in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſs.</hi> Roul thy ſelf, and lay all thy Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the Lord: Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 Pet. 5.7. <hi>Caſt your Care upon the Lord, for he careth for you.</hi> It is God's proper Office and Work: He careth for thy Soul, therefore lay it all upon him, and put over all thy Care into his Hands, and ſet his Power and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs a-work: Only this is here a little to be ſcanned. I ſpeak not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhould take no Care at all, but I ſay, Hang all the Weight and Burden upon the Lord. The Brewer, he tumbles the Barrel of Beer, and he rouls it, but it's the Earth that bears it: So whatever Trouble is in thine Eye, or Ear, or
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:005214_0141_1016E684D3EDD268"/>
Heart, roul it upon the Lord. That is thus: The <hi>Weight</hi> of a Man lies eſpecially in <hi>three Things,</hi> which a Man muſt hurl off himſelf and lay upon the Lord. Either <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Man ſhall not be able to <hi>know</hi> what he ſhall do, or what he is commanded: Or elſe, <hi>Secondly,</hi> He ſhall not be able to <hi>do</hi> what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and he knows: Or elſe, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He ſhall not find <hi>Succeſs</hi> in what he doth. It is not a Trouble to do what we can, or to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our ſelves as we are able: But this is the Trouble, when the Heart ſaith, <q>I <hi>know not</hi> what the Mind of God is; or, I ſhall <hi>not do</hi> what I know; or, It will <hi>not ſucceed;</hi> or, No, it is not in <hi>my Power.</hi>
                  </q> Now leave all theſe with God, and meddle not with them, but put them over to the Lord, and meddle with thine own Duty, and thine own Work; and let God alone with his: And ſay thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, <q>In truth, Lord, it is not in my Power, it is not in my Parts or Work, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to compaſs that Wiſdom, that is able to direct my ſelf, or to have any Power to do all that is commanded, much leſs to give good Succeſs. Lord, I will not meddle with that, but leave it with thy Majeſty: If thou in thy Power canſt not, nor in thy Faithfulneſs and Goodneſs careſt not for thy poor helpleſs Creature, then I am content: And if thou wilt not be faithful, then I am content to be miſerable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="unknown:005214_0142_1016E64E9DAD5210"/>And ſo alſo thou mayeſt ſuppoſe a Man that hath promiſed to undertake ſome Buſineſs for a Friend, and in the End it proves ſomewhat troubleſome, and therefore he wiſhes his Friend to take it again into his own Hands; for it is very troubleſome: But a Man will leave it to him, and ſay, He hath engaged himſelf to do it, and he will not look after it; I will not meddle with it any more. So whatever it is that is in God's royal <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> leave it with God, and do not meddle with it; let God now look to it; leave it to his Faithfulneſs and Power to accompliſh it. So did <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.16,—20. <hi>Who againſt Hope</hi> [or, above] <hi>Hope, believed in</hi> [or, under] <hi>Hope, that he ſhould become the Father of many Nations. Sarah</hi>'s Womb was barren, and <hi>his</hi> Body dead, and yet he muſt have a <hi>Son:</hi> And therefore he ſets God's <hi>Power</hi> a-work, and ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <q>Lord, this Body is dead, and <hi>Sarah</hi> is barren: There is no Help here: But thou art able, and thou haſt engaged thy ſelf to do it.</q>
You ſee he ſets God's Power to work, and puts over all the Weight and Burthen of the Care upon the Lord. And therefore ſays <hi>Mordecai,</hi> Eſther 4.14. <hi>If thou altogether holdeſt thy Peace at this Time, Enlargement and Deliverance ſhall come from ſome other Place.</hi> He was reſolved that God had Deliverance for his Church, and would not deny his Truth.
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:005214_0143_1016E6865DA29BE0"/>
                  <hi>Salvation will come,</hi> ſaith the Text. He knows not the Place or the Means: But he knows <hi>Salvation will come.</hi> So ſet thou God's Power and Faithfulneſs to work, and not thy own Care: Commit it to the Lord, and caſt <hi>thy Care</hi> upon him, ſo far as concerns the <hi>Burthen</hi> of it. This is the <hi>firſt Direction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly;</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> go to the <hi>Promiſe</hi> again for <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to wait on God in that Way, and to look towards God in the Uſe of thoſe Means, he hath appointed for the attaining of that Good which his Power will work for thee. God will certainly work it: And ſo thou muſt meet God in the Courſe of his Providence, in the Improvement of the Means he hath appointed for thy Good. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thou his Providence, and do thou what God requires: For otherwiſe we live not by <hi>Faith,</hi> but tempt God, and throw away the Promiſe and all, and deprive our ſelves of that Good which God would beſtow; we not walking in that Way which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. when our Saviour was to go to Heaven, he ſaid, <hi>Behold, I ſend the</hi> PROMISE <hi>of my</hi> FATHER <hi>amongſt you: But tarry you in the City of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>until you be indued with Power from above.</hi> Chriſt would indue them with the SPIRIT; but they muſt tarry at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and wait for it. So I ſay, Would'ſt thou have Grace and the SPIRIT from above, and the Wealth of the
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:005214_0144_1016E611D74C1C80"/>
World? Then walk in that Way God hath appointed: Stay at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and be in the Way, and meet God in his Providence; and then thou ſhalt receive from his Power and Faithfulneſs what thou needeſt. Thou wouldſt have God bleſs thee in thine Eſtate, and yet thou wouldſt be idle and careleſs: But this will not do the Deed: God would give thee a Bleſſing, but thou art not there to take it. <hi>This is the Excellency of the Promiſes of God; as they require Conditions before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow Mercies; ſo they make us able to be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Conditions, and give the Conditions:</hi> As for <hi>Example, Ezek.</hi> 36. the Lord in the former Part of the Chapter promiſeth to give them many Things; but how? It muſt be by Prayer, and humbling themſelves before him: He will give thee a Family Bleſſing, by Prayer in it; and a Bleſſing in private, by Prayer in private; and Strength againſt Sin, and Power againſt Corruption: But I will be ſought unto for all theſe, ſaith the Lord: And the Text ſaith, Prov. 20.7. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that walketh in his Integrity, and his Children after him.</hi> Therefore walk thou in the Integrity of thine Heart; that's the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Chriſtian in General; or as a Huſband, or as a Wife, or as a Servant, in the Particular. This the Promiſe requires. But mark this now: The ſame Promiſe that requireth the Conditions, will help us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:005214_0145_1016E68939930F38"/>
form the Conditions: And the ſame Lord that ſaith, <hi>I will be entreated and ſought to for theſe;</hi> the ſame Lord ſaith, Pſal. 10.17. <hi>He prepareth their Hearts to pray.</hi> Go thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to God to help thee to pray, that he may beſtow his Bleſſing upon thee, which he hath promiſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.27. he will firſt give them a <hi>new Heart,</hi> then <hi>teach them to walk in his Ways.</hi> So if thou wilt walk in his Ways, thou ſhalt have his Bleſſings: Therefore go thou by the Power of Faith, to the Promiſes of God, for <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and in that thou muſt uſe the <hi>Means</hi> appointed; and then expect a Bleſſing from it in the Courſe of his Providence. Now is God's Power and Faithfulneſs ſet a-work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>third Direction.</hi> We muſt ſet it down, and conclude it, that God <hi>will do it;</hi> ſo ſhall we receive in the Ways of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence whatſoever he hath promiſed to give. That is the Work of Faith, and that is to draw Sap and Virtue from the Promiſe, John 3.33. <hi>He that hath received his Teſtimony, hath ſet to his Seal that God is True.</hi> There, by <hi>Sealing,</hi> is meant ſealing to the Promiſe. This is the Nature of <hi>Sealing;</hi> when a Man hath drawn the Articles of Agreement, and when they have ſealed, the whole Matter is done. So Faith muſt make the Promiſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical, and put a Seal to it that it is true; and ſaith, <q>It is done in Heaven, and I am
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:005214_0146_1016E6508D8AB490"/>
fully reſolved, and ſetledly perſwaded thereof, that I ſhall have whatever I have believed; and Thou, LORD, haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and I have uſed the Means in the Ways of thy Providence.</q> Famous is that of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.5. The Lord hath bidden him ſacrifice his Son, and yet had ſaid before he ſhould live: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he came to the Place, he ſaid to his Servants, <hi>Abide you here with the Aſſes; for I and the Lad will go yonder, and ſacrifice, and return again to you.</hi> He thought to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice him, and yet by <hi>Faith</hi> he believed that he ſhould bring <hi>Iſaac</hi> again. So I would have a poor Saint of God believe and conclude. When thou findeſt thy Comforts like <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s in the Aſhes, and thy Eſtate helpleſs and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; yet even then ſet God's Power a-work, and wait upon him in the Uſe of the Means he hath appointed, and there conclude it, and that He will bring Patience, Power, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and ſo in every Kind, according to all Neceſſities. Yet remember this, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no more from the Promiſe, than God will give in the Promiſe: But ſay, <q>My Sins ſhall be maſter'd one Day, and theſe Temptations ſhall one Day be overthrown, that have ſo long annoyed the Soul of thy Servant; I have begged Succour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe Corruptions within, and theſe Temptations without, and yet it is not;
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:005214_0147_1016E68D5AA0F0B8"/>
but I know it's done in Heaven; it wants nothing but the taking out; Thou wilt beſtow upon thy Servant what thou ſeeſt fit.</q> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Hannah</hi> wept ſore, and prayed to the Lord, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and was no more ſorrowful: And ſhe ſaid, <q>Lord, I believe that I ſhall either have a Child, or that which is as good, or better:</q> Now the Buſineſs was done.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe the Lord delays, and does not ſuddenly accompliſh what he intends, and thou haſt uſed Means to receive; he gives not, grants not, ſends not Succour according to thy Deſire, and the Tenor of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>as thou conceiveſt;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Then in the <hi>fourth Place,</hi> FAITH is to take up it's Stand, and <hi>ſtay till it come:</hi> As thou reſolveſt, ſo it will be: Stay 'till it be, and ſtay it out. Here is much Work to do. We prevent God's Kindneſs, when we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before he be willing to beſtow a Kindneſs on us. But Faith will not do ſo: He that believes, does not make haſte: He makes haſte to obey, but he ſtays, and reſolves that it will be. Hab. 2.3. <hi>The Viſion is for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Time; but at the End it ſhall ſpeak, and not lie;</hi> Therefore <hi>wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come.</hi> Thou art peſtered with thy <hi>Sins,</hi> and haſt laboured by Faith to ſubdue them; and thy Eſtate is low, and thou haſt laboured by Faith for Deliverance: And yet it comes
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:005214_0148_1016E60DC9CB2038"/>
not: Therefore ſtay till God ſees fit, and it will come. Pſal. 123.2. <hi>As the Eyes of Servants look to the Hands of their Maſters, and as the Eyes of a Maiden to the Hand of her Miſtreſs; ſo our Eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until he have Mercy upon us.</hi> It is not, 'till I will, or 'till I ſee fit, or according to my Mind; but until the Lord have Mercy. We ſuddenly ſlide away from the Covenant which the Lord makes with us; becauſe we have it not when we will, therefore we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.13. When <hi>Samuel</hi> tarried long, and the People began to murmur, <hi>Saul</hi> went and offered a Burnt-offering to the Lord: And therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou haſt done fooliſhly, thou haſt not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee; for now would the Lord have eſtabliſhed thy Kingdom upon</hi> Iſrael <hi>for ever.</hi> If <hi>Saul</hi> had ſtayed the Lord's Time, HE would have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his Kingdom upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ever: But he prevented the Lord's Kindneſs, and offered ſacrifice unſeaſonably and ſinfully. So it is many Times with a proud, pettiſh, raſh and diſtempered Heart: If we have not what we would, and when we would, then we are all amort, [<hi>i.e.</hi> quite dead-hearted,] and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, and ſay, Why ſhould we wait any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? <hi>Thou haſt done fooliſhly:</hi> Haſt thou pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and looked to the <hi>Promiſe</hi> thus long, and wilt thou now give over? The Lord would
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:005214_0149_1016E690024010A8"/>
have comforted thee, hadſt thou gone on: But the Lord hath withdrawn himſelf from thee, becauſe thou haſt withdrawn thy Heart from the Promiſe. When the Carriage is heavy, and the Way dead, there are many ſore Pulls, and oft the Waggon is at a Stand; and if a Man ſhould then go away and give over, all his Work were loſt. Therefore ſtay thou 'till the Lord ſhew Mercy. Thus long thou haſt call'd and ſought, and look'd up to the Promiſe, and waited upon the Lord, and attended upon the freeneſs of his Grace; once more haply would have done it: thy Heart was almoſt humbled, thy Sin was almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered: Oh thou ſilly Soul, why didſt not thou hold it out? It would have come at the laſt; my Life for thine. Now take heed of this; If the Time ſeems tedious, and thy Heart begins to ſink, and thy Spirit is weary; take heed of flying off, take heed of ſhifting for thy own Comfort, and looking to baſe Ends and Aims: No, hold thy Mind to, and keep thy Eye of Faith upon the Promiſe, and ſtay it out 'till God ſee the Time fit: And know, <hi>it's the beſt Time, when it's</hi> GOD'S <hi>Time.</hi> In the 27th of the <hi>Acts,</hi> ver. 31. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe abide in the Ship, ye cannot be ſaved.</hi> Every Man was ſkipping over-board to ſave himſelf, but <hi>Paul</hi> ſtayed them. A Man would have tho't otherwiſe; but the Apoſtle knew it was not ſo; for the Lord had reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:005214_0150_1016E6918C6A3900"/>
it to him. So I ſay, Be thy Temptations never ſo ſtrong, and thy Sins never ſo many, and thou beginneſt to complain, and ſayeſt, <q>I have cryed, Lord, and ſought earneſtly, and yet my Condition is worſe, and my Soul more ſinful, and I am leſs able to help my ſelf, there is no more Succour to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>
Now take heed of going out of the <hi>Ship,</hi> and from the uſe of Means: Keep in the <hi>Ship;</hi> for in it you ſhall be ſafe. Keep in the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and ſtill your Hearts there: You ſhall have a happy Arrival at Heaven, tho' it be upon a little broken Board: It's no matter, ſtay God's Time.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>fifth Direction. Lay hold</hi> on GOD in CHRIST, and <hi>wreſtle</hi> with him, and <hi>never let him go.</hi> For yet haply the Lord ſeems not only to <hi>delay</hi> his poor Servants, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Favour; but he ſeems to <hi>frown</hi> and ſay, <hi>He will not hear;</hi> and he ſeems to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the Prayer of his Servants, and with their Importunity; and he ſeems as if he would not ſuccour and ſupply: Thus he dealt with <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32.26. There the Lord ſays, <hi>Let me go;</hi> I care not what becomes of thee, <hi>Let me go:</hi> But <hi>Jacob</hi> lays hold upon him, and would not let him go. So the <hi>laſt Work</hi> of Faith is this: <hi>In a holy Humility la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to contend with</hi> GOD, and by a ſtrong Hand overcome the Lord; for the Lord loves to be overcome thus. Be not ſaucy with the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:005214_0151_1016E695C1A4A780"/>
Lord: But in the Senſe of thine own Baſeneſs, as it were, catch the Lord Jeſus, and ſtrive with him; leave not 'till thou haſt thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts he hath promiſed, and thou haſt begged. This is the Glory and the Victory of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of Faith, that gives thee the Day too; and the Lord, as 'twere, lays down the Wea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pons, and yields himſelf as conquered: As was with <hi>Jacob,</hi> when GOD ſaw he could not prevail, he ſaid, Verſe 28. <hi>Thy Name ſhall no more be called</hi> Jacob, <hi>but</hi> Iſrael, <hi>becauſe thou haſt prevailed with God.</hi> God is ready to give what he hath promiſed; but he will have us try the Maſtery with him. God overcomes himſelf, and we by Faith in God, overcome or prevail with God: As Jam. 2.13. <hi>Mercy triumphs over Juſtice.</hi> Lord, ſaith <hi>my Soul,</hi> Why ſhould not I have that Mercy, Supply and Succour? Saith Juſtice, Thou art a ſinful Wretch, and thou haſt wronged me: Saith Anger, Thou haſt deſerved to be plagued; and therefore thou ſhalt feel the ſmart of my Diſpleaſure. Now <hi>Faith</hi> lays hold upon the Riches of the Freeneſs of God's <hi>Mercy</hi> in Chriſt; and in him Juſtice is ſatisfied, and Anger appealed for all: And now Mercy is purchaſed for all, and Mercy triumpheth over Juſtice; and Faith takes hold upon and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes GOD himſelf, as I may ſay, with a holy humble Baſeneſs of Heart. You know what the Lord did to the Woman of <hi>Canaan, Mat.</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:005214_0152_1016E6986CB41398"/>
15.28. when ſhe had ſtriven with him a great while, and would take no Denial; at laſt he ſaith, <hi>O Woman, great is thy Faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> Take what thou wilt; if thou wilt have Life for thy Child, and Peace for thine own Conſcience, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, take it; for it is all thine. He, as it were, turns her looſe to all his Treaſury. If ſhe had gone away at the firſt or ſecond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, ſhe had found no Help: But becauſe ſhe held out, ſhe had all her Heart's Deſire. God would have us wreſtle with his Majeſty, that he may be overcome in Mercy and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>I might have here taken ſome of <hi>the moſt deſperate Caſes</hi> that could be, that you might have ſeen what <hi>Faith</hi> would have done in the Midſt of the <hi>Want of all Means,</hi> and in the <hi>greateſt Extremity</hi> that could have befallen a poor Sinner; but I paſs over that at this Time.</p>
               <p>Now therefore conſider what hath been ſaid: Lay theſe Things up, and have them ever before you, and practiſe them: And by often writing, learn to write: And by often living, learn to live. Many People live poorly, and make a poor Shift to go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: But I would not have a Chriſtian live ſo, but be Maſter of his Art. Know and ſee your Way, and uſe the Means, Labour to get Good thereby; that you may have the Sap and Sweet of the Promiſes, and ſo go ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:005214_0153_1016E69B1EB78680"/>
and rejoicing and triumphing up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW that which I conclude withal is this: You ſee how far the Lord hath brought us; how the Soul hath been prepared, and cut off from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Itſelf,</hi> if fitted for the Lord Jeſus, by <hi>Contrition</hi> and <hi>Humiliation;</hi> and that the Soul comes to ſee that there is <hi>no Hope</hi> in the <hi>Creatures,</hi> nor any Succour in Heaven, but in the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and ſo at laſt the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner comes, and lies at the <hi>Foot</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> and knows that either he muſt be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man, or a damned Man. Now when he ſees that <hi>Prayer</hi> and all other <hi>Means</hi> will not profit, and the Power of the Means yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails not, and the Power of his <hi>Corruptions</hi> is not yet maſtered; then he looks up to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and is contented that he ſhould do what he will with him. Now when the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſees him lie wearied thus with his Corruptions, then the Lord gives ſpecial Notice to his Soul that it is his Purpoſe to do him good, and that there is Mercy for that broken Heart of his. With that <hi>Hope</hi> is ſtirred; and <hi>Faith</hi> cries out, <q>Is it poſſible? Is it credible? Shall this
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:005214_0154_1016E69CA75F6438"/>
Wretchedneſs of mine be pardoned? Oh, my Deſire is kindled within me, and I long for that Day: O that I might once ſee the Funeral of all my Sins!</q> Mark now how <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> are cheared to entertain this Mercy; and Oh how is the Soul bound and engaged to GOD, that offers free and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Grace to a ſtubborn and rebellious Sinner! At laſt the <hi>Will</hi> ſaith <hi>Amen</hi> to the <hi>Promiſe;</hi> and further ſaith, <hi>O that Mercy I will have!</hi> And thus the Soul is come home to GOD by <hi>Vocation.</hi> Now the Prodigal is come home to his Father; and the Father's Heart leaps within his Breaſt, when he ſees him lie at the Door. And as the Father rejoiceth, ſo the Angels in Heaven rejoice; and all the Faithful ſhall rejoice, and ſay, <q>Oh my Huſband, Oh my Father. Oh my Child, and Oh my Wife, that was a ſinful Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is come home again to her firſt and beſt Huſband.</q> You that have found it thus in your ſelves, be comforted: You that know it in others, rejoice.</p>
               <p>To <hi>ſum up all</hi> briefly, we ſee,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt;</hi> When we have <hi>pluck'd away all carnal Props,</hi> that then there is Way made for the <hi>Promiſe</hi> to come in to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> And when our Hearts are poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoro'ly of the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of GOD'S <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> and <hi>Grace;</hi> that then the <hi>Promiſe</hi> that draws near, begins it's Work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:005214_0155_1016E69E2F6D5798"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly;</hi> That when we <hi>expect</hi> all from the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> even Power to come to it, that then It lays faſt hold upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly;</hi> That when we are <hi>content to yield</hi> to the <hi>juſt Conditions</hi> of the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> then the <hi>Promiſe</hi> carries us, and all in us.</p>
               <p>Thus we have ſeen the <hi>Hindrances</hi> removed, and the <hi>Means</hi> propounded: And hence we ſee, that <hi>Faith</hi> is to be laboured for above all Graces. And now that we may be moved and perſwaded importunately to ſeek after this bleſſed Grace of God; let us further conſider thus much, namely, that <hi>if we once get this Grace, we get all other Graces with it;</hi> which is a Ground of much Comfort, and cannot but keep us doing: For will it not much encourage a Man, when in the doing of <hi>one</hi> Work he knows he ſhall do <hi>another,</hi> nay, <hi>all</hi> his Work with one Labour! But ſo it is in the Work of <hi>Faith.</hi> Oh then how ſhould it encourage us to labour for <hi>Faith,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by getting it, we have all? Men that are wiſe to provide for themſelves, and to lay out their Monies in ſome Purchaſe for the beſt; when they ſee a Ground well wooded and watered, but eſpecially to have ſome rich Mines in it, all their Minds will be upon ſuch a Place, becauſe, having it, they have all with it. So it ſhould be here, in our Deſires: And as there, ſo here; get <hi>this Grace,</hi> and get all: Strengthen here, and all is ſtrong:
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:005214_0156_1016E6A33B686790"/>
But want here, and want every where: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Grace of <hi>Faith,</hi> you need not ſeek for <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> for <hi>Faith</hi> will make you wiſe to Salvation: And you need not labour for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;</hi> for he that is faithful, will be patient: And ſo for other Graces. He that hath the Grace of <hi>Faith,</hi> hath them all; hath <hi>Holineſs,</hi> hath <hi>Cleanneſs,</hi> hath <hi>Love,</hi> hath a <hi>pure Mind,</hi> and <hi>good Conſcience;</hi> and what hath he not? The Saints of God endeavour with much Pains to get Grace, and to ſubdue Corruption: But becauſe they take not the <hi>right Way</hi> to it, they ſeek and do not find.</p>
               <p>Many a poor Soul mourns and cries to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for Mercy, and prays againſt a ſtubborn hard Heart, and is weary of his Life, becauſe this vile Heart remains yet in him; and yet haply gets little or no Redreſs: The Reaſon is, and the main Wound lies here; he goes the wrong Way to work; for, he that would have <hi>Grace</hi> muſt (firſt of all) get FAITH: <hi>Faith</hi> will bring all the reſt; buy the Field and the Pearl is thine; it goes with the Purchaſe. Thou muſt not think with thine own Struggling to get the Maſtery of a proud Heart; for that will not do: But let thy <hi>Faith</hi> go firſt to CHRIST, and try what that can do. There are many Graces ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in this Work; as <hi>Meekneſs, Patience, Humility,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom:</hi> Now <hi>Faith</hi> will fetch all theſe, and poſſeſs the Soul of them. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:005214_0157_1016E6A62029A098"/>
therefore if you ſet any Price upon theſe Graces, buy the Field, labour for <hi>Faith;</hi> get that, and you get all. The Apoſtle ſaith, 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>We all with open Face, beholding as in a Glaſs, the Glory of the</hi> LORD, <hi>are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory.</hi> The Lord Chriſt is the Glaſs, and the glorious Grace of God in Chriſt, is that Glory of the Lord: Therefore firſt behold this Grace in Chriſt by Faith (and thou muſt do ſo before thou canſt receive Grace.) Firſt, See <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> in Chriſt, and then fetch it thence: Firſt, See Strength and Courage in him, whereby to enable thy weak Heart, and Strength will come; there fetch it, and there have it. Would you then have a <hi>meek, gracious,</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> Heart? I dare ſay for ſome of you, that you had rather have it than any Thing under Heaven, and would think it the beſt Bargain that ever you made; which is the Cauſe why you ſay, <q>O that I could once ſee that Day, that this proud Heart of mine might be humbled: Oh if I could ſee the laſt Blood of my Sins, I ſhould then think my ſelf happy, none more, and deſire to live no longer.</q> But is this thy Deſire, poor Soul? Then get <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſo buy the whole, for they all go together: Nor think to have them upon any Price, not having <hi>Faith:</hi> I mean <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and the <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heart:</hi> But buy <hi>Faith,</hi> the Field, and you
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:005214_0158_1016E6A7A7D02380"/>
have the Pearl. Further, Would you have the Glory of God in your Eye, and be more heavenly-minded? Then look to it, and get it by the Eye of <hi>Faith:</hi> Look up to it in the Face of JESUS CHRIST, and then you ſhall ſee it; and then hold you there: For there, and there only, this Viſion of the Glory of God is to be ſeen, to your everlaſting Peace and endleſs Comfort. When Men uſe to make a Purchaſe, they ſpeak of all the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of it; as, That there is ſo much Wood, worth ſo much; and ſo much Stock, worth ſo much; and then they offer for the whole, anſwerable to theſe ſeverals. So here; there is <hi>Item</hi> for an <hi>heavenly Mind,</hi> and that's worth Thouſands; and, <hi>Item</hi> for an <hi>humble Heart,</hi> and that's worth Millions: And ſo for the reſt. And are thoſe Graces ſo much worth? What is <hi>Faith</hi> worth then? Hence we may conclude and ſay, <hi>O precious Faith!</hi> precious indeed, that is able, thro' the Spirit of Chriſt, to bring ſo many, nay, all Graces with it: As one Degree of Grace after another: Grace here, and Happineſs for ever hereafter. If we have but the Hearts of Men (I do not ſay of Chriſtians) methinks this that is ſpoken of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſhould provoke us to labour always, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Things, for this bleſſed Grace of God, the Grace of <hi>Faith.</hi>
