            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Mr. PRESIDENT,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Queſtion before us is, Have the Methodiſts done moſt Good or Evil? Now this ſuppoſes, firſt, That they have done both good and evil, otherwiſe it would be abſurd to inquire which they have done moſt of; and ſecondly, it ſuppoſes, That they have done both in nearly the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; otherwiſe it would not admit of any diſpute, much leſs of one ſo large<note n="*" place="bottom">This Speech was delivered on the third night.</note> as this we are now engaged in. This then being the true ſtate of the Queſtion, I undertake to demonſtrate that it is both abſurd and blaſphemous.</p>
            <p>And, firſt, It is abſurd. For it ſuppoſes that the ſame fountain ſends forth bitter water and ſweet; that the ſame tree bears good and evil fruit; and they both do this in nearly the ſame degree. Beſides, it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deſtroys that rule of judging given by our Lord, By their fruit ye ſhall know them. For if the ſame tree bears good and evil fruit, how ſhall we be able to judge by
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028549_0003_0FD94056F6645100"/>
the fruit whether the tree be good or evil. In like manner, if the Methodiſts bear theſe oppoſite fruits, how can the world judge whether they are falſe prophets or true? whether ſent of God or of the Devil?</p>
            <p>Again. Our Lord ſays, A good man, out of the good treaſure of his heart, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good things, and (not the ſame, but) an evil man, out of the evil treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth evil things. Now the queſtion, in its preſent form, turns this into the greateſt abſurdity. For it ſuppoſes that one of theſe may have both theſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in his heart, bringing forth good and evil things! That is, it ſuppoſes that he may be a good and an evil man at the ſame time, and have a good and an evil treaſure in his heart, bringing forth theſe oppoſite things! which is a moſt palpable abſurdity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is blaſphemous. In proof of this let it be obſerved, that, according to the Scriptures, good and evil are brought into being by the aſſiſtance of ſpiritual agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: good, by the aſſiſtance of God, and evil, by that of the devil. Hence, ſpeaking of good, they ſay, All the good that is done upon earth, the Lord doeth it, and that it is God who worketh in us both to will and do of his good pleaſure. On the other hand, all moral evil is attributed to the agency of Satan. Therefore he is ſaid
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028549_0004_0FD9405C1806AE38"/>
to work, with energy, in the children of diſobedience; and in particular, to have beguiled Eve, and to have put it into the heart of Ananias and Sapphira to lie unto the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Now as the queſtion before us ſuppoſes that good and evil are both done by the Methodiſts, it muſt ſuppoſe that there is communion between light and darkneſs, and concord between Chriſt and Belial: the one working in, and by the Methodiſts all the good they do, and the other all the evil: and which works hardeſt, Chriſt in helping them to do good, or Belial in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to do evil, is the blaſphemous point we are this night to determine!</p>
            <p>Perhaps it is owing to this great impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the queſtion, that no one has yet ſo much as attempted to ſpeak directly to it: that is, that no one has once offered to ſhew, What good and evil the Methodiſts have done; and then which is the greateſt. Inſtead of this, the Oppoſers of Methodiſm have aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at nothing but Ridicule and Abuſe: therefore their Advocates have hitherto thought it quite enough to anſwer thoſe falſe and ridiculous accuſations.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed is it poſſible to ſpeak directly to the queſtion, in its preſent form, with any degree of propriety: therefore I ſhall
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028549_0005_0FD9405D0F33A9A0"/>
take the liberty to amend it, and only aſk, Have the Methodiſts done Good or Evil?</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to the queſtion thus amended, I ſhall ſhew, firſt, who the Methodiſts are. Then, ſecondly, inquire, Whether they have done good or evil?</p>
            <p>And, Firſt, I am to ſhew, who the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts are. And, firſt, it is certain that thoſe who were dead a hundred years before any Methodiſt was born, cannot be taken into the account. Therefore to impute to them the abſurdities of John of Munſter, or of Nailor of Briſtol, or of any other who lived a hundred, or a hundred and fifty years ago, is an inſult both on Methodiſm and common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are ſeveral denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſtians now living, who are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called Methodiſts, who do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them. For inſtance; the Moravians, the Independents, the Baptiſts, the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians; together with many miniſters and congregations, who, in every ſenſe of the word, belong to the church of England. Now though many of theſe preach the ſame doctrines, and entertain a favourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Methodiſts; and though, on the other hand, the Methodiſts very highly eſteem many of theſe; yet they cannot, with any propriety, be called Methodiſts. For, firſt, their names were never entered in any
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028549_0006_0FD9405EA9527DC0"/>
Regiſter of the Methodiſt ſocieties. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they were never ſubject to thoſe rules and regulations by which the Method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts are governed. Thirdly, they do not ſo much as bear the Methodiſt-name, unleſs it be impoſed on them, and then they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſown, and diſclaim it. Nor, fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, were they ever acknowledged by the Methodiſts, as any part of their community. As to ſome of theſe, the Antinomians, they are profeſſedly, as great enemies to the laws of Methodiſm, as they are to the laws of God! To impute, therefore, the follies of theſe, or of any other of the above deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, to the Methodiſts, is abſurd and cruel.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Neither can the queſtion intend any mere individual, as ſuch; ſeeing it ſpeaks, in the plural, of "the Methodiſts." Now there are ſeveral ſorts of individuals, called Methodiſts, who muſt be excluded from the buſineſs in hand. As firſt, ſuch as are, or have been called Methodiſts, who never were in any connection with them. Of this ſort I knew an inſtance when I was a boy. A man in a gown and caſſoc preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the town where I was, paſſed for a Methodiſt: but when the mob began to be unruly he cried out, "I am no Methodiſt." Now had this man been guilty of any irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity (which I know not that he was)
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028549_0007_0FD9406371821280"/>
doubtleſs it would have been ſet down to the Methodiſt's account. Another ſort of individuals, almoſt always called Method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, are thoſe who have been expelled for their evil practices. Perſons of this ſort have too frequently been found in all deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Chriſtians: even that ſmall number which followed our Lord while he was on earth, for ſome time had a Judas among them. Now, whatever other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities do, when the Methodiſts diſcover an unholy walker among them, they firſt endeavour to reclaim him; but if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do this, they then put him away from their ſocieties. And though this is all they can do, or ought to do, for the honor of God, and for their own credit, yet the evil practices of ſuch perſons continue to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Methodiſts; yea, though they have been out of that connection for a great number of years.</p>
            <p>A third ſort of individuals unjuſtly called Methodiſts, are thoſe who are Apoſtates from Methodiſm; thoſe who have made ſhipwreck of faith and of a good conſcience. Now apoſtates are well known to be often ſome of the bittereſt enemies the people have from whom they have apoſtatized. Witneſs Satan, the original apoſtate; who ever ſince his apoſtaſy has been doing all in his power, againſt God and man: witneſs
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028549_0008_0FD94064F0A9C768"/>
Alexander the copper ſmith, in the apoſtle's days, whom St. Paul ſaid had done him much wrong: witneſs Julian the Apoſtate, who, after his apoſtaſy, became one of the greateſt perſecutors the Chriſtians ever had. Add to theſe, the two principal Oppoſers of Methodiſm on this occaſion. Theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in the preſence of this aſſembly, have avowed their apoſtaſy from Methodiſm, in the moſt explicit terms, and then have pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out ſuch torrents of low and ſcandalous abuſe, on thoſe who were once their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as is ſhocking to every Chriſtian ear. Among many other inſtances one of them has ſaid, "The Methodiſts have thronged Bedlam with lunatics: made Tyburn groan with criminals; and quite crowded the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit!" Now I aſk every man of ſenſe, if theſe, and the like, are not fine gentry to be fathered on the Methodiſts? Or rather if it is not great injuſtice to make them reſponſible for the conduct of ſuch virulent Apoſtates!</p>
            <p>But if theſe are not, who then are the Methodiſts? I anſwer, Thoſe who are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſeveral ſocieties inſtituted by the original founders of Methodiſm. Now theſe are the Rev. John Weſley, and the late Rev. George Whitefield. All therefore who are members of the ſocieties, inſtituted and eſtabliſhed by theſe, and who are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028549_0009_0FD940664BF4F578"/>
by the rules and regulations they have laid down, are properly, "The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts."</p>
            <p>Having ſhewn who the Methodiſts are, I proceed, Secondly, to inquire, whether they have done Good or Evil?</p>
            <p>But before I do this, it is neceſſary to make a few obſervations on the different ways of doing good and evil. Now theſe may be done two ways: directly, and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly; or rather properly and accidentally. Good and evil are done directly, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, when the cauſe naturally produces the effect. They are done improperly, or accidentally, when an effect follows which does not naturally or properly belong to the cauſe. For inſtance; you ſee a perſon in danger of dying for want of bread. From a principle of humanity you <hi>deſign</hi> to ſave him. In order to this end, you give him a piece of bread, which is an immediate and natural <hi>cauſe</hi> of producing the effect you intended. But this cauſe cannot produce this effect, unleſs the perſon receives, and uſes the bread in a proper manner. But he does ſo receive and uſe it, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence his life is ſaved. Here then is good done immediately and directly, as the effect has naturally followed the cauſe. But good may be done accidentally. One man ſeeing another, whom he ſuppoſes to be his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028549_0010_0FD9406909230128"/>
               <hi>intends</hi> to kill him. In order to this end, he thruſts a ſword through his body. But the ſword miſſing the vitals, opens an impoſthume, whereby his enemy's life is ſaved. Now here was an evil <hi>intended,</hi> and evil <hi>means</hi> made uſe of to bring it to paſs; but notwithſtanding both, good accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally followed.</p>
            <p>In like manner evil may be done directly and accidentally. And firſt, directly. A man on ſeeing his enemy, <hi>intends</hi> to kill him. For this purpoſe he runs a ſword through his heart; the conſequence is, his enemy drops down dead at his feet: as muſt be the caſe, ſeeing the cauſe naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the effect. This evil then was not accidental, but natural, immediate, and direct. On the other hand, evil may be done accidentally. For inſtance. You ſee a boy in danger of dying for want. You <hi>deſign</hi> to ſave him. For <hi>that end</hi> you give him a piece of bread. But by a careleſs uſe of it, a crumb ſticks in his throat and ſuffocates him, and in a ſhort time he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. Now if you had not intended to have ſaved him, you would not have given him the bread; and if you had not done this, it would not have occaſioned his death. It is therefore certain that what you did was the cauſe of his death: ſeeing he would not have died by means of that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028549_0011_0FD9406A768A18E0"/>
bread, if you had not given it him. But as this evil did not happen as a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of your generoſity; but rather through the careleſſneſs, or wantonneſs of him you gave it to, the evil was entirely accidental with reſpect to you.</p>
            <p>Now as to this laſt ſort of evil, there is nothing excellent or praiſe-worthy, which is not liable to it. For inſtance; when God created angels and men, his <hi>deſign</hi> was only good, viz. that they might glorify him, and be happy to all eternity. And the <hi>means</hi> which he made uſe of in creating them, or rather the manner in which he created them, was perfectly conſonant with his deſign. For he created them in his own image; endued with reaſon and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; with liberty to chooſe the good and refuſe the evil; that they might be capable of a greater reward, by performing a free and voluntary obedience. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Creator only <hi>intended</hi> good, and created them in a <hi>manner</hi> which was moſt likely to promote that end, yet much evil enſued, viz. all the ſin and miſery which began preſently after their creation, and which will laſt to all eternity. Now if men and angels had not been created, this vvil could not have happened; but as it was no part of their Creator's <hi>deſign,</hi> nor natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally followed from the <hi>manner</hi> of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028549_0012_0FD9406F37FE1758"/>
but aroſe merely from the abuſe of their liberty, which God intended only for their good, the evil was certainly acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental.</p>
            <p>Again, when God entered into covenant with Abraham he <hi>intended</hi> great good both to him and his family; and alſo that in him all the families of the earth ſhould be bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And there is no doubt but the terms of that covenant correſponded with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, otherwiſe a God of infinite wiſdom and goodneſs would not have given them. But notwithſtanding this, the perverſeneſs of men occaſioned much accidental evil to proceed therefrom: ſuch as the tyranny of the Egyptians, and the oppreſſion of the Hebrews. This tyranny alſo occaſioned all the plagues which ſell on that hardened people, in their own land, and at laſt their overthrow in the Red Sea. And all the evils which befel the Iſraelites and their enemies, both in the wilderneſs, and in the land of Canaan, happened in the ſame way; ſo that theſe may properly be called acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental evils.</p>
            <p>Chriſtianity likewiſe is ſubject to this ſort of evil. Undoubtedly the <hi>deſign</hi> of God in this was, the greateſt good that a ſinful world was capable of; being nothing leſs than their preſent and eternal ſalvation. And <hi>what he did,</hi> in order to this end, was
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028549_0013_0FD94071F317AE70"/>
the moſt perfect diſplay of divine wiſdom and goodneſs ever made known to angels or men. Yet we all know that great evils were occaſioned thereby, which otherwiſe could never have happened: ſuch as the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Jews and Gentiles on the one hand, and all the ſufferings of Chriſt and his followers on the other.</p>
            <p>If we deſcend to particulars, we ſhall find that every part of Chriſtianity is liable to accidental evil. For inſtance, the birth of Chriſt was the accidental cauſe of the ſlaughter of the infants, by the order of Herod: the faſting of Chriſt in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was the accidental cauſe of Satan's hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and blaſphemous temptations; the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of Chriſt accidentally occaſioned the blaſphemies of the Scribes and Phariſees: the preaching of Chriſt thus occaſioned the oppoſition he met with on that account: the crucifixion of Chriſt thus occaſioned the inſults he received in the judgment-hall and on Calvary: and the reſurrection of Chriſt was the accidental cauſe of the rulers ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borning the ſoldiers to ſay, His diſciples came and ſtole him away while we were aſleep. Add to this, that the exiſtence of the word of God is the accidental cauſe of men wreſting it to their own deſtruction: the preaching of the Apoſtles was thus the cauſe of its becoming the ſavour of death
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028549_0014_0FD94073F83E48F0"/>
unto many. Again, Wherever the grace of God is turned into wantonneſs, we muſt ſay, that it is remotely or accidentally the cauſe of that abuſe; for if that grace had never exiſted, it could not poſſibly have been thus abuſed.</p>
            <p>Once more, The Reformation has been productive of much accidental evil. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the <hi>deſign</hi> of our firſt Reformers was only the good of the church of Chriſt. And the <hi>means</hi> they made uſe of, in expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuperſtitions and idolatries of the church of Rome, were the moſt likely to accompliſh their deſign. Notwithſtanding theſe, much evil followed, viz. all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions the Papiſts were guilty of, and all the martyrdoms, and other ſufferings, the Proteſtants endured. But as all theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and ſufferings were contrary both to the deſign of the Reformers, and to the natural tendency of what they did; they were accidental evils, and therefore not to be imputed to the Reformers, as faults of theirs.</p>
            <p>In like manner, Methodiſm has been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with much accidental evil. Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the original founders of Methodiſm had a <hi>good deſign.</hi> Had they aimed at eaſe, they would not have voluntarily undertaken the hardeſt labours; much leſs have continued therein. Had they wiſhed for the praiſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028549_0015_0FD940784235A4B0"/>
that cometh of men, they would not, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and wilfully, have expoſed themſelves to almoſt univerſal reproach. And had they aimed at riches, they would have gone to the rich and great, and not to the moſt poor and indigent. Their <hi>deſign,</hi> therefore, muſt be ſuppoſed to be, The glory of God, and the good of men. And the <hi>means</hi> they made uſe of were the moſt likely to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their deſign. For not being ſatisfied with what they felt in themſelves, and ſaw in thoſe about them, who were reputed good Chriſtians, they determined, with much prayer and faſting, to ſearch the Original Scriptures, to ſee what real Chriſtianity was: whether there was any thing more contained therein, than doing no harm, and doing good, and uſing the ordinances of God. They had not gone on long this way, before they diſcovered, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity required a right ſtate of mind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of right tempers and deſires, and that from hence right words and actions were to proceed. No ſooner were they thoroughly convinced of this, than they began to be in earneſt in ſeeking it for themſelves: then in recommending it to thoſe who came in their way, who had any inclination to hear them. They then went to the priſons, and recommended it to the moſt wretched criminals. At laſt they
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028549_0016_0FD9407A343B9118"/>
boldly preached the religion of the heart to the whole Univerſity. From Oxford they came to London, and inſiſted on the ſame doctrine there in many of the churches. After a ſhort ſtay in London, they went to America, to convert the Indians to this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. After attempting this they returned to London, where their congregations were much greater than they had been before. After awhile, the principal inhabitants of the ſeveral pariſhes where theſe gentlemen preached, complained that they were greatly incommoded by the immenſe multitudes which came to hear. The conſequence was, that firſt one church, then another, and at laſt, all the churches were ſhut againſt them. On this they went into Moorfields, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other places, preaching the kingdom of God to thouſands, and tens of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, of all ſorts of people; but chiefly to ſuch as would not hear it in any other place. After doing this for awhile in and about London, they went to Briſtol, and did the ſame there. From hence they went, with their lives in their hands, to the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſavage parts of the nation, and preached Chriſt and his kingdom to the colliers in Kingſwood, Newcaſtle, and Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire: then to the tinners in Cornwall: and at laſt, to almoſt every city, town and village in the three kingdoms. And thus
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028549_0017_0FD9407D3403EB00"/>
one of them, the great and good Mr. Whitefield, went on to his dying day; and thus the truly venerable Mr. Weſley goes on, with unabating ardour, to this day, although he is now between eighty and ninety years of age.</p>
            <p>And what has been ſaid of theſe great and good men, to whoſe labours theſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms owe ſo much, may in a good meaſure be ſaid of thoſe, who from time to time, have laboured with them. For the event has abundantly ſhewn, that theſe in general, ſet out with a ſingle eye; and that the fame good intention has influenced them in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſteps of their leaders.</p>
            <p>Now, whoever conſiders the ſcriptural accounts of former ages, the hiſtories of later dates, and the ſtate mankind is in at preſent; will ſoon be convinced, that a great variety of accidental evils muſt follow ſuch a work. Men of influence, who have no religion, will cry out againſt thoſe who endeavour to be better than themſelves: men of mere outſide religion, like the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees of old, will exclaim againſt thoſe who are ſeeking the kingdom of God within them: hypocrites and deceivers are ſure to have ſomething to ſay againſt thoſe who profeſs to be true of heart: and all theſe will ſtir up the rabble to be guilty of various and great outrages. So it was in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028549_0018_0FD9408128B60328"/>
the days of Chriſt and his apoſtles; ſo it was in the following ages of the church; and ſo it has been among the Methodiſts. Men of learning, fortune, power, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, invented or propagated evil reports; hence aroſe a great variety of barefaced ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and ſlanders. By theſe the rabble were encouraged to inſult the perſons, and deſtroy the property of the Methodiſts. By theſe means, not only one neighbour was often ſet againſt another, but there were frequent diſturbances in families. As our Lord ſaid, there were five in a houſe, three againſt two, and two againſt three: the father againſt his ſon, and the ſon againſt his father; the mother againſt her daughter, and the daughter againſt her mother; the mother-in-law againſt her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law againſt her mother-in-law; ſo that a man's foes were often thoſe of his own houſehold. Now had theſe evils been a thouſand times greater than they were, as they were not the natural and direct conſequence of Methodiſm, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accidental conſequences, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed from the abuſe thereof, the Method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts are no more to be blamed on account thereof, than the Reformers are for the abuſe of the Reformation; or Chriſt, for the abuſe of Chriſtianity; or God, for the evils which were occaſioned by his entering
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028549_0019_0FD940863655DDC8"/>
into covenant with Abraham, or for the abuſe which men and angels made of the creation of the world.</p>
            <p>We will therefore put accidental evil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely out of the queſtion; and aſk, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Have the Methodiſts done evil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and directly? If they have, it has been either by their doctrine or their diſcipline. But have they done it by their doctrine? That this may be fairly and fully underſtood, let us ſee what their doctrine is. And, firſt, They teach that all men are ſinners by nature and practice. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That Chriſt died to ſave ſinners. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That men muſt unfeignedly repent of all their ſins. Fourthly, That they muſt believe the Goſpel. Fifthly, That all who thus repent and believe, are juſtified; that is, pardoned and accepted of God. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That all who are thus pardoned, ought to love God with all their hearts, mind, ſoul, and ſtrength. Seventhly, That he that loves God, ought to love his brother alſo: yea, that he ought to love his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour (every man, friend and enemy) as himſelf. Eighthly, That all who thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and love, ought to be careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good works. Ninthly, That every Chriſtian ought to endeavour to be holy in all manner of converſation, as he who hath called him is holy. Tenthly, That while
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028549_0020_0FD940887B6667D8"/>
they are in this world, they ought to grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Eleventhly, That he that endures unto the end the ſame ſhall be ſaved. Twelfthly, That they who have thus done good, ſhall go to the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Life; but they that have done evil, to the Reſurrection of Damnation.</p>
            <p>Now I appeal to every one who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the doctrine of the Method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, if this is not the ſum thereof: if the particulars above mentioned, are not the points chiefly inſiſted on both among Mr. Weſley's and Mr. Whitefield's followers. If ſo, I ſhall be glad to know if there is any tendency in theſe doctrines, whether taken ſeparately, or in conjunction with each other, to do evil. Has that which teaches the fall and actual wickedneſs of man? Does it not rather tend to humble him? Has the doctrine of the atonement? What! the doctrine which points out the love of God in giving his Son to ſave us from our ſins? Has the doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which teaches us to be ſorry for our ſins, and that we ſhould immediately forſake them, ſuch a tendency? Is there any tendency to evil in the doctrine of faith: which inſiſts on our coming to Chriſt for the ſalvation he has purchaſed for us? Has the doctrine of juſtification, of pardon
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028549_0021_0FD9408EB0514EF8"/>
and adoption for every penitent believer, any tendency to do evil? Or theſe which teach that we ought to love God with all our heart, and our neighbour as ourſelves? Or thoſe which inculcate the neceſſity of good works, of growing in grace, of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal holineſs, of perſeverance in the ways of God, or of eternal rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? I ſay, is there any thing that bears the ſmalleſt reſemblance of a tendency to do evil in any of theſe?</p>
            <p>But has not their diſcipline done evil? Let us examine this point with candor and impartiality. The ſubſtance of their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is as follows: Firſt, No perſon is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their ſocieties who is known to live in open ſin. Secondly, When admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he is required to hear, read, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the word of God as frequently as he can. Thirdly, Each member is expected to pray, in public, in his family, and in private. Fourthly, He muſt aſſemble with his brethren, for mutual edification, at every ſtated opportunity, if health and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs will admit. Fifthly, He is expected to receive the ſupper of the Lord at every proper opportunity: Sixthly, It is alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of him to uſe faſting or abſtinence, as often as health, buſineſs and opportunity ſerve. Seventhly, It is moreover required of him to be merciful after his power to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028549_0022_0FD940906D7BEBC0"/>
the bodies and ſouls of men. Eighthly, In order to this end, It is expected that he be not ſlothful in buſineſs; but rather work with his hands, the things that are right, that he may owe no man any thing; that he may provide, for himſelf and family, things lawful in the ſight of all men; and have to give to him that needeth. Ninthly, It is required of him to ſhew a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to all men, that the Goſpel be not blamed. Now this is the ſubſtance of the Methodiſt diſcipline, which certainly (to ſay no more at preſent) can have no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to do evil.</p>
            <p>But if they have not done evil, what have they done? I anſwer, They have done much good. But what good have they done? Spiritual and temporal good. And, firſt, they have done ſpiritual good. For firſt they have been inſtruments in turning the moſt ignorant, vulgar, and ridiculous ſinners from darkneſs to light. Multitudes who, before they heard the Methodiſts, knew neither themſelves nor God, are now well acquainted with both. As to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they know that they were ſhapen in iniquity, and that in ſin did their mother conceive them. They know that on that account their heart is deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked. In other words, they know that they have in them
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028549_0023_0FD940923A870458"/>
a carnal mind which is enmity againſt God, which is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be—till it is renewed. They know alſo that this evil nature is the ſource from whence all outward wickedneſs proceeds; that it is this fountain which ſends forth all the corrupt ſtreams of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſin. Again, they know as all men are ſinners by nature and practice, that they are condemned already, that the wrath of God <hi>now</hi> abideth on them. Again, they know that this ſtate of ſin and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an infallible ſource of preſent miſery: that it is on this account the wicked are like the troubled ſea which cannot reſt, whoſe waves caſt up mire and dirt; that deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—eternal deſtruction, and miſery—pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſery are in their path, and that the way of peace they have not known. Once more, They know that they cannot ſave themſelves, that they cannot bring a clean thing out of an unclean, that they cannot make themſelves new creatures, and that if it is not done in time, they cannot be holy or happy here, much leſs ſaved to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>And as for God, They know that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of thoſe that diligently ſeek him. They know that in Him they live, and move, and have their being. They know that God was in Chriſt
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028549_0024_0FD94095F5A1E390"/>
reconciling the world unto himſelf, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their treſpaſſes unto them. They know that God commandeth all men every where to repent, and alſo to believe the Goſpel. They know that all who do this are juſtified and born of God. They know that all ſuch have the kingdom of God within them, even righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. They know that from this inward principle, all good works, yea, all holineſs and happineſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. And they know that this inward and outward religion is the gift of God: that it comes <hi>from</hi> the Father, <hi>through</hi> the Son, <hi>by</hi> the Holy Ghoſt; and that therefore all the praiſe belongs to Him in Time and Eternity.</p>
            <p>If any one doubt, of their having this knowledge, he may ſoon ſatisfy himſelf: only let him go into any city, town or vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, where Methodiſm has prevailed, and enquire firſt, what ſort of people the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts formerly were, with reſpect to knowledge; and then let him converſe with them a ſingle hour on any of the above particulars, and he will doubt no longer.</p>
            <p>Again, As the Methodiſts have turned many from darkneſs to light, ſo alſo, have they from the power of Satan unto God. Surely, if ever any were taken captive by the devil at his will, many of theſe were in
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028549_0025_0FD9409771F713A0"/>
a very high degree. It is dreadful to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what ſlaves to ſin, and what enemies to all that is good, multitudes of them were: what pride, paſſion, and evil deſires: and what luſt, cruelty, and injuſtice, filled, and governed their hearts. And from this corrupt fountain iſſued forth abundance of polluted ſtreams: on this evil tree grew a large quantity of evil fruit, ſuch as drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, whoredom, curſing, ſwearing, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fighting, thieving, ſabbath-breaking, gaming, extortion, oppreſſion and the like. But by hearing the Methodiſts, the Lions became Lambs: the proud became humble, the paſſionate became meek and gentle, the unclean became chaſte, the cruel became merciful, and the unjuſt became honeſt. And being thus inwardly reformed, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and converted, they became new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their outward behaviour. Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, uncleanneſs, and lying, gave place to ſobriety, chaſtity, and truth. The mouths that formerly were filled with oaths, curſes and blaſphemies, were filled with prayer and praiſe. The ſabbaths that were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken and profaned, were now employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſervice of God. The time which was once ſpent in gaming, idleneſs, and vain amuſements, was now improved in reading, and holy meditation. And in the place of ſighting, cruelty, fraud and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028549_0026_0FD94099CDE966C0"/>
there was juſtice, mercy, and every good work.</p>
            <p>Now that the Methodiſts have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in thus reforming multitudes, is too notorious to be denied; yet if any doubt of it, let them go to Kingſwood, and Cornwall; let them go to Newcaſtle, Coleford, Wedneſbury, and Whitehaven; let them go to Leeds, Sheffield, Mancheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Liverpool; let them go to Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham, Wolverhampton, and Cheſter; let them go to Norwich, Bath and Briſtol: nay, let them only go to the moſt wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts of this metropolis, and they will ſoon find abundant proof of all I have aſſerted; they will ſoon be fully ſatisfied, that multitudes in theſe places, who were once the reproach of Chriſtianity, the peſts of ſociety, the plagues of their neighbours, the curſe of their families, and a ſcandal to human nature; are now ſober, holy, chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They have done Temporal good. Before the perſons above referred to, heard the Methodiſts, many of them were in a ſtate of deplorable poverty and wretchedneſs: having neither food to eat, nor raiment to put on; nor always ſo much as a little clean ſtraw to lie on. At the ſame time they were ſo deeply in debt, and ſo far from any likelihood of paying it,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028549_0027_0FD940A1ABBB9268"/>
that they had quite loſt their credit: and had it not been for the humanity of their neighbours, and the ſcanty proviſion made for them by the laws of their country, they and their families muſt have periſhed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. As this was owing, partly to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and partly to drunkenneſs, gaming, and other extravagancies; on hearing the Methodiſts, and becoming earneſt in the work of their ſalvation, there was an end of all theſe evils. The conſequence was, they ſoon got food for themſelves and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: next a little plain, decent apparel; then a little neceſſary furniture. Having thus procured a few neceſſaries, they began to pay their debts, and after awhile they owed no man any thing. Going on in the way of virtue, they continued to uſe all diligence and frugality. By theſe means, they were enabled to procure things a little more comfortable for themſelves, and now and then to ſpare a little to the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous. By ſtill continuing to uſe all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and frugality, they were enabled to enlarge their bounty. At length, having it in their power, they began to do good unto all men, eſpecially unto the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of faith. Nor did they overlook that word, Lend to him that would borrow of thee; for when it was proper and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they were now as willing to lend, as
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028549_0028_0FD940A2B27407E8"/>
they were formerly to borrow of others. Still going on in the good way, they were ſoon able to lay by a little for future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies. To this they added a little more: till at laſt many of them became poſſeſſed of hundreds, and ſome of them of many thouſands. Now as theſe are facts which cannot be denied, I conclude that the Methodiſts have done both Spiritual and Temporal good.</p>
            <p>But, Secondly, what is the Extent of this good? What is the Number of thoſe who have been thus benefited by Methodiſm? To aſcertain the exact number is impoſſible to any child of man. None but God, who knoweth all things, can do this. All that we can do is, by a general calculation, to come as near the truth of the matter as poſſible. And in order to this end, I ſhall obſerve, Firſt, That there are above Ninety<note n="*" place="bottom">Since the time of this debate, many thouſands have been added to the Methodiſt Societies both in Europe and America.</note> Thouſand members at this time in the different Societies under Mr. Weſley's care and we cannot ſuppoſe there are leſs than Ten<note n="†" place="bottom">One reaſon of the great diſproportion between the above number is, Mr. Whitefield never thought it his duty to eſtabliſh ſocieties wherever he preached, as Mr. Weſley did; nor, of courſe, to encourage ſo many preachers.</note> Thouſand in the Societies inſtituted
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028549_0029_0FD940A4483378D8"/>
by the late Mr. Whitefield: in all, about a Hundred Thouſand. Secondly, let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that in the long ſpace of fifty or ſixty years, there could not be leſs than a Hundred Thouſand more, who from time to time, have formerly been members of theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties: multitudes of whom have yearly been going to God; multitudes more who have continually been joining other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Societies; and vaſt numbers who after enduring for awhile, went back into the world. Now very few, if any of theſe were ſuffered to become Members of theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, without evident marks of having received ſome benefit by firſt hearing the word: they were at leaſt, a little enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and at the ſame time thoroughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their outward behaviour. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the far greater part of them experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced a much deeper work; being more deeply awakened, and made much more in earneſt for their ſalvation. Here then are Two Hundred Thouſand ſouls who have received good (ſome in one degree, and others in another) by means of Method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.</p>
            <p>Again, Thoſe who are conſtant and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent hearers of the Methodiſts, in town and country are (taking one place with another) about five times as many as thoſe who are members of the Societies. Now
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028549_0030_0FD940AB2393D960"/>
theſe, one with another, have heard the Methodiſts about twice a week. And we cannot ſuppoſe that they have ſo often heard that word which was made ſo great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to others, without receiving ſome bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves. Indeed many of them have received very material good, as their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral behaviour abundantly ſhews. And as to the reſt, if they were only enlightened and reformed a little, this, certainly is ſome good. Now when theſe are added to the former number, they make in all about Twelve Hundred Thouſand ſouls.</p>
            <p>Add to theſe ſuch us have been occaſional hearers; and thoſe who have frequently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited Methodiſt families, where religious worſhip, and Chriſtian converſation are kept up; and thoſe who have laboured or travelled with zealous Methodiſts, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fallen into company with them, and have been inſtructed, exhorted, warned and admoniſhed by them, here muſt be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of very many thouſands more to whom they have been of uſe.</p>
            <p>Again, Suppoſe there has been only a ſingle Methodiſt in a family, and two or three in a neighbourhood, twenty or thirty in a country village, two or three hundred in a large trading town, and three or four times that number in a city; if each of theſe has been as a city upon a hill which
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028549_0031_0FD940ACF5A8F428"/>
cannot be hid, and as a candle upon a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick which gives light to all in the houſe, Thouſands, Tens of Thouſands, Hundreds of Thouſands, who have ſeen their good works, muſt, ſooner or later, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or other be benefited thereby.</p>
            <p>Again, There have been (and ſtill are) many holy, uſeful miniſters, both in the Church of England, and among the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſorts of Diſſenters, whoſe religion (and conſequently their uſefulneſs) originated with the Methodiſts. Now as theſe have frequently been of uſe in enlightening, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, and converting ſinners, this muſt (under God) be attributed to the Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts. For in all likelihood, if theſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters had never heard the Methodiſts, they would not have been converted; and if they had not been converted, they had never been inſtrumental in doing the good they have; of conſequence the main of their uſefulneſs, if not every tittle of it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Methodiſts.</p>
            <p>Again, In the courſe of fifty years many religious books have been publiſhed by the Methodiſts, and others who ſprung from them. Now as theſe in general are not only argumentative, but likewiſe plain, practical, and perſuaſive; they have been of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervice to multitudes. And as it has often happened that they have fallen into
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028549_0032_0FD940AE078CE068"/>
the hands of a great variety of perſons, at home and abroad, who never heard the Methodiſts, or converſed with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have reaſon to believe, both from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the books, and from the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects we have known them to have had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, that many of theſe have been much benefited by reading them. Nor is this mere conjecture; for we have known many inſtances even of perſons of character who have been very materially benefited by reading Mr. Weſley's Appeals, Sermons, and various other Tracts.</p>
            <p>Again, We all know that in St. Paul's days there was thoſe who preached Chriſt out of contention, and that the apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced therein; not doubting but good was done thereby. In like manner, when the Methodiſts made a noiſe in the world, many of the Clergy began to beſtir themſelves, and took much more pains both in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and living. Nor is this mere imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for we have known many inſtances of this kind in every part of the three king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. Now as we muſt believe that much good has been done, even by this means, and as we are certain that Methodiſm gave occaſion to it; we muſt view it as a farther diſplay of the good the Methodiſts have done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:028549_0033_0FD940B33444E3D0"/>Once more, He who ſays a firm founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereon to build a ſtately edifice, or plants a large vineyard, which promiſes a fruitful vintage, or ſows an extenſive field which almoſt aſſures us of a plentiful har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt; certainly does good. Now all this the Methodiſts have done. They have laid ſuch a firm foundation; they have planted ſuch a large vineyard; they have cultivated and ſown ſo wide a field; by enlightening, reforming, and converting ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and tens of Thouſands, that if they go on, as hitherto they have done, ages unborn, and nations who never yet ſo much as heard of their name, will bleſs God in Time and Eternity, that ſuch a people ever exiſted.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that the Methodiſts have been inſtrumental in doing Spiritual and Temporal good, in a higher or lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to Thouſands of Thouſands; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have laid a broad and firm found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for a much greater work in futurity; I conclude that they have done Good, and not Evil; and that they have done it in a moſt marvellous degree.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may be worth while to ſubjoin a few ſhort anſwers to ſeveral objections urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Methodiſts on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It has been ſaid, "They are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts, in pretending to receive the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028549_0034_0FD940B707D54790"/>
and to be influenced thereby." I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, They make no pretence but to the ordinary operations of the Spirit: which is nothing more than what every Chriſtian Church under the heavens does, in its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, Articles, Creed, Catechiſms and Confeſſions: particularly, the Church of England, Scotland, and Ireland; with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body of Diſſenters in theſe lands. If then the Methodiſts are Enthuſiaſts on this account, ſo alſo is the whole Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It was ſaid, "They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, in confining Salvation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves." To this I anſwer, They do no ſuch thing. What they believe, and ſay, is this: every one that repents of his ſins, believes in Chriſt, and loves God and his neighbour, will be ſaved, whatever Church he is of. And on the other hand, he that does not thus repent, believe, and love, he, and he only, they ſay will be damned. All the clamour, therefore, concerning the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs of the Methodiſts, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their confining ſalvation to themſelves, and damning all beſides, is mere Slander and Abuſe, as every one knows who has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It was ſaid, "There are very wicked perſons among them." I anſwer, There never was a Chriſtian church on earth,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028549_0035_0FD940B8F234BCC8"/>
conſiſting of fifty members, who ſooner or later, had not thoſe among them who did not adorn their profeſſion. In the Apoſtles' time they had Spots in their feaſts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and even among the Twelve, who were in the cloſeſt connexion with our Lord, there was one who had a devil. It would be ſtrange, therefore if in a body conſiſting of a Hundred Thouſand members, there ſhould be none who walked in a diſorderly manner. But ſuppoſe there were fifty that did ſo, this would not be enough to crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the whole body, ſeeing ſuch are in no wiſe allowed among them. For when a perſon of that ſort is diſcovered, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reclaim him, they cut him off as a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered branch, according to the word of Chriſt, and the example of his Apoſtles. If he repent they receive him again; if not, he is no more admitted into their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. Now here I aſk, Does every Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church under the heavens do this? Do thoſe in Great Britain and Ireland? If not, with what face can thoſe who do it not, find fault with the Methodiſts in this reſpect.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It has been ſaid, "They make uſe of very uncouth and abſurd expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions." I anſwer, Perhaps they ſometimes may. And is this to be wondered at? Would it not rather be a wonder, if every
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028549_0036_0FD940BCA2EECF60"/>
member of ſuch a community ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expreſs himſelf with the utmoſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy? Was ſuch a thing ever known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong any other people? "But the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers themſelves uſe uncouth expreſſions." Perhaps they may, and perhaps they may not. It has ſometimes happened that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couthneſs was in the ears of thoſe who heard them. For though St. Paul had been ſpeaking the words of Truth and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſs, ſo uncouth were the ears of Feſtus, that he cried out, Paul! thou art beſide thyſelf; much learning hath made thee mad. And though the Son of God had been ſpeaking as never man ſpoke, yet ſome who heard him, and thoſe too of the moſt reputable ſort, ſaid, He is mad and hath a devil; why hear ye him? "But there are abſurd expreſſions in the Methodiſt-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings." I anſwer, Was there ever a Book written wherein an evil eye could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover an abſurdity? Is even the book of God free in this reſpect? Rather have not the infidels of all ages beheld it as nothing but a heap of Abſurdities and Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! What wonder then if the Methodiſt-writings are viewed in the ſame unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able light?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is objected; that, "They are divided among themſelves, and often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn each other with great ſeverity." I
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028549_0037_0FD940BE76109380"/>
anſwer, Then this is one argument in their favour. For it proves that they are ſo far honeſt men, as not to be in league to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the world. But they are not divided in any thing eſſential. They are perfectly agreed, That the whole world lieth in wickedneſs: that God commandeth all men every where to repent: that there is ſalvation in none but Chriſt: that all who believe are juſtified, and have peace with God: that all ſuch ought to love God and their neighbour; and to rejoice evermore, pray without ceaſing, and in every thing give thanks; and to be holy in heart, and in life. "But ſome of them are Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and others Calviniſts." This is very true. The followers of Mr. Weſley are, in general, Arminians; and the followers of the late Mr Whitefield are, in general, Calviniſts. But what for that! Is ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion any thing new or extraordinary? Was there not, at leaſt ſince the days of St. Auſtin, a mixture of thoſe who are now called Calviniſts and Arminians, I will not ſay, in every Chriſtian nation, or Chriſtian city; but in every Chriſtian congregation of any note? Is it not ſo now all over Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, Ireland, Holland, France, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, America, and in the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies? If ſo, where is the harm if ſuch a diviſion
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028549_0038_0FD940C174E3E6D8"/>
is ſound among the Methodiſts? "But they bitterly condemn each other." I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Sometimes they do; but not in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. And if they did it oftener, it would be no wonder, ſeeing ſo great a majority of mankind are incapable of viewing any point with liberality and candour. This frailty of human nature, has been matter of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to candid men in every age and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but not more ſo than to thouſands of both parties which conſtitute "The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts."</p>
            <p>Sixthly, It is ſaid, "The teachers of Methodiſm are a company of illiterate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics." I anſwer, They are not more illiterate than the Prophets and Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are not more illiterate than the teachers of various other denominations; ſuch as the Quakers, Anabaptiſts, Moravians, and ſome Independents: they are not more illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate than ſome who have been ordained miniſters of the Church of England, who did not ſo much as know a Verb from a Noun: particularly the Rev. Mr. T. who was originally a Merry-andrew, then a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, then a Prieſt, then a Juſtice of the Peace, if not of the Quorum!</p>
            <p>Again, They are not more illiterate, or more ignorant of the laws of God, than Thouſands of Magiſtrates are of the laws of their country: particularly than multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028549_0039_0FD940C75C1F91D8"/>
of Mayors and Aldermen, who have the care, not only of our corporate towns, but even of our Cities! Now if an illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Magiſtrate, by looking into the Statute-Laws, can tell what is legal and illegal; what pains and puniſhments belong to evil-doers, and what praiſe to them that do well; why may not a Methodiſt teacher (ſuppoſe he is equally illiterate) by looking into the Laws of God, tell what is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, on the one hand, and what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden on the other; and alſo what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments belong to obedience and diſobedience? And if he <hi>declares</hi> what theſe rewards and puniſhments are, and adds warnings, inſtructions and exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this is nothing more than what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly done, by every illiterate Magiſtrate in the world.</p>
            <p>Again, They are not more illiterate than myrrads of thoſe who are heads of families, who are ſuppoſed to be able to inſtruct all under their care, in the duties they owe to God, their neighbours and one another; and to make uſe of arguments, warnings, and exhortations, to engage their whole houſehold to love and fear God, and live in obedience to the king, and in love and charity with their neighbours. Now if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very maſter of a family is ſuppoſed (without the help of a univerſity education) to be
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028549_0040_0FD940C840857410"/>
capable of doing this; why may we not ſuppoſe a Methodiſt teacher capable of doing the ſame, when Five, Ten, Twenty or Fifty families are met together?</p>
            <p>But after all this noiſe about their illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, it is well known there have been men of very conſiderable learning among them from the beginning: men who have had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular education, and who have acquired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable renown, even in our univerſities. There have alſo been others, who in the courſe of thirty or forty years, have made themſelves well acquainted with the learned languages; with polemical and practical divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and with various other arts and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And as for the reſt, ſeeing they have been wiſe to win ſouls, they need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard who clamours againſt them; as he is the beſt Phyſician who performs the moſt cures.</p>
            <p>But, "They are mechanics." So were Kings and Prophets, under the law; ſo was Chriſt and his Apoſtles, under the Goſpel; ſo were Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons in former times; and ſo were many who now bear ſome of the higheſt offices, both in Church and State. If then it is no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe that they were once mechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics; where is the Candour? Where is the Juſtice of urging it againſt the Methodiſts? Eſpecially as it is no where ſaid in the Bible,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028549_0041_0FD940C9C73D5138"/>
that every preacher of the Goſpel muſt be a fine Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, "But the teachers of Method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm are idle, mercenary men." I anſwer, As they generally ride, through all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, three, four, and ſometimes five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles a year; and, in that time preach, with all their might, five, ſix, ſeven or eight hundred ſermons; beſides giving near as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny public exhortations, viſiting the ſick, and ſpeaking to every member under their care, four or five times a year; writing letters, and enforcing every other part of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſt diſcipline; it is impoſſible they ſhould be idle. On the other hand, I know from long experience, that there are few ways of life attended with more fatigue, and ſo likely to deſtroy a good conſtitution, as that of a preacher among the Method<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts. I myſelf have often been ſo wearied with the labours of a ſingle Sabbath, that I could ſcarce ſleep at all the firſt night, but imperfectly the ſecond, and not ſoundly till the third. Now I aſk every impartial man, if this is a life of Idleneſs, whoſe is a life of Labour? whoſe is a life of Toil?</p>
            <p>But, "They are mercenary: their aim is only to enrich themſelves." I anſwer, if this was really their aim, never were men more diſappointed. For I defy any man living to ſhew ſo much as a ſingle preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028549_0042_0FD940CDE377ECF0"/>
who has enriched himſelf, even by preaching for the long ſpace of forty or fifty years. It is true, a few of them (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one in ten) have got a little by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, though perhaps, not a quarter, or a tenth part of what they would have done, had they ſtaid at home. And as to the reſt, it is known to thouſands, that they never aimed at more than a ſcanty allowance to provide plain food and raiment for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and if they got it (which was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the caſe) they were therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>And as a farther proof of their not being mercenary men, I add, had they been ſuch, would God have owned their labours as he has done? Was it ever known, from the beginning of the world, that impoſtors and deceivers turned thouſands upon thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands from the evil of their way? Did any of this ſort ever go, with their lives in their hands, to the moſt ignorant, daring, and ſavage people; and ſo preach Chriſt to them, as to conſtrain them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all their ſins, to turn to God with full purpoſe of heart, and to walk in the narrow way, the way of holineſs, to their lives end? Yet all this have the Teachers of Methodiſm been doing for forty or fifty years together, in the face of the ſun; and all this they ſtill continue to do with unremitted zeal, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028549_0043_0FD940D204F50EE8"/>
the many obſtacles which are thrown in their way. We muſt therefore conclude that they are not a ſet of deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but holy and diſintereſted men, ſent of God to reform a guilty generation.</p>
