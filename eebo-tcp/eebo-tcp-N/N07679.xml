            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SOME Perſons, of good Character, at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> having applied to his Excellency the Governor, for his Licence for ſome <hi>Indians,</hi> who have been always in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, to reſide in your Town, he has been pleaſed to grant his Licence, and the Protection of this Government, by his Order of this Day, directed to all Officers civil and military.</p>
            <p>The late Outrage committed in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> is ſuch a notorious Violation of the Rights of Government, and a Crime of ſo black a Dye, that I have not the leaſt Doubt but that the Perpetrators of it will, in good time, ſuffer the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Law inflicts upon Murderers; for altho' their Conſciences may be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, or they at preſent in a State of Infatuation, yet the Time muſt come when theſe Heats will ſubſide, and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009809_0003_0F7A552C001A8128"/>ſtand on a right Footing, then theſe Tranſactions muſt be enquired into; and would any Man in his Senſes have ſuch a Cloud hanging over him and his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, which would, by his own Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, be ſubjected to large Demands and Forfeitures to the Crown?</p>
            <p>To have fallen on a Town of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy <hi>Indians,</hi> and to have deſtroyed them and it, might have terrified the <hi>Indians,</hi> and leſſened the Number of our Enemies; but ſuch an inhuman Murder as that at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> can only ſerve to convince the World, that there are among us Perſons more ſavage than <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves. To be cruel in War, and while the Blood is in a high Ferment, is frequent; but to aſſemble at a Diſtance, to march many Miles with Intent, in cool Blood, to butcher defenceleſs People, who were placed where the Magiſtracy pleaſed to order them, was an amazing Depravation of every Senſe of Virtue and Humanity.</p>
            <p>Would Wars ever have an End, if every Perſon who had loſt a Relative in it ſhould exerciſe his own Judgment, and take away the Life of any Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009809_0004_0F7A552D4BDEE120"/>of the Nation they had been at War with, whenever (after a Peace) he ſhould have Strength ſo to do?</p>
            <p>Weak Minds are apt to be in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Manner inflamed, and get into violent Ferments, on reading an Article in the Gazette of a few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being deſtroyed by <hi>Indians;</hi> and yet theſe very Perſons will with little or no Emotion, run over an Article of a Battle between two Armies, where Thouſands fell on a Side. They get heated by the Mode of War, though it is of little Conſequence whether the Scalp or Finger of a dead Corpſe is tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en off as a token of Victory, or how many Wounds it has. As a free Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Indians</hi> have the ſame Right to go to War, as any other Nation. When they become Subjects, they have the ſame Right of living on Lands of their own, or of other People's, by the Owner's Permiſſion. If they remove from one Place to another, the Overſeers of the Poor may demand the uſual Security, and the Magiſtrates deal with them as with others, for Miſbehaviour.</p>
            <p>I know of no Law to oblige them to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009809_0005_0F7A552DF4A2AF88"/>remove from one Place to another; while they comply with the Laws in Force, their Treatment ought to be the ſame with other Subjects in like Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; their Perſons and Effects equally claim the Protection of the Laws; and to murder or aſſault one of them, is a Crime equal to the doing of the ſame to another of His Majeſty's Subjects, the Colour of the Skin can make no eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Difference; to have a yellow one in the preſent Circumſtances, may be a Misfortune, but not a Crime. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the <hi>Lancaſter</hi> Maſſacre has raiſed in me a very high Reſentment; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Indians</hi> may have done trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheroſly, I really think this Act, and the deſtroying in cool Blood three <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Guides, who undertook to pilot the <hi>Paxton</hi> Voluntiers (who were ſtarving when they met with them) to <hi>Fort-Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and by whoſe Aſſiſtance the whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were undoubtedly ſaved from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Famine; to deſtroy theſe Perſons, who, at their Intreaty, had done them ſuch eminent Service, and ſaved their Lives, equals any thing we have met with; nor can any Perſon ſhow that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:009809_0006_0F7A552EC126E818"/>have ever done worſe; if they have, it has never come to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Perſons who thirſt after the Blood of <hi>Indians,</hi> ſhould go to the Seat of War to ſhew their Courage. If there were no Crime in it, nothing that would ſubject them to Puniſhment, no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of Eſtate, yet there is ſomething ſo very mean in attempting the Lives of a wretched People who have voluntarily thrown themſelves into your Power, that no Man of real Courage or Bravery would bear the Thought of doing it. Many of the <hi>Indians</hi> have been very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us, and ſtill may be ſo. The Nations far back, and whoſe Intercourſe have been chiefly, if not totally with the <hi>French,</hi> have been by them perſwaded to enter into a War; and is this to be wondered at, that they ſhould believe the People they had long traded with, and been long allied to? We ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admire their Conſtancy to their old Friends; and have we not Reaſon from thence to conclude, that when they know us, and a Peace is firmly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between us and them, they will be as firm and conſtant in their Friendſhip
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009809_0007_0F7A552FA3761060"/>to us as they have been to the <hi>French.</hi> To conſider them in a true Light, we ſhould recollect, that on this Continent their Numbers are very great; that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Individual will purchaſe ſome Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufacture; that it is Trade only that enables <hi>Britain</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Armies, and ſend forth Fleets, which terrify the World, and raiſes the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Name in the moſt diſtant Parts of the Univerſe; and the <hi>Indians</hi> will (as ſoon as they are undeceived, and Peace is eſtabliſhed with them) make us Maſters of the moſt valuable Trade for Furs and Peltry in the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by contribute to the Riches and Glory of the Nation.</p>
            <p>There are People ſo ſanguine that, without conſidering, would wiſh the whole Race of <hi>Indians</hi> extinct, but they ſhew their Ignorance of the real Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Nation; they would have us ſet about deſtroying them Root and Branch—It needs but little Reflection to convince them, that while ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Tracts of Land lie to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſuch Attempt is vain, nor would all the Forces that have laſt War
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009809_0008_0F7A55305306E920"/>taken the Field in <hi>Europe</hi> effect it. I ſhould join heartily with the moſt forward to make the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions we could into their Country, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no more Slaughter there, than to bring them to a juſt Senſe of their Miſconduct, and make them, for the future, dread our Reſentment, and learn to know that it was their real Intereſt to behave friendly to us, and cultivate our Regard for them. Things will, I think, clearly appear in this Light to any Perſon who will coolly and deliberately conſider the Matter devoid of Paſſion or of Prejudice.</p>
            <p>There muſt be many now in your Country, who have heard their Anceſtors recount the Kindneſs with which the <hi>Indians</hi> treated them when it was in their Power to have deſtroyed the whole Number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Settlers in a Day. They then fed them, and gave them all Kind of friendly Aſſiſtance; I hope their Deſcendants will now let Humanity, let Chriſtianity prevail over them to return the Kindneſs, and not ſay to the Charge of theſe poor diſtreſſed People the Actions of the remote Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> to whom they are as much Strangers as we are. When the Treachery of the <hi>Indians</hi> is repreſented, Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces bad in themſelves may be exaggerated (tho' I have no Doubt but too much is true) I beg you will guard your Neighbours againſt taking up Tales they may hear of theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> which, when enquired into, may be found without any Foundation; if they miſbehave, the Mgiſtrates can puniſh them; therefore I cannot ſuppoſe that any will be ſo impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by any Conduct of their own, to involve the Government into Difficulty, and themſelves in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vietable Ruin.</p>
