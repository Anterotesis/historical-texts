            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>COLOSSIANS, CHAP. I. VER. 19.</bibl>
               <q>For it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN ſome preceding verſes of this chapter, St. Paul deſcribes the perſonal excellency and dignity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his divine nature, and as the creator of the univerſe: <q>Who is the image of the inviſible God, the firſt born of every creature: by whom were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him: he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt.</q> In the 18th verſe, he conſiders the excellency of Chriſt's offices in the human nature, which he aſſumed into perſonal union with himſelf, not only as the political head of direction, authority and government, but alſo of vital influences, to communicate all ſpiritual life, nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, growth, and activity to every member of the church, "which is his body." The more evidently to ſhew his ſufficiency for theſe glorious purpoſes, it is added in the words of our text, <q>For it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</q> The word <hi>Father</hi> is not in the original, and perhaps the paſſage may be juſtly paraphraſed thus: For it is the reſult of eternal counſel, that correſpondent to the excellency of Chriſt's divine perſon, and the greatneſs of his mediatorial work, he ſhould poſſe<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s all fulneſs of gifts and qualifications, to render him a ſaviour worthy of the moſt unreſerved and perfect reliance of believers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:020416_0004_0FAF04986C124D88"/>
It is certainly, among many others, a very powerful ſupport of our confidence in the redeemer, that he exerciſes none of his offices, but under the ſeal of divine appointment. The whole ſcheme of ſalvation is a device of infinite wiſdom: and Chriſt, the great high prieſt of the new covenant is, accordingly, choſen from all eternity, to fulfil the gracious offices which he exerciſes in the recovery of ſinners, and in accompliſhing their reconciliation to God.</p>
            <p>From all eternity he was the <q>elect of God, in whom his ſoul delighteth; his ſervant whom he upholdeth, upon whom he putteth his ſpirit, that he might ſhew judgment to the Gentiles. He was ſet up from everlaſting,—from the beginning, or ever the earth was: and he glorified not himſelf, to be made an high prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, Thou art my ſon, to day have I begotten thee.</q> And ſo in the text Chriſt is not ſelf-exalted in the all-ſufficiency which is committed to him as the head of the church; but by the decree of eternal wiſdom it is determined, that in "him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</p>
            <p>As ſome of the moſt illuſtrious diſplays of this fulneſs are exhibited in the ſpreading and eſtabliſhment of the goſpel, in the enlarging of the borders of Zion, and in extending the means for bringing men to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſalvation, it will be a proper ſubject of meditation on the preſent occaſion. In further treating of it, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew ſome of the moſt important reſpects in which all fulneſs dwelleth in Chriſt, and then to lead to the ſuitable application of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>1ſt. I am to point out ſome of the moſt important reſpects, in which all fulneſs dwelleth in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It may be neceſſary to obſerve here, that our text conſiders the Lord Jeſus only in his mediatorial character, and ſpeaks not of the fulneſs which is eſſential to his
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020416_0005_0FAF049A25E08C68"/>
divine nature, but of that which is communicated to him as Meſſiah. As God indeed, he is <q>over all bleſſed forever,</q> and by reaſon of the union of his two natures, <q>all the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily.</q> The eſſential perfections of deity are, in this reſpect, the ſame in him as in the Father and the Holy Ghoſt: not depending on the divine decree, but co-eſſential with his eternal exiſtence. For this reaſon <q>his name is called wonderful, counſellor, and the mighty God, as well as the prince of peace,—his throne is forever and forever: and he counted it not robbery to be equal with God, for he is the true God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In reſpect, therefore, to his divine nature, diſtinctly conſidered, Chriſt hath all the fulneſs of infinite being, glory, bleſſedneſs and perfection, independent and underived.</p>
            <p>But in his mediatorial offices, the ſcriptures repreſent him as receiving his qualifications according to, and in conſequence of the divine appointment. Agreeably to which he declares his authority to publiſh the glad tidings of ſalvation to guilty men: he claims it by virtue of the unction which he had received of the Father: <q>The ſpirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the goſpel to the poor: he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted; to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of ſight to the blind; to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed.</q> And when he teſtified the authority by which he fulfils all his offices in the character of the Meſſiah, he declared it not to be from himſelf, but by the direction of the Father: <q>I can of mine own ſelf do nothing: as I hear I judge, and my judgment is juſt, becauſe I ſeek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath ſent me.</q> Yet in the character of mediator, conſidered as a ſubordinate character, all,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020416_0006_0FAF049BF64A4508"/>
even infinite fulneſs is committed to Chriſt, to be employed by him in accompliſhing the purpoſes of infinite mercy; and this fulneſs is more particularly exerciſed and evidenced, in the</p>
            <p>1ſt place, in his almighty power:—It is a glory in Chriſt's character that he <q>is mighty to ſave—that he can ſave to the uttermoſt, them that come unto God by him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But barely to deliver the guilty from deſtruction, is not the utmoſt of that illuſtrious power which he poſſeſſeth; nor indeed is it the utmoſt that divine grace hath intended ſhould be exerciſed for them that believe. In the great ſcheme of redemption, the minuteſt circumſtances of the ſaints have been attended to, and all proviſion is made for them during a weariſome pilgrimage, as well as for their eternal ſafety. They are liable to no changes, either in ſpiritual or temporal concerns, which are not fully under the control of the great high prieſt and captain of their ſalvation: and for this purpoſe both nature and providence are ſubjected to his hand. In the days of his humiliation, he evidenced, in innumerable inſtances, the influence of his almighty power. The viſible and the inviſible creation lay proſtrate at his feet. He diſpoſed and directed all the human faculties, both of body and mind, at his pleaſure. The moſt inveterate diſeaſes yielded to his healing word. With caſe he arreſted the unruly elements, and bound or looſed them at his will. Death and the grave ſubmitted to his all-ſubduing dominion: and even apoſtate ſpirits, hardened in their rebellion, trembled and confeſſed his power. Nor was this only a temporary exerciſe of power, given to him as a teſtimony of his heavenly deſcent and miſſion; but after his reſurrection, when all that was neceſſary as a meritorious foundation for the redemption of his church was accompliſhed, he declared, for the everlaſting ſupport of his humble
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020416_0007_0FAF049D67E99B08"/>
followers, that all power was given to him in heaven and upon earth. And it is a conſideration demanding attention, that this declaration peculiarly relates to his offices as Meſſiah. All things are put under him, and he reigneth until he ſhall have put down all oppoſing rule, authority and power; until all his enemies are put under his feet: he is gone into the higheſt heavens, <q>and is on the right hand of God, having angels, authorities and powers made ſubject to him;</q> and he hath entered into this ſtate of exaltation, as head over all things to his church, to exerciſe a dominion for the benefit of his believing ſubjects. The ſun, moon and ſtars ſhine not but by his command—the revolving ſeaſons continue, and are productive or unfruitful, healthful or noxious, according to his ſovereign direction,—ſtates and empires flouriſh, or are extinguiſhed by his power alone. Nor is this all—the thoughts and actions of men are equally ſubjected to him: he ſucceeds or diſappoints the wiſdom of the prudent, as ſhall beſt anſwer the purpoſes of his own government—he turns the hidden and intricate counſels of the wicked into fooliſhneſs, and frequently cauſes their beſt concerted meaſures to operate againſt themſelves; while on the other hand, neither the want of abilities or influence in the agents he is pleaſed to employ, can prevent the ſucceſs of any of his deſigns. If it is neceſſary, <q>he will give them a mouth and wiſdom, which all their adverſaries ſhall not be able to gainſay nor reſiſt;</q> and if he chuſe it, <q>the weak things of the world ſhall confound the mighty, and the things which are not, bring to nought things which are.</q> In fine, whether he worketh by viſible inſtruments or without them, whatſoever his will determines in heaven, or upon earth, his hand is able to perform.</p>
            <p>But 2dly. Chriſt hath all fulneſs of authority as well as power. The plenitude of his power implies, indeed,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020416_0008_0FAF049E5DB3D220"/>
an authority to uſe it. It could not be a fulneſs of power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if circumſcribed in its exerciſe, by the leaſt degree of limitation. And when we conſider Chriſt's mediatorial power, we muſt always conceive of it not as it exiſts in him as an eſſential attribute of his divine nature, but as delegated to him for the ſpecial purpoſes for which he hath aſſumed the mediatorial character, which of conſequence includes authority; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly all thoſe paſſages which aſſert Chriſt's power as the Meſſiah ſpeak of it as a moral, and not a natural faculty; and the ſame word is uniformly uſed to expreſs it in the original, which is always uſed to ſignify his authority: thus when he ſaith, <q>I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again;</q> and when he declareth, that <q>the ſon of man hath power on earth to forgive ſins,</q> it is evident that it is the ſame as to ſay, I have authority to lay down my life and to take it again; and the ſon of man hath authority on earth to forgive ſins. And ſo when it is ſaid, "he taught them as one having authority;" and when the <q>chief prieſts and the elders aſked him, By what authority doeſt thou theſe things?</q> uſing the word in the above ſignification, we might read, he taught as one having power, and by what power doeſt thou theſe things? All authority then dwelleth in Chriſt; and not only is all juſt and equitable authority on earth derived from him, as by him kings reign and princes decree juſtice; but as king on the holy hill of Zion, the heavens as well as the earth are under his government—all the angels of God worſhip and obey him—the heavenly hoſts rejoice to do his pleaſure. And in the exerciſe of the ſame righteous dominion, he both governs the univerſe and gives laws to his church.—He appoints the ſtation of every individual of its members; directs their peculiar circumſtances while in their pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſtate; orders the meaſure of their trials, calling
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020416_0009_0FAF049E7B393970"/>
them forth, either to the ſpecial exerciſe of their faith, hope and patience, under adverſity and affliction; or of humility and thankfulneſs, in the experience of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing bounty. And he diſpenſes to all that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace and ſpiritual advantages which he determines to be beſt and moſt expedient for them. In like manner he hath inſtituted the means of grace, and appointed the ſeveral ordinances of the goſpel, for the regular and orderly worſhip of God; hath given the exact rule of faith, in all things that pertain to the glory of God, or the ſalvation of our ſouls; and preſcribed that rule of conduct, which is to be the guide of all our actions through the various changes of life. And finally, Chriſt will hereafter appear in all the glory of his authority, when, as ſovereign and righteous judge of all the earth, <q>he ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God;—when all the tribes of the earth ſhall ſee him coming in the clouds with power and great glory; and as the ſon of man he ſhall appear in his own glory, in the glory of the Father and of his holy angels;</q>—when by the authority he hath received, he ſhall fix the everlaſting condition of ſaints and ſinners; aſſigning to the one a crown of righteouſneſs, and receiving them to the kingdom of his Father; while the others ſhall go away into everlaſting fire.</p>
            <p>3d. Chriſt hath all fulneſs of wiſdom and grace. Omniſcience is his as God; and boundleſs wiſdom is given to him as mediator. It was a glorious prediction concerning him even in his lowly humiliation; <q>The ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the ſpirit of wiſdom and underſtanding, the ſpirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.</q> This prophecy was eminently fulfilled in the redeemer, who not only diſplayed the wiſdom and power of God in the qualifications of his perſon for the mediatorial offices,

but had all the treaſures of infinite wiſdom committed to him, as head of the church, for the uſe and benefit of the ſaints: and though its influence is often beyond their comprehenſion, and concealed from carnal minds, yet it is employed in conducting all the affairs of his kingdom, and all things that relate to their happineſs, either in the diſpenſation of his providence or grace. And as infinite grace is combined with his unſpeakable wiſdom; as he is ever touched with the feeling of our infirmities, and hath a ſympathy with his people under all their neceſſities, and under all their temptations, it is impoſſible that his power or authority ſhould ever be miſapplied. He is acquainted with the circumſtances of every individual believer; knows how, and is diſpoſed ſeaſonably to ſupply all their wants ſpiritual or temporal, and ſo to over-rule every occurrence of time to them, that at length they ſhall ſee how he hath cauſed light to ſhine out of the obſcureſt darkneſs; and that he is able to give them <q>the oil of joy for mourning, and the garments of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs</q> He diſcerns the ſtate of his church at large, and not only hath power and a gracious diſpoſition to build up its intereſts in the world, but hath wiſdom to direct all circumſtances relating to it; ſo that his children ſhall be gathered from all quarters of the globe, and none of them be left without the needful diſpenſations of his grace.</p>

               <p>Such, my brethren, is the fulneſs which dwelleth in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. You have this day an evidence of the gracious manner in which he condeſcends to exerciſe it, in his enabling you to open another houſe for the honor of his name. This building will indeed be a laſting monument of the zeal and aſſiduity of your
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020416_0011_0FAF04A002E59F78"/>
former paſtor, whoſe active mind firſt projected the plan, and with your concurrence, purſued it with unwearied application, until, by the convulſed ſtate of his country, he was interrupted in the deſign, and ſhortly after called from his labors here below into the joy of his Lord. Here, however, his memory ſhall long ſurvive and flouriſh; here new glories ſhall be added to the crown of his immortality, while angels rejoice over thoſe, who from time to time are called to repentance in this ſacred place; and here the name of TENNENT ſhall be handed down, with endearment, to your children's children, to the lateſt generations.</p>
               <p>Upon you the taſk devolved to finiſh the work, which at length you have thus far accompliſhed. Much credit is due to the cheerful piety you have expreſſed, in proſecuting an undertaking of ſuch utility; and with pleaſure I anticipate the days when you ſhall obtain a moſt grateful reward in the virtues of the riſing generation, who ſhall here be inſtructed in the living principles of religion. But, to thee, O bleſſed Jeſus! to thee we are indebted for the diſpoſition and ability thou haſt given thy ſervants to fulfil thy pleaſure. Of thy fulneſs have they received, and of thine own do they this day preſent an offering to thy name. Yes, my dear brethren! to Chriſt Jeſus do you owe the honor of all that you have been able to perform: and ſuffer me to remind you, that you are to depend upon him for all the benefits which you expect to ariſe from it in future. The means of grace with which you may be favored, are entirely at his diſpoſal, and the ſucceſs of them wholly reſts on his bleſſing. He ſaith to his ſervant go, and he goeth; and to another come, and he cometh. He walketh in the midſt of the golden candleſticks, his churches, to view their order, diſpoſition and neceſſities. He holdeth his miniſters in the right hand of his power, to place or diſplace them at his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020416_0012_0FAF04A100A1FCC0"/>
pleaſure. He ſheds his holy influence on their minds, and clothes them with light and ſalvation, that they may be the happy inſtruments of joy to his people:—or if his love be diſregarded, he turns away from his ungrateful ſubjects; and whatever outward means he may then leave them, they only ſerve, through their own perverſeneſs, to render them the more blinded and hardened. As therefore, through your care and liberality, this new temple is erected for the advancement of the goſpel, I flatter myſelf you will not forget its proſperity, in your daily ſupplications at the throne of grace. And, with the bleſſings that hereafter crown your devout intentions, may you ever be able to ſay, agreeably to the diſpoſition which I am perſuaded you now feel,—"Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name be the glory!"—</p>
               <p>And now permit me to conclude this diſcourſe, with a ſhort addreſs to ſuch of my hearers as expect to be of the congregation of ſtated worſhippers in this place. To you, my brethren, I hope the preſent occaſion will be the introduction to many happy days of goſpel opportunities, which you ſhall enjoy within theſe walls. Let it be your care to improve them, by a regular attendance, by diligently cultivating the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the goſpel in your own minds, and by a ſerious endeavour to reduce it to practice in your life and converſation. As a ſociety, ever ſtudy the things which make for peace; and let your moſt ardent emulation be to provoke unto love and good works. As indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, ſtrive to attain to the higheſt degrees of the chriſtian temper, not being forgetful hearers, but doers of the word; and evidencing, by a regular and decent deportment, that you mean not only to profeſs, but to lead a life of religion. Keep in view the example of Jeſus, the great apoſtle and high prieſt of your profeſſion, who hath left you an example that ye ſhould follow his
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020416_0013_0FAF04A19ABC3530"/>
ſteps; and ſtudy to know more and more of him, the knowledge of whom is life eternal, and to bring you to an acquaintance with whom is the proper end of all goſpel inſtitutions. We have now ſet out among you by proclaiming his adorable name, as the fountain of all power, authority, grace and wiſdom. I humbly hope you will make it a principal object of your future attention to know him as the author of redemption; and that thoſe doctrines will be moſt acceptable to your minds, which favour moſt of Jeſus. Though you do not in this walk in the faſhion of the wiſe of this world, you will find that Chriſt is the wiſdom of God and the power of God unto ſalvation to them that believe; while you experience the happy influence of a ſaving knowledge of his croſs on the temper and diſpoſition of your ſouls, in ſupporting your hope of immortality, in redeeming you from the pollutions of the world, in refining the ſentiments of your hearts, and in meetening you for the happineſs of the heavenly ſtate, to which you will finally be received, when the career of your attendance in the courts of God on earth ſhall be accompliſhed, and you ſhall know by happy experience, the efficacy of that infinite fulneſs, which dwelleth in the ever bleſſed Jeſus:</p>
               <trailer>To whom, with the Father and Holy Spirit, be glory, dominion and power for ever and ever. AMEN.</trailer>
