            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>FELLOW CITIZENS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE honour of being called to addreſs you on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſomewhat qualified by the conſideration, that the ſubject to which our thoughts are naturally directed, has been ſo often diſcuſsed, that no new argument can be advanced to gratify the ear of curioſity, and no additional luſtre given to thoſe which are already known, to render them more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to hearers of a refined taſte. But, diſadvantageous as this may be to the ſpeaker, it affords no ſufficient reaſon why we ſhould diſcontinue the celebration of this anniverſary. In the courſe of a year, many things occur, to wear away the impreſſions which former diſcourſes may have produced. The zeal which you felt at the commencement of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will gradually cool, unleſs renewed and revived by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preſenting to your view the objects by which it was at firſt excited. It is a circumſtance, too, highly encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that I am not ſent to you with heavy tidings, or deſired to make unwelcome demands upon your charity; but rather to thank you for your former liberality, to congratulate you on the ſucceſs with which your exertions have been attended, and to point out this inſtitution as an object of the firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the community, and as highly deſerving of your future patronage.</p>
            <p>Had I no other purpoſe in view but to intereſt your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in behalf of this eſtabliſhment, I need go no farther than the objects before you. You now behold one of the moſt pleaſing and affecting ſights which can be exhibited to the benevolent eye—the moſt magnificent edifice of the kind
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028369_0004_0FD8A5A16E413790"/>
of which the new world can boaſt, erected on a ſpot formerly barren and unprofitable, to ſhelter and protect thoſe tender plants whom misfortune and adverſity had left expoſed to every rude and noxious blaſt—more than one hundred of your fellow creatures, lately ſubject to poverty and want, and ready to fall victims to vice and ruin, happily reſcued by your generous interpoſition, and decently clothed, ſupported and educated by your bounty. <q>Deprived of every parental aid, you became their guardians; deſtitute of any abode, you provided for them a habitation; hungry and thirſty, you fed them and gave them drink; expoſed continually to the wiles of the deſtroyer, you ſnatched them, with an angel's hand, from deſtruction; in danger of every evil to which idleneſs and ignorance could render them liable you employed and inſtructed them.</q> If the recollection of beneficent actions, and the conſciouſneſs of good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though defeated by the perverſeneſs of men, or by thoſe untoward accidents to which all human ſchemes are liable, are a ſource of pure and exquiſite enjoyment—your ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be greatly increaſed, when you behold your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions carried into execution, and your labours crowned with complete ſucceſs. But how muſt the imagination ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand with hope, and the heart dilate with joy, when you look forward and behold thoſe whom you now protect, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into life; acting for themſelves; filling uſeful and honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtations in ſociety; adorning and improving their country by their ingenuity and induſtry, or defending it by their valour; becoming, themſelves, the fathers and mothers of families, and tranſmitting to their children's children, a portion of that happineſs which they have derived from this inſtitution. In this point of view, you will no longer conſider this houſe as merely an aſylum from preſent miſery, but as a nurſery of uſeful characters, as a ſeminary of religion and virtue, as the ſource of an incalculable addition to the happineſs and improvement of the human race.</p>
            <p>It is the nature of charity not to <hi>boaſt</hi> or to <hi>envy:</hi> but it is no leſs a property of it to liſten with delight to the voice of ſincere praiſe. Without, therefore, ſubjecting myſelf to the charge of boaſting, or of making invidious compariſons, I
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028369_0005_0FD8A5A7701B5A78"/>
may affirm, that of all charitable inſtitutions, thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the education and maintenance of orphan and deſtitute children, may juſtly claim the preference. God forbid that I ſhould ſeek to withdraw your compaſſion and ſupport from the aged and infirm, whoſe arm is now unſtrung, and who, declining into the winter of life, no longer diſplay the bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms of ſpring, or the fruit of autumn! God forbid that I ſhould endeavour to dry up the ſympathetic tear which flows for the ſorrows of others; to make you deaf to the ſigh of the afflicted, or render you leſs anxious to relieve the ſick, and, by aſſiſtance and advice, to ſmooth the bed of death! God forbid that what is meant to excite charity, ſhould create a jealouſy of intereſt, or an interference of claims among inſtitutions which have one common object in view, the relief of diſtreſs, the alleviation of human miſery, in whatever ſhape it appears! My intention here is to congratulate you on the proper application of your charity; to encourage you to proceed in the ſame courſe; and to ſhew that, while other charitable eſtabliſhments ought not to be neglected, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires and deſerves a more than common ſhare of your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſupport. <hi>Many of the fair daughters of Charity have done virtuouſly—but this excelleth them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inſtitutions of this nature may juſtly be ſtiled more <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> than any other, becauſe they relieve greater wretchedneſs. There is not, in nature, a more ſtriking picture of weakneſs and helpleſsneſs than man in the firſt ſtage of his exiſtence. Some animals are capable of providing for their defence and nouriſhment from the moment of their birth: and all, in a ſhort ſpace of time, are independent of foreign ſupport. But man, like a tender and delicate flower, muſt be reared with infinite care and attention; and requires, for many years, the foſtering hand of the parent. Happily the natural love of offspring, and the dictates of reaſon, combine to call forth the parental aſſiſtance. But when this ſupport is, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of heaven, removed—when they to whom they were accuſtomed to look for bread, are laid in the duſt—when the unconcerned ſtranger, immerſed in the purſuit of buſineſs or pleaſure, paſses by regardleſs of their diſtreſs; can imagination figure to itſelf a ſtate more helpleſs and wretched? The very
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028369_0006_0FD8A5A90C31FE78"/>
cries and tears, by which alone they can expreſs their miſery, ſpeak more forcibly in the ears of the compaſſionate, than the moſt pathetic orator can in their behalf.</p>
            <p>And yet, ſuch has been the ſituation of moſt of thoſe who have been received into this houſe. Some of them have been found wandering in the ſtreets, without father or mother; without friend, except the compaſſion of the charitable, and the benevolent providence of Him who is the father of the fatherleſs, the ſhield of the ſtranger and the ſupport of the orphan; ſcarcely acquainted with their own names; and truly able to ſay, <hi>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts, but we have not where to lay our heads.</hi> Others have been uſhered into the acquaintance of the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by the diſconſolate mother, whoſe tears ſtill flowed for the head and ſupporter of herſelf and her children, and who had addreſsed them in the piteous language of the widow of Iſrael to the prophet of old: <hi>Thy ſervant my huſband is dead, and thou knoweſt that thy ſervant did fear the Lord. Thine handmaid hath nothing in the houſe ſave one pot of oil, and behold! the creditor is come to take my two ſons to be bond men.</hi> In other caſes, the children have been taken from the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of their aged, ſick or infirm parents, who have thus been ſpared the heart-rending neceſſity of hearing them call for bread, while they had none to beſtow; and who have then yielded with leſs reluctance to the irreverſible ſentence of heaven, when they knew that thoſe whom they loved, and who would be the greateſt loſers by their death, were not left to wander in the wide world, friendleſs and forlorn, but were provided for in this houſe, where there is bread enough and to ſpare. In ſhort, others have been found in ſituations ſtill more wretched and deplorable: the offspring of an illicit connection, ready to be ſacrificed to that ſhame which natural feeling, as well as human opinion, have attached to every deviation from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; or breathing that noxious atmoſphere which infects the haunts of profligacy and impurity, and which infallibly leads thoſe who are contaminated with it, firſt, to the loſs of virtue and honour, next, to idleneſs and intemperance, and laſt of all, to a ſhameful and untimely end.</p>
            <p>Inſtitutions of this nature are not only more charitable in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028369_0007_0FD8A5AA811661A0"/>
their origin, but alſo more varied and extenſive in their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. In common with others they have it in view to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide food and raiment, a place of habitation, health and comfort, for thoſe who are deſtitute of them. And ſo far they deſerve an equal ſhare of praiſe and encouragement. But the plan of this inſtitution extends farther, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates deeper into the conſtitution of human nature. It is not ſatisfied with the removal or ſuſpenſion of preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, but provides againſt its return, and lays the foundation of future comfort and happineſs, by accuſtoming thoſe whom it protects to habits of induſtry and application, and by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſome art or profeſſion, in the proſecution of which they may acquire a decent and honourable ſubſiſtence. This inſtitution, while it relieves outward indigence, likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves inward miſery. It ſees the immortal inhabitant of this earthly tabernacle ſtript and naked; mangled by vice, and bleeding at every pore; bound in fetters by ignorance, and ſtruggling in vain for relief. Like the good Samaritan, it haſtens to his aſſiſtance, breaks his chains, and removes his intellectual diſtreſs and miſery. It pours the oil and wine of conſolation into the wounded ſpirit. It cauſes the light of knowledge and inſtruction to ſhine into the dark and benighted mind. It feeds the hungry ſoul with that meat which endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever. It gives to the thirſty the water ſpringing up unto eternal life. It ſows thoſe ſeeds of virtue which will bring forth a rich harveſt in future life, and will flouriſh when all human ſchemes and inſtitutions ſhall have paſsed away.</p>
            <p>Inſtitutions of this kind are alſo more laſting in their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Other charities are confined to the individuals who are the objects of them. This, which regards the young and riſing generation, extends farther than the imagination can reach: it bleſses ages and races of men which are yet unborn: in the revolutionary courſe of human affairs it may even prove the means of obtaining relief to the children and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of thoſe who are its preſent ſupporters, and who wiſely lay up, by practiſing pious and generous deeds, a good foundation againſt the time to come.</p>
            <p>But the beneficial effects of ſuch an inſtitution are by no means to be conſidered as doubtful and remote. They are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028369_0008_0FD8A5ABE9A214C0"/>
and immediate. By promoting the happineſs of theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, you are in fact promoting your own intereſt. By ſaving them from want and temptation, you are depriving the ſcaffold of its victims; you are defending your lives from the dagger of the aſsaſſin; you are ſecuring your houſe and property from the inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious attempts of the midnight robber. By a religious ſyſtem of education, you improve the national character, and retard the progreſs of infidelity and impiety, which are the certain fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of the downfall of that ſtate in which they prevail. By enuring theſe your adopted children to habits of activity, induſtry and virtue, you lay the ſureſt foundation of national proſperity; which conſiſts not in any local advantages of ſoil and climate, or in the abundance of gold and ſilver; but in the uſeful labour and active induſtry of the inhabitants. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural advantages are uſeleſs when unimproved. Gold and ſilver may be conſumed and diſſipated. But active and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious citizens are a never-failing and permanent national reſource. In ſhort, by this public mode of education, you form a hoſt of patriots and warriors, who know no parent but their country, and owe no debt of gratitude but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the general weal. <hi>Theſe are our ramparts,</hi> ſaid an ancient ſtateſman to one who enquired concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of his city, and pointing to a band of young men who were educated at the public expence. And I have no doubt every ſkilful politician will agree with me in thinking, that this houſe, appropriated as it is, to the maintenance and education of orphan boys and girls, is a more effectual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the ſtate, than the bulwarks and loud-toned inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of deſtruction which formerly reſted on the ſame foundation. Of the final ſucceſs of this eſtabliſhment, and of the future deſtinies and fortunes of theſe orphans, we ſhall predict nothing. But we know that in other countries, where ſuch inſtitutions have been of longer ſtanding, ſome who were educated and ſupported at charity ſchools, have afterwards become commanders of fleets and armies, have riſen to the higher departments of ſtate, occupied a ſeat on the bench, or miniſtered at the altar of the Lord. The object of this inſtitution, it is confeſsed, is of a humbler, though not leſs uſeful kind; being confined chiefly to the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028369_0009_0FD8A5AD71E43B68"/>
mechanical walks of life: and I am happy to ſay, that the tradeſmen and artiſans of this city, by their numerous appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for apprentices, ſhew a decided preference for ſuch as have been educated here, above thoſe whoſe temper, morals and habits of application, have been deſtroyed by maternal indulgence.</p>
            <p>Such being the excellent tendency and beneficial effects of inſtitutions of this nature, it may not be improper to enquire, for a moment, into the principle from which they originate. It cannot, I think, be denied, that there exiſts in the original conſtitution of human nature, a principle or feeling of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion which is excited by the fight of diſtreſs, and which prompts us to relieve the object thereof. Whether the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of beneficent actions is wholly diſintereſted, or is founded on a deſire to eſcape from that pain which we feel at the ſight of miſery, or to obtain that happineſs which flows from the relief of diſtreſs, is of no importance in the preſent enquiry. It is of more conſequence to obſerve that this feeling, unleſs when ſtrengthened by ſuperior motives, is but a caſual and precarious inſtrument of good. It ceaſes to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate except in the immediate preſence, and within the audible cry of miſery. The inferences and concluſions of reaſon give additional energy and ſtability to this principle. But after all, it remained an imperfect proviſion for human miſery, till improved and ſtrengthened by the benevolent ſyſtem of religion publiſhed to the world by Jeſus Chriſt. Of this it formed the moſt eſsential part, being inculcated as the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing mark of diſcipleſhip; being ſupported by motives the moſt powerful and ſublime; and being recommended to us by a perfect model of philanthropy and compaſſion. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the diſtreſses of others, we only copy the example of our Great Maſter, who <q>found the ſons of men as fatherleſs children, outcaſts from paradiſe, in a ſtate of utter deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; who opened for them a houſe of refuge, fed them with celeſtial food, gave them the water of life to drink, clothed them with the garments of ſalvation,</q> and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated on his followers, this commandment—<hi>As I have loved you, ſo ought you to love one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This reaſoning is ſupported by fact. In the hiſtory of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028369_0010_0FD8A5AF35D05A18"/>
ancient times, a few ſolitary inſtances of individual benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence may be met with; but it is from the introduction of Chriſtianity that we date the origin of charitable eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Then benevolence began to operate upon a regular and ſyſtematic plan. Then the rich learnt to part with their goods for the relief of the poor. Houſes were built for ſuch as had none. Hoſpitals were prepared for thoſe who wanted a phyſician. And the naked and hungry brethren of Jeſus were clothed and fed at the common expence of that ſociety of which they were members.</p>
            <p>The benevolent and compaſſionate genius of the goſpel is fully apparent in its effects. It has diſpelled former ignorance and barbarity; ſoftened and civilized human ſociety; refined and humanized the manners of men; reſtrained the ravages and cruelties of war; mitigated the ſeverity of puniſhment; diffuſed more extenſively civil liberty and ſocial rights; and elevated the lower orders of men to a rank and importance in ſociety.</p>
            <p>But in nothing is the humane ſpirit of Chriſtianity more conſpicuous than in improving the ſtate of children. In the moſt poliſhed nations of antiquity we obſerve on this ſubject laws the moſt ridiculous, and cuſtoms the moſt ſhocking to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Their legiſlators had too much wiſdom not to perceive that the youth were an important part of the community; and that, if they did not ſow in ſpring, they could not reap in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. But war and conqueſt conſtituted the policy of every ſtate previous to the chriſtian aera; their inſtitutions were all calculated for this end; and barbarous laws counteracted, and often triumphed over, the feelings of nature. At Sparta, the new-born infant was expoſed to the examination of a council of men, the moſt inflexible in their diſpoſitions, and the moſt ſevere in their manners; and if it had the appearance of being weak and ſickly, it was deemed unworthy to live. At Athens, it depended on the will of a capricious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated father, whether any of his children ſhould be allowed to live; and as the ſtate made proviſion for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance only of thoſe whoſe parents had fallen in battle, the children of the poor, or unhappy orphans, were for the moſt part conſigned to deſtruction; expoſed in the deſert, to the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028369_0011_0FD8A5B06BBE93F0"/>
uncertain affection of the wild beaſt, or left in the high way to the mercy of the accidental paſſenger. At Rome, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's authority over his children was abſolute and unlimited. They could be ſold into ſlavery, or put to death at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But Chriſtianity has reſtored to nature its rights, and to virtue its reign. With the ſevere legiſlators of antiquity compare the mild and merciful Lawgiver of the univerſe; whoſe meekneſs of temper and ſuavity of manners were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged even by his enemies; who, in all his actions, diſplayed the utmoſt affability and condeſcenſion; who, on many occaſions, ſhewed a peculiar affection and attachment to children; who delighted to have them about his perſon; and who frequently exhibited them to his diſciples, as fit em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of that innocence, ſimplicity and docility, which ought to characteriſe the ſubjects of his moral government. <hi>Suffer, little children,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hear then the ſum and concluſion of the whole matter. You, who are the generous patrons and ſupporters of the Orphan-houſe, have, by your attention to this inſtitution, ſhewn yourſelves to be <hi>charitable men, enlightened patriots</hi> and <hi>good Chriſtians.</hi> The catalogue of human virtues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes no additional encomium.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs of every inſtitution depends on the wiſdom and fidelity with which it is conducted. Upon this principle the Orphan-houſe may reaſonably expect all that ſucceſs of which the nature of human affairs will admit. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral management and ſuperintendance of this inſtitution has wiſely been committed to thoſe whom their fellow-citizens have entruſted with the ſecurity of their lives and properties, I mean the INTENDANT and WARDENS of this city. To you,</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>I wiſh to addreſs myſelf with that deference and reſpect which are due to thoſe whom the voice of their country has inveſted with authority. Our religion teaches us, that they who rule are entitled to double honour; but at the ſame time it exhorts rulers to rule with diligence. Reſponſibility is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably attached to ſtations of honour and truſt. If nobler
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028369_0012_0FD8A5B7A641EE18"/>
laurels are to be gained, greater toil is to be undergone and more danger is to be encountered. By accepting the office which you now hold, you have pledged yourſelves to the community, that you will diſcharge the duties thereof with diligence and fidelity.</p>
            <p>Among the many duties attached to your ſtation, none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more important than a due regard to the proper manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this inſtitution. Here you muſt lay the foundation of almoſt every other improvement in the adminiſtration of the police. The education of youth is the moſt intereſting object which can occupy the attention of the rulers of the community. This age is the ſeed-time of life, and if this is neglected, the conſequences will be as injurious, as if the ſeed-time were left out of the year. As the twig is bent, the tree is inclined. The habits and manners of the youth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the character and conduct of the man. The inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and exhortations of the miniſters of religion will be delivered in vain, unleſs the mind has been previouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for receiving them, by a virtuous education. To no purpoſe will you enact laws and regulations for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of good order and ſobriety, unleſs you encourage in the youth, habits of induſtry and virtue. In vain do you employ your time and money in cleaning and repairing the ſtreets, if you do not free them from the impurities of vice, and from thoſe diſguſting ſights which ſqualid poverty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. You will have done but half your work, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent yourſelves with lighting the nightly paſsenger on his way, and ſtill leave the minds of the lower orders of people in the darkneſs of ignorance. You cannot beautify and adorn the city in any way ſo effectually, as by introducing purity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and training up theſe children to induſtry and virtue. The encouragement of this inſtitution is not only a ſublime inſtance of charity—but alſo the trueſt economy, the beſt way of huſbanding the public money. The more of it that is expended here, the leſs will be conſumed in the poor-houſe. In proportion as the number of thoſe who are benefited by this inſtitution is increaſed, the expence of guarding your lives and properties will be diminiſhed. The patriotic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans of antiquity, lived themſelves in mean and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028369_0013_0FD8A5B97689AF68"/>
dwellings: they diſplayed their ſplendor and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence in their public works, and in the temples of their gods. Shew yourſelves imitators worthy of them; and by your attention to inſtitutions of public utility, manifeſt your zeal for the public good.</p>
            <p>But while, as far as your funds will permit, you encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and extend this inſtitution, let it not be forgotten that you will more effectually promote the deſign thereof, if you can find leiſure for perſonal attendance and inſpection. This will raiſe in the children, a ſpirit of emulation, and a laudable deſire to excel; becauſe they will perceive that you take an intereſt in their welfare and improvement, and will find themſelves diſtinguiſhed according to their progreſs and good behaviour. This will tend, alſo, to excite the diligence and exertions of thoſe ſervants and dependents whom you employ under you in this houſe. For though the exhibition of this day affords ample teſtimony of the fidelity and prudence of all concerned in this eſtabliſhment, it cannot be denied that the preſent zeal can be kept up only by your conſtant and regular ſuperintendence.</p>
            <p>Above all, let it be your chief care to make a wife and diſcreet choice of commiſſioners—to elect to this important and honourable ſtation, none but men of known integrity and prudence; men fearing God, and hating covetouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Happily the exiſting circumſtances leave no room here, but for praiſe and congratulation. Were I not afraid to wound that modeſty and humility which are inſeparably attached to great and good characters, I would deſcribe minutely, and you would hear with pleaſure, the unwearied diligence with which the COMMISSIONERS, without fee or reward, attend to the buſineſs of this inſtitution; frequently to their own detriment, and the interruption of their private affairs. I would call upon the diſtreſsed parents to declare, how eaſy of acceſs they have ever found them, and how ready to liſten to their tale of woe. I would teach theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to rehearſe the many inſtances of paternal affection, anxiety and care which they have experienced, and the many proofs of zeal for their intereſts, and of their readineſs to give them advice, and even pecuniary aſſiſtance from their
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028369_0014_0FD8A5BAE868A290"/>
private fortune after they had left the houſe. In their book of laws, which is open to the inſpection of every one; I would point out the ſalutary regulations which they have eſtabliſhed for the management of their important charge. I would lead you through the different apartments of this building, and direct your attention to the plenty which reigns there, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> economy which is practiſed, and to the good order which prevails among the children. I would then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt you to follow me into the place of their education, and mark the proficiency many of them have made; a proficiency that might well put to the bluſh ſome who have enjoyed all the advantages which the good fortune of being deſcended from rich and reſpectable parents confers. In ſhort, you ſhould be preſent at their hours of devotion, and hear with what fervour and zeal, they, every morning and evening, offer thanks to heaven, who has raiſed them up in you ſuch generous patrons and ſupporters. There is but one fact, however, which I ſhall diſtinguiſh with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice, as a proof of the great attention which is paid to the health, diet and comfort of the children. Out of 183, who have been received upon this eſtabliſhment ſince its foundation, in five years (the term of its duration) only ſix have died; making one in 152 annually: a circumſtance, which, conſidering the precarious period of life, is almoſt incredible, and is not to be equalled in any other climate, even the moſt favourable to the health and longevity of the human race.</p>
            <p>I have only to beſeech you, GENTLEMEN, as you have hitherto deſerved well of the community, not to relax in your exertions. Conſider the important truſt repoſed in you. A higher compliment could not have been paid to the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues either of your head or heart, than to commit to you the management of an inſtitution which requires ſo much of both. I need ſcarcely remind you of that pleaſure which you have ſo often felt, the pleaſure of doing good, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of relieving the wretched. At times, indeed, you will be called to witneſs afflicting ſcenes; but it is conſoling to think, that even theſe have the happieſt tendency to ſoften and improve the heart. In general, you will find in this houſe a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028369_0015_0FD8A5BC9855EF48"/>
pleaſing retreat from the rougher labours of buſineſs and the more diſagreeable duties of your ſtation. A ſeminary of children, engaged in the little toils and labours ſuited to their years; indulging their playful and ſportive diſpoſitions, and diſplaying without diſſimulation or reſerve, their hopes and their fears, their loves and their hatreds, their joys and their griefs, is a delightful ſubject of contemplation. It is the picture of man's primeval ſtate, and reminds us of thoſe happy days of innocence and peace, which were ſpent in quietneſs under the paternal roof, before we were acquainted with the cares and ſorrows and vices of the world. Here, ſeated on an eminence, you enjoy a delightful calm and ſerenity, while you behold the world beneath you vexed with the din of politics, and wearied with the noiſe of folly. Other patriotic deeds may gain applauſe, but ſcenes like theſe adminiſter comfort. Nay, the applauſe which ſuch works acquire to their performers, though not ſo loud and noiſy, is far more laſting and ſatisfactory. In the eye of reaſon, goodneſs ranks before greatneſs, and benevolent deeds before the moſt heroic exploits. They confer laurels which never fade, and beſtow honours which no breath can blaſt. The erection of this edifice will be remembered to the immortal honour of its founders, when the proud monuments of human ambition and folly ſhall have mouldered into duſt; and when the heroes and conquerors and deſtroyers of the human race, who have filled the earth with widows and with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, ſhall have ſunk into oblivion, or are remembered with abhorrence. But this is the ſmalleſt part of your reward. Your's are the joys of ſelf approbation. Upon you ſhall come the bleſſing of thoſe who were ready to periſh. When thoſe years arrive, wherein the idle, who have waſted their time unprofitably, and the ſelfiſh, who have employed it ſolely for their own private advantage, ſhall ſay they have no pleaſure, you will be able to recollect with ſatisfaction the ſeveral events of a life ſpent in promoting the glory of God, and the good of your fellow creatures. In that hour, when human ſtrength is nought but weakneſs, and all the glory of man withers away as the flower of the field, your labours of love in behalf of this houſe, will be to you a ſource of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028369_0016_0FD8A5BDEC78DF58"/>
and conſolation. And in that day of retribution, when the merciful ſhall obtain mercy, and all the frivolous and hard hearted ſons of mirth ſhall be ſwept away, as the chaff before the wind, you ſhall hear with delight this ſentence of approbation and reward: <hi>Come ye bleſſed! inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you, from before the foundation of the world. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in; Naked and ye cloathed me; I was ſick and ye viſited me; I was in priſon and ye came unto me. For in as much as ye have done it unto the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me. For whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one of theſe little ones, a cup of cold water only, ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am laſt of all, to addreſs myſelf to you for whoſe benefit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> inſtitution is intended. And here much might be ſaid, were it poſſible to clothe my ſentiments in language which your tender and uninformed minds could eaſily underſtand. But, as this is not the caſe with the greater part of you, I ſhall conſider the ſubject with more brevity than perhaps its importance requires.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of you who are capable of judging and feeling at all, muſt, on this occaſion, at the ſight of your benefactors, be filled with ſentiments of joy, gratitude and love. Once were you orphans and fatherleſs, but now theſe are your mothers and your fathers, your ſiſters and your brethren. To them ought to be transferred that affection which would have been due to your own parents, had you been fortunate enough to have experienced their kindneſs. Perhaps their claim is ſtronger than that of any natural parent, becauſe they were bound by no tie of affection, and they expect no recompence but a proper improvement, on your part, of the opportunities which they have put in your power. The wretchedneſs of your former condition, which was not at all diminiſhed by the inability of many of you to perceive its full extent, compared with your preſent comfortable ſituation, clearly points out to you how much you owe to the generoſity of the public. Every meal you eat, every time you look to this ſtately building, deſtined for your dwelling, ſhould call up to your view your kind ſupporters, and bring the tear
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028369_0017_0FD8A5C4DC6597A0"/>
of gratitude into your eye. You ought farther to conſider, that even had you been able to ſtruggle through the various ills of poverty, want and diſeaſe, incident to your former condition, you would ſtill have laboured under the moſt ſerious diſadvantages in your progreſs through life. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and vicious, you could not have riſen to eminence in any ſituation. Without friends to patroniſe and adviſe you, or to introduce you into the world, diſcouragement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment would have attended you in every purſuit. But, by being received into this houſe, you have been adopted, as it were, into an honourable family. You are now the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate children of your country, who will not fail to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for you, if you are not wanting to yourſelves. You have now friends and patrons, to whom you may look up for counſel and protection. Reflections like theſe are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to melt the moſt inſenſible heart, and have been often found to reform the moſt ſtubborn and untractable, with whom puniſhment and reſtraint were of no avail. But how ſhall you evince your gratitude, and your ſenſe of our kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? You cannot, in perſon, thank every individual of your ſupporters: and it may never be in your power to make any return. The only way, then, in which you can ſhew your gratitude, is by a proper behaviour, a diligent attention to your improvement while you are in this houſe; and a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful recollection, after you have left it, of the kindneſs you have here experienced, together with a faithful diſcharge of the duties which may belong to your future ſtation in life. Thus your benefactors will have the ſatisfaction to know, that their money and pains have not been beſtowed in vain; and thus you will confute an ancient objection to ſuch inſtitutions, that they who have been educated in them, have generally become vicious and abandoned, when they entered into life, becauſe they had no parents and friends to whom they were reſponſible for their conduct. In this way you will more effectually benefit your ſucceſsors, and promote the intereſt of the Orphan-Houſe, than by the moſt liberal contribution which ſucceſs in buſineſs might enable you to make.</p>
            <p>Upon you, my young friends, are incumbent all the duties which belong to others of the ſame age and ſex. But I only
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028369_0018_0FD8A5C85E778B98"/>
mean to mention ſuch as are peculiar to your ſituation. The firſt is diligence and application in whatever you are appointed to perform. Now you muſt lay the foundation of your ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in future life. While the heart is yet tender, habits are ſoon formed, impreſſions are eaſily made, and leſsons of wiſdom ſink deep into the mind. Thoſe golden days, which you now enjoy, will ſoon paſs away, but they will never return; and whether well or ill employed, they will leave laſting memorials behind them. As you now ſow, you will hereafter reap. Remember then that every thing depends upon your own exertions. You have no inheritance but your talents, and no friends but ſuch as your fidelity and diligence may procure you. The child of proſperity who waſtes the precious ſeaſon of youth in idleneſs, only expoſes himſelf to future contempt and diſgrace; you thereby expoſe yourſelves to utter ruin and miſery. Remember alſo, that your time is not your own—that you eat the bread of others—and that you are, in a ſenſe, the property of the public, to whom you are reſponſible for every moment of your life.</p>
            <p>To diligence you muſt add humility, docility and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to your ſuperiors. Theſe are qualifications highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in men of all ages; in youth they are peculiarly ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and graceful: but in you, who derive every thing from the charity of others, and who, without their aſſiſtance, would have been outcaſts and peſts of ſociety, they are indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly requiſite.</p>
            <p>Endeavour, likewiſe, while your minds are yet ſuſceptible of tender impreſſions, to cultivate generous and charitable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. <hi>Remember, that ye were bondmen in the land of Egypt,</hi> is an argument frequently addreſsed by the Almighty to the people of Iſrael, when he inculcates humanity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in their dealings with the poor, or with their bond ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And moſt certainly no conſideration is more powerful to excite ſentiments of tenderneſs and compaſſion than the actual feeling of preſent, or the recollection of paſt ſufferings. Remember then, that you were once helpleſs, friendleſs and forlorn; and, though you cannot relieve, be ever ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate others who may be in the ſame ſituation—to weep with thoſe who weep, and to rejoice with thoſe who rejoice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:028369_0019_0FD8A5C92BAA44B8"/>The choice of companions is an object of the firſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to youth; but this your ſituation has not left in your power. On this ſubject, therefore, I have only to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, that you be careful to maintain harmony and concord with one another. It is comely for brethren to dwell together in unity; and brethren, in many ſenſes, you are—brethren in affliction, as well as by adoption into the ſame family. Let all wrath, contention and ſtrife, be put away far from this houſe; and let it be the manſion of peace and brotherly love. Is not the number of your friends ſufficiently ſmall already, that you ſeek, by unneceſsary feuds and conteſts, to make enemies of thoſe whom a community of wants and ſorrows, and habits of familiarity and intercourſe ought to have knit to you for ever, and to have rendered through life inſtruments of mutual happineſs and ſupport.</p>
            <p>On a day ſacred to feſtivity and joy, I wiſhed to have ſaid nothing which might throw a cloud over the fair proſpect which I have held forth to this audience. But I am particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly charged to inform you, that repeated, and I am afraid, well founded complaints have been made to the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of the improper behaviour of ſome of you, not only in the ſtreets, but even in the houſe of God; and thus publicly to warn the offenders, that unleſs reformed by the ordinary modes of correction, they will be made an awful example to the reſt, will be finally expelled from this houſe, and their place ſupplied by others who ſhall prove more deſerving of the kind ſupport which they here receive.</p>
            <p>In a word, my young friends, while you are careful to expreſs your gratitude to your benefactors; to prove by your conduct, that you are not unworthy of their favour; and to ſhew to each other that kindneſs and humanity which your mutual wants and weakneſs require, forget not to lift up your minds to the Supreme Being, the author of your exiſtence, <q>the inſpirer of all the love and friendſhip which have ever been ſhewn you by others, the ſupporter of your infancy, the guide of your childhood, the guardian of your youth, and the hope of your coming years.</q> Let it be the firſt object of all your wiſhes and endeavours to obtain his favour; and know, for your encouragement, that they who ſeek him
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028369_0020_0FD8A5CAD1F2CD88"/>
early ſhall find him. Without the bleſſing and protection of the Almighty, all hope of happineſs and ſucceſs in life were vain: poſseſsed of theſe, you have the beſt reaſon for truſt and confidence. His arm can give ſtrength to the weak. His grace will enable you to reſiſt every temptation. His comforts will delight your ſouls in the day of adverſity and diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, unite, with one heart and with one voice, in offering thanks and praiſe to him who hath hitherto helped us; and in imploring his future bleſſing and protection to this inſtitution, without which all our endeavours will be inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>

            <p>While Angels and Archangels, and the Spirits of the Juſt, behold thy perfections and glory unveiled, we contemplate thee only in thy works.

Enable us to co-operate with thee in that great plan, which thou art carrying on from age to age, for counteracting the fatal effects of that diſorder which ſin has introduced into the moral ſyſtem. Implant within us the ſeeds of every virtue which is ornamental to our nature, and well pleaſing in thy fight. Inſpire us with a principle of univerſal benevolence. Breathe into our ſouls that ſpirit of charity which is the bond of perfection. May we feel that generous ſympathy, which weeps with thoſe who weep, and rejoices with thoſe who rejoice. Teach us that candour which think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no evil. As we expect mercy from thee, may we forgive our neighbour the wrongs which he has done us. As we hope for divine ſuccour in the day of diſtreſs, may we be ever ready to relieve and aſſiſt the wretched.</p>
            <p>Father Almighty! without whoſe aſſiſtance and protection nothing can proſper, we beſeech thee to regard with favour this inſtitution: May it effectually anſwer the great deſign of its eſtabliſhment, and, in every caſe, may human compaſſion prove a remedy for human miſery.</p>
            <p>Father of the fatherleſs! be gracious to theſe Orphans who have no friend and protector but thee. O merciful and compaſſionate Shepherd of Iſrael! who carrieſt the lambs in thy arms, and gently leadeſt ſuch as are with young, defend this tender flock from evil. Preſerve them in the path of righteouſneſs, innocence and peace. Grant that they may make due proficiency in the ſeveral branches of education alloted to them. Inſpire them with gratitude and love to their benefactors, but eſpecially to thee, their greateſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor and friend. Grant that they may live in harmony and concord with one another; and, when they leave this place, may they, by their conduct, do honor to themſelves, and prove a bleſſing to their country.</p>
            <p>Bleſs with thy almighty patronage every ſeminary of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;

and render effectual the exertions of parents, guardians and teachers, in behalf of the young and riſing generation.</p>
            <p>Pour down thy choiceſt bleſſings on the friends and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of this inſtitution. May they experience that he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord; and though he may ſeem to caſt away his bread as it were upon the waters, he ſhall find it after many days. Grant that all who are concerned in this inſtitution may diſcharge, with fidelity and diligence, the various duties of their ſtations; and may, in every thing, look up to thee who art the friend of the poor, and the protector of the oppreſsed!</p>
            <p>Ruler of the Univerſe! we offer up our earneſt ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in behalf of theſe lands wherein we live. Bleſs the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; and grant that peace, happineſs and proſperity may ever attend them. May we put a due value on the ineſtimable bleſſings of civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious liberty which we enjoy; may we be grateful to thee, the author of them: and may we tranſmit them pure and unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the lateſt generations.</p>
            <p>Pour down thy bleſſings on thy ſervant THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Protect his perſon, prolong his life, and guide his counſels, that his government may be a bleſſing to thoſe over whom he is placed.</p>
            <p>We pray for all Governours, Judges and Rulers, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, THE GOVERNOUR of this ſtate, and the MAGIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRATES of this city. Teach them to rule in thy fear, and to thy glory; employing the power with which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, as a terror to evil-doers, and as an encouragement and protection to thoſe who do well.</p>
            <p>Bleſs, O God! this city and all its inhabitants. Let not our ſins and follies provoke thee to viſit us in wrath. Spare thy deſtroying ſword; and reſtore us to our wonted health and proſperity.</p>
            <p>Let not the Lord be angry, and we will yet farther ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the whole human race, the diſtreſsed and fallen family of mankind. See, O God! the afflictions of the afflicted! May the ſigh of the priſoner come up before thee. Look down with compaſſion on the ſufferings of the juſt. Bend thine ear to the cry of the miſerable. O, may thy kingdom

come! May thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven! May ignorance, ſuperſtition, tyranny, bigotry and wrath ceaſe for ever! May the mild genius of the goſpel appear in the lives of its profeſsors! May virtue again ſhine forth as in the days of old, and convert theſe abodes of ſin and miſery into manſions of holineſs and peace!</p>
            <p>May thy name be hallowed and thy glory advanced by all thy rational and moral offspring throughout thy vaſt univerſe, henceforth, even for ever more! AMEN.</p>
