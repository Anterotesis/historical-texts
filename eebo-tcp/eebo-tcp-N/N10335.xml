            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CITIZENS of <hi>New-York,</hi> On the preſent critical Situation of Affairs.</head>
            <p>WERE I neither a Philadelphian, a New-Yorker, a Boſtonian, nor even a native of this continent, as a friend to the rights of mankind, I ſhould intereſt myſelf in the fate of America. America muſt at preſent be conſidered as the principal, or indeed the only remaining ſeat of liberty —In Corſica, Sweden, Poland ſhe has been borne down by the direct hand of violence; and in our parent country, ſhe is ſapp'd by corruption to ſo dangerous a degree, that ſhe totters from the foundation, and unleſs propp'd by the virtue and ſpirit of her colonies, ſhe muſt inevitably fall to the ground. A regular plan has been formed by the preſent court, for the introduction of arbitrary power;—this is no declamation, and did the ſize of this paper admit of it, I could prove the truth of the aſſertion by numberleſs inſtances: The privileges, and indeed natural rights of the ſubject, have been invaded in every part of the empire, one while by open force, another by cabal and the arts of corruption —Even the iſlands of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norca, Jerſey, Guernſey, have not been protected by their inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance, from the ſcourge of tyranny.—Great Britain and Ireland have been drained almoſt to the laſt farthing, not for any national purpoſes, but to increaſe the influence of the crown, in creating new placemen, penſioners, and of courſe enemies to the public welfare, and liberty.</p>
            <p>General warrants, violation of the rights of election, the disfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement of the proprietors of the Eaſt India ſtock, murders committed, murderers pardoned, encouraged, rewarded, and the other overtacts (of treaſon, I may ſay) which the miniſtry have been guilty of againſt law, magna charta, and the Engliſh conſtitution, are ſo notorious, that it is almoſt impertinent to mention them; but there are other indications, or rather evidences of the temper and views of the court, which ought not to be paſſed over in ſilence and which muſt convince the ſubjects that they are to expect nothing but from their own virtue and firmneſs,—</p>
            <p>Every writer in ſupport of boundleſs prerogative, every jacobite hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, (the Humes, Guthries and Smollet's) has been careſſed, placed or penſioned. Attacks have been made under the auſpices of the court, not only on the revolution, and the principal promoters of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, but a ſcheme has been laid, and to the utmoſt of their power carried into execution, to proſcribe virtue herſelf, by ſubverting the reputation of her brighteſt models—They argue thus, <hi>if we can ſpread the perſuaſion, that public virtue never did exiſt in a human breaſt that patriotiſm has been in all ages only a maſk for deſigning men; we ſhall gain the following point, we ſhall render mankind totally indifferent who are in office, who are not; whether a Pitt or a Bute—what maxims we rule by, what maxims we repudiate, whether we profeſs thoſe of an Alfred, or a Stuart, will be a matter of indifference to the public, if we can once convince them, that their intereſts ever have been, and ever will be equally out of the queſtion.—When we have thus deſtroyed all political confidence, we have reaſon to flatter ourſelves that the people will not be ſuch fools as to think of oppoſition, or reſiſtance, but without giving themſelves any unneceſſary trouble, ſubmit to the yoke we are preparing for them.</hi> To accompliſh theſe pious purpoſes, ſome fit inſtrument was to be ſought and found, ſome man of a ſufficiently corrupt heart, to qualify him for the taſk. This inſtrument was found in a certain Sir John Dalrymple, (who in the adminiſtration of Lord Rockingham had been turned out of an important office, which he held in Scotland, for manifeſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt practices —He was detached into France, and recommended by Lord Mansfield, and another very great perſonage, to the famous Duke D'Aiguillon; he, who had trampled on the few remaining laws of France, and exterminated their virtuous Parliaments.—the Duke D'Aiguillon, with the candour (as this Dalrymple tells us) inſeparable from every miniſter of a great King catches the idea of our court, (and as might be expected from ſo natural an ally) patronizes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and conſigns to their agent, the key of the <hi>depote des affaires etran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geres.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Office of records of foreign affairs.</hi>
               </note>—Here he ſets himſelf to work, to rummage, to garble, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falcate, to forge,—for without ſtraining inferences, it is almoſt certain that he did forge—at length he triumphantly ſallies forth, with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as he hopes to perſuade us, of the non-exiſtence of human virtue, with proofs that her brigheſt patterns were knaves and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. It would be eaſy (tho' here might be thought tedious) to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the whole foundation, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> defeat the intended effects of this abominable production;—but I cannot help remarking, that were the proofs of Sydney and Ruſſel's being traytors irrefregable, he who ſhould produce them, would be held in abhorrence by every friend to humanity.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary that ſome models of human virtue ſhould be held up to our imitation: He who would remove from our ſight theſe few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels which hiſtory has left to us, would check every noble ardour of the ſoul, as it would then appear madneſs to attempt attaining what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with our nature It may now perhaps be aſked what can be the intention (in an addreſs to the citizens of New-York) of ſo long a preamble on the conduct and ſpirit of the court, in matters which do not particularly relate to America. I will explain to you my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is to convince you, that when a ſpirit ſo hoſtile to general li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty prevails, in thoſe who have the power at home, you have only to hope for redreſs of grievances from the united virtue and firmneſs of the colonies; that the idea of proceeding by petition and remonſtrance, is the moſt ridiculous idea that ever entered into weak heads. Can you ſeriouſly think your petitions would have any effect at this inſtant, when the confidence and temerity of the miniſtry are mounted to ſo much higher a pitch than we have hitherto ſeen them? Can you ſeriouſly think that your petitions would operate more ſtrongly on ſo firmly a fixed miniſter, backed by a vaſt majority in parliament, than the petitions of the city of London, and the principal counties of England, with the firſt men of property and character, and a conſiderable number of the members at their head did on a miniſter leſs firmly ſeated; a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, not only leſs firmly ſeated, but perhaps a much leſs bold and determined foe to liberty, than the preſent.—It is no calumny, it is no exaggeration to ſay, that Lord North is a determined foe to liberty.— He is ſo by inheritance; deſcended from one of the moſt forward and active inſtruments of tyranny under Charles the ſecond; every ſpeech, every action of his life demonſtrates him to be the genuine offspring — On the brave Corſicans he never beſtowed a gentler Epithet than rebels and traitors.—The mention of American liberties, the ſuppoſition that they had any liberties, always threw him into a frenzy of rage,— foaming at the mouth, and with eyes ſtarting from their ſockets, He has denounced, or rather vomitted forth eternal war againſt you and your poſterity.—He has had the arrogance, the madneſs to declare, in the open ſenate, that he never would receive, never hear any petitions from America, until he had her at his feet.</p>
            <p>When it is conſidered that this avowed foe, and perſecutor of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; this furious fanatick in deſpotiſm, is now become the omnipotent miniſter, I muſt repeat, that the idea of redreſſing grievances by peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and remonſtrance, is the moſt contemptible idea, that ever entered into weak heads. It is indeed ſo very contemptible, that we cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe who adopt it are in earneſt;—it is impoſſible not to ſuſpect them of ſiniſter deſigns—They muſt mean, under the cloak of coolneſs and moderation, to check the vigour, ſo abſolutely requiſite at this junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to prevent the only poſſible means of redreſs; they muſt mean to recommend themſelves to the future favour of your oppreſſors. —They perhaps already devour in their minds, contracts, ſalaries, and penſions, for which, (if the miniſtry ſucceed) funds will be immediately eſtabliſhed out of the fruits of your honeſt labour and induſtry.—They muſt be conſcious that all the force and troops they can employ, will not effect their purpoſes, unleſs the corruption of your own members powerfully co-operates —Upon the whole, conſidering the critical ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of affairs, the impending ruin over our heads, I cannot help being a good deal ſurpriſed and ſomewhat ſhocked, at the conduct of this city—Is this a time to amuſe yourſelves with narrow local politicks and diſputes? Is this a time, when the deareſt intereſts of yourſelves, of poſterity, and of mankind are at ſtake, (for the cauſe of liberty is the cauſe of mankind)? Is this a time I ſay, to indulge your little prejudices, jealouſies, and perſonal piques? For ſhame citizens, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card all ſuch diſgraceful ſentiments; aſſume a more noble character; ſave yourſelves from the infamy which threatens you; let not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ruin be laid to your charge. For my own part, I neither pretend to approve nor to condemn the meaſure which the committee hath lately thought proper to cenſure —But this I will pretend to ſay that the publiſhing the cenſure, may have moſt pernicious conſequences; it may, by propagating the opinion of diviſions ſtarting up in this <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>

I muſt confeſs, a very ſuſpicious air to its authors —the deſign could not be good. It has already furniſhed matter of triumph to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of liberty. One man in particular (he is indeed an official man, not a native of this country, and remarkable for his alacrity in political wickedneſs) ſings <hi>te deum,</hi> I am told, in all companies on this occaſion, conſidering the victory as inſured to his idol deſpotiſm —There are now ſome far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſequences to be apprehended from the preſent conduct of this city, which perhaps have not occurred to you, and which therefore I ſhall beg leave to offer to your conſideration —Is it not to be apprehended that the Boſtonians, when they turn their eyes and addreſs their prayers to you, as a leading people of America, for ſuccour in their diſtreſs; and when inſtead of the vigour and noble ſpirit they had reaſon to expect from your former exertions, they ſee nothing but backwardneſs, frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous delays, and (as to them it will appear) total dearth of ſpirit; is it not to be apprehended, that having no proſpect of relief, they may grow deſperate? And that their deſpair, in conjunction with the corruption of individuals among themſelves, (for you may be aſſured that General
<pb facs="unknown:013118_0002_0F8FF96BC3378C20"/>
Gage has unlimited credit on the treaſury for the purpoſes of corruption) may drive them into the wiſh'd for fatal conceſſion; the <hi>general ſeal of American bondage—The admiſſion of the right of taxing you without your own conſent?</hi> Is it not to be expected, that the inſtant they have diveſted themſelves of the character of freemen and taken up that of ſlaves, they will become the favourite colony of the court? That it will then be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that they have been miſrepreſented? That they had indeed for ſome time been deluded by a few factious demagogues, but that in fact, they were a loyal, dutiful and affectionate people?—This will be the language affected by the General, and this will the miniſtry oſtentatiouſly affect to believe.—When they have thus commuted the character of freemen for that of ſlaves, will they not act the part natural to ſlaves? Be the ready inſtruments for reducing others to the ſame ſituation with themſelves? And when a people ſo potent in numbers and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects as New England, is thrown into the ſcale of the military I am at a loſs to know what means on this continent can be deviſed for reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>For my own part, O citizens of New-York, ſuppoſing myſelf a Boſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, and that my country were reduced to the wretched ſituation I have deſcribed, through your dilatorineſs, diſaffection, or want of virtue, I am afraid there is no meaſure (be it ever ſo tyrannical) my Lords and maſters could dictate againſt you, which I ſhould not from reſentment, find a pleaſure in putting into execution.—For inſtance ſhould they think proper to revive in this particular province, the odious ſtamp act, (and ſuch is the wantonneſs and inſolence of tyranny, that they would probably chooſe it, in preference to any other mode of oppreſſion, as a trophy of their victory) I ſhould, I am afraid, with alacrity lend my hand to enforce it.—I am ſenſible that in hazarding theſe ſentiments, I may give to many, a diſadvantageous picture of my own diſpoſition; it may be, that I miſtake myſelf, but as reſentment operates ſo ſtrongly on the human breaſt, even the beſt diſpoſed, and as ſlavery ſo vitiates the human heart, the apprehenſion is far from groundleſs.—This, at leaſt, is certain, that ſhould the people of Boſton be enſlaved, and have reaſon to impute their calamity in part, or principally to New York, there is no degree of animoſity and hatred they could afterwards bear to New-York, which would not in a great meaſure be juſtified; and it is equally certain, that the liberties of the betrayers would not long ſurvive thoſe which they had betrayed.</p>
            <p>I muſt now, O citizens, intreat that you will attribute what I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, to the genuine motive; to an ardent zeal for the liberties of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and the rights of mankind; that you will believe me at the ſame time moſt ſincerely attached to the real intereſts of Great Britain; no man can have a higher reverence for the people of England than myſelf; I eſteem them, in all reſpects the firſt people of the univerſe. But when our parent is thrown into a dilirium, by the quackery of a murdering im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, is it not the duty of her children to prevent her committing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, not only immediately deſtructive to themſelves, but which muſt end in her own ruin? When her phrenzy is paſt, ſhe will thank us for the pious reſtraint. There is one conſideration which renders the preſent deluſion of the people of England with reſpect to America, really won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful; it is that the very ſame men ſhould have been able to bring about this deluſion, whom they themſelves have ever held in contempt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence. The ſame men who within doors have violated, baffled, or eluded their moſt ſacred laws, diſſipated and refuſed to account for their treaſures, treated with inſult their petitions and remonſtrances; and who have externally ſacrificed their intereſts, annihilated their importance, and tarniſhed their glories?—That theſe men ſhould have wrought upon them, is ſo prepoſterous and unnatural that the deluſion cannot be of a long continuation; they muſt ſoon open their eyes; they will then thank Providence, that the ſenſe and virtue of their colonies has ſaved them from the deſtruction into which their own infatuation would have plunged them —Such are the ſentiments which I entertain, ſuch are the principles I poſſeſs—and if you believe them ſincere, they will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent apologies for my addreſſing you in this extraordinary manner; and that they are ſincere, I call to witneſs that Eternal Being, who is the judge of the truth of all hearts. I ſhall now conclude with obſerving, that there are two roads preſented to you; the one leading to ſecurity, freedom, happineſs, and honour; the other which terminates in wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, ſlavery, and infamy to you and your children's children—it is of the greateſt concern, therefore, to be aſſured of the fidelity of your conductors. If they turn their eyes to the right or left, from the direct object of their charge, <hi>the general welfare,</hi> to little views of imagined ſelf intereſts, you and your poſterity are loſt. The more we reflect, the more we are ſtruck with the importance of what you are now about to reſolve, of the neceſſity there is of paying the moſt ſerious attention to the characters of thoſe whom you ſhall appoint your Delegates.—If amongſt thoſe propoſed for your election there ſhould be a man whom you think averſe to ſchemes of non-importation and even non exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the iſlands, if neceſſary—that is in fact a man whoſe mind has been ſo narrowed by commercial habits, that he would poſtpone the permanent ſecurity and freedom of the whole, to his own temporary perſonal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages: Let him be rejected, as totally unworthy of ſo momentous, ſo dignified a truſt —Is there a man who ever did, or you ſuppoſe ever will hold any office under a miniſtry odious as the preſent? Him reject, as deſtitute of all principle. But above all, is there a man who has upon the preſent occaſion, been heard to propoſe or recommend petition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance as the propereſt mode of obtaining redreſs? Him reject with ſcorn and indignation—for if he is in earneſt, his capacity muſt be miſerably low indeed, and if he is not in earneſt, he certainly means to betray you.</p>
            <p>The moſt ſtrenuous civil reſiſtance is neceſſary to your ſalvation unleſs you prefer a civil <hi>war</hi> a few months hence, to civil <hi>reſiſtance</hi> now, or are determined to ſubmit to abſolute <hi>ſlavery.</hi> Let your choice of Delegates be proportioned to the importance of the occaſion.—I do not think tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent talents abſolutely neceſſary; a common good underſtanding: ſufficient, but unqueſtionable heartineſs, zeal, and fervor in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe, are indeſpenſible—in ſhort, let your choice correſpond with what we are taught to expect from the other colonies, and not only the ſecurity, happineſs, and liberties of America will be fixed on a foundation which a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
