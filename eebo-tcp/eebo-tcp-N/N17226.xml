            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it, let me put you in remembrance;</p>
            <p n="1">'1. That a miniſter is bound to attend wholly and only
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:022242_0002_0FB7705359D1F470"/>upon his calling in the miniſtry, and not to entangle himſelf in the affairs of life, that he may pleaſe him by whom he is called to his ſpiritual warfare; and nothing but real neceſſity may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the contrary. His whole time and ſtrength is little enough to be employed in the work and ſervice he is called to. He muſt give himſelf to the miniſtry of the word, and prayer, and continue in reading, meditation, &amp;c. as a man wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the goſpel ſervice; and is therefore, by his call to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, ſecluded from thoſe ways and means of providing for his own ſubſiſtence, as the trades and ſecular employments of others furniſh them with, that his mind, by the cares of worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may not be diverted from that ſtudy of God's word, and care of ſouls, which the duty of his ſtation engageth him to. And if he may not expoſe himſelf to the careful thoughts that accompany worldly buſineſs, though tending to his own profit, certainly it is no way meet, that he ſhould be left to conflict with the cares of a neceſſitous condition, whilſt thoſe he miniſters to have means to prevent it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is no leſs the duty of a miniſter than of other men, to provide for his family, and (what lies in him) to take care of his wife and children, that they may not be expoſed to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miſeries and temptations, when he is gone. I confeſs, of all men in the world, a covetous, raking temper worſt becomes a miniſter; but we greatly miſtake, if we think he muſt diveſt himſelf of the due affection of an huſband towards his wife, or of a father towards his children; or, that theſe fruits thereof, which are juſtly eſteemed commendable in others, ſhould be a fault in him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An elder, or biſhop is under a ſpecial charge to uſe hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in himſelf a pattern of charity, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate bounty to poor ſouls; and if it be his duty to be hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and charitable in an eminent degree, then without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy the people are concerned to endeavour that he may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of giving proof of this grace in him, by the exerciſe of it as there is occaſion.</p>
            <p>'Theſe things being premiſed, I ſhall ſhew you, that you lie under the ſtrongeſt obligation imaginable to this duty;
<list>
                  <item>'1. By the law of nature.</item>
                  <item>'2. By the expreſs command and appointment of Chriſt.</item>

               </list>
            </p>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> matter of equity and juſtice. And from hence our apoſtle takes his firſt plea, in 1 Cor. 9, 7. &amp;c. <hi>Who go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th a warfare any time at his own charges? Who planteth a Vineyard, and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the fruit thereof? Or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</hi> The miniſtry is a warfare, undertaken at the command of Chriſt, for the ſervice of your ſouls; and it is as reaſonable that the miniſter ſhould receive a ſupply of outward things from you, as that a faithful ſoldier ſhould receive his pay from his captain, at the charge of the commonwealth, for whoſe good he militates, Shall a man feed a flock (as a paſtor does) and be denied to eat of the milk of that flock, which it is his work to keep and feed? Or, is it conſiſtent with common juſtice, to deprive a man of the fruit of that Vineyard, which is planted and manured by his own labour? Such is the caſe, in reſpect of maintenance, between a miniſter and the people.—It is not your charity that I aſk for him, but juſtice and debt that I plead for: he is employed in your ſervice, and of right ſhould live upon your charge; nay, you have called him off from other buſineſs, and therefore his maintenance is due from you, as is the wages of your ſervant, though I fear ſome give more to the meaneſt ſervant in their houſe, than they are willing to do to their miniſter. Certainly, if you chuſe as you ought, your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are not of the loweſt of the people, but may be allowed to have a ſhare of parts, common prudence, and ability for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, with other men; and could manage trades, or fall into other employments, and get eſtates as well as you, if they were not <hi>devoted to a better ſervice:</hi> and muſt they needs be devoted to neceſſities and miſery, in the ſame hour that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> upon the miniſtry? my brethren, this ought not to be. Let your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have as good a treatment at leaſt, as the law provided for the <hi>ox that treads out the corn,</hi> who might not be <hi>muzzled.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this written for the ſake of oxen; for, <hi>doth God take care of oxen?</hi> or were there no higher end of this law, than that the brute creature ſhould not be abuſed? certainly there was; <hi>And for your ſakes no doubt was this written, that he that ploweth, ſhould plow in hope; and he that threſheth in hope, ſhould be partaker of his hope: for if we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnal things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Secondly; The Lord hath not leſt us to argue this only from general principles of reaſon, and common equity; but to put the matter beyond diſpute, hath ſuperadded his <hi>expreſs command</hi> Thus he provided for his miniſters in the time of the law, which
<pb facs="unknown:022242_0003_0FB770561E1CE878"/>the Apoſtle urgeth in the next place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Do ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> know, that they which miniſter about holy things, live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar, are partakers with the altar?</hi> God did no ſooner ſeparate the <hi>Levites</hi> to the ſervice of the ſanctuary, but he by law provided for their ſubſiſtence; and though they were but one tribe in twelve, yet the tenth of the increaſe of the whole land was given to them. beſides the firſt fruits and offerings, and divers other advantages; ſo that their lot might equal, yea, exceed that of their brethren. This law is now abrogated, and we pretend to no right of tithing your eſtates; but the equity of it can never ceaſe; neither hath Chriſt left goſpel miniſters to the wide world, but hath made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for them alſo, ſo far as the intereſt of his command will go with them that profeſs his name; for ſo it follows <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the goſpel, ſhould live of the goſpel.</hi> The <hi>labourer</hi> is ſtill <hi>worthy</hi> of his <hi>hire,</hi> and not the <hi>leſs worthy,</hi> becauſe he <hi>labours in the goſpel.</hi> Though indeed (if men did fully come up to their duty, yet ſtill) the charge of goſpel worſhip will appear very inconſiderable, when compared with that of the law; for were that my buſineſs, I think I could demonſtrate, that the fifth part of their eſtates was yearly to be ſpent in things relating to the temple ſervice. And if we are ſenſible of the great privilege and bleſſing of the goſpel, on higher accounts than merely the eaſe of thoſe burthens, we ſhall never think much to defray the moderate charge of a goſpel mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, in ſuch a manner as to give reputation to our profeſſion.</p>
            <p>'Thirdly: That you may prevent the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>inconvenience</hi> that follows the neglect of this duty, it concerns you cheerfully to practiſe it: I might have ſaid, <hi>evils</hi> and <hi>inconveniencies,</hi> as of many, for many there are, and thoſe of eaſy obſervation to an unprejudiced eye; but it is the <hi>diſcouragement of ſtudy,</hi> which at preſent I chiefly aim at. That ſtudy muſt needs be diſcouraged (I intend the ſtudy of theology) by the people's neglect to make a comfortable proviſion for their miniſters, is too evident to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a proof. Who will apply himſelf to gather and lay up thoſe ſtores of ſolid learning, which are needful to a miniſter, when he can expect to purchaſe nothing to himſelf but poverty and diſtreſs thereby? or how ſhall a miniſter be capable to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh himſelf with <hi>univerſal knowledge</hi> of things relating to this work, that hath no means for providing for his own informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or no time free from cares and worldly buſineſs? and the diſadvantage of this will at laſt fall to the ſhare of the people that

And it is not without diligent and continued ſtudy, that the deep things of God can be ſearched out, and ſo propoſed to you, as to enrich your mind with the clear and ſolid knowledge of them. I confeſs a little learning, and leſs ſtudy, may furniſh a man with ſuch a diſcourſe, as may pleaſe ſome weak perſons, that judge of a ſermon by the loudneſs of the voice, and affectionate ſentences, or can fancy themſelves to be fed with the aſhes of jingling words, and cadency of terms in a diſcourſe. But alas! the ſeeming warmth of affection that is ſtirred up by ſuch means, is as ſhort liv'd as a land flood that hath no ſpring to feed it. He that will do the ſouls of his people good, and approve himſelf a paſtor after God's own heart, muſt feed them with knowledge and underſtanding, and endeavour to maintain a conſtant zeal and affection in them, by well informing their judgments, and ſuch an opening of the mind of God from the ſcriptures as may command their conſciences—and this is not to be expected, but from him that labours in his ſtudy, as well as in the pulpit. Miſtake me not; I know the ſucceſs and fruit of all the ſtudies and labours of men that preach in the goſpel, is from the grace and power of the Holy Ghoſt, but the <hi>aſſiſtance of the ſpirit</hi> is to be expected by us in the <hi>way of our duty.</hi> Theſe things might be yet applied more home to my preſent purpoſe; but perhaps ſome will think there is too much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> already (though I heartily wiſh more were not needful) and my time calls me to put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to this exerciſe.'</p>
            <p>Two queſtions yet remain to be conſidered, which belong to this important ſubject, viz.
<list>
                  <item>1. In what method may this duty be diſcharged.</item>
                  <item>2. To what penalty are members of churches ſubjected, who, though able, refuſe to obey this law of Jeſus Chriſt?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, by what method may the churches ſupport the goſpel miniſtry? anſwer, every church is at liberty to chuſe its own method. There are three methods which we beg leave to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a <hi>voluntary ſubſcription.</hi> But it has been found by long experience that this is not the moſt eligible. It is an eaſy thing for a man to ſign his name to a paper, but it has been found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb facs="unknown:022242_0004_0FB770571E5D54A8"/>difficult, and in many inſtances impoſſible to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> money that had been ſubſcribed. Hence many miniſters have contracted debts for the ſupport of their families in confidence of the money ſubſcribed, who have been unable to pay them; and thereby their feelings and their characters have been wounded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond method is by raiſing a fund in the reſpective churches, and appropriating the annual intereſt of it to the maintenance of the goſpel miniſtry. There are many ways by which ſuch funds may be raiſed, which will be eaſy to the people, viz. By weekly, monthly, or quarterly aſſociations of the friends of religion, who may ſpend their time at ſuch meetings on ſome doctrine or practice in the churches, and at each meeting throw into a common ſtock 1 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> 2 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> more or leſs as they ſhall agree among themſelves. However ſmall this fund may appear at the beginning, it will in time increaſe ſo much as to become a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of importance. Such perſons as have it in their power may give while living, or bequeath at their death certain ſums depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in the ſtanding fund.—Thus ſome of our churches to the weſtward ſupport the goſpel.</p>
            <p>A third method is by a <hi>voluntary</hi> aſſeſſment upon the eſtates of each member of the congregation. Let a liſt of property be given in to the ſociety, and each perſon's proportion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence be aſcertained by it; in this caſe, there will be an equality, for each member of the ſociety will bear his part of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Nor can we think that any but the covetous will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to it. No man in this caſe will pay more than he can afford, according to his eſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To what penalty do thoſe members of churches ſubject themſelves, who, though able, refuſe to obey this law of Chriſt? anſwer, they fly in the face of divine authority; and are guilty of an act of diſobedience to the command of Jeſus Chriſt; and an act of injuſtice to their miniſter, as obſerved in the extract; therefore we believe that they ought to be dealt with as any other delinquent members. Moſt certainly they walk diſorderly. If they loved their adorable maſter and his cauſe; they would not refuſe to ſupport it according to their ability.</p>
            <p>Thoſe perſons who go from other ſocieties to ſave their money ought to find no protection among the Baptiſt churches, and we muſt believe this is their motive, if they refuſe to pay their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the expence of the goſpel among us.</p>

N. B. The times of holding the aſſociations are mentioned; but it is to be obſerved that whereas 'tis mentioned 1ſt, 2d, 3d, 4th Saturday in ſuch a month, it ought in many caſes to be Saturday before the 1ſt, 2d, 3d 4th Sunday in the month. The aſſociations in the northern ſtates are holden generally two days, but in the ſouthern ſtates at leaſt three.</p>
