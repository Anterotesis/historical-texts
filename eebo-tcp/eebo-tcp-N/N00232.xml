            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Reasons for the Inditement of the D. of York, presented to the Grand Jury of Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex, Saturday, June 26. 80. By the Persons hereunder Named.</head>
            <p n="1">I. BEcause the 25<hi>th. Car.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> when an Act was made to throw Popish Recusants out of all Offices and Places of Trust. The Duke of <hi>York</hi> did lay down several great Offices and Places (as Lord High Admiral of <hi>England, Generalissimo</hi> of all his Majesties For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both by Land and Sea; Governour of the Cinque Ports; and divers others) thereby to avoid the Punishment of that Law against Papists.</p>
            <p>II. 30<hi>th. Car.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> When an Act was made to disable Papists from sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in either House of Parliament; There was a <hi>Proviso</hi> inserted in that Act, <hi>That it should not extend to the Duke of</hi> York: On purpose to save his Right of sitting in the Lords House; though he refuseth to take those Oathes which the Protestant Peers ought to do.</p>
            <p>III. That his Majesty in his Speech <hi>March,</hi> 6. the 31. <hi>year</hi> of his Reign, doth give for a Reason to the Parliament, why he sent his Brother out of <hi>England;</hi> because he would leave no man room to say that he had not removed all cause which might influence him to Popish Counsels.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That there have been divers Letters read in both Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and at the secret Committees of both Houses from several Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals and others at <hi>Rome;</hi> and also from other <hi>Popish</hi> Bishops and Agents of the <hi>Pope,</hi> in other Forreign parts, which do apparently shew the great correspondencys between the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> and the <hi>Pope.</hi> And how the <hi>Pope</hi> could not choose but weep for joy, at the reading of some of the Dukes Letters, and what great satisfaction it was to the <hi>Pope</hi> to hear the D. was advanced to the Cath. Religion. <hi>T</hi>hat the <hi>Pope</hi> has granted <hi>Breev's</hi> to the D., sent him <hi>Beads,</hi> ample <hi>Indulgences,</hi> with much more to this purpose.</p>
            <p>V. That the whole House of Commons hath declared him to be a <hi>Papist</hi> in their Votes, <hi>Sunday, April</hi> 6<hi>th.</hi> 1679. Resolved, <hi>nemine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicente,</hi> That the Duke of <hi>York's</hi> being a Papist, and the hopes of his coming such to the Crown, has given the greatest countenance and incouragement to the present Conspiracy and Designes of the Papists against the King and Protestant Religion.—What this Conspiracy and Design is, will appear by a Declaration of both Houses of Parliament, <hi>March</hi> 25. 79. Resolved, <hi>Nemine contradicente,</hi> by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament Assembled; That they do declare, That they are fully satisfied, by the proofs they have heard, there now is, and for divers years last past hath been a horrid and Treasonable Plot and Conspiracy, contrived and carried on by those of the Popish Religion, for the Murthering of his Majesties sacred Person, and for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Protestant Religion, and the antient well established Government of this Realm.</p>
            <p>VI.That besides all this Proof, and much more to this purpose, it is most notorious and evident he hath for many years absented himself from Protestant Churches during Religious Worship.</p>
            <p>These are the Reasons why we believe the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to be a Papist.</p>
