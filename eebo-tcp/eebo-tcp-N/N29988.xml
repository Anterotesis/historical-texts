            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Occaſion of this Meeting, was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Requeſt of <hi>Mary Man</hi> of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon,</hi> who ſent us Word that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be Baptiſed by our Society according to the Rule given in Scripture, by <hi>Burying in the Water;</hi> and upon our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this Meſſage, and conſidering that Chriſt's Ordinances ought to be Publickly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, we drew up a Paper Signed by ſeveral of us, Signifying the time when we deſigned to Adminiſter the Ordinance; which Paper was publickly ſet up in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> ſome Weeks before the time appointed; and though we ordered our Meeting there, <hi>(viz.)</hi> at <hi>Lebanon</hi> to begin on the firſt day of the Week, the day which we uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meet on as well as the reſt of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, yet we appointed the ſecond day of the Week for the Adminiſtration of the Ordinance, deſigning thereby to give the greater opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to any to be preſent, that otherwiſe might be prevented by their own Meetings. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly when the day came, we ſet out from our ſeveral Habitations in order to attend our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Meeting; and as we were paſſing through <hi>Norwich,</hi> we were ſtopt by the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and a rude Company of young Men, who

The next day we were very cruelly whipt with an unmerciful Inſtrument, and then ſent back to <hi>New-London</hi> and committed to Priſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhall proceed to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the aforeſaid Pamphlet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In page firſt he calls the Sufferers <hi>Notorious Offenders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his 2d. page he ſignifies, that the Offence which theſe Offenders gave, was with notorious aggravating Circumſtances. In his 3d. page he declares, that the Perſon here named, <hi>(viz.) An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Davis,</hi> was one of <hi>John Rogers</hi>'s Brethren in Iniquity and Tranſgreſſion, and that they were Travelling from <hi>New-London</hi> and <hi>Groton,</hi> with a deſign for <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and all this as pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly as needleſsly ſhall be made evident, <hi>(Says he.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his 4th. page he ſignifies, that we were equally concerned in the Adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and that we knew not who ſhould be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately call'd to do it when we came there, and that there was not any of us that pretended to be an Officer more than the reſt. Whereupon he argues, that we were very ignorant or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of that Text. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. <hi>And no Man taketh the Honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was</hi> Aaron.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That by this Account which he here gives, it is very manifeſt that none

               </gap>e waiting on God to know his Mind and Will in the matter, and who he would call to the Work, like as did thoſe Servants of the Lord that were in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts 13.1, 2, 3. verſes; who not preſuming to take the Honour to themſelves, were in like manner waiting for a Call from God. By which it is manifeſt that they knew not who the Lord would Call to that Work, until he made it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to them, by commanding them to ſeparate <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſo when they were called of God as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> they immediately attended on the Work.</p>
            <p>Now the falſe Teachers and Hirelings which the World heaps up to themſelves, ſpoken of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. are not Called of God as was <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> but have their Call and Authority from Men, and by human Art prepare themſelves for their Trade as other Crafts-Men do, and then through Covetouſneſs with feigned or ſtudied words, make Merchandize of the People, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. Chap. 1, and 3. verſes. Now theſe falſe Teachers here deſcribed, are they who are not called of God as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> but for the lucre of great Sums of Money, preſume to take the Honour to themſelves of being call'd Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By all which it is manifeſt that he greatly wreſts this Scripture through his own darkneſs. Now in the latter part of this 4th. page he begins to ſet forth, what was the Notorious aggravating Circumſtance of theſe Notorious Offenders Offence. And firſt he ſeems to Inſinuate, as if we ordere'd our coming
<pb n="6"

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> our other Company to meet them returning from their Sacramental Solemnity. Yet in the begining of his 5th. Page he ſeems to yield that this coming might be purely accidental, and ſo anſwers himſelf; and ſaves me the trouble of anſwering him to this matter. For moſt certain our coming into Town at that time, was purely accidental as he allows, nor did we know what buſineſs they were upon; being only deſigned to paſs along the Country-Road to our own Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now let the Reader judge, whether our paſſing along the Road to our own Meeting, was any more juſt ground of Offence to them, than their doing the like was to us, or whether it was not ſo far wide of the Golden Rule, to do to all Men, as ye would they ſhould do to you; that it bears the plain Image of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>In the next place he adds, that we might have gone another way. To which I anſwer, that I never knew or underſtood that there was any way to <hi>Lebanon</hi> from <hi>New-London</hi> or <hi>Groton,</hi> but that Road, except we had croſſed a multitude of Fields and Incloſures, whereby we ſhould have given juſt grounds of Offence to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by treſpaſſing upon their Fences and Lands, and unaccountable Difficulty to our ſelves, and might juſtly have been puniſhed for Treſpaſſers; and it is marvellous that even <hi>Envy</hi> it ſelf ſhould ſo much blind any Perſon, as to cauſe them to deſire to put their Neighbours upon ſuch an unreaſonable and unlawful Action.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>He proceeds alſo to inform the Reader, that the firſt Company brought a Chair with them, to aggravate the Offence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> That there was a ſmall Child's Chair brought for the Relief of a poor diſtreſſed Child, which the Grand-father, Grand-mother and Uncle were carrying to its Mother at <hi>Lebanon,</hi> (I grant) which diſtreſſed Child was attended with a ſore Malady, whereby the Bowels often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fell out of the Body in great quantities, to the wonderful Anguiſh and Diſtreſs of the Child; and there being no way to help or move the Child many times but in the Chair, ſo that the neceſſity of the Chair was ſo apparant to all the Spectators, that not one of them blamed us on that account; nor did the Juſtice make it any Article againſt us: And therefore it is very unfair for him to endeavour to deceive the World, by giving ſo unintelligible an Account of that matter.</p>
            <p>He alſo adds, That ſome of the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany called out to the People, <hi>Did ye not hear there is a ſolemn Ordinance to be adminiſtred to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row upon a Perſon at</hi> Lebanon, <hi>according to Chriſt's Inſtitution?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> This is another of the notorious ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating Circumſtances which he charges the Sufferers to be guilty of. And indeed it is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great Lamentation to conſider, that ſuch who call themſelves Chriſtians, ſhould ſo long practice the Ordinances contrary to Chriſt's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: That they ſhould be ſo hardned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as not to indure to be told that they are like to be adminiſtred according to Chriſt's Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:039855_0007_101490F5D7A58B08"/>He farther adds as follows, <hi>And though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtly thought a matter of Conſcience in them, to come to us in ſuch Time and Manner, when they knew it was contrary to the Law of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt of theſe Aſſertions, <hi>(viz.) That we came to them,</hi> I utterly deny; for we were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſing along the Country Road towards our own Meeting, and was got onward of our way beyond their Meeting Houſe, I ſuppoſe the beſt part of a Mile, where they came to us, and with Violence ſtopt us, and made Priſoners of us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which it is manifeſt that it was they that came to us, &amp; not we to them, as he has wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted.</p>
            <p>He alſo aſſerts, That we knew it was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Law of the Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here I think he does the Government no Honour by informing the World, that they have made Laws to debar ſuch as differ from them in matters of Religion, the liberty of the Kings High way to paſs to their own Meetings, ſince our Lord the King hath granted equal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience to all diſſenters to hold their Meetings, and ſerve God according to their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>In his 7th. page he aſſerts, that we knew not who or whether any of us was to Baptiſe, or whether any Perſon would be Baptiſed, and ſo <hi>(ſays he)</hi> it proved the next time when they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally went to <hi>Lebanon,</hi> under the ſame Pretence, Baptiſm was not adminiſtred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here again I muſt deny his aſſertions; for the very next time that we went up pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039855_0008_101490F75A715920"/>
to Adminiſter the Ordinance, it was actually done, and another Perſon who was convinced by our means, <hi>(viz.) Eliſha Man,</hi> was alſo Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed at the ſame time. Indeed there was before this three of us that went up to viſit our Friends, and hold a Meeting among them, but with no pretence of Baptiſing any Perſon at that time.</p>
            <p>However he makes theſe falſe aſſertions a foundation to build ſome of his Mocks and Scoffs on, for he immediately adds, that our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit doth ſometimes deceive us, as it did our great Apoſtle the late <hi>John Rogers,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from the Inſpiration of it, that he was proof againſt all Infection of Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to put the matter upon Tryal, daringly ventured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Boſton</hi> in the time of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> but receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Infection and dyed of it, with ſeveral of his Family taking it from him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here I think he plainly diſcovers his unchriſtianlike and unmanly ſpirit, by Raking a Man out of his Grave to be the Subject of his Game; and it is great Preſumptuouſneſs in him, to take upon him to judge one that is gone into the Hands of a Righteous Judge. For in the firſt place he aſſerts, That our <hi>Infallible Spirit deceives us as it did</hi> John Rogers, <hi>who pretended from the Inſpiration of it, that he was proof againſt all Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Body,</hi> &amp;c. Now I am fully perſwaded that <hi>J. R.</hi> never ſpake thoſe words but that <hi>J. Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kus</hi> is highly guilty of ſlandering him in his Grave concerning this matter. He alſo adds, <hi>That to put the matter upon tryal, daringly ventured into</hi> Boſton, <hi>in the time of the</hi> Small Pox, <hi>but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Infection and ayed of it, with ſeveral of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039855_0009_101490FA2244FEB8"/>
his Family.</hi> Now how preſumptuous and ſenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Judgment is it for him to aſſert, that his going to <hi>Boſton</hi> was <hi>daringly to put the matter upon Tryal,</hi> when it is well known that it had been his Practice for more than forty years paſt, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit all ſick Perſons as often as he had opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and particularly thoſe who had the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> when in the height of their Diſtemper he has ſat on their Bed-ſide ſeveral hours at a time, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of the things of God; ſo that his going to <hi>Boſton</hi> the laſt time, was no other than his conſtant Practice had been ever ſince he made a profeſſion of Religion. Now it is certain that <hi>J. Rogers</hi> in his life time, and all his Society to this day, do firmly believe from the teſtimony of the Scripture, that God's Protection is with his faithful Children through the Courſe of this Life, to continue them to old Age, (notwithſtanding the Calamities which he ſends on the Earth,) except when he Calls them to lay down their Lives for his Truth by way of Martyrdom, as may be ſeen abundantly in Scripture. <hi>Job.</hi> 6.26. <hi>Thou ſhalt come to thy Grace in a full Age, like as a ſhock of Corn cometh in in his Seaſon.</hi> Pſal. 91.16. <hi>With long life will I ſatisfy him,</hi> &amp;c. Now the Age of Man is ſet forth in Scripture to be ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, as is to be ſeen <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.10. <hi>The days of our years are three ſcore years and ten,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now although we have the Scripture plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to confirm us in this Principle of God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting his faithful Children to old age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet we know it is <hi>appointed for all Men once to die,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what is written <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. and by what manner of Death it may pleaſe God to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:039855_0010_101490FEA501ADB8"/>
take them to himſelf, after he hath preſerved them to old age, he has not revealed to us, and therefore neither <hi>J. Rogers</hi> in his life time, nor any of his Society ſince his Death has underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to decide the matter; judging it to be one of thoſe ſecret things which God has not reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, and therefore is not our Buſineſs to meddle with, according to what is written <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>The ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God; but thoſe things which are revealed belong unto us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now let every unprejudiced Reader take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how little cauſe <hi>J. Backus</hi> has to reflect <hi>John Rogers</hi>'s manner of Death upon him, who lived to the age of ſeventy three years, and then died in his own Houſe, and on his own Bed, having his Reaſon continued to the laſt, and manifeſting his Peace with God, and perfect aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of a better Life. He had alſo a very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy Death, without any ſtrugling or ſtriving, as is common to many People.</p>
            <p>He farther adds, <hi>That ſeveral of his Family alſo died, taking the diſtemper from</hi> him. To which I anſwer, That this is another miſtake, for not one of his Family died of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> tho' ſeveral of my Family did.</p>
            <p>He alſo adds, <hi>That more Inſtances of their decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be mentioned,</hi> &amp;c. To which I anſwer, That hitherto he has mentioned no deception at all, and therefore very improper to ſay, <hi>more might be mentioned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his 8th. page he ſays, we <hi>wilfully choſe the Corporal Puniſhment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:039855_0011_10149100293BCD28"/>And in the 9th. page he adds, That <hi>by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Choice we conſtrained him to order this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or diſregard the Law, and that in a moral ſenſe we whipt our own Backs, and may thank our ſelves for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here I cannot but take notice how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly he ſpeaks the Language of the <hi>Papiſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Martyrs, who always informed the World, that they choſe the Flames and were guilty of their own Deaths, and were Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, and might eſcape if they would, and that the Authority were compelled to Puniſh them, or diſregard the Laws, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By which it appears, that Perſecutors are not only of one ſpirit, out naturally ſpeak one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: And indeed I muſt confeſs, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my Judgment, the <hi>Papiſt</hi> ſpake as much Truth as <hi>J. Backus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Martyrs choſe the <hi>Flames</hi> as much as we choſe the Whip; for neither they nor we choſe either the Flames or the Whip, but as we were compelled thereto by our cruel Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p>In the next place he labours to hide the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Whip, he ſignifies that the Whip was but a ſingle Cord, without a knot in it.</p>
            <p>All which I allow to be true, for that the Cord was ſo large that it would not admit of a knot, but inſtead of a knot it was firmly whipt with a waxed thread at leaſt four Inches at the end, and then ſoaked in Liquor.</p>
            <p>He alſo adds in his 10th page, That <hi>he ſtood by and ſaw every ſtroke, and diſcovered not a drop of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039855_0012_10149103AA6D5BD0"/>
Blood, ſave only from ſome ſtrokes with the end of the Whip, under the Arms of ſome of them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here I can but marvel at his Confidence in rendering the Effects of the Whip ſo ſmall. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſince he produceth no better Proof for his aſſertion than his own bare Word, which to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove I ſhall Produce two ſufficient Teſtimonies; the firſt is the multitude of Spectators, whoſe Eyes ſaw the terrible Wounds which every ſtroke gave, excepting a few ſtrokes which accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took the Cloathing of one or two of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Teſtimony which I ſhall produce, is the Wounds in the Bodies of every one of the Sufferers, which till the Grave ſhall hide, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as a ſufficient Teſtimony to diſcover the deceit of his Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>In the ſame page he adds, <hi>That he ſaw no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inſult them or triumph in their Correction, but the whole multitude of Spectators with a becoming aſpect of</hi> Grief, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That although the whole Body of People (ſome few ſober Perſons only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) had ſpent the greateſt part of the day in as great Revilings, Mocks, Scoffs, Flouts and Deriſions perhaps as has been ſeen in any age of the World, by Perſecutors againſt God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which is a manifeſt Token of the Enmity that is between the ſeed of the Woman and the ſeed of the Serpent, yet it was very obſervable, that in the time of the Execution of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, it was acted with ſuch Barbarity, that it ſeemed to ſtrike a d<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mp upon the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; in ſo much that I never heard of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039855_0013_101491057758C320"/>
triumphing in their Suffering ſo much as <hi>J. Backus</hi> himſelf, who was obſerved by the Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators to ſmile at the Anguiſh of the tortured Sufferers: By which it is manifeſt, that he had no ground to take any Honour to himſelf of the Peoples not inſulting or triumphing over the Sufferers, ſince himſelf was the moſt forward to have moved them to it.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Page he ſpeaks deridingly of the Sufferers for calling upon God and Chriſt for Aſſiſtance and Support in the time of their Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That this is no new thing either for God's Children to call to their Heavenly Father for Help, when under the hands of their cruel Perſecutors, or for their Perſecutors to mock and deride them for it, as the Hiſtory of Perſecutions will fully prove; as alſo our Narative of the Wars in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with the <hi>Indians</hi> informs us, that ſome of the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Words which the Natives learned of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt help me;</hi> which Words they had learned of their diſtreſſed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, when under the Hands of their cruel Tormentors: Which Words thoſe Salvages would often repeat by way of Deriſion to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> perhaps too much in the ſame Spirit which <hi>J. B.</hi> here derides theſe Sufferers, where he calls them, <hi>Creatures in Human Shapes;</hi> and calls their Prayers <hi>wild and unſcriptural Zeal, and clamorous Invocations of the Name of God and Chriſt for Aſſiſtance and Support,</hi> &amp;c. However, that he may not remain ſo ignorant in the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer, I deſire him to read <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59, 60.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039855_0014_10149109F28A5EA8"/>
               <hi>And they ſtoned Stephen, calling upon God and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit: And he kneeled down and cryed with a loud voice,</hi> &amp;c. Here he may ſee that it is not unſcriptural for God's Children to call to their Heavenly Father when they are under the Hands of their cruel Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as we were at that time.</p>
            <p>In his 13th Page he gives a Record (of his own making) relating to <hi>John Bolles,</hi> which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord declares that <hi>J. Bolles</hi> acknowledged that he came from <hi>New-London,</hi> and was going to <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and that he knew it was contrary to our Law, and that they did it in defiance to the Law.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That God's three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were caſt into the fiery Furnace for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their defiance to the King's Law, which was made to force Men's Conſciences in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; and all the Prophets &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſuffered for oppoſing thoſe Laws which was ſet up to force Peoples Conſciences in matters of worſhipping God: And all the Martyrs which have ſuffered the Flames and other Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ever ſince, it has been for manifeſting their defiance to ſuch Laws as have been ſet up by the worldly Government to uphold falſe Worſhip, or to reſtrain them from worſhipping God according to their Conſciences. Now for as much as God has juſtified all thoſe Sufferers above-mentioned, for their bold defiance of ſuch Laws as were ſet up by Man to prevent People ſerving God according to their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, well may we have Confidence that God will juſtify us for the ſame thing. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039855_0015_1014910C7503C700"/>
farther to plead in our own Juſtification in this matter than thoſe Sufferers above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had, in as much as our Lord the King has granted us the ſame liberty to meet together and worſhip God according to our Conſciences, as he has given to our Perſecutors: So that in the conſideration of what is here expreſt, I think <hi>J. Bolles</hi> and his Brethren are highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable for their faithfulneſs to God, in manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their defiance againſt ſuch Laws as would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from worſhipping God according to their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>In his 14th. page he charges the Sufferers to be moſt <hi>daring and malicious Offenders, utterly diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding thoſe Scriptures,</hi> Rom. 13. Tit. 3. 1 Pet. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> My Anſwer to theſe laſt Charges will conſiſt chiefly in opening theſe Scriptures which he has here wreſted, and reſtoring them to their natural Senſe; by which it will appear, that he is one of thoſe <hi>unlearned and unſtable Souls</hi> ſpoken of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. who <hi>wreſt the Scripture to their own Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt place I ſhall fully grant from thoſe Scriptures, and many more that might be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, that the worldly Government is ſet up of God, and are God's Miniſters to act in worldly matters between Man and Man, and that the Law which God hath put into their Hands is good, if they uſe it lawfully; that is to Puniſh Murtherers of Fathers and Murtherers of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Man-ſlayers, Whoremongers, and them that defile themſelves with Mankind; for Men-ſtealers, for Liars, for perjured Perſons,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039855_0016_1014910E289B7260"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> According to what is written 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>And while the worldly Government act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Commiſſion, God is with them, and has put ſuch Carnal Weapons in their Hands, as is ſufficient to rule all Carnal Perſons, which are Stocks, Fines, Priſons, Whips and Gallows: Which above-named Weapons are ſufficient to conquer and ſubdue all carnal and guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo that Rulers are a <hi>Terror to evil doers.</hi> And for as much as we acknowledge the worldly Government to be ſet up of God, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways paid all publick Demands for the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame; as Town-Rates, County-Rates and Country-Rates, and all other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, excepting ſuch as are for the upholding of Hireling Miniſters and falſe Teachers, which God has called us to teſtify againſt. Now when the worldly Rulers take upon themſelves to make Laws relating to God's Worſhip, and thereby to force and command Men's Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and ſo turn their Sword againſt God's Children, they then act beyond their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and out of their Juriſdiction; and are ſo far from being God's Miniſters, that they are fighters againſt God and his Church; and God is ſo far from making them a Terror to his Church, that he gives his Church and People Faith and Boldneſs to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them to their Faces; Nor are their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weapons able to overcome God's Children, whoſe Weapons are not <hi>carnal but mighty, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4 And that this is a right Expoſition of all thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures quoted by him, I ſhall prove by theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Texts of Scripture; <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>O
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039855_0017_1014910FC521FAE8"/>
thou King, the moſt high God gave</hi> Nebuchadnezzer <hi>thy Father a Kingdom, and Majeſty, and Glory, and Honour, and for the Majeſty that he gave him, all People Nations and Languages trembled and feared before him,</hi> &amp;c. Thus it appears that <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer</hi> was ſet up of God to act in the worldly Government, and that God laid a Terror upon all his ſubjects to fear and tremble at his Preſence ſo long as he acted within the Bounds of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but when he exceeded the Bounds of his Commiſſion, by acting in matters of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which was out of his Juriſdiction, God's Children publickly withſtood him, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Face manifeſted their defiance to his Laws: And God was ſo far from laying his Terror on them, that he gave them Faith pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to oppoſe him; nor was his Carnal Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons able to compel them to attend his falſe Worſhip, as may be ſeen <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. Alſo ſaith Chriſt in that 10th of <hi>Mat.</hi> 27, 28. <hi>What I tell you in darkneſs, that ſpeak ye in light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And fear not them which kill the Body,</hi> &amp;c. Here Chriſt commands his Children to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, and not to fear them that kill the Body. Now we know that thoſe which kill the Bodies of God's Children are the worldly Powers, when they exceed their Commiſſion, (which is only to judge in worldly matters) then they turn fighter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt God, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his Children; for the worldly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the Kingdoms of this World, but Chriſt's Kingdom is not of this World. <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.36. And when the Man in the Goſpel deſired Chriſt to ſpeak to his Brother to divide the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:039855_0018_1014911161F106A0"/>
Inheritance, he refuſed to do it, ſignifying it was not his Buſineſs to judge in ſuch matters. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.13, 14. Nor would he condemn the Woman taken in Adultery, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. becauſe ſuch Judgment did properly belong to the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Government, and not to Chriſt's Kingdom: For Chriſt's Church is his Kingdom, and they are not of this World, for he hath choſen them out of the World. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19.</p>
            <p>And now though I might go on to multiply Scriptures to prove this great Truth, <hi>(viz)</hi> That the worldly Rulers are not impowered by God to act in matters of Worſhip to God, but only in worldly Affairs; yet I muſt deſiſt at preſent, for that I only intended Brevity in this ſmall Volume; but do boldly affirm, that Chriſt's Church ſince his coming in the Fleſh, are no where commanded to be ſubject to the worldly Powers relating to God's Worſhip, and ſo ſhall forbear at preſent to enlarge upon this Subject, deſiring <hi>Joſeph Backus</hi> (if he be able) to produce Scripture to the contrary.</p>
            <p>In the next place it may be needful for the ſatisfaction of the Reader, to look back and obſerve what are the Crimes which he charges the Sufferers to be guilty of, and which are to be ſeen in his fifth page. The firſt is our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing along the Country Road towards our own Meeting.</p>
            <p>The next Crime which he charges us with, is the merciful act in carrying the ſmall Chair for the Relief of the diſtreſſed Child, of which I have already given a particular Account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:039855_0019_10149114FA68CDF8"/>The third Crime he charges us with is, That ſome of our Company asked ſome People if they did not hear that there was a ſolemn Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to be Adminiſtred to Morrow on a Perſon at <hi>Lebanon,</hi> according to Chriſt's Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? Now how Criminal theſe three Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles will appear in the Eyes of indifferent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I know not, but doubtleſs they ſeem very great to <hi>J. Backus,</hi> otherwiſe he would not have made uſe of ſo much foul and Railing Language againſt the Sufferers as he has done throughout his Book; as in page firſt he calls them <hi>Notorious Offenders.</hi> Pape 2d. he charges them to be guilty of <hi>Notorious aggravating Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</hi> Page 3d. he ſays, <hi>The Perſon here named, was one of</hi> John Rogers<hi>'s Brethren in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Tranſgreſſion,</hi> and that our deſign for <hi>Lebanon</hi> was <hi>needleſly and perniciouſly.</hi> Page 9th. he calls them <hi>Notorious Malefactors.</hi> Page 10. he calls them <hi>Creatures in human ſhapes.</hi> Page 19. he calls them Miſcreants, or <hi>Infidels,</hi> and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them with tranſgreſſing the Laws of God, but doth not mention what Law of God they were found in the Tranſgreſſion of. Surely paſſing along the Road to our Meeting, could be no Tranſgreſſion of the Laws of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the merciful Deed done to the Child be contrary to any Law of God, neither could our informing our Neighbours concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt's Ordinance be a breach of God's Laws. Now I deſire him to conſider, whether all this evil Communication above-mentioned doth not prove him to be guilty of corrupting good Manners, according to what is written
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:039855_0020_10149117840E7F78"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.33. <hi>Be not deceived, evil Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons corrupt good Manners.</hi> Or whether ſuch Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth not prove him to be a Railer, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Reviling of his Neighbours doth not prove him to be a Reviler, which if he be ſuch a Perſon he may ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. that no ſuch Perſon ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>In his 24th Page he ſignifies, that ſome of the People at <hi>Norwich</hi> offered freely to pay the fine for ſome of us, and that we refuſed the Kindneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the Week after being ſentenced at <hi>Lebanon</hi> to undergo the ſame Puniſhment; that our Courage failed ſo as to accept a Diſcharge by other Men's Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That if he had ſaid that ſome at <hi>Norwich</hi> talked of paying the Fine and did not do it, but at <hi>Lebanon</hi> they actually did pay it, he had then ſaid Truth; for we were no more active in that matter at <hi>Lebanon,</hi> than we were at <hi>Norwich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the latter end of the ſame Page, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 25th. he adds, That we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged a Diſpute on thoſe Articles, the <hi>Sabbath</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and had a publick Confutation by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>Williams,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here he boldly aſſerts, that we had a publick Confutation on thoſe Articles the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> but he produceth no better Proof for his Aſſertion, than his own bare Word, which I think is not a ſufficient Proof to ſatisfy the World that it was really ſo. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for the better ſatisfaction of all Perſons in that matter, we do here freely offer him to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:039855_0021_10146B88071E8E38"/>
manage thoſe two Points againſt any two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters which he ſhall make choice of in <hi>New-England;</hi> either thoſe which he has here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or any other, if he knows any more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than they. And farther, that we will give him his choice to do it either in Writing or publick Diſpute; and that we will be at the one half of the Charge to print and publiſh it to the World; whereby every one may judge for themſelves, and not be confined to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that matter. And that he may be at no loſs in the matter, we will here ſtate the Points to be debated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We deny that the Name <hi>Sabbath</hi> is any where in Scripture impoſed on the firſt Day of the Week.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We deny that Chriſt or any of his Diſciples have left any Command, Precedent or Example for the keeping the firſt day of the Week as a <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Holy time</hi> throughout the New-Teſtament, or given it any Name ſuperior to any other day of the Week.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We affirm from the Scripture, that Water Baptiſm was and ought to be Adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by Burying in the Water.</p>
            <p>And we utterly deny that there is either Command or Example in Scripture for ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Infants.</p>
            <p>And theſe great Truths we are ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend as aboveſaid.</p>
            <p>In his 24th. page he ſays, <hi>That as much of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty as there was in this, (viz.</hi> our whipping,) <hi>ſome of them did notwithſtanding their ſore Backs, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly expoſe themſelves by the like Crime, to the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:039855_0022_1014911BC4FD7B28"/>
like Puniſhment the Week after at</hi> Lebanon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Here he plainly makes it manifeſt, that his cruel Perſecution wrought no effect upon the Sufferers; but even as it has always been obſerved, that when Perſecutors have act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt Tyranical Cruelty againſt God's Children, that God hath at ſuch times in a ſpecial manner appeared, by giving Faith and boldneſs to his Children to oppoſe them in their Deluſions, ſo that they have never been able to ſtop their Teſtimony, or hinder God's Work.</p>
            <p>Here likewiſe it is obſervable how contrary he is to himſelf, and how much he thwarts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Paſſages in the foregoing part of his Book; particularly in the 6th. page where he argues, That if they had not puniſhed us for this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, they might have had juſt Reaſon to conclude that we would have ſoon proceeded to give them diſturbance in the Publick Worſhip of the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that his argument in the 6th. page is as if their puniſhing us had prevented our farther proceedings of that nature: yet in his 24th. page he plainly confeſſes, that we did proceed the Week after in the ſame nature, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our ſore Backs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo in the 10th. page where he is labouring to hide the Cruelty of the Whipping, he ſays he ſtood by and ſaw every Stroke, and diſcovered not a drop of Blood, ſave only from ſome ſtrokes with the end of the Whip, under the Arm of ſome of them. But in this 24th. page he confeſſes, that notwithſtanding their ſore Backs, they did zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly expoſe themſelves by the like Crime the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:039855_0023_1014911E4A73C800"/>
Week after. Now it is certain that what he calls the like Crime was our going the next firſt day to hold our Meeting with our Brethren at <hi>Lebanon,</hi> which was ſeven days after. Now let any one judge, whether it is likely that our Backs could remain ſore ſeven days if there had been no Blood drawn, but only by ſome ſtrokes under the Arms of ſome of us.</p>
            <p>But I am willing to put the moſt Charitable Conſtruction upon theſe groſs Contradictions, and that is to ſuppoſe that they are occaſioned by the weakneſs of his Memory.</p>
            <p>Page 26th. he ſays that the word Perſecute ſignifies to follow hard after, and when uſed in ſuch a ſenſe as is here intended, it ſignifies to purſue Men with wild and ungoverned Zeal for malicious deſigns upon them for the ſake of their Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here I allow his Expoſition of the word to be right, and then how fully has he proved their proceeding againſt us to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, who when they firſt took us up it was I ſuppoſe near a Mile beyond their Meeting-houſe, onward of the Road towards our own Meeting. And ſeveral times ſince at <hi>Lebanon,</hi> when we have paſſed by their Meeting-houſe along the Road towards our own Meeting, their Conſtable has Preſt a conſiderable number of Men out of their Meeting-houſe, who with Horſes have followed hard after us with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed zeal, and have ſtopt us and made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of us for the ſake of our Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that by his own Confeſſion their proceeding againſt us is Perſecution. In the latter end of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:039855_0024_1014912128294FA0"/>
the 26th. and beginning of the 27th. page he falls to heaping up a great number of charges againſt us, in a very confuſed manner without any proof at all; ſome of which I ſuppoſe to be only the falſe Reports which our Enemies have ſcattered about the World. However, at the end of theſe charges he adds, That to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to forbear, our late honourable Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hath aſſured us, that if we would be quiet and worſhip God in our own way according to our Conſciences, he would puniſh any of their People that ſhould diſturb us in our Worſhip. Now for as much as he concludes all his charges with this Article of the Governour, I ſhall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly give the Reader an Account of that matter, which is as follows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt, I grant that the Governour did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually make this Promiſe, as fully as <hi>J. Backus</hi> has given it, and that it was in a Publick Court before a multitude of Hearers.</p>
            <p>Now ſome time after this, <hi>John Rogers,</hi> ſince deceaſed, and ſeveral of his Society (having as good a Right to <hi>New-London</hi> Meeting-houſe as any in the Town) did propoſe to hold our Meeting there at Noon-time, between the Meetings of the other Congregation, ſo as not to diſturb them in either of their Meetings. And accordingly we met there, and finding their Meeting not ended, we ſtood without Door until their Forenoon Meeting was ended and the People come out, and then <hi>John Rogers</hi> told them that our deſign was to make no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:039855_0025_10149124D7BE3770"/>
but to hold our Meeting while they were at Dinner, and when they were ready for their Afternoon Meeting we would deſiſt and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Whereupon I heard no Perſon manifeſt any diſlike of our proceedings. Whereupon <hi>J. Rogers</hi> went into the Seat which the Town Officers ſeated him in, after the Meeting-houſe was built, and proceeded to Expound a Chapter in the Bible. But in the time of our Meeting, the Conſtable was ſent with a Warrant to break up our Meeting, and was attended with a Rude Company of Men, who began to haul Men and Women out of the Meeting, committing ſome to Priſon, as did <hi>Paul</hi> in his unconverted ſtate, as may be ſeen <hi>Acts</hi> 8.3. And when <hi>Sarah Bolles,</hi> one of our Society, ſaw the Conſtable and his attendance carrying her Husband to Priſon by his Legs and Arms, with his Belly downward, in a very Cruel manner, ſhe and <hi>Joſiah Gates,</hi> another of our Society, went to the Governour, minding him of his late Promiſe to defend us in our Meetings from any that ſhould diſturb us, and deſired him that her Husband might not be ſo abuſed, but all the Relief they had, <hi>Joſiah Gates</hi> received a Box on the Ear from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's own Hand, and were both turned out of Doors by the Governour, and the next day the Governour ſat Judge himſelf of the matter, and Bound over <hi>J. Rogers</hi> to the County Court, charging him with a Riot, though all that he did was to Expound a Chapter as aforeſaid, and all that his People did, was to attend to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, in as quiet a manner as was ever in any Meeting in the Kings Dominions, till the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:039855_0026_10149129C10F4168"/>
Conſtable with his rude Attendance made the deſturbance. However the Court fined <hi>J. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> Ten Shillings, for which ten ſhillings and the Charges, Execution was given out, and the Shereff firſt took ten Sheep, and then complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they were not ſufficient to anſwer the Fine and Charges, and came a ſecond time and took a milch Cow out of the Paſture on the ſame account, and ſo we heard no more about it; by which I ſuppoſe that the Cow and ten Sheep ſatisfied them for the ten Shillings and Charges. And tho' for brevity I here omit to make any Proof of this matter, yet if <hi>Joſeph Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kus</hi> ſhall preſume to deny any part thereof, in my next <hi>Reply</hi> I ſhall prove every Article that I have here aſſerted. And I do farther add, that I know of no Protection that we have met with from the Authority relating to our Worſhip, but what has been of the ſame nature; and I deſire <hi>J. Backus</hi> (if he be able) to make the contrary appear. By which it is manifeſt, that his end in mentioning this Article of the Governour was to deceive the World, and to mock us.</p>
            <p>In his 27th Page he adds as follows, <hi>But if it were Perſecution, how ſtrangely have they forgot that Advice, When they perſecute you in one City, flee into another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> Here he greatly wreſts and abuſes the Scripture, for want of a right underſtanding thereof: For this Text which he mentions a ſmall part of, has only reference to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Commiſſion given by Chriſt to his Apoſtles,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:039855_0027_1014912B43D650A8"/>
as may be ſeen <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5, 6. <hi>Theſe twelve Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſent forth, and commanded them, ſaying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not. But go rather to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that under this Commiſſion the Apoſtles were ſtrictly commanded to go to none but the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and utterly forbidden to go to any other Nation. In the 9th and 10th Verſes he commands them to provide neither <hi>Gold nor Silver,</hi> &amp; <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Coats, nor Shoes,</hi> &amp;c. By which it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> under this Commiſſion they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> act with all the ſpeed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> allowing them time to provide Money, not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>fering them to burthen themſelves with Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the 23d Verſe he charges them, that if they were perſecuted <hi>in this City, to flee to another: For verily</hi> ſays he, <hi>ye ſhall not have gone over the Cities of Iſrael, till the Son of Man be come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that the Reaſon why Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles in ſuch great haſte at that time, was becauſe it was the will of God firſt to proclaim the coming of Chriſt, and the glad Tidings of the Goſpel to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> before other Nations had the offer of it.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſon why he did not allow them time to provide Money, nor ſuffer them to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then themſelves with Cloathing, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not to be ſtopt by Perſecution, but to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:039855_0028_1014912D11913CF8"/>
flee to the next City with their Meſſage, was becauſe the time that Chriſt would publiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Saviour of the World was ſo near at hand, that there was not time for the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles firſt to publiſh it in all the Cities of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and therefore the Lord ſoon after this, ſends other Seventy under the ſame Commiſſion, and with greater Injunctions to make ſpeed than the firſt, for they were forbidden to ſalute any Man by the way, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.4.</p>
            <p>Thus it plainly appears, that this Text of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> has only Reference to that particular <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> on given to the Apoſtles at that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>And there can be no greater abuſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than to apply it to wrong caſes; and Chriſt is ſo far from Countenancing his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſhuning Perſecution for his ſake, that he hath commanded them <hi>not to fear them that Kill the Body,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
