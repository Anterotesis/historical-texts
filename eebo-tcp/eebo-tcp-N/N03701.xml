            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HEN I ſee a Book well written for the <hi>Inſtruction of Mankind,</hi> I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ways hope it will ſpread its good Influences as far and wide as it finds Readers. But when I meet with a valuable Treatiſe, whoſe Deſign is to improve the ſacred <hi>Skill of Preaching,</hi> I am ready to perſwade myſelf, <q>Surely this will become a more extenſive Benefit; and the good Influences of it will reach as many whole Aſſemblies of Men, as there are Miniſters who ſhall happen to read it.</q> For this Reaſon I cannot but take a ſpecial Satisfaction in recommending theſe <hi>two Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes</hi> to the World, which, in my Opinion, are founded upon the general Principles of Chriſtianity, and therefore invite the Peruſal of All, being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without the narrow Spirit of a Party. They ſeem to be calculated for the common Good, nor have I obſerv'd any Thing in them that can juſtly give Diſguſt, or awaken any reaſonable Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, without Controverſy, that there are ſome Things wherein ſeveral of the Preachers of the <hi>preſent Time</hi> have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our Learned and Pious Fathers: But there are other Excellencies in the Sermons of the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical Age,</hi> which I would rejoice to find more ſtudiouſly revived and cultivated in our Day. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:004534_0006_100D64208AA616E8"/>
theſe I know none of more eminent Neceſſity, Glory, and Uſefulneſs, than thoſe <hi>two</hi> which are the Subjects of this little Book; I mean the <hi>Evangelical Turn of Thought</hi> that ſhould run thro' our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and the <hi>Experimental Way of Diſcourſe</hi> on practical Subjects.</p>
                  <p>It hath been juſtly obſerved, that where a great and univerſal Neglect of <hi>preaching Chriſt</hi> hath prevailed in a Chriſtian Nation, it hath given a fatal Occaſion to the Growth of <hi>Deiſm</hi> and <hi>Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> for when Perſons have heard the Sermons of their Clergy, for many Years together, and find little of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them, they have taken it into their Heads, that Men may be very good Men, and go ſafe to Heaven without <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' they dwell in a Land where the Goſpel is profeſs'd, they imagine there's no Need they ſhould be <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But what a Blot and Reproach would it be to our Miniſtry, if <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> ſhould multiply among us, through ſuch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Neglect of preaching the <hi>peculiar Doctrines of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, let us conſider how little hath been our <hi>Succeſs</hi> in compariſon of the Multitudes converted by our Fathers in the Day of their Miniſtry. Hath not this been Matter of ſore Complaint theſe many Years paſt? Now it is worth our Enquiry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may not be aſcribed to the <hi>Abſence of Chriſt</hi> in our Sermons. And what Reaſon indeed can we have to expect the <hi>Preſence</hi> and Influence of the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> if we leave his Perſon, his Offices, his Grace, and his Goſpel, out of our Diſcourſes, or give but a ſlight and caſual Hint at theſe glorious Subjects, which ought to be our daily Theme? This is what our Author would put us in mind of in his <hi>firſt Diſcourſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="ix" facs="unknown:004534_0007_100D64220F740A18"/>And perhaps another Cauſe of our <hi>Want of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi> hath been this, That we have too much left off the Way of our Fathers, in diſtinguiſhing the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of our Hearers, and dividing the Word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to Saints and Sinners, to the ſtupid and the profane, the awaken'd and convinc'd, the mournful and penitent, the preſumptuous and obſtinate, the deſerted and deſpairing.</p>
                  <p>This Method appears eminently in the Labours of the former Age. Thoſe two great and good Men, Mr. <hi>Flavell,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> might be divided in their Sentiments on other Subjects, but you find this Conduct runs thro' all their practical Writings, This is a great Part of what the <hi>ſecond Diſcourſe</hi> here recommends to us, under the Title of <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Preaching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Author indeed aſſumes not ſo much to himſelf, as to addreſs any beſides <hi>Students</hi> and <hi>Younger Miniſters.</hi> But if in the <hi>middle Age of Life</hi> we ſhould examine our Performances by the Light of this Treatiſe, 'tis poſſible we and our People might be Gainers by it.</p>
                  <p>Have we not been too often tempted to follow the <hi>Modiſh Way,</hi> and ſpeak to our Hearers in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Terms, as though they were all converted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and ſufficiently made Chriſtians by a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Profeſſion? Have not ſome of us ſpent our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to build them up in the Practice of Duties, without teaching them to ſearch whether the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation has been laid in an entire Change and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of Heart? Do we lead them conſtantly to enquire into the inward State of their Souls, the ſpecial Tempers and Circumſtances of their Spirits, their peculiar Difficulties, Dangers and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

and give them peculiar Aſſiſtance in all this Variety of the Chriſtian Life?</p>
                  <p>With how much more Efficacy does the Word of God impreſs the Conſcience, when every Hearer finds himſelf deſcribed without the Preacher's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Knowledge of him? When his own ſpiritual State is painted to the Life, and (as it were) ſet before his Eyes in the Language of the Preacher? When a Word of Conviction, Advice, or Comfort, is ſpoken ſo pertinently to his own Caſe, that he takes it as directed to himſelf. How much more powerful and more penetrating will our Sermons be, when thoſe who <hi>come into our Aſſemblies</hi> ſhall be <hi>convinced and judged,</hi> and have the <hi>Secrets of their Hearts made manifeſt, and confeſs that God is in the midſt</hi> of us <hi>of a Truth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Peruſal of theſe excellent <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> in Manuſcript hath given me ſo much Satisfaction, that I take a ſenſible Pleaſure to think that the Preſs will communicate them to the World, and then I hope for a further Share of Profit, by keeping them always at my Right Hand when I am preparing for the Service of the Sanctuary. May the bleſſed Spirit of God teach thoſe who enter into the ſacred Office, this holy Skill of <hi>winning</hi> Souls! May He awaken us all to ſee what may be mended in our Miniſtrations, in order to publiſh the Goſpel of Chriſt with more illuſtrious and divine Succeſs!</p>

                  <p>THAT excellent Letter concerning the beſt Method of Preaching, which ſtands annexed to this new Edition of Mr. JENNINGS's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, was written in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue by that Venerable and Apoſtolick Man HERMAN AUGUSTUS FRANCK, late Profeſſor of Divinity at <hi>Hall</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> and was communicated to me laſt Winter by his worthy Son GOTTHILF AUGUSTUS FRANCK, who happily fills and adorns the ſame Poſt in that Univerſity, and ſeems to be poſſeſs'd of the ſame Spirit of Faith and Love.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E profeſs ourſelves Chriſtians, and are, I hope, upon careful and rational Enquiry ſatisfied that the Religion of <hi>Jeſus</hi> comes from God; and that it is a moſt glorious Diſpenſation, not only for the ſublime Wonders of its Doctrine, and the Divine Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of its Precepts, but that it excels all other Religions in the Strength of its Motives, the Richneſs of its Promiſes, and the Sufficiency of the Divine Aid attending it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:004534_0014_100D643165C53468"/>Now in all the peculiar Glories of this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is interwoven, like <hi>Phidias</hi>'s Name in the Shield, which could not be effaced without deſtroying the Shield itſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrines concerning <hi>Jeſus</hi> make the Glory and Advantage of his Religion; and ſo run through the whole, that <hi>preaching Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>preaching the Goſpel,</hi> are, in Scripture Style, ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous Terms: As in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 23.—ii. 2. and innumerable other Places.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>preaching of Chriſt</hi> is our Buſineſs, our Charge, and our Glory; but oh! <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe thing?</hi> Give me leave then, my dear Brethren and Friends, to remind my-ſelf and You, what Regard a Miniſter ſhould have to our Redeemer in his Preaching and other Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Let us make</hi> Chriſt <hi>the Deſign and End of our Preaching.</hi> If we ſeek principally to pleaſe Men, then are we not the Servants of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If we look no farther than our own Humour, Reputation, or temporal Advantage, and expend our Talents to our own private Uſe, how ſhall we make up our Accounts to our Maſter? and what Reward can we expect from him?</p>
                  <p>Our ultimate End ſhould be the perſonal Glory of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> That the Glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as God, is the ultimate End of the Goſpel, none can doubt: Nay, as a Creature, he is in his Perfections and Felicity, far ſuperior to the reſt of the Creation;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004534_0015_100D6433A0C0B848"/>
ſo that it is ſaid of this divine Perſon, Heb. ii. 10. <hi>All things are for him, as well as by him.</hi> Is he not worth ten thouſand of us? More worth than the World? The only begotten Son of God, whom the higheſt Angels adore? Now if the Glory of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Perſon, to the Honour of the Father, be the principal End in the divine Schemes and Actings, it ſhould alſo be our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt View and Deſign. Nor want we Motives of Gratitude to lead us to this: He is the Founder of our Religion, to whom all our Hopes are ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: He has honoured us, and well deſerved that we ſhould honour him: Nor is there any Danger of leſſening the Honour of God the Father there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, when we conſider him, as the Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him, <hi>as one with the Father, the equal Image of the inviſible God, to the Glory of God the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, as the Glory of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Perſon ſhould be our ultimate End; ſo the advancing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Grace amongſt Men, is to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate End.</p>
                  <p>The Recovery of fallen Creatures to Holineſs and Happineſs is the immediate Deſign of the Goſpel. Chriſt <hi>is come into the World to ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> 1 Tim i. 15. And he ſends us to preach his Goſpel, that we might promote the ſame Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>That Men might live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly, looking for that bleſſed Hope,</hi> Tit. ii. 11, 12, 13. To make Men holy, to bring them to the Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Imitation of him, and Communion with him, here and hereafter, to the Glory of the Father through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt be the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004534_0016_100D6436AF037620"/>
conſtant End of our Preaching. We ſhould not think it enough to inform, to amuſe, to pleaſe, to affect, but we muſt aim farther than this, to bring them to truſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and withal, to make them penitent and holy; and every Subject muſt be managed with this View: And let it be our great Care, on a more ſpeculative Subject (as ſuppoſe one of the ſublime Doctrines of Grace) ſtill to keep the End in view, and apply it practically, or our Labour is loſt.</p>
                  <p>Let us by all Means endeavour to ſave precious Souls, but yet aim at a higher End than this, <hi>viz.</hi> that we our ſelves may be <hi>a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt unto God,</hi> 2 Cor. ii. 15. And then, though we miſs of our ſecondary End, and are not, as we could wiſh, <hi>the ſavour of life unto life,</hi> unto any great Number; yet in being the <hi>ſavour of death unto death to them that periſh,</hi> we ſhall be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of glorifying the Juſtice and Long ſuffering of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and be Witneſſes for God, <hi>that there has been a Prophet amongſt them;</hi> our primary End is anſwered, <hi>our Labour is with the Lord,</hi> and we in the mean time are ſupported, <hi>tho' Iſrael be not gathered, for the word ſhall not return empty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay farther, it is not enough that the Strain of our Preaching is adapted to the true Deſign of the Goſpel, but we muſt at Heart ſincerely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it; otherwiſe, tho' our Diſcourſes be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable, yet if our Deſigns be wrong and baſe, though others be ſaved through our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, <hi>we ſhall be caſt-aways.</hi>

                     <pb n="19" facs="unknown:004534_0017_100D6438DEBFAC70"/>II. <hi>Let</hi> Chriſt <hi>be the Matter of our Preaching.</hi> Let us diſplay the Divine Dignity and Lovelineſs of his Perſon, by the Light of his Word, as <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us unfold his Mediatorial Office, the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Deſign, and Purport of his great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
                  <p>Let us remind our Hearers of the Particulars of his Incarnation, Life, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion and Interceſſion.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſet forth the Characters he bears, as a Prophet, Prieſt and King; as a Shepherd, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Advocate and Judge.</p>
                  <p>Let us demonſtrate and ſhew the Sufficiency of his Satisfaction, the Tenor and Excellence of the Covenant confirmed with and by him, our Juſtification by his Righteouſneſs, Adoption thro' our Relation to him, Sanctification by his Spirit, our Union with him as our Head, and ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct by his Providence; and how Pardon, Grace and Glory accrue to the Elect through his Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Sacrifice, and are diſpenſed by his Hand.</p>
                  <p>Let us in his Name declare and explain his moſt holy Laws, and teach the People whatever Duties he has commanded, to God, our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and our Selves.</p>
                  <p>Let us quicken the Saints to Duty, raiſe their Hopes, eſtabliſh and comfort their Souls, by the exceeding great and precious Promiſes of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which in him are <hi>yea and amen.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="unknown:004534_0018_100D643A628789E0"/>I but juſt give ſhort and imperfect Hints of theſe Things, and refer to the Apoſtolical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which you'll find are made up of Diſcourſes on theſe and ſuch like Topicks.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Let the Manner of our Preaching on any Subject, diſtinguiſh it from mere Diſcourſes on Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, by a continual Regard to Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we are upon the Perfections of God, let us conſider them as ſhining in his Son, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify'd in his Undertaking, <hi>who is the brightneſs of his Father's glory, and expreſs image of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Heb. i. 3.</p>
                  <p>If we ſet forth Goſpel-Bleſſings and Promiſes, let us conſider them as purchaſed by a Saviour's Blood, and diſtributed by his Bounty; <hi>For by his own blood he has obtained eternal redemption,</hi> Heb. ix. 12. And <hi>from him the whole body is ſupplied,</hi> Eph. iv. 16.</p>
                  <p>If we take notice of the Providence of God, let us not forget that <hi>all power is given to Chriſt, in heaven and in earth,</hi> Mat. xxviii 18. And that <hi>he is head over all things for the church,</hi> Eph. i. 22.</p>
                  <p>If by the Terrors of the laſt Judgment we perſuade Men, let the <hi>wrath of the Lamb</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and the dreadful Reckoning for abuſed Grace and a ſlighted Saviour; for <hi>this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> John iii. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:004534_0019_100D63ACD2A9B5C0"/>If we are aſſiſting the Devotions of the People in Confeſſion, Prayer, or Praiſe, let their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſpring from <hi>looking on Chriſt whom they have pierced,</hi> Zech. xii. 10. Let their Faith in Prayer fix ſteadily on <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as to him is owing our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and Succeſs, and <hi>our boldneſs at the throne of Grace</hi> flows from regarding <hi>Chriſt</hi> as our great <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> Heb. iv. 14, 16. And let us teach them to <hi>give thanks to God the father thro' him,</hi> to whom it is owing that God is our Father, <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 17.</p>
                  <p>When we are upon the Subject of Duty, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is by no means to be forgotten; for to perſuade Men to practical Godlineſs, is one of the moſt difficult Parts of a Miniſter's Work. Men will hear with a curious Satisfaction a ſpeculative Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and with ſome Joy attend to the Diſplays of God's Grace; nay, a <hi>Felix</hi> may tremble when Judgment is preached: Many indeed will bear to hear of Duty too; but to induce them to practiſe it, <hi>hic labor, hoc opus:</hi> Here we had need call in all Helps, and take all Advantages, which the Goſpel as well as the Light of Nature can furniſh. In other Diſcourſes, we are rather attacking <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>'s Out-works, a blind and prejudiced Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; in practical Subjects we aſſault <hi>Satan</hi>'s ſtrongeſt Fort, a corrupted Will: We may gain the Underſtanding on our Side, and gain ſome ſhare of the Affections; but to ſubdue a perverſe Will, and make Men good practical Chriſtians, is not ſo eaſy a Thing, that we can afford to ſpare any Motive or quickning Conſideration. But here I muſt be more particular in explaining how we ſhould regard <hi>Chriſt</hi> in preaching Duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:004534_0020_100D316A73E7CBC8"/>1. Let us repreſent Duty as the natural and neceſſary Fruit of Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Love to him. When by Faith we behold a crucified <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> do we not tremble at the Severity of Gods Juſtice, and regret and hate thoſe Sins that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned his Sorrows? When we farther conſider, that <hi>by his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> can we forbear <hi>to love him who hath firſt loved us?</hi> Shall we not <hi>live to him that died for us?</hi> Can we have the Heart to <hi>crucify him afreſh?</hi> No, let us make his Service our Buſineſs, his Sufficience our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, his Life our Example, and his Bleſſings our Portion and Choice.</p>
                  <p>From ſuch Actings of Faith and Outgoings of Love, flows that divine Temper which conſtitutes the new Creature, and lays the Foundation of all right Goſpel-Obedience. Thus therefore let us continually trace Goſpel Duties up to their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-head, that the People may learn, 'tis not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Reformation that will ſtand the Teſt in the Day of Judgment, but an inward Renewal of the Soul; that <hi>the tree muſt firſt be made good, before there can be any good fruit;</hi> and that all muſt be done for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake, and flow from <hi>faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by love,</hi> Gal. v. 6.</p>

Let us enforce Duties with Motives reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as grateful Love to him ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us; as Fear of his Wrath ſhould awe us; as we would approve our ſelves the Diſciples and Followers of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> as we would enjoy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him; as we would promote his Honour and Intereſt; and as we would have Joy, and not Confuſion, at his appearing. Not that we ſhould

neglect any Motives which the Light of Nature can furniſh, and are level to the Capacities of the People: We have need enough of all; but if we go no further than theſe, our Exhortations will want far the greateſt Part of their Weight: We muſt <hi>beſeech and exhort by the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 Theſſ iv. 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us conſider Duties, as to be performed by the Grace of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Telling the People, that our Fruitfulneſs depends on our being engrafted into this Vine; and that a Holy Walk is being <hi>led by the Spirit;</hi> and when we do good, it is <hi>not we, but the grace of God that is in us;</hi> that out of a ſenſe of Weakneſs, <hi>we muſt be made ſtrong, and do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthning us,</hi> Phil. iv. 13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us conſider all good Works as accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble through the Merits of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and remind our Hearers, that <hi>could we do all, we were but unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſervants;</hi> and that we muſt <hi>ſeek to be found at laſt, not having on our own righteouſneſs, but that which is of God by faith,</hi> Phil. iii. 9.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>Let us deliver our ſelves in a Style becoming the Goſpel of</hi> Chriſt: Not with <hi>great ſwelling words of vanity,</hi> or in the Style of the Heathen Sophiſts, or Words that <hi>Man's Wiſdom teacheth,</hi> and may perhaps ſound beſt in our own Ears; but let us uſe <hi>great plainneſs of ſpeech,</hi> and ſeek to find out ſuch <hi>acceptable words,</hi> as may beſt reach the Underſtanding and Affections of the bulk of an Auditory.</p>

                  <p>And now, Brethren, let me lay before you ſome Reaſons and Motives to back this friendly Admonition concerning <hi>preaching Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">(I.) 'Tis the way to have our Labours accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to have Communion with him in our Work: — Even <hi>Paul</hi> cries out, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> With how much more reaſon have we? Does not our chearful Progreſs in our Work depend on a divine <hi>Afflatus,</hi> and the Spirit diſpenſed by <hi>Chriſt?</hi> But
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004534_0023_100D638C7208BB28"/>
if we take no Notice of him in our Preaching, and do not diſtinguiſh ourſelves from the moral Philoſophers of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> how can we expect any more of this enlivening and encouraging Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> than they had; nay, we have leſs ground to expect it, if we wilfully ſlight and ſlur ſo noble a Revelation, which they were never favour'd with.</p>
                  <p n="2">(II.) 'Tis the way to win Souls to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and make lively Chriſtians. The Succeſs of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is certainly no leſs owing to the Power of its Motives, than to the Clearneſs, Fulneſs, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of its Precepts. Theſe peculiar Motives of the Goſpel have all ſuch a Reſpect to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they are enervated if he be diſregarded: The Goſpel Scheme is what God in his Wiſdom has pitch'd upon to reform Mankind, and ſave them; and he ſeems in Honour concerned to crown it with greater Succeſs than any other Scheme what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; <hi>the preaching of Chriſt crucified is the power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 23, 24 If we maim the Goſpel, and ſuppreſs a good Part of it, we can expect but a very defective Succeſs in the Nature of Things; nay, may we not fear God's Honour is concerned in ſuch Caſe to blaſt us, and we ſhall be like to labour almoſt in vain.</p>
                  <p>Obſervation agrees with this Theory: The great Maſters of Reaſon, who have leſs regard to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their preaching, may, indeed, have a Charm for one of an hundred, who have a Taſte of the Beauties of fine Reaſoning, and be of uſe to them, whilſt the Bulk of an Auditory is aſleep: Alas! with what Heart can we go on, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004534_0024_100D638F62301EF8"/>
two or three, to the ſtarving of moſt of the Souls in an Auditory. May we not alſo obſerve a happier Effect of a Strain prudently evangelical on Chriſtians themſelves; that they who ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it are more lively, zealous, ready to every good Work, and heavenly-minded, than thoſe Chriſtians who have heard leſs of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="3">(III.) It is a direct Imitation of the Apoſtles of <hi>Chriſt: Chriſt</hi> himſelf, whilſt upon Earth, preached the Goſpel in Parables, in a concealed Manner, diſtantly and with reſerve: He could not ſo fully take the Advantage of his Reſurrection, Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, Aſcenſion, and the like, not yet done, made or proved: He had many things to ſay, which his Diſciples could not then bear, but he declares them afterward by his Spirit in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: They therefore are the true Pattern of our preaching, now, after the Myſtery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is brought to light, and hath its full Evidence.</p>
                  <p>How then did the Apoſtles preach <hi>Chriſt?</hi> 'Tis endleſs to attempt a full Detail of Particulars; any part of the Apoſtolical Writings is Authority ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to our Purpoſe; and therefore I've been ſparing in Quotations all along, as needleſs, to thoſe who will look into theſe Writings with this View. And here we don't deſire to alledge or inſiſt upon any Paſſages in their Writings, which may be ſuppoſed to be writ and inſerted for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons peculiar to that Age and Country in which the Apoſtles wrote, and in which perhaps we are not ſo much obliged to imitate them in our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for what will remain after all theſe are put

out of the Account, will, I am ſatisfied, be as full to our Purpoſe, as theſe that are ſtruck off.</p>
                  <p>I'll only then, by way of Specimen, ſelect ſome of the Apoſtles Diſcourſes on Duties moſt moral, where we are apteſt to forget a mention of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or reſpect to him, that it may at once appear the Apoſtles ſhunned not the preſſing ſuch Duties, or a regard to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the treating on them.</p>

Honeſty is preſſed by theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives—the <hi>unrighteous thieves and extortioners, ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God</hi> (which in the Style of the New Teſtament is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Kingdom of Grace and Glory.)—That Chriſtians <hi>are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the ſpirit of Chriſt, and juſtified by his righteouſneſs.</hi>

                  <p>I <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. and ix. Alms is recommended, as it will bring a large Tribute of <hi>praiſe to God for our ſubjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt—and Chriſt became poor for our ſakes.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now what is there in theſe Motives peculiar to one Age or Nation? Are not all theſe as good now as formerly? And are Men ſo ready in their Duty, that we have no need of them?</p>
                  <p>Nay, it is worth Obſervation, that the Apoſtles do not confine themſelves to Motives peculiarly adapted to the Duty they are preſſing, and which ſerve to enforce one Duty rather than another; but, as you may look back &amp; ſee, when ſuch proper Motives are not at hand, they take without any ſcruple common or general ones, which will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually enforce any Duty whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And why ſhould not we introduce the Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities of the Goſpel on all Occaſions, as frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Apoſtles did? If our Schemes of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy will not allow us, we have reaſon to ſuſpect
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004534_0027_100D63962D971CB0"/>
we are in a different Scheme from the Apoſtles. Are we afraid Men will make perverſe uſe of ſuch Doctrines as the Apoſtles uſed for Motives? The Apoſtles choſe to venture it, and why ſhould not we? If we will not dare to preach ſuch a Goſpel as may be perverted by Men of corrupt Minds to their own Injury, we muſt not expect to be Inſtruments of any Good: If we'll be <hi>the ſavour of life</hi> to ſome, we muſt expect to be <hi>the ſavour of death</hi> to others, or not preach at all.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs even the <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> Scheme (which, I think, conſiderably ſinks the Doctrines of Grace) does allow room to regard <hi>Chriſt</hi> abundantly more than moſt Preachers of that Set do: I would meet them on their own Principles: What hinders their frequently inculcating the Merits of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Depravity of our Natures, the Neceſſity of Regeneration, the Aids of Grace, and Union and Communion with <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Theſe Topicks, it were to be hoped, might have their Effect: But alas! how few of the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> improve to Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ſo much of the Goſpel as they hold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: And it makes me leſs inclined to this Scheme, that it ſo generally draws thoſe that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it into a Strain of Preaching, even on prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Subjects, ſo different from that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and inclines them, I know not how, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thoſe glorious Motives (which yet their own Principles might allow) by which the Apoſtles enforced Goſpel Duties.</p>
                  <p n="4">(IV) So only ſhall we deſerve the Name of Preachers of <hi>Chriſt</hi>—Only did I ſay? I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid this may ſound too harſh —Come let us
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004534_0028_100D639864265D30"/>
put the Matter as ſoft and candid as common Senſe will allow us— So ſhall we moſt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or beſt deſerve this honourable Title.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt a Preacher keeps off from the Peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the Goſpel, and ſays nothing but what the Light of Nature would alſo ſuggeſt and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize, give me leave to ſay, a Stranger might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly doubt whether he is a Deiſt or a Chriſtian; the Queſtion is like an imperfect Mathematical Problem, which equally admits of different So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe the Ghoſts of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> to come, meer Strangers, into an Aſſembly where one was haranguing the People in this abſtracted Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; I am apt to think <hi>Seneca</hi> would claim him as a Philoſopher of his own Sect and Religion. Now if <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould alſo make his claim to him as a Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> how could the Queſtion be decided without allowing <hi>Seneca</hi> to be a Preacher of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>On the other Hand, If a Preacher picks out ſome of the Truths of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and even the peculiar and glorious Truths of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, but ſo unhappily manages them, as not to lead People to Holineſs, and the Imitation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> thereby, what is this to the Purpoſe of Preaching, to the Deſign of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? Such are quite oft that Scheme which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated <hi>to deſtroy the works of the devil, and to teach men ſobriety, righteouſneſs, and godlineſs:</hi> It is not only <hi>Chriſt without us</hi> we are to preach, but <hi>Chriſt in us,</hi> and our <hi>putting on Chriſt Jeſus</hi> by a holy Heart and Life.</p>

                  <p>Upon the whole, Brethren, let it be our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to ſtudy and preach <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> On this Subject, there is room for the ſtricteſt Reaſoning and moſt ſublime Philoſophy; it deſerves, invites and inſpires the ſtrongeſt Fire of the Orator; in extolling <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we cannot ſhock the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Taſte by overſtrained Hyperboles; here the Climax may riſe till it is out of Sight; our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery cannot be too ſtrong and rich; and what more moves than an Apoſtrophe to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Or what Proſopopoeias more commanding than thoſe in which he is introduced?</p>

                     <q>As the Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you to preach the kingdom of God; that every knee may bow to me, and every tongue confeſs me: — teach them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you; and tell them, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me they can do nothing; that when they have done all, they are unprofitable ſervants, and muſt be found in my righteouſneſs: — be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all things to all men; ſeek words which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth; that you may gain ſouls, and bring in my ſheep for whom I laid down my life; — If ye love me, feed my ſheep: — I have called you friends; do all in my name, and to my honour; ſo I will be with you always; and if you thus watch for ſouls, you ſhall give up your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with joy at my appearing — This is the Preaching, which tho' it ſeem fooliſh to many, ſhall prove the power of God and wiſdom of God: caſt forth the net on this ſide, and ſo may you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to catch many ſouls: be followers of my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles as they are of me, and in my name ſhall ye do wonders: If you preach me, I and mine ſhall therein rejoice, be not aſhamed of my Goſpel, and I will not be aſhamed of you.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to arrive at any tolerable Perfection in Preaching <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is a work of Time, the Reſult of a careful Peruſal of the Scriptures, and ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hearts of Men: It requires the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pride of carnal Reaſon, a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for Souls, and humble Dependance on the Spirit of God, with the lively Exerciſe of Devotion in our Cloſets.</p>

This Strain, I fear, though it brings many toward <hi>Chriſt,</hi> will bring but few ſafely to him: Many of their Hearers, with <hi>Chriſt</hi> much in their Mouths, will prove but Hypocrites ſettled on their Lees, and Slaves to Luſt. Nor is this Strain more happy for the uniform Growth of the ſincere Chriſtian: They that fit under it, are too frequently low, imperfect, and partial in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Godlineſs; diſtemper'd with Conceit and prepoſterous Zeal for Words and Phraſes, and Things of little or no Conſequence; perplexed and perplexing others with a thouſand ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Scruples; <hi>children in underſtanding,</hi> and it were happy were they ſo in Malice too; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! their Narrowneſs of Mind infects the Heart with uncharitable Affections to Chriſtians of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Perſwaſions.</p>
                  <p>Others having not arrived at the Reliſh of the Doctrines of Grace themſelves, ſuppreſs them in their Preaching, and are altogether on Morality; enforcing it with no Motives of the Goſpel, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome of thoſe addreſſed to Fear.—— Theſe, if they are Maſters of much Fire, may convince ſome; but it fares with moſt of their Convicts, as with the Man in the Parable, out of whom the unclean Spirit went for a while; hut finding his Houſe empty, returned with ſeven more; and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004534_0035_100D63A7955AC430"/>
the latter End of ſuch is worſe than the Beginning. —Or elſe, the awakened Hearer takes up with a proud Dependance upon a miſtaken, external, and Phariſaical Righteouſneſs. — Or elſe the convinced Sinner, not being by his Teacher led to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> proceeds not, ſettles not, but abiding long under the doubtful Concern, is wearied with it, weary of it, and comes to nothing; which ſeems to be the thought in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> xiii. 13. <hi>Ephraim is an unwiſe ſon; he ſhould not ſtay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.</hi>—Or laſtly, if any are converted under his Miniſtry, 'tis very uſual that they are forced to deſert it, to find rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſweeter Paſture for their Souls.</p>
                  <p>Some of their Hearers may poſſibly prefer this Strain of Preaching; but it does not thence follow they are the better for it: And here I'll recite a Paragraph out of <hi>Remarkable Paſſages in the Life of a private Gentleman.</hi> 
                     <q>Spiritual ſearching Diſcourſes I did not ſo much ſavour as meer moral Doctrines; tho' God knows too immoral myſelf.— The Hopes I had conceived of the Strength of my good Reſolutions render'd them grateful—<hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>'s <hi>Morals</hi> I read with great Pleaſure— Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Saints Reſt</hi> frighted me, ſo in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few Pages, I threw it by!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus with Regret he tells us what little Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit he had in that Way, of his Fondneſs of which he was aſhamed, when he came to be of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Mind, <hi>to count all droſs and dung that he might gain Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="39" facs="unknown:004534_0036_100D63A9CAFD2FC8"/>II. <hi>The putting of a Thought in ſeveral diſtinct Views and Lights for different Purpoſes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</hi> The ſacred Writers are herein our Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and that not by Chance, but for wiſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. One View is deſigned to raiſe one Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, another View, to excite another of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sort: And farther, one of the Views is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as an Antidote againſt the Poiſon, which the Corruption of Mens Hearts might draw out of the other.</p>
                  <p>For inſtance, the Terms and Way of our Juſtification and Salvation are frequently ſtated thus—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That we muſt be found in Chriſt, having on the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith,</hi> Phil. iii. 9. and <hi>we muſt be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 21.</p>
                  <p>And this View is exquiſitely adapted to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us, to draw forth Love and Gratitude, and encourage our Hopes and Dependance.</p>
                  <p>But leſt this Phraſeology alone made uſe of, ſhould beget Security, at other Times we are told—</p>
                  <p>That <hi>by works a man is juſtified, and not by faith only; and that faith without works is dead,</hi> Jam ii. 24, 26. and that the Enquiry at the laſt Day ſhall be, who has <hi>fed the hungry, cloathed the naked?</hi> &amp;c. Matt. xxv.</p>
                  <p>And moſt commonly theſe two Views are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſame Paragraph; that one may prevent
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004534_0037_100D63AB4FC7B410"/>
the ill Conſequences Man's Perverſeneſs would draw from the other: As Phyſicians finding ſome dangerous Effect likely to follow from a Drug of ſovereign Virtue, mix ſome other with it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the fatal Conſequences.</p>
                  <p>So we are ſaid to be <hi>elect according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God, through ſanctification of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto obedience, and ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 2.</p>
                  <p>Again we are told, that <hi>by grace we are ſaved through faith, the gift of God, not of works; for we are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt unto good works,</hi> Eph. ii. 8.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>I may give another Inſtance, in the different Ways the Scripture ſpeaks of Power and Duty.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes we are told, that <hi>we cannot come to Chriſt except the Father draw,</hi> John vi 44. That <hi>without Chriſt we can do nothing,</hi> John xv. 5. That <hi>if we live, it is not we, but Chriſt that liveth in us,</hi> Gal. ii. 20.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe Views tend to hide Pride from Man, to create a Diffidence of ourſelves, and to centre our Hopes and Dependance in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But leſt the ſlothful and wicked Servant ſhould make his Impotence his Excuſe; we are called upon to <hi>turn and make us new hearts,</hi> exhorted to <hi>ask and we ſhall receive,</hi> and are aſſured <hi>God will give the Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> Luke xi. 9, 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="unknown:004534_0038_100D3168E5D58FE8"/>And how happily are theſe two Views united in Phil. ii. 12, 13. <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in you to will and to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, leſs skilful Dividers of the Word deal entirely in one of theſe Views only, and neglect the other; and whilſt they are labouring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite one good Affection, they raiſe another of a bad Tendency together with it: To this in part is owing that there are ſo many low or diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Chriſtians. Nor is this Partiality more happy at effecting the real Converſion of Sinners, who generally under ſuch Management are either left aſleep, and ſettled in a fond Conceit of their own Righteouſneſs; or elſe <hi>ſtumble at the rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> (in a different Manner indeed from what the <hi>Jews</hi> did) thinking to find by <hi>Chriſt</hi> a Way to Heaven without Holineſs or moral Honeſty.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Diſtinctly explaining and enforcing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Duties, and oppoſing particular Sins.</hi> It is true, the whole Scheme of Goſpel Duty is dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible from the general Heads of Faith and Love; but alas! moſt Mens Minds are ſlow, confuſed, and erroneous in long Deductions, and it is our Buſineſs to lead them on in every Step, and to ſhew what particular Duties to God, our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and our Selves, will flow from theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and are neceſſary to make the Man of God perfect. We muſt particularly teach them to <hi>add to their faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godlineſs, brotherly-kindneſs and charity,</hi> if we would not leave them <hi>blind and unfruitful,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:004534_0039_100D63B156094FC8"/>
2 Pet. i. 7. And we ſhould in a particular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſpeak of <hi>the fruits of the Spirit, as love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, and temperance;</hi> and at proper Seaſons explain and enforce each of them, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 22, 23 We ſhould apply the Lamp of the Word to detect and diſgrace all the particular <hi>works of darkneſs,</hi> and to make manifeſt <hi>the fruits of the fleſh; ſuch as adultery, laſciviouſneſs, wrath, ſtrife, ſeditions, hereſies, envyings, murders, drunkenneſs, revellings, and ſuch like,</hi> Gal. v. 19, 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhould read to a ſick Perſon a learned Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Benefit of Health, and exhort him to take care to recover it; but never enquire into the Nature of his Diſeaſe, or preſcribe proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and Medicines for the Cure; he would hardly acquieſce in me for his Phyſician, or reſign the Care of his bodily Health to me.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it a more likely Way to the Soul's Health to reſt in general Exhortations to Holineſs only, without diſtinctly handling the ſeveral Branches thereof, and Sins oppoſite thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>Particularly applying to the ſeveral Caſes, Tempers, and Experiences of the Hearers.</hi> Beſides many Thoughts ſuited in general to all Caſes, there might properly ariſe in the Application of moſt Subjects, Thoughts diſtinctly proper to the Converted and Unconverted, to notional Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, and meer Moraliſt, to Mourners, to Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders and lazy Chriſtians, and at ſeveral Times to a much greater Variety of Characters, and Perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="unknown:004534_0040_100D63B2DAA36D70"/>Now ſuch particular Addreſſes, when the Caſe is lively drawn, in the natural Language of the Sort of Men intended, and judiciouſly and art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſpoken to, are the cloſeſt, moſt weighty, and moſt uſeful Parts of the Application.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>this</hi> is the true Way of addreſſing an Auditory, <hi>viz.</hi> to divide them into ſeveral Claſſes, and diſtinctly ſpeak to each, will be plain, if we look thro' the Apoſtolical Writings, and I might add the Prophetical alſo, with this View; and we ſhall find that both Prophets and Apoſtles fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently take Care to diſtinguiſh <hi>the holy and the vile,</hi> the Converted and the Unconverted. As for inſtance, as to their Knowledge and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Things. 1 Cor. ii. 14, 15. <hi>The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit— they are fooliſhneſs to him—he cannot know them: But the ſpiritual judge all things.</hi> And alſo as to their Obedience to the Law. Rom. viii. 7, 8. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God—is not ſubject to God's law, nor can be ſubject, or pleaſe God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They particularly rebuke Scoffers, and confute Gainſayers — <hi>behold ye deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh</hi> —as for Inſtance, thoſe who denied or cavilled at the Reſurrection. 1 Cor. xv. <hi>Thou fool, that which thou ſoweſt, is not quickened ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it die,</hi> &amp;c. and alſo thoſe that were for a Faith without Works. Jam. ii. <hi>Wilt thou know, vain man, that faith without works is dead?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>They addreſs to carnal ſtupid Sinners in an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Way; denounce <hi>woe to them that are at eaſe:</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="unknown:004534_0041_100D63B49AD7CBB0"/>
As <hi>Paul</hi> when he made <hi>Felix</hi> tremble, Acts xxiv. 25. or as <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts vii. 51—54. <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>They lead convinced Sinners to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> to thoſe that are enquiring they ſay, <hi>If ye will enquire, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ye, return, come, turn to the ſtrong hold; if the Lord hath torn, he will heal:</hi> As in Acts ii. 38. <hi>Repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> &amp;c. Acts xxvi. 31. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>They reaſon with the Moraliſt, and thoſe that <hi>truſt in themſelves that they are righteous; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their righteouſneſs is as filthy rags.</hi> Rom iii. <hi>The law ſaith, there is none righteous, but all the world are guilty before God; therefore by the deeds of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified; but the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God is manifeſted, that God might free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtify them that believe on Jeſus; therefore man is juſtified by faith; boaſting is excluded by the law of faith.</hi> And Gal. iii. <hi>Ye received the Spirit by the bearing of faith — the goſpel was before preached to Abraham—they that are of the works of the law, are under the curſe. But the law could not diſannul the covenant confirmed before, but was a ſchool-maſter to bring us to Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by faith; they then that are Chriſt's, are Abraham's ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſharply rebuke and expoſe pretending Hypocrite, ſhewing them their Abominations, detecting and confounding the Wretches that <hi>delight to know God's ways, and hear his word, but

will not do it:</hi> As <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts viii. 21. <hi>Thou haſt no part in this matter; thy heart is not right in the ſight of God;</hi> and <hi>James</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> ii. <hi>Shew me thy faith without thy works — the devils believe and tremble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſpirit up Chriſtians that have but a little Strength, and perſwade them to make farther Advances in Religion; that he that is <hi>feeble may be as</hi> David: as in <hi>Heb.</hi> v. at the end, and the beginning of <hi>ch.</hi> vi. <hi>Ye are dull of hearing — for the time ye ought to have been teachers — ſtrong meat belongeth to them that are of full age — therefore leaving the firſt principles, let us go on to perfection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They deal with the ſeveral Sorts of diſtemper'd Chriſtians tenderly, and yet plainly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; as particularly with thoſe who idolized one Miniſter, and deſpiſed others; telling them, it is <hi>not by might or power of man, but by God's Spirit,</hi> that the Goſpel is ſucceſsful; as in 1 Cor. iii. <hi>While one ſaith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and another, I am of</hi> Apollos, <hi>are ye not carnal? Who is</hi> Paul <hi>or</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos, <hi>but miniſters by whom ye believed?

God the Author of Sin; who ſay <hi>we unavoidably pine away in our iniquities, and how can we then be ſaved?</hi> as in Jam. i. 13. &amp;c. <hi>Let no man ſay, I am tempted of God; for God tempteth not any man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Declining Chriſtians are quickened, awakened, and put in mind of the <hi>love of their eſpouſals:</hi> as in Rev. iii. 2. <hi>be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things that remain that are ready to die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They awfully warn thoſe who are in danger of ſinning and falling back to Perdition; telling them, <hi>the righteouſneſs they have done will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred no more,</hi> and <hi>God's ſoul will have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them:</hi> as in Heb. vi 4 <hi>&amp;c. It is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightened,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, ſeeing they crucify the Son of God afreſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They encourage the perſecuted and afflicted; telling them, <hi>when they paſs thro' fire and water, God will be with them,</hi> and that <hi>when they are try'd they ſhall come forth as gold, and be the Lord's in the day that he maketh up his jewels:</hi> As in Rom. viii. 18. <hi>The ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compar'd with the glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> And Heb xii. <hi>We are compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a cloud of witneſſes — Jeſus endured the croſs and is ſet down at the right hand of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty on high — whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and that for our profit — chaſtening yields the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs.</hi> And more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, thoſe that lament Relations dead in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are told, they ſhall go to be happy with them,

tho' the dead ſhall not return; as in 1 Theſ. iv. 13, 14. <hi>Sorrow not as others that have no hope; for them which ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are alſo particular Leſſons for ſtrong Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> to be tender to the Weak, and to be publick-ſpirited, that as <hi>Ephraim ſhould not envy Judah, ſo neither ſhould Judah vex Ephraim:</hi> Rom. xvi. <hi>Him that is weak in the faith receive— Let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not — Let none put a ſtumbling-block in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's way — Let not your good be ill ſpoken of — Haſt thou faith, have it to thy ſelf — Bear the infirmities of the weak — Let every one pleaſe his neighbour for his good to edification.</hi> And in 1 Cor. viii. <hi>Knowledge puffs up; but charity edifies — Let not your liberty be a ſtumbling-block to the weak — nor through thy knowledge let thy weak brother periſh, for whom Chriſt died — If meat make my brother to offend, I'll eat no fleſh whilſt the world ſtands.</hi> Again they are told, that <hi>a mark is ſet upon the men</hi> that deplore the Sins of the Times; and <hi>a book of remembrance is written</hi> for thoſe who diſtinguiſh themſelves by their Piety in Times of abounding Wickedneſs: as in Rev. iii. 4. <hi>Thou haſt a few names who have not defiled their garments; and they ſhall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You find alſo a ſuitable Portion for thoſe who are groaning under Corruption; who complain they were <hi>ſhapen in iniquity,</hi> and their actual <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are paſt underſtanding:</hi> in Rom. vi. <hi>Altho' I am carnal, ſold under ſin, and what I would I do

not, and what I hate that I do; in my fleſh dwells no good, and to perform good I find not, yea with the fleſh I ſerve the law of ſin (oh wretched man that I am</hi>) yet <hi>I conſent to God's law, and delight in it after the inner-man; it is not then I that do this evil, but ſin that dwelleth in me — I thank God through Chriſt, with my mind I ſerve God's law, and God will deliver me from the body of this death.</hi> And they are told how God has <hi>laid on Chriſt our iniquities,</hi> and he will be <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs and ſtrength:</hi> 1 John ii. 1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Humble and Penitent, who are of <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ſpirit, and tremble at God's word,</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, 2 Cor. vii. <hi>Ye were ſorry indeed, 'twas but for a ſeaſon — 'Twas after a godly manner — I rejoice in it — Such ſorrow worketh repentance not to be repented of — It wrought in you careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fear, deſire, zeal and revenge; you have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved your ſelves clear in this matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They who want Direction, and cry out, <hi>Oh that my ways were directed to keep thy ſtatutes!</hi> are ſent to God for Counſel, Jam. i. 5 <hi>If any lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God, and it ſhall be given him.</hi>

However, there are laid up, in the New Teſtament, ſome proper Hints of Counſel, for ſuch as ſhould in after-times labour under the Hidings of God's Face; as, to <hi>examine themſelves—For this to beſeech the Lord —To clear themſelves of</hi> Sin—<hi>Not to faint in well-doing;</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, from your Acquaintance with the Scriptures, you'll eaſily perceive that I could as happily run this Specimen much farther thro' the ſacred Writings. And if you peruſe the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the moſt powerful &amp; ſucceſsful Preachers, particularly the <hi>Puritan</hi> Divines, you'll ſee that they herein imitated the great Leaders of the Chriſtian Profeſſion; and were large in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Application to ſeveral Sorts of Perſons; ſuiting their Diſcourſes to all the Variety of the Hearts of Men, and Sorts &amp; Frames of Chriſtians, according to the true Precepts of Oratory and Chriſtianity. In this Way they found their own Hearts warmed, and thus they reached the Hearts
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004534_0047_100D63C209E4C6A0"/>
of their Hearers; whilſt many were imagining the Miniſter had been told of their Caſe, and made the Sermon for them: and ſo was verified that Paſſage in Heb. iv. 12. <hi>The word of God is quick and powerful—a diſcerner of thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what Succeſs can we reaſonably expect, if we do not take into cloſe Conſideration the Caſe of our ſeveral ſpiritual Patients?</p>
                  <p>If a Man profeſſing <hi>Phyſick</hi> ſhould adminiſter or give out one conſtant Medicine for Fevers, and another for Conſumptions, and ſo for other Diſtempers, without conſidering the Age, Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, Strength, and Way of Living of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; and not vary his Method and Medicines as thoſe varied; we ſhould hardly call this the regular Practice of <hi>Phyſick:</hi> Nor can I think this general and undiſtinguiſhing Way will be more ſafe, or likely to anſwer its End, in <hi>Divinity</hi> than in <hi>Medicine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I reſt perſuaded, Brethren, the thing is ſo evident you can't but allow, 'tis the beſt to ſuit our ſelves to all the Variety of Tempers and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Hearers, if it can be done; and I hope I may ſucceſsfully offer ſome Thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Way how this Skill may be attained.</p>
                  <p>Above all then, carefully ſtudy your own Hearts, and preach over the ruder Sketches of your Sermons to your ſelves firſt; by which Means the correſponding Workings of your own Hearts and Affections may furniſh you with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004534_0048_100D63C5D4B97738"/>
Thoughts wherewith to apply cloſely to all, whoſe Temper, and Experience, and Caſe is like your own: for what is ſupplied to your imperfect Notes, out of the applicatory Meditations of your own Minds on the Subject, will very probably, according to the uſual way of the Spirit, happily and powerfully reach thoſe of the ſame Make in like Circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>But alas! one Man's Experience falls far ſhort of all the Variety of Men's Hearts, and of the Spirit's Work; nay, thoſe whoſe Heads are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for cloſe and regular Thought, and whoſe Time has been ſpent in Study and Letters, as they go on more rationally and evenly in Religion, have leſs variety of Experience, than many of a different Mold and Way of thinking. Here it will be needful then to look out of our ſelves, and take a larger View, in order to be acquainted with Caſes and Tempers different from our own; and with ſuch Methods of the Spirit's Work, as we our ſelves have never experienced, but many others have. Now the beſt and original Way of getting this Acquaintance with Men, and with God's Workings in them, (and I may add of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Workings alſo) is by converſing freely with the ſerious People of our Flock.</p>
                  <p>I know your Thoughts will prevent me with an Objection: You'll ſay, this is almoſt impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, eſpecially amongſt Perſons of Politeneſs and Figure; theſe alas! too rarely will uſe any ſuch Freedom with us, in laying open their Hearts, and communicating their Experiences to us, as to give us the needful Information. — If we ever
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:004534_0049_100D63C76403CD88"/>
do arrive at any Acquaintance with the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Chriſtians, 'tis little thanks to ſuch as theſe; they expect we ſhould preach ſuitably to them, and that with as much reaſon as <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> demanded of the Wiſe Men to interpret a Dream they knew not. The middle and lower Sort of People indeed, are more unreſerved to grave Miniſters of Age and Standing; but will hardly uſe the ſame Freedom with young Men.</p>
                  <p>To help you over this Difficulty, I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; that as for <hi>the Polite,</hi> and <hi>Men of ſome Thought and Reading,</hi> your own Experience, with the Allowances and Corrections a moderate Skill in Human Nature will enable you to make, may lead you into happy Conjectures at their Way of Thinking: Beſides, in the time of their Viſitation, under ſome ſore Affliction, you ſhall find them more communicative; and an Hour's free Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, with ſuch as can give a rational and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Account of themſelves, in a Seaſon when they are diſpoſed to do it, is as valuable and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as it is rare and difficult to enter into.</p>
                  <p>Again, have an Eye upon <hi>the ſerious Youth,</hi> whom Nature and Providence has deſigned to place in a ſuperior Claſs; and eſpecially at a Time when the Impreſſions of Religion are new to them: You ſhall find them more open than elder Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, if you court their Intimacy, and relieve their Baſhfulneſs: And if you can ſee into the Heart of a Youth, then with the proper Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for the Alterations that Age and Buſineſs will make, you may pretty well gueſs at their Turn of Mind in more advanced Years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="unknown:004534_0050_100D63C9976B4128"/>With the Generality of <hi>ſerious and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced Chriſtians,</hi> there needs not ſo much Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to get into ſuch a ſpiritual Intimacy with them as we deſire; the laying aſide Nicety and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and getting into ſuch a grave good-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Way as our Character requires, is more than half-way to our Purpoſe: Where this is inſufficient to encourage the People to Freedom, lead them into it by communicating firſt, either what your ſelves have experienced, under the Name of a third Perſon (if Modeſty or Prudence require) or elſe what you have learned from others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out betraying the Confidence they have put in you: By theſe Methods we ſhall ſeldom fail of drawing ſerious People on to ſuch a Freedom, as will be of Uſe to them and ourſelves. — If we heartily go about it, we are pretty ſure to ſucceed.</p>
                  <p>I may farther Hint at a compendious Way for the gaining much Knowledge of Men's Hearts in a little Time. <hi>viz.</hi> If you have any tolerable Skill in the different Tempers and Complexions of Mankind, diſtribute in your Thoughts your People into Claſſes, according to their natural Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and Temper, and ſelect one of each Claſs to be more particularly acquainted with; for amongſt thoſe whom Nature has formed alike, you ſhall find upon farther Enquiry, a ſtrange Uniformity in the Spirit's Work and Way of Proceeding with them.</p>
                  <p>I might recommend a Way of knowing theſe things at ſecond Hand, <hi>viz.</hi> from the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular and experimental Authors; but this way is far inferior to the other; and we ſhall but faintly
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:004534_0051_100D63CB1B5B8658"/>
paint any Phaenomenon of the Heart, by copying another Picture; 'tis infinitely preferable to do it from the Life. Yet would I earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Peruſal of ſuch Authors, as deal much in an experimental Strain, and have been very ſucceſsful in it; but with a different Deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> That we may learn from them, how to deſcribe, in a diſcreet and lively Manner, ſuch Caſes as we our ſelves have obſerved; and how to addreſs properly to thoſe Caſes, with the like Thoughts and Expreſſions, as have in the Courſe of their Preaching happily anſwered the End.</p>
                  <p>After all, rightly to divide the Word of Truth, with true Wiſdom, is a Matter of no ſmall Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; but if we carefully and diligently go about it, with a Zeal for our Maſter's Intereſt, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of our own Inſufficience, <hi>asking wiſdom of God,</hi> we know <hi>he giveth liberally,</hi> and will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make us <hi>wiſe to win ſouls,</hi> to the Honour of his Name, and our own <hi>rejoicing in the day of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> to whom with the Father and Holy Spirit, that one God whom we adore, be paid the higheſt Honours and Praiſes to eternal Ages. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>Written in the <hi>German</hi> Language by the late Reverend and Celebrated Dr. AUGUSTUS HERMANNUS FRANCK, Profeſſor of Divinity in the Univerſity of <hi>Hall</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> Paſtor of a Church, and Director of the charitable FOUNDATIONS there.

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE good Acceptance which the two preceeding Diſcourſes met with, when they were firſt publiſhed by the Author, (a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before his Death) and the ſpeedy Demand of a ſecond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, together with the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Enquiries which have been made for them ſince they have been out of Print, encourages this Republication of them. Were it proper for me to add any thing to that Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation which is prefixed to them, I might mention the Acceptance which they have alſo met with in Foreign Parts. For, beſides a large Edition printed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they have lately been tranſlated and publiſhed in the <hi>German</hi> Language, by Order of the Reverend Dr. FRANCK, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent worthy Profeſſor of Divinity in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Hall</hi> in <hi>Saxony.</hi> The Reverend Dr. WATTS, who correſponds with that Profeſſor, ſent him theſe Diſcourſes the laſt Year; with which he was ſo well pleaſed, as not only to give them a very high Encomium in his next Letter to the Doctor, but to get them tranſlated into
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:004534_0054_100D63D2975AE5A8"/>
                     <hi>High-Dutch,</hi> and inſerted in a Collection of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which is publiſhed in that Country about once a Month, for the Advancement of Religion. In return for this Preſent, which proved ſo very acceptable to the good Profeſſor, he ſoon after ſent the Doctor a <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation of a Letter, which his excellent Father, and Predeceſſor in the Divinity Chair at <hi>Hall,</hi> had publiſhed in the <hi>German</hi> Language, pretty much on the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; which the Doctor has been ſo kind as to communicate to me, and which I have tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and here added to theſe Diſcourſes of my Brother's; in hopes that, by the Bleſſing of God, it may be a conſiderable Means of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the good Deſign of them, <hi>viz.</hi> to form skilful Labourers for the Lord's Vineyard, and to revive that too much neglected Strain and Way of preaching, which large Experience has abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved to be moſt uſeful and ſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>The two proceeding Diſcourſes were originally prepared for Academical Lectures, and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the Author to a Set of Pupils, who were training up under his Inſtruction for the Service of the Sanctuary. In the Letter, which is now added, we have the Sentiments of one of the moſt celebrated Preachers and Divines, and perhaps one of the moſt truly Apoſtolick Men, that ſome paſt Ages have known, on the ſame Subject: A Man whom God did very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly own, not only as a Preacher and a Tutor, but above all in that almoſt miraculous Work (if I need ſay <hi>almoſt</hi>) his building and eſtabliſhing the Orphan-Houſe at <hi>Glaucha</hi> in the Suburbs of <hi>Hall;</hi> a Work which both in the Beginning and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004534_0055_100D63D64B545C30"/>
of it can be attributed to no Means ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly as to the Power of Faith. A Hiſtorical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Affair, wrote by the Profeſſor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as it was laid before <hi>Frederick I.</hi> King of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> to whoſe Dominions <hi>Hall</hi> belonged, and who in the Year 1700 gave a Commiſſion to four of his Privy Counſellors to examine ſtrictly into it, was afterwards publiſhed, under the Title of <hi>Pietas Hallenſis,</hi> and has ſince been tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I ſuppoſe it will not be unacceptable, to ſuch Perſons eſpecially as have not read that larger Account, to give a brief Abſtract of it in this Place.</p>
                  <p>When the Profeſſor was firſt ſettled as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at <hi>Glaucha,</hi> he, according to the Cuſtom of charitably diſpoſed Perſons in thoſe Parts, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one Day in every Week for the Poor to come to his Door for Alms. Their Miſeries, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the groſs Ignorance and Wickedneſs which generally prevails among that ſort of People, very ſenſibly touch'd him; and above all to ſee Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Children among them growing up in that diſſolute Way of Life, was to him a very affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and pitiful Sight. This made him reſolve on ſome Attempt for their ſpiritual as well as their bodily Relief. Accordingly every <hi>Thurſday,</hi> which was his Day for diſtributing Alms, he took all the Poor that came, into his Houſe; and there, beſides giving them Money, he inſtructed the Children, in the Preſence of the Elder Perſons, in the Principles of Religion, and concluded with Prayer. This Exerciſe was ſet up in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Year 1694. The Number of the Poor who came to this Exerciſe (many of them
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:004534_0056_100D63D7CFA04650"/>
probably for the ſake of the Alms) ſoon increaſing, and conſequently the Charge that attended it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing too, obliged the Profeſſor to ſeek for ſome Aſſiſtance in carrying on this good Work. For that Purpoſe therefore he ſet up an Alms-Box in his Parlour, with theſe Words written over it, 1 John iii. 17. <hi>Whoſo hath this World's Goods, and ſeeth his Brother have need, and ſhutteth up his Bowels of Compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God is him?</hi> and under it, 2 Cor. ix. 7. <hi>Every Man according as he purpoſeth in his Heart, ſo let him give, not grudgingly, or of neceſſity, for God loveth a chearful Giver.</hi> This was intended aS a tacit Admonition to all that came in, to open their Hearts towards the Poor. About a quarter of a Year after this Box was ſet up, a certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon put into it at one time, to the value of <hi>Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Shillings and Six Pence Engliſh.</hi> When the Profeſſor took this Sum into his Hands, he ſaid, in full Aſſurance of Faith, <q>This is now a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Fund, worthy to be laid out in ſome important Undertaking; therefore I will even take this for the Foundation of a Charity-School.</q> And immediately he laid out eight Shillings of it in Books, and hired a poor Student to teach the Children two Hours in a Day. When his Stock was juſt ſpent, ſome Friends who came to viſit the Profeſſor, and were much pleaſed with his charitable Eſſay, contributed more; upon which the two Hours teaching were enlarged to five, and Alms were diſtributed to the Children three times a Week, to engage them to come more conſtantly to School. But after Matters had gone on in this Way for ſome time, this Profeſſor but too plainly ſaw that all his Endeavours upon thoſe
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:004534_0057_100D63D9541163E0"/>
poor Vagrants were like to be fruſtrated, by their keeping ſuch bad Company out of School-time. Some of them ran away with their Books, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to School no more. This made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to chooſe out twelve of the moſt hopeful of the Children, and to venture upon their Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as well as their Education. At firſt he put them out to Perſons of known Integrity and Piety, to be educated by them. But as this little Beginning came to be known abroad, ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſent in Contributions to carry on ſo good a Deſign; particularly the Lord put it into the Heart of a Perſon of Quality to give a <hi>Thouſand Crowns,</hi> and two other Perſons contributed <hi>Four Hundred.</hi> Upon which a Houſe was purchaſed, and converted into an Hoſpital for the poor Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans. This was in the Year 1696. Afterwards Alms were ſent in by ſeveral other Perſons; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them came from unknown Hands Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly more Children were ſtill admitted into the Hoſpital, till the Houſe grew too ſtrait for them; which put the Profeſſor on a Deſign of building a large and commodious Hoſpital; for he clearly foreſaw, that the hiring of more Houſes, ſcattered up and down, would be attended with very great Inconveniences. One Gentleman had lately ſent him <hi>five hundred Crowns,</hi> with a Deſire that ſome part of that Sum might be diſpoſed of to poor Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; which the Profeſſor looked upon as a Call of Providence, to make indigent Scholars a part of his Care. This enlarged his charitable Deſign beyond his former Intention. He now wanted a Building that would hold at leaſt two hundred Perſons; but his Stock of Money was by this time ſo far ſpent, that, as he writes, he had not enough
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:004534_0058_100D63DAF3B6A9A8"/>
to build a ſmall Cottage. No wonder then that ſeveral of his Friends diſſwaded him from ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous an Undertaking! But the Lord ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened his Faith in ſo powerful a Manner, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him with ſuch a Preſence of Mind, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him above all Diſcouragement. Accordingly <hi>July</hi> 13. 1698. the Foundation of a ſpacious Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital was laid, in THE NAME OF GOD, without any ſettled Fund, or ſo much as a Promiſe from any great Perſons to contribute to the building of it. <q>And now, the Profeſſor writes, I was to wait upon God, and from Week to Week to receive at his Hand what he would be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed to furniſh me with for carrying on the Building.</q> It muſt alſo be remembered, that the weekly Expence of maintaining the Poor, which he had already under his Care, was very conſiderable; but nothing could diſcourage the pious Profeſſor, his Faith kept Pace with his grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Charity, and he had a firm Truſt in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the fulfilling thoſe kind Deſires, which he was confidently perſwaded God had put into his Heart. Nor were his Expectations in this Matter at all diſappointed; for the Building was carried on ſucceſsfully, and the Poor ſupported all the time merely by ſeemingly accidental Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were ſent in from time to time by charitable Perſons, living not only in <hi>Germany,</hi> but in moſt other Proteſtant Countries in <hi>Europe.</hi> So that in the Year 1702 the Hoſpital was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, which had coſt <hi>five thouſand Pounds,</hi> and was peopled with above two hundred Poor. The Steps of Providence in carrying on this Affair were indeed very extraordinary. God ſeveral Times ſuffered the good Profeſſor's Faith to be
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:004534_0059_100D63DD4ABE1388"/>
tried by very preſſing Neceſſities; as when the Workmen were to be paid, the Poor to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and yet the Stock of Money was quite exhauſted, and there was no rational Proſpect of any further Supply. This often happened, but his Recourſe was always to God by Prayer, which as conſtantly met with a gracious Anſwer. I will here ſet down two or three Paſſages of this ſort, by way of Inſtance, out of a great Number that are recorded in the <hi>Pietas Hallenſis</hi> Memorable Inſtances of the Power of Faith and Prayer!</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>At one time, he writes, all Proviſions were gone, when the Steward declared there was a Neceſſity of buying ſome Cattle to furniſh the Table, and other Neceſſaries. Under theſe preſſing Circumſtances I found one Comfort, which was a <hi>Preſence of Mind in Prayer,</hi> joined with a confident Dependance upon the Lord, who heareth the very Cry of the young Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. When Prayer was over, I heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body knock at the Door, which when opened there was an Acquaintance of mine holding in his Hand a Letter, and a Parcel or Money wrapt up, which he preſented to me, and I found therein <hi>fifty Crowns,</hi> ſent a great Way for the Relief of our Poor.</p>
                     <p>At another time, there was Want again in every Corner. The Steward brought me his Book and deſired me to defray the Weekly Charges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Recourſe was to God through Faith. The Expences were neceſſary, and I ſaw not the leaſt Proviſion, nor any way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it. This made me reſolve to retire into
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:004534_0060_100D63E0E59DF970"/>
my Cloſet, and to beg the Lord's Aſſiſtance in ſo preſſing a Neceſſity; but as I was preparing for Prayer, I received a Letter from a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, intimating that he was ordered to pay a <hi>thouſand Crowns</hi> to me for the Relief of the Hoſpital. This put me in mind of that Saying, Iſai. lxv. 24. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs, that before they call, I will anſwer; and while they are yet ſpeaking, I will hear.</hi> Nevertheleſs I entred into my Cloſet, but inſtead of begging and praying, as I had deſigned, I praiſed and extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Name of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Another time, I ſtood in need of a great Sum of Money, inſomuch that an 100 <hi>Crowns</hi> would not have ſerved my turn, and yet I ſaw not the leaſt appearance how I might be ſupplied with an hundred Groats. The Steward came and ſet forth the Want we were in. I bid him to come again after Dinner, and I reſolved to put up my Prayers to the Lord for his Aſſiſtance. When he came again after Dinner, I was ſtill in the ſame Want, and ſo appointed him to come again in the Evening. In the mean time a Friend of mine came to ſee me, and with him I joined in Prayers, and found my ſelf much moved to praiſe and magnify the Lord for all his admirable Dealings towards Mankind, even from the beginning of the World; and the moſt remarkable Inſtances came readily to my Remembrance whilſt I was praying. I was ſo elevated in praiſing and magnifying God, that I inſiſted only on that Exerciſe of my preſent Devotions, and found no Inclination to put up many anxious Petitions to be delivered out of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:004534_0061_100D63E296166F28"/>
the preſent Neceſſity. At length my Friend taking his leave, I accompanied him to the Door, where I found the Steward waiting on one Side for the Money he wanted, and on the other, a Perſon who brought an <hi>Hundred and fifty Crowns</hi> for the Support of the Hoſpital.</p>

                  <p>Thus was this famous Hoſpital, which has ſince been one of the moſt illuſtrious Ornaments and Supports of the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>Germany,</hi> built without any other Fund but that of Faith. Surely, we muſt ſay, <hi>This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our Eyes.</hi> Whether it may paſs for a Miracle or no, yet thus much I take for certain, that if any Popiſh Monaſtery had ever been founded in the ſame Manner, and ſuch remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Steps of Providence had attended the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, as did actually attend this Proteſtant Hoſpital at <hi>Hall,</hi> the World would have rung with the Noiſe of the Miracle, and it had indeed been a much better Miracle than any which the Papiſts boaſt of. But to return to the Story. The Hoſpital being thus finiſhed, at leaſt as far as was intended when the Foundation was laid, it was ſtill to depend immediately on Providence for its future Support and Maintenance Nor for this did the Profeſſor's Faith fail, nor were his Hopes diſappointed; for the Author of the Preface to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation of Profeſſor FRANCK's <hi>Chriſtus ſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>crae Scripturae Nucleus,</hi> informs us, that in the Year 1706 the State of the Hoſpital was as follows.</p>
                  <p>Ten Schools, in which 988 Children were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by 72 Maſters. The Number of Perſons
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:004534_0062_100D63E41D118F10"/>
lodged and ſubſiſted in the Hoſpital was 360, and 84 poor Students of the Univerſity had their Diet there. Eight poor Widows were maintained, with a Chaplain and a Maid Servant, and Proviſion alſo was made for the Relief of caſual Poor</p>
                  <p>The Death of this excellent Profeſſor, which happened in the Year 1727, in the 65th Year of his Age, filled many Perſons with Fear, that this good Work of Charity, now it muſt be deprived of the Support of his Influence and Prayers, would languiſh and die too, but in this their Fears have been happily diſappointed. It was Honour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for this holy Man to be ſuch an illuſtrious Inſtance of Faith, and to be the Inſtrument of ſo great and good a Work: But the Lord has ſince made it appear that the Work was his, and that the Reſidue of the Spirit is with him. For I find in the before-cited Preface, that at the Concluſion of the Year 1731, which was four Years after Dr. FRANCK's Death, the number of the Scholars and Children in the ſeveral Schools of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan-Houſe amounted to 2300, and the number of Students who inſtructed them to 160. I am further informed by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Zeigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen,</hi> the preſent worthy Paſtor of the <hi>German</hi> Church at <hi>St. James</hi>'s, that the Hoſpital ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in a very flouriſhing State, and that ſome further Additions were made to the Buildings, but about three Years ago.</p>
                  <p>Many uſeful Inſtructions might be deducted from this Narrative. What Arguments for a Providence, what Encouragement to Prayer, what <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to Work of Charity, might it yield us?
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:004534_0063_100D63E65036AE38"/>
But I have already ſwelled this Preface almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all reaſonable Bounds, and therefore muſt not inſiſt here on theſe Topicks.</p>
                  <p>I have only to obſerve further, that the Letter which follows was written by this great and good Man about two Years before his Death, in which we have his Opinion and Judgment, ripen'd by Age and large Experience, concerning <hi>the moſt uſeful Way of Preaching.</hi> And what Miniſter, who is in good Earneſt concerned to approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf faithful in his Work, to advance the Honour of Chriſt, and do good to Souls, would not be glad to conſult ſo great and experienced a Maſter? And who would not pay ſome conſiderable Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Judgment of ſuch an Apoſtolick Man, a Man ſo highly honoured of God, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor FRANCK was?</p>
                  <p>The good Profeſſor himſelf had, it ſeems, ſuch an Opinion of this little Piece, as to deſire it might be tranſmitted to Poſterity. He therefore inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it entire in a Preface to a Quarto Volume of Sermons which he publiſhed in the Year 1726, on purpoſe, as he there declares, that it might not be loſt, as ſingle Sheets are apt to be; but that Poſterity might know his Thoughts upon this Matter And after the End of it, he declares in a very ſolemn Manner, <hi>as in the Preſence of the Lord,</hi> that what he had thus written was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of his own Experience; and that theſe Rules and Directions which he had given to other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, were the ſame that he had conſtantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and practiced upon in the whole Courſe of his own Preaching and Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="unknown:004534_0064_100D63E888A1CEF0"/>May this Publication of them in our own Language prove a Means, thro' the Bleſſing of God, of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many ſuch uſeful and ſucceſsful Preachers of the Goſpel, in our Country, as that holy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Man was in his. May many Miniſters be made wiſe hereby to win Souls to Chriſt, <hi>to ſave themſelves and them that hear them.</hi> So ſhall this little but valuable Treatiſe <hi>redound through the Thankſgivings of many to the Glory of God.</hi>

                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N Anſwer to the Queſtion which you have propoſed to me, <hi>viz. How a faithful Miniſter, who earneſtly deſires to ſave and to edify the Souls of his Hearers, to gain Sinners unto Chriſt, and to inflame their Hearts with a growing Love to their Saviour, may beſt adapt his Preaching to theſe excellent Purpoſes?</hi> I can only at preſent ſuggeſt a few things briefly; whereas if I had more Leiſure, I ſhould chooſe to write more copiouſly on ſo weighty a Subject.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="70" facs="unknown:004534_0066_100D63EDCE3E9B40"/>I. I muſt take it for granted that a Miniſter, who ſincerely deſires and who is likely to do good by his Preaching, is ſuch a one, both in Heart &amp; in Life, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes, 2 Tim. i. 13, 14. <hi>Who holds faſt the form of ſound words</hi> (or the pure Apoſtolic Doctrine) <hi>which he has heard, in faith and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and <hi>who keeps that good thing which has been committed to him by the Holy Ghoſt which dwelleth in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. It will not a little ſubſerve the good Ends propoſed in the Queſtion, for a Miniſter, very frequently, to lay down in his Sermons the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Marks and Characters both of the Converted and of the Unconverted, and that with all poſſible Plainneſs, that ſo every one of his Hearers may be able to judge of his own State, and may know to which of theſe two Claſſes he belongs. But then great Care muſt be taken that thoſe diſtinguiſhing Characters are juſtly drawn: For it may eaſily happen, thro' a Preacher's Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulneſs in this Affair, that the Unconverted, on the one hand, may be deceived into a good Opinion of their preſent State, and may grow thereupon more ſecure and careleſs; and that ſome converted Perſons, on the other hand, may be unreaſonably diſquieted and filled with ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and fruitleſs Fears. However, a prudent Miniſter, who has experienced a Work of Grace upon his own Heart, will have no great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo to deſcribe it to others, as ſufficiently to guard againſt the Miſtakes on both ſides; and to lead both one and the other, by the unerring Light of Scripture, into the Knowledge of the true State of their own Souls.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="71" facs="unknown:004534_0067_100D63F0C1BDDCA0"/>III. For this Purpoſe alſo let a Miniſter care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and clearly diſtinguiſh in his Preaching, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt mere Morality and true Religion; betwixt the moral honeſt Man and the ſound Believer, who, from a deep Conviction of the Depravity of his Nature and the Errors of his Life, has learn'd to hate Sin from his Heart, and lives by the Faith of the Son of God. For it is hardly credible what Multitudes of Perſons there are, even in Chriſtian Countries, where the Goſpel is publickly and faithfully preached, who, though they are wiſe enough in other Matters, yet in this are they groſly ignorant, and thereby miſerably deceive their own Souls.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. And, becauſe this kind of Self-Deceit is ſo very common, it is highly neceſſary for a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to inſtruct his Hearers with all poſſible Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the Duty of Self-examination; and very often to exhort them to it: As more eſpecially to enquire, If ever they were awakened from their natural Sleep in Sin? If they have eſcaped out of the Snare of the Devil? If ever they have had a lively and affecting Senſe of the Corruption of their own Hearts, and of the Miſery of their natural State? And, in ſhort, whether they have good and ſolid Reaſons to conclude that they are regenerate Perſons? Whether they can find in themſelves the genuine Marks of a true Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God, and a living Faith in Chriſt? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or whether, on the other hand, they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they are true Chriſtians and in a State of Salvation, merely from their being moral ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Men, and their not living in any groſs and ſcandalous Sin? And, perhaps too, from their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:004534_0068_100D63F246CFAAE8"/>
Prayers, hearing Sermons, and frequenting the Places of public Worſhip, and from their practiſing ſuch like outward Duties of Religion? Or again, whether they do not flatter themſelves that their eternal State is ſafe, merely becauſe their Lives are not altogether ſo bad as the Lives of ſome others?</p>
                  <p n="5">V. It would alſo be of very conſiderable uſe for a Miniſter often to explain, and to ſhew the Difference betwixt a Legal and an Evangelical Frame and Principle of Religion; or betwixt that ſlaviſh Fear, by which alone it is that ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, even of a ſerious Turn of Mind, are forced and dragg'd as it were to their Duty, and that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Newneſs of Spirit, that filial Love to God and Delight in his Service, which uſually grows and flouriſhes in the Soul where it is once planted, and which produces a free, unconſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and acceptable Religion. This would be an excellent Means, not only of awakening Sinners out of their carnal Security, but of turning them throughly unto God, to a holy Walk and to a pleaſurable Converſe with him, even ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his Children. And for this End it is of very great Moment, that a Miniſter not only inſtruct his Hearers what they muſt do, and how they ought to act, but that he alſo labour fully to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and to convince them, by the Evidence of Scripture, of their own native Weakneſs and Impotency for all that is ſpiritually good; and that he further ſhew them, by the ſame Word of Truth, from whence they muſt look for, and from whom they may hope to receive, all Grace and Strength, not only to renew their Souls in
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:004534_0069_100D63F3C978D9B8"/>
their firſt Converſion, but alſo afterwards to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to perform every Duty, as well of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as of inward Religion. They muſt be told that they can do nothing without Chriſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he has aſſured us, John xv. 5. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> And again, that by the Help of his Grace they may do all things, according as St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes, Phil. iv. 13. <hi>I can do all things thro' Chriſt ſtrengthning me.</hi> Thus ſhould Goſpel Miniſters conſtantly make it the Aim and Drift of their Preaching, to lead their Hearers to Chriſt, and to his Grace; to Him by <hi>whoſe ſtripes we are healed,</hi> and whoſe Blood takes away all the Sins of all that truly repent &amp; believe, &amp; by whoſe <hi>divine power all things are given to us that pertain to life and godlineſs,</hi> 2 Pet. i. 3. Thus the Holy Apoſtles preached; theſe were the Topicks which they inſiſted much upon; and if their Example is not followed in this matter, it will be no wonder if our modern Preaching comes vaſtly ſhort of the Succeſs of theirs: And by this means ſome of our Hearers will be in danger of ſinking into a mere Legal Frame and Spirit of Bondage, while they are preſs'd to Duty and Working, but not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the Grace of Chriſt, nor directed where to look for Strength to perform it; and others of them will take up with a falſe Peace, a carnal Security, for want of being directed to Chriſt, who is the only Foundation of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's reaſonable Hope and ſolid Comfort. But on the other hand, when both theſe Points are well explain'd and duly inſiſted on, no other Means are ſo powerful to awaken ſecure Sinners, to bring them to Chriſt, and to ſettle their Souls in ſolid
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004534_0070_100D63F60DA247B8"/>
Peace and Comfort. Hereby, under the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Spirit of Chriſt, they find themſelves tranſported as it were into a new Life; and now they go on with Vigour and Pleaſure in the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of univerſal Piety.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. It would further be uſeful, and it is highly neceſſary that Miniſters ſhould not only preach up the Neceſſity of Converſion, and inſtruct their Hearers to depend on the Grace of Chriſt for it, but alſo that they ſhould, very frequently, in their Sermons explain the Nature and the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Converſion, ſometimes more largely and diſtinctly, and at other times more briefly, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring thereby to lead their Hearers into a true Knowledge of the State of their Souls; and ſhewing them how they muſt repent of their Sins, what they muſt do to be ſaved from their natural Miſery and Ruin, and, in ſhort, how they may obtain the full Salvation of the Goſpel; that ſo every one may be able to give an Anſwer to that moſt important Queſtion, <hi>What muſt I do that I may be a Child of God and inherit eternal Life?</hi> For let a Miniſter entertain his Hearers with the ſublimeſt Doctrines of Chriſtianity, let him alſo declaim againſt Sin and exhort them to their various Duties in the moſt earneſt and pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick manner, and let all be adorned with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Beauties of Wit and Eloquence; yet, after all, if his Sermons are not ſo contrived and fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as, at the ſame time, to inform the Ignorant how they may obtain an Intereſt in the Goſpel-Salvation for themſelves, and what Means and Methods God has appointed for that Purpoſe; what will it profit them? No more than a parcel
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:004534_0071_100D63F845F6D330"/>
of Shreds of Cloths, of various Dyes, tho' they were of the fineſt Thread and livelieſt Colours, would ſerve the Purpoſe of a Man who wants a handſome Garment; whereas a Sermon that informs the ignorant Sinner, not only of the Neceſſity of Converſion, but alſo how that happy Change may certainly be effected in his own Soul, may not unfitly be compared, in reſpect to its Uſefulneſs, to a complete Garment, made all of a Piece, well fitted to the Man's Shape that wants it, and which he may therefore put on and wear with Honour and Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>But now in order to all this, a Miniſter muſt take Pains with his own Heart, as well as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his Sermons; he muſt have a Zeal for Chriſt, and muſt aim at nothing ſo much as to bring Sinners to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This ſhould be in ſome Meaſure the Deſign and Drift of every Sermon that he preaches, that ſo if a Perſon ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to hear him but once in all his Life, he might, even by means of that one Sermon, get ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one thing needful, and be juſt enter'd at leaſt into the Way of Salvation. For this ſhould every Miniſter ſtudy and ſtrive, and for this ſhould he continually pray that God would fill his Heart with pious Zeal and holy Wiſdom, that ſo he may divide the Word of Truth aright, and adminiſter Grace unto Hearers.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. It might probably make ſome good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on the Minds of the People, was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter pretty often to inculcate, with great Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Seriouſneſs, the Neceſſity of Prayer; and more particularly what need they have to pray
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:004534_0072_100D63FA805B2020"/>
very earneſtly to the God of all Grace that he would ſet home his Word upon their Hearts, that he would bring the good Seed to Perfection in their full and bleſſed Conformity to himſelf. And further, ſo great is the Ignorance of many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerning the Duty of Prayer, that they ſeem to have no other Notion of it than merely a reading ſome Forms out of a Prayer-Book. This makes it to be as neceſſary, as it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be a uſeful thing, for a Miniſter to lead them, as it were by the Hand, into this Path of their Duty; that is, to explain it to them in a moſt eaſy and familiar manner, to ſhew them that it requires no great Art and Skill to pray acceptably unto God; for they are to ſpeak to him as Children to a loving Father, they are to ſpread before him their Sorrows and Complaints, they are to tell him of the State and Condition of their Souls, juſt as they find and feel it; and they need not be at all ſollicitous about Propriety of Expreſſion and elegant Phraſes in their ſecret Prayers; for God regards the Senſe of the Heart, rather than the Language of the Lips. The Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves furniſh us with ſeveral Examples of ſuch artleſs and yet acceptable Prayers. Let a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter then diligently inſtruct his Hearers how they are, in the firſt Place, to get their Hearts diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for Prayer; and it may be of uſe too to aſſiſt and furniſh the more ignorant with Words and ſit Expreſſions; but at the ſame time let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them that they need not tie themſelves to uſe thoſe very Words, nor any Form whatever; but that they ſhould learn to pour out their Hearts unto God, in ſuch Words by which they can beſt expreſs the real Sentiments and Affections of their
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:004534_0073_100D63FC07D24DD8"/>
own Souls, according to the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. lxii. 8. <hi>Ye people, pour out your hearts before him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. It is further extreamly neceſſary that Miniſters ſhould very often take Occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in their Sermons that Renewing or Change of the Mind, which is ſo eſſential to all true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and which yet, alas! but very few Perſons ſeem to underſtand, or indeed to have almoſt any Notion of. Nor is it enough to explain that firſt and mighty Change, which is at once made in a Sinner at his Converſion, when he comes to love that Good which before he hated, and to hate that Evil which he before loved, when from being an Unbeliever he becomes a Believer; or when his falſe and dead Faith is changed into a true and ſaving one: But that further progreſſive Change ſhould alſo be much recommended, in which the Chriſtian muſt be improving to the very End of his Life, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> refers to, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 18. <hi>But now</hi> (the Veil which was upon the Heart being taken away, and the Spirit of the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken up his dwelling in it, Verſes 16, 17.) <hi>we all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Hereby the Mind is more and more renewed, the Chriſtian grows up in the Spirit and Temper of Chriſt, and his lovely Image is drawn upon the Soul in fairer Lines every Day than other.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. It is of conſiderable Moment alſo that the whole Faith and Duty of a Chriſtian be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its moſt amiable and attractive Light, that ſo Sinners may be won to Religion upon a full
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:004534_0074_100D63FFCD233C48"/>
Conviction, that if they would do well for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and obtain true Peace and Comfort, the ſhorteſt, the ſureſt, and indeed the only Way is to turn in good earneſt from Sin to God and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and that Religion is by no means a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and melancholy thing, which any need be afraid of, but full of Pleaſure and greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable even for its own Sake; and tho' it calls us indeed to a preſent Combat, and requires us to ſight and ſtrive againſt Sin; yet this is but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Peace and to a certain Victory, which will much more than recompence the Toils of the War.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. It were much to be wiſhed that Miniſters would not take up more of their Sermons than needs muſt in explaining their Text, but rather, after as ſhort an Explication of it as is ſufficient to lead their Hearers into the true Senſe and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (which muſt by no means be neglected) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to the Application; and in that, let a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter addreſs himſelf to his Hearers with a becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Seriouſneſs and Earneſtneſs; let him apply his Subject both to Saints and Sinners, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and to the Unconverted, in order to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the Secure and Careleſs, and to build up true Believers in their Faith and Holineſs. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience would ſoon ſhew that this is by far the more profitable Way, than to ſpend almoſt the whole Diſcourſe, as ſome do, in explaining their Text and Subject, and then cloſe with a very ſhort Application, becauſe the Time is gone.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. It were alſo greatly to be wiſhed, that thoſe Under-Shepherds of the Flock of Chriſt would
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:004534_0075_100D6401FA75ED58"/>
make it more deſignedly and zealouſly the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their Preaching to bring Sinners to him, who is the great Shepherd of the Sheep; that they would ſtrive by the moſt winning Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they can poſſibly uſe, and eſpecially by ſuch as the Grace of the Goſpel will naturally ſuggeſt, to perſwade and even to compel them to come to him. As the Hen when ſhe lights on a few Crumbs or Grains of Corn, how earneſtly does ſhe invite her Brood to come and ſhare the Treaſure with her! She will by no means be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied nor leave off calling them till they come. Thus did our bleſſed Saviour; how graciouſly did he call and invite Sinners to come to him in the Days of his perſonal Miniſtry upon Earth! As Matt. xi. 28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt,</hi> &amp;c. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain John vii. 37, 38. <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink: He that believeth on me, as the ſcripture ſaith, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water.</hi> And much to the ſame Purpoſe we find him ſpeaking in ſeveral other Places. Thus alſo we hear the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in the Old Teſtament, inviting Sinners unto Chriſt, Iſai. lv. 1. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> &amp;c. and thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 2 Cor. v. 11. <hi>We beſeech you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> And thus doth the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> over and over in his divine Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Remarkable to this Purpoſe alſo are thoſe Words of our bleſſed Saviour concerning <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> Matt. xxiii. 37. <hi>How often would I have gathered thy children even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing!</hi> Chriſt called Sinners to come to <hi>himſelf,</hi> as their proper Lord and Maſter,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:004534_0076_100D640431C19068"/>
as their only Redeemer and Saviour; whereas <hi>we,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, preach not ourſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. iv. 5. and therefore we endeavour to bring Sinners not to ourſelves, but to Him. But now in order to this, and that a Miniſter may be thus happily ſucceſsful in his Preaching, he muſt not only ſincerely love his People and have an affectionate Concern for their Salvation, but he muſt be an ardent Lover of Chriſt too; he muſt wiſh and deſire and covet nothing ſo much as to bring all that hear him to Chriſt, to deliver every one of them, as it were, into his gracious Arms, could he but perſwade them to be ſo happy; that thus they may learn, even by the Example of their Miniſter, to love the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. For this purpoſe it is farther requiſite that a Miniſter ſhould very often take Occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play, in the moſt lively Colours that he can, the Excellency and Glory of Chriſt's Perſon, the Kindneſs of his Heart and the exceeding Riches of his Grace both as he is God and Man, as he is now a glorious triumphant Saviour, as well as once he ſuſtained &amp; executed the ſame Office in a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled &amp; ſuffering State. And that he further inform his Hearers what excellent Bleſſings are treaſured up in Chriſt to be beſtowed on all his Friends and People, that ſo they may be drawn to him by a Principle of Deſire and Love, that they may moſt willingly give him their Hearts; and that ſo it may be the Breathing of their Souls and the Matter of their moſt earneſt Prayer to Chriſt, that he would be pleaſed to manifeſt his Love to them, that he would <hi>ſhed it abroad in their heart by his
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:004534_0077_100D6405B55D06A8"/>
holy Spirit,</hi> Rom. v. 5, that he would more and more reveal to them the Glory of his Majeſty, that he would impreſs and affect their Minds with a lively Senſe of it, that ſo they may yet more and more love and honour him their heavenly Spouſe, by whom it is that they have, and that they farther hope for Acceſs to and Acceptance with the Father, and with whom they alſo hope to dwell for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. The Love of Chriſt ought to be much more inſiſted on by Preachers than what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly done; becauſe when we apply to ourſelves in a right Manner, his Paſſion, Death and Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Merits, and that Purchaſe of Salvation which he hath made for us, the Knowledge of his Love to us, and of our Pardon and Juſtification thro' Faith in his Blood, it is the trueſt Spring and moſt powerful Attractive of our Love to him. Now the more we love Chriſt, and that for this very Reaſon, <hi>becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> the better will every other Branch of our Religion flouriſh, every other Grace and every Duty will then flow from its proper Fountain; and therefore the more a Miniſter endeavours to inſtil this Principle of ſacred Love into the Hearts of his Hearers, the more comfortable Succeſs will he probably ſee of his Labours, in their ſpiritual Improvement and growing Obedience to the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially, and in the firſt Place, let every Miniſter look to his own Heart; and ſee to it that he himſelf loves Chriſt fervently, leſt he ſhould be as <hi>the ſounding braſs and as the tinkling cymbal,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 1.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:004534_0078_100D64075247B7D0"/>
And beſides, without a ſincere Love to Chriſt in his own Soul, there will be little Probability of his recommending him effectually to the Love of others. It is not enough for him to preach a great many Sermons upon the Love of Chriſt, and to exhort his Hearers to love him; for if his own Heart is not warmed with this ſacred Love, his Diſcourſes on that Subject will be apt to be cold and lifeleſs, and therefore unprofitable and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Nothing could be more pertinently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in a few Words, to one that asked ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, How he might learn to be a good and a uſeful Preacher? than this, <hi>Si multum ames Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> You muſt learn to be a zealous Lover of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But then let it be further noted, that ſincere Love to Chriſt will always expreſs itſelf not only in Words, but by ſuitable or correſpondent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So our Saviour has taught us, John xv. 14. <hi>Ye are my friends,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if ye do whatſoever I command you;</hi> i. e. this is the beſt and moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Evidence of your ſincere Friendſhip, and that you truly love me.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. I reckon alſo the Duties of Self-denial and Weanedneſs from the World and its carnal Pleaſures, and, in ſhort, from all the preſent things of Senſe and Time, to be among thoſe more important and neceſſary Subjects which Miniſters ſhould often preach upon, oftner indeed than moſt of them do. Theſe are Subjects which our Saviour Chriſt, when he was a Preacher upon Earth, very much inſiſted upon in his Sermons, as you may ſee particularly Matt. xvi. 24, 25, 26.
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:004534_0079_100D64098939FBF8"/>
                     <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and take up his croſs and follow me.</hi> Luke xiv. 26. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yea and his own life alſo,</hi> i. e. in Compariſon of me, <hi>he cannot be my diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And how needful are theſe Subjects now? For alas! how many Perſons are there, who can talk well about Chriſt and Religion, nay who carry a fair Appearance of Virtue and Godlineſs, and who perform many outward Duties with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Honour, and yet not having learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deny themſelves, their Love of the World not being ſufficiently mortified, they are eaſily overcome in a Day of Trial, and ſacrifice their Religion and their Souls to their worldly Intereſt. Let Self-denial then be earneſtly recommended, and that, not merely as a moral Virtue or philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Attainment, I mean not upon ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples only as the Heathen Moraliſts uſed to inſiſt upon; but let it be recommended and urged as a Chriſtian Grace, as that which flows chiefly from Love to Chriſt, even ſuch a Love as will make us ready to deny ourſelves the Pleaſures, Riches and Honours of this World, all manner of ſenſual Gratifications, and our very Lives themſelves, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> for his Sake, as Chriſt not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects but requires of us, <hi>Matt.</hi> xvi. 25.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. Tho' the diligent reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves, even the inſpired Writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and the very Words of our Saviour Chriſt, ſhould be chiefly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as they are undoubtedly far preferable to any other Books of mere human Compoſure; yet beſides theſe a Miniſter may very profitably
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:004534_0080_100D640BC02ED448"/>
recommend to his Hearers ſome other good Books of Religion, both ancient and modern, to be read by them at home in their own Cloſets or Families: Such Books I mean as are written in a truly evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Strain, and with a Spirit of lively Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Piety, which would be no inconſiderable Means, both of preſerving and nouriſhing the Fire of divine Love in their Hearts. I might mention, by way of Inſtance, <hi>Martin Statius's Lutherus Redivivus,</hi> which is nothing elſe but an Abridgment of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Works, in which the moſt conſiderable Paſſages are collected into a narrow Room, and ſuch Paſſages more eſpecially, as have the moſt direct and powerful Tendency to awaken and to excite the Minds of Men to lively practical Religion. However, I mention this but as one Inſtance, out of a great many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excellent and uſeful Books which the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God has now furniſhed his Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and which we ought to account as a precious Treaſure to it. And further, let not any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter think that 'tis the People only who are to be profited in their Souls by the reading ſuch good Books, while all the uſe that he is concerned to make of them for himſelf, is only to form his Stile by reading them, or to borrow Thoughts from them, or it may be to ſteal Sermons out of them (which is ſhamefully the Practice of too many Preachers) but he ſhould read them, chiefly and in the firſt Place, with a View to his own ſpiritual Edification. He ſhould endeavour ſo to uſe and improve the Gifts which God has beſtowed on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men, as that his own Soul may be the better for them as well as the Souls of the People to whom he preaches</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <pb n="85" facs="unknown:004534_0081_100D640D47FC4408"/>XVI. Once more, let faithful Miniſters by no means forget to recommend it to their Hearers, that they would familiarly acquaint themſelves and converſe with ſerious, lively, and growing Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and with ſuch more eſpecially as excel in the Gift and Spirit of Prayer; for as a live Coal kindles another that is cold and dead, ſo will the ſavoury Diſcourſe, the fervent Prayers and the holy Converſation of warm and lively Chriſtians, be a probable Means of kindling the ſame Fire of divine Love in the Souls of dead Sinners; or at leaſt of nouriſhing &amp; improving the ſacred Flame in the Hearts of their more intimate Chriſtian Friends. Miniſters ſhould therefore do all they can to promote ſuch Chriſtian Converſation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the more ſerious part of their Hearers: Obſerving however the Rules of neceſſary Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, particularly that of the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. xiv. 40. <hi>Let all things be done decently and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> They ſhould exhort them as St. <hi>Paul</hi> does the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Col. iii. 16. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſdom, teaching and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing one another in pſalms and hymns and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſongs, ſinging with grace in your hearts unto the Lord;</hi> to which pious Purpoſe that large and rich Treaſure of ſacred Hymns, both ancient and modern, with which God has graciouſly bleſſed his Church, is not a little conducive, for which therefore we are bound to render him immortal Praiſes.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have briefly anſwered your Queſtion, and given you my Thoughts on the moſt uſeful Way of Preaching. May God, for Chriſt's Sake, attend what I have written with his effectual

Bleſſing. To him I would now humbly offer up the following Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>O Lord God! give, I beſeech thee, both now and at all times hereafter to thy Church, Paſtors and Teachers after thine own Heart, even ſuch as ſhall bring the Sheep of Chriſt into his Fold, and who, thro' the Influence of thy good Spirit, ſhall feed them with ſaving Knowledge and Underſtanding. Make every Preacher of thy Word to know and always to remember, that <hi>neither is he that planteth any thing,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>he that watereth,</hi> but thou art all in all, who alone canſt give the Increaſe. Let none of them vainly preſume on their own Skill and Ability to do any good by their preaching, and obtain any good Succeſs; but let them all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wait upon thee, and by fervent daily Prayer let them ſeek for and obtain the Aids of thy Grace, to enable them to diſpenſe the Word of Life, and thy Bleſſing render their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happily ſucceſsful to the Souls of thoſe that hear them.</q> 
                     <hi>Amen.</hi>
