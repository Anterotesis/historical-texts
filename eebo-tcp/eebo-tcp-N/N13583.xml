            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I SINCERELY congratulate you, my honored Auditors, on the confirmation of happy tidings, and the certainty of that auspicious event, which has already diffused joy thro' the breast of every true American; which gives such an unusual flow to our spirits at this time, and has induced such numbers to consecrate this day to festivity and mirth.</p>
            <p>Could I, my respectable fellow citizens, on this happy occasion, answer my own wishes, I might, with the greater probability of success, hope to answer yours: Or could I feel that gratitude and devotion to the supreme dispenser of all good, which the late instance of his unmerited favor demands; or utter the genuine, the exhilerated emotions of my heart in language and eloquence the most expressive of my feelings, I might with the greater reason flatter myself that you would not go away altogether disappointed and unsatisfied. But being unpractised in oratorial exercises, and unfurnished with oratorial talents; the shortness of the notice, and my being unacquainted with many of the entertaining circumstances of the glorious event in which we are now rejoicing, render me unable to do justice to the occasion;—to do justice to our brave country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and allies, who have been the happy instruments of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing for us this glory and joy; and most of all, to do
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017153_0003_0FA06D3D50CFECB0"/>
justice to the merciful Superintendency of that Being,
"whose is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory."</p>
            <p>But as the heart, when overflowing with joy, is the most disposed to benevolence and candor, I take courage to proceed in my appointed task.</p>
            <p>And in the first place, we ought, with the warmest emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of gratitude, and the sincerest resolutions of answerable returns, to ascribe that praise and glory to the GOD of Heaven which is due to his name.
"O sing unto the Lord a new song, for he hath triumphed gloriously, he hath done marvellous things; his right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory."</p>
            <p>The joyous event which the hand of Providence hath pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duced, and which we are this day triumphantly celebrating, is no less than the Capture of the whole British Army under the command of Lord CORNWALLIS, together with several vessels of force, a number of transports and seamen, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable quantity of military stores, &amp;c. by the combined army of French and Americans, under the command of his Excellency General WASHINGTON, in conjunction with the fleet commanded by Count de GRASSE.</p>
            <p>As his Lordship was an active and enterprizing General, resolute and intrepid, the Ministry and their friends placed much dependence upon him; and he was soon to have taken the command of all the British troops in America. He is therefore to be esteemed the more valuable prize; and his surrender is a more fortunate acquisition to us, and a greater
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017153_0004_0FA06D444EA9E030"/>
loss and disappointment to them.—His army, consisting of between 7 and 8000, most of them veteran troops, being all made prisoners of war, not only relieves Virginia and the rest of the Southern States (as the capture of BURGOYNE and his army, four Years ago, relieved us in the North) but is such a diminution of the force of the enemy, that it seems as if, instead of giving much disturbance to us, they must now tremble for themselves.</p>
            <p>This event must be considered, not only as important and glorious in itself, but as big with the most happy conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. Not to mention the tendency it will have to cement the union between the three already allied nations of <hi>France, Spain</hi> and <hi>America</hi>; and to make Americans set a yet higher value on the friendship and assistance of their Allies, it must, unless the British ministry and nation have drunken the very dregs of the cup of infatuation, change their counsels and measures—accelerate an honorable peace, and establish our Liberties and Independence; as this, in conjunction with other instances of success on our side, must convince them of their utter inability to "bring America to their feet." And when the report of this capture reaches the Congress of the United Powers of Europe, it must exalt their opinion of the importance of America, and of the resolute and independent spirit of Americans, and influence their determinations in our favour. This will heighten the esteem of all other nations, and add warmth to their courtship of our alliance, commerce and protection. And may we not hope, that the ill success of Britain will be universally considered as the frown of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017153_0005_0FA06D4519D37340"/>
Heaven, and a just punishment for her cruel and unrighteous attempts upon America;—serve as a check to the exorbitance of ambition and despotism<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deter other powers from lifting a rebellious hand against the sacred rights of mankind? And on my part, I cannot forbear being gratified, not only at the humiliating subjugation of a person of Lord <hi>Cornwallis</hi>'s insolence and pride, to American Rebels, as he scornfully stigmatized us; but also at the mortification and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the haughty nation of Britain, of the Ministry, and of their tyrannical Prince, when the fatal news comes like a sudden thunder-clap to their ears.</p>
            <p>This glorious event, on the 19th of October 1781, pregnant with such happy consequences (which I must leave to your imaginations further to enumerate, and to Providence to realize and bring forward in their season) revives the joyful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the similar surrender of General <hi>Burgoyne</hi> and his army, on the 17th of October 1777, when Heaven, in a manner equally propitious and remarkable, smiled upon our northern army, under the command of General GATES.</p>
            <p>These exploits will shine with a distinguished brilliancy in the Annals of Fame. What a radiance will this struggle for Liberty, which has produced such exertions of genius and prowess, throw around America! 'Tis enough to make us proud of our country, and to glory in the name of Americans; yea, even to make it criminal to be destitute of this pride.— Many nations have in their turn been celebrated for noble atchievements—for battles won—for cities taken, and for
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017153_0006_0FA06D45A4CD99B0"/>
countries gradually subdued. But the glory of capturing whole armies together, one after another, with experienced commanders at their head, by superior generalship, and with little loss of time or of blood, is reserved for America.</p>
            <p>Happy Country! the scene of such wonders, the nurse of such heroes, the defender of Liberty, and the care of <hi>JEHOVAH!</hi> How natural is it to look forward to distant posterity, and figure to ourselves their increase, their tranquility, their freedom, their prosperity! Soon, we trust, will
'commence the aera of our quiet enjoyment of those liberties which our fathers purchased with the toil of their whole lives, with their treasure, with their blood. Safe from the enemy of the wilderness; safe from the griping hand of arbitrary sway, here shall be the late founded seat of peace and of freedom. Here shall arts and sciences, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of tranquility, flourish. Here shall dwell uncorrupted faith, the pure worship of God in it's primitive simplicity, unawed, unrestrained, uninterrupted. Here shall religion and liberty extend their benign influences to savage, enslaved and benighted nations.'
—How can we forbear rejoicing in such happy prospects, as well as in the events which open such prospects to our view? How can we help testifying the gladness of our hearts in every decent way, in which joy can be expressed, communicated and heightened, and the event which gave rise to this joy be fixed deep in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of all, and transmitted to future generations? But our care should be, that
'Religion may preside over the joy of this day, and that gratitude to Heaven may exalt it. There
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017153_0007_0FA06D4652BDCA60"/>
are some civil and military demonstrations of gladness that so great an occasion demands. But the blessing is too divine, the joy is too great, too sacred, to be affronted by profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or polluted and debased by sensuality.'</p>
            <p>'May our gracious Benefactor perfect the work of mercy in which we are rejoicing, and grant that neither we, nor those that come after us, may wantonly forfeit these blessings and these hopes! May the cause of Liberty and of pure Religion still advance by the favour of the Almighty, 'till every nation shall be happy under the government of the Prince of Peace; and truth, freedom and righteousness universally prevail!'</p>
            <l>"Till pride shall cease its neighbors to invade,</l>
            <l>"And swains at ease enjoy their humble shade:</l>
            <l>"Till guilty spears shall cease to blush with gore,</l>
            <l>"And swords be drunk with christian blood no more:</l>
            <l>"Till harmless those in pruning-hooks are found,</l>
            <l>"And these in plough-shares mark the furrow'd ground:</l>
            <l>"Till exil'd peace, returning from above,</l>
            <l>"To human-kind propitious, heav'nly dove!</l>
            <l>"Shall olive to each clime, each country bring,</l>
            <l>"And spread o'er nations wide her fostering wing:</l>
            <l>"Till wrath and hate are banish'd in their turn,</l>
            <l>"And ev'ry breast with purer flame shall burn!</l>
            <l>"Till then, O Heaven!" AMERICA befriend,</l>
            <l>Her Rights maintain, her Liberties defend.</l>
