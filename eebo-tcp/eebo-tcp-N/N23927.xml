            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE writing travels, or memoirs, has ever been a pleaſant employment, for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or ſenſibility always renders it intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In writing theſe deſultory letters, I found I could not avoid, being continually the firſt perſon—"the little hero of each tale." I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were deſigned for publication; but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as I arranged my thoughts, my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I found, became ſtiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unreſtrained, as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that I could not give a juſt deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what I ſaw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilſt the impreſſion was ſtill freſh.</p>
            <p>A perſon has a right, I have ſometimes thought, when amuſed by a witty or intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing egotiſt, to talk of himſelf when he can win on our attention by acquiring our affection. Whether I deſerve to rank amongſt this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged number, my readers alone can judge— and I give them leave to ſhut the book, if they do not wiſh to become better acquainted with me.</p>
            <p>My plan was ſimply to endeavour to give a juſt view of the preſent ſtate of the countries I have paſſed through, as far as I could obtain
<pb facs="unknown:031653_0003_0fed8de453bb4500"/>
information during ſo ſhort a reſidence; avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe details which, without being very uſeful to travellers who follow the ſame route, appear very inſiped to thoſe who only accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you in their chair.</p>

               <p>ELEVEN days of wearineſs on board a veſſel not intended for the accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of paſſengers have ſo exhauſted my ſpirits, to ſay nothing of the other cauſes, with which you are already ſufficiently acquainted, that it is with ſome difficulty I adhere to my determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of giving you my obſervations, as I travel through new ſcenes, whiſt warmed with the impreſſion they have made on me.</p>
               <p>The captain, as I mentioned to you, promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put me on ſhore at Arendall<note n="*" place="bottom">In Norway,</note>, or Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enburg, in his way to Elſineur; but contrary winds obliged us to paſs both places during the night. In the morning, however, after we had loſt ſight of the entrance of the latter bay, the veſſel was becalmed; and the captain, to oblige me, hanging out a ſignal for a pilot, bore down towards the ſhore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:031653_0005_0fed8ded37e33870"/>My attention was particularly directed to the light-houſe; and you can ſcarcely imagine with what anxiety I watched two long hours for a boat to emancipate me—ſtill no one appeared. Every cloud that flitted on the horizon was hailed as a liberator, till approaching nearer, like moſt of the proſpects ſketched by hope, it diſſolved under the eye into diſappointment.</p>
               <p>Weary of expectation, I then began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the captain on the ſubject; and, from the tenour of the information my queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons drew forth, I ſoon concluded, that, if I waited for a boat, I had little chance of getting on ſhore at this place. Deſpotiſm, as is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the caſe, I found had here cramped the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of man. The pilots being paid by the king, and ſcantily, they will not run into any danger, or even quit their hovels, if they can poſſibly avoid it, only to fulfil what is termed their duty. How different is it on the engliſh coaſt, where, in the moſt ſtormy weather, boats immediately hail you, brought out by the expectation of extraordinary profit. Diſlik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſail for Elſineur, and ſtill more to lie at anchor, or cruiſe about the coaſt for ſeveral days, I exerted all my rhetoric to prevail on the captain to let me have the ſhip's boat; and though I added the moſt forcible of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, I for a long time addreſſed him in vain.</p>
               <p>It is a kind of rule at ſea, not to ſend out a boat. The captain was a good-natured man; but men with common minds ſeldom break
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031653_0006_0fed8deedb0484e8"/>
through general rules. Prudence is ever the reſort of weakneſs; and they rarely go as far as they may in any undertaking, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to go beyond it on any account If, however, I had ſome trouble with the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, I did not loſe much time with the ſailors; for they, all alacrity, hoiſted out the boat, the moment I obtained permiſſion, and promiſed to row me to the light-houſe.</p>
               <p>I did not once allow myſelf to doubt of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a conveyance from thence round the rocks—and then away for Gothenburg—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement is ſo unpleaſant.</p>
               <p>The day was fine; and I enjoyed the water till, approaching the little iſland, poor Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerite, whoſe timidity always acts as a feeler before her adventuring ſpirit, began to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at our not ſeeing any inhabitants. I did not liſten to her. But when, on landing, the ſame ſilence prevailed, I caught the alarm, which was not leſſened by the ſight of two old men, whom we forced out of their wretched hut. Scarcely human in their appearance, we with difficulty obtained an intelligible reply to our queſtions—the reſult of which was, that they had no boat, and were not allowed to quit their poſt, on any pretence. But, they informed us, that there was at the other ſide, eight or ten miles over, a pilot's dwelling; two guineas tempted the ſailors to riſk the captain's diſpleaſure, and once more embark to row me over.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:031653_0007_0fed8df078d898d8"/>The weather was pleaſant, and the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſhore ſo grand, that I ſhould have enjoyed the two hours it took to reach it, but for the fatigue which was too viſible in the countenances of the ſailors who, inſtead of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering a complaint, were, with the thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs hilarity peculiar to them, joking about the poſſibility of the captain's taking advantage of a ſlight weſterly breeze, which was ſpringing up, to ſail without them. Yet, in ſpite of their good humour, I could not help growing unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy when the ſhore, receding, as it were, as we advanced, ſeemed to promiſe no end to their toil. This anxiety increaſed when, turning into the moſt pictureſque bay I ever ſaw, my eyes ſought in vain for the veſtige of a human habitation. Before I could determine what ſtep to take in ſuch a dilemma, for I could not bear to think of returning to the ſhip, the ſight of a barge relieved me, and we haſtened towards it for information. We were immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to paſs ſome jutting rocks when we ſhould ſee a pilot's hut.</p>
               <p>There was a ſolemn ſilence in this ſcene, which made itſelf be felt. The ſun-beams that played on the ocean, ſcarcely ruffled by the lighteſt breeze, contraſted with the huge, dark rocks, that looked like the rude materials of creation forming the barrier of unwrought ſpace, forcibly ſtruck me; but I ſhould not have been ſorry if the cottage had not appeared equally tranquil. Approaching a retreat where ſtrangers, eſpecially women, ſo ſeldom appeared, I wondered that curioſity did not
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031653_0008_0fed8df7d587fe50"/>
bring the beings who inhabited it to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows or door. I did not immediately recollect that men who remain ſo near the brute creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as only to exert themſelves to find the food neceſſary to ſuſtain life, have little or no imagination to call forth the curioſity neceſſary to fructify the faint glimmerings of mind which entitles them to rank as lords of the creation.— Had they either, they could not contentedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main rooted in the clods they ſo indolently cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the ſailors went to ſeek for the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh inhabitants, theſe concluſions, occurr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me; and, recollecting the extreme fondneſs which the pariſians ever teſtify for novelty, their very curioſity appeared to me a proof of the progreſs they had made in refinement. Yes; in the art of living—in the art of eſcaping from the cares which embarraſs the firſt ſteps towards the attainment of the pleaſures of ſocial life.</p>
               <p>The pilots informed the ſailors that they were under the direction of a lieutenant retired from the ſervice, who ſpoke engliſh; adding, that they could do nothing without his orders; and even the offer of money could hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer their lazineſs, and prevail on them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company us to his dwelling. They would not go with me alone which I wanted them to have done, becauſe I wiſhed to diſmiſs the ſailors as ſoon as poſſible. Once more we rowed off, they following tardily, till, turning round another bold protuberance of the rocks, we ſaw
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031653_0009_0fed8dfc82179948"/>
a boat making towards us, and ſoon learnt that it was the lieutenant himſelf, coming with ſome earneſtneſs to ſee who we were.</p>
               <p>To ſave the ſailors any further toil, I had my baggage inſtantly removed into his boat; for, as he could ſpeak engliſh, a previous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was not neceſſary; though Marguerite's reſpect for me could hardly keep her from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the fear, ſtrongly marked on her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which my putting ourſelves into the power of a ſtrange man excited. He pointed out his cottage; and, drawing near to it, I was not ſorry to ſee a female figure, though I had not, like Marguerite, been thinking of robberies, murders, or the other evil which inſtantly, as the ſailors would have ſaid, runs foul of a woman's imagination.</p>
               <p>On entering, I was ſtill better pleaſed to find a clean houſe, with ſome degree of rural elegance. The beds were of muſlin, coarſe it is true, but dazzlingly white; and the floor was ſtrewed over with little ſprigs of Juniper (the cuſtom, as I afterwards found, of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try), which formed a contraſt with the curtains and produced an agreeable ſenſation of freſhneſs, to ſoften the ardour of noon. Still nothing was ſo pleaſing as the alacrity of hoſpitality— all that the houſe afforded was quickly ſpread on the whiteſt linen.—Remember I had juſt left the veſſel, where, without being faſtidious, I had continually been diſguſted. Fiſh, milk, butter, and cheeſe, and I am ſorry to add, brandy, the bane of this country, were ſpread
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031653_0010_0fed8e025bae8c40"/>
on the board. After we had dined, hoſpitality made them, with ſome degree of myſtery, bring us ſome excellent coffee. I did not then know that it was prohibited.</p>
               <p>The good man of the houſe apologized for coming in continually, but declared that he was ſo glad to ſpeak engliſh, he could not ſtay out, He need not have apologized; I was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually glad of his company. With the wife I could only exchange ſmiles; and ſhe was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed obſerving the make of our clothes. My hands, I found, had firſt led her to diſcover that I was the lady. I had, of courſe, my quantum of reverences; for the politeneſs of the north ſeems to partake of the coldneſs of the climate, and the rigidity of its iron ſinew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rocks. Amongſt the peaſantry, there is, however, ſo much of the ſimplicity of the golden age in this land of flint—ſo much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of heart, and fellow-feeling, that only benevolence, and the honeſt ſympathy of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, diffuſed ſmiles over my countenance when they kept me ſtanding, regardleſs of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, whilſt they dropt courteſy after cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy.</p>
               <p>The ſituation of this houſe was beautiful, though choſen for convenience. The maſter being the officer who commanded all the pilots on the coaſt, and the perſon apointed to guard wrecks, it was neceſſary for him to fix on a ſpot that would overlook the whole bay. As he had ſeen ſome ſervice, he wore, not without a pride I thought becoming, a badge to prove
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031653_0011_0fed8e03f8e63920"/>
that he had merited well of his country. It was happy, I thought, that he had been paid in honour; for the ſtipend he received was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than twelve pounds a year.—I do not trouble myſelf or you with the calculation of ſwediſh ducats. Thus, my friend, you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the neceſſity of <hi>perquiſites.</hi> This ſame narrow policy runs through every thing. I ſhall have occaſion further to animadvert in it.</p>
               <p>Though my hoſt amuſed me with an account of himſelf, which gave me an idea of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the people I was about to viſit, I was eager to climb the rocks to view the country, and ſee whether the honeſt tars had regained their ſhip. With the help of the lieutenant's teleſcope I ſaw the veſſel underway with a fair though gentle gale. The ſea was calm, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful even as the moſt ſhallow ſtream, and on the vaſt baſon I did not ſee a dark ſpeck to indicate the boat. My conductors were conſequently arrived.</p>
               <p>Straying further, my eye was attracted by the ſight of ſome heart's-eaſe that peeped through the rocks. I caught at it as a good omen, and going to preſerve it in a letter that had not conveyed balm to my heart, a cruel remembrance ſuffuſed my eyes; but it paſſed away like an April ſhower. If you are deep read in Shakſpeare, you will recollect that this was the little weſtern flower tinged by love's dart, which "maidens call love in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs." The gaiety of my babe was unmixed;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031653_0012_0fed8e059b241ad8"/>
regardleſs of omens or ſentiments, ſhe found a few wild ſtrawberries more grateful than flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or fancies.</p>
               <p>The lieutenant informed me that this was a commodious bay. Of that I could not judge, though I felt its pictureſque beauty. Rocks were piled on rocks, forming a ſuitable bulwark to the ocean. Come no further, they empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically ſaid, turning their dark ſides to the waves to augment the idle roar. The view was ſterile; ſtill little patches of earth, of the moſt exquiſite verdure, enamelled with the ſweeteſt wild flowers, ſeemed to promiſe the goats and a few ſtraggling cows luxurious her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage. How ſilent and peaceful was the ſcene. I gazed around with rapture, and felt more of that ſpontaneous pleaſure which gives credebil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to our expectation of happineſs, than I had for a long, long time before. I forgot the horrors I had witneſſed in France, which had caſt a gloom over all native, and ſuffering the enthuſiaſm of my character, too often, graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God! damped by the tears of diſappointed affection, to be lighted up afreſh, care took wing while ſimple fellow feeling expanded my heart.</p>
               <p>To prolong this enjoyment, I readily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the propoſal of our hoſt to pay a viſit to a family, the maſter of which ſpoke engliſh, who was the drolle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t dog in the country, he added, repeating ſome of his ſtories, with a hearty laugh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:031653_0013_0fed8e0a26828158"/>I walked on, ſtill delighted with the rude beauties of the ſcene! for the ſublime often gave place imperceptibly to the beautiful, dilating the emotions which were painfully concentrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>When we entered this abode, the largeſt I had yet ſeen, I was introduced to a numerous family; but the father, from whom I was led to expect ſo much entertainment, was abſent. The lieutenant conſequently was obliged to be the interpreter of our reciprocal compliments. The phraſes were awkwardly tranſmitted, it is true; but looks and geſtures were ſufficient to make them intelligible and intereſting. The girls were all vivacity, and reſpect for me could ſcarcely keep them from romping with my hoſt, who, aſking for a pinch of ſnuff, was preſented with a box, out of which an artificial mouſe, faſtened to the bottom, ſprung. Though this trick had doubtleſs been played time out of mind, yet the laughter it excited was not leſs genuine.</p>
               <p>They were overflowing with civility; but to prevent their almoſt killing my babe with kindneſs, I was obliged to ſhorten my viſit; and two or three of the girls accompanied us, bringing with them a part of whatever the houſe afforded to contribute towards rendering my ſupper more plentiful; and plentiful in fact it was, though I with difficulty did honour to ſome of the diſhes, not reliſhing the quantity of ſugar and ſpices put into every thing. At ſupper my hoſt told me bluntly that I was a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031653_0014_0fed8e0d2ae47be8"/>
woman of obſervation, for I aſked him <hi>men's queſtions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The arrangements for my journey were quickly made; I could only have a car with poſt-horſes, as I did not chuſe to wait till a carriage could be ſent for to Gothenburg. The expenſe of my journey, about one or two and twenty engliſh miles, I found would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to more than eleven or twelve ſhillings, paying, he aſſured me, generouſly. I gave him a guniea and a half. But it was with the greateſt difficulty that I could make him take ſo much, indeed any thing for my lodging and fare. He declared that it was next to robbing me, explaining how much I ought to pay on the road. However, as I was poſitive, he took the guinea for himſelf; but, as a condition, inſiſted on accompanying me, to prevent my meeting with any trouble or impoſition on the way.</p>
               <p>I then retired to my apartment with regret. The night was ſo fine, that I would gladly have rambled about much longer; yet recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting that I muſt riſe very early; I reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly went to bed: but my ſenſes had been ſo awake, and my imagination ſtill continued ſo buſy, that I ſought for reſt in vain. Riſing before ſix, I ſcented the ſweet morning air; I had long before heard the birds twittering to hail the dawning day, though it could ſcarcely have been allowed to have departed.</p>
               <p>Nothing, in fact, can equal the beauty of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031653_0015_0fed8e1033339310"/>
the northern ſummer's evening and night; if night it may be called that only wants the glare of day, the full light, which frequently ſeems ſo impertinent; for I could write at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night very well without a candle. I contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated all nature at reſt; the rocks, even grown darker in their appearance, looked as if they partook of the general repoſe, and reclined more heavily on their foundation.—What, I exclaimed, is this active principle which keeps me ſtill awake?—Why fly my thoughts abroad when every thing around me appears at home? My child was ſleeping with equal calmneſs— innocent and ſweet as the cloſing flowers.— Some recollections, attached to the idea of home, mingled with reflections reſpecting the ſtate of ſociety I had been contemplating that evening, made a tear drop on the roſy cheek I had juſt killed; and emotions that trembled on the brink of extacy and agony gave a poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy to my ſenſations, which made me feel more alive than uſual.</p>
               <p>What are theſe imperious ſympathies? How frequently has melancholy and even myſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy taken poſſeſſion of me, when the world has diſguſted me, and friends have proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. I have then conſidered myſelf as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle broken off from the grand maſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;—I was alone, till ſome involuntary ſympathetic emotion, like the attraction of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, made me feel that I was full a part of a mighty whole, from which I could not ſever myſelf—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by ſnapping the thread
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031653_0016_0fed8e133a6c7f48"/>
of an exiſtance which loſes its charms in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the cruel experience of life ſtops or poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the current of the heart. Futurity, what haſt thou not to give to thoſe who know that there is ſuch a thing as happineſs! I ſpeak not of philoſophical contentment, though pain has afforded them the ſtrongeſt conviction of it.</p>
               <p>After our coffee and milk, for the miſtreſs of the houſe had been rouſed long before us by her hoſpitality, my baggage was taken forward in a boat by my hoſt, becauſe the car could not ſafely have been brought to the houſe.</p>
               <p>The road at firſt was very rocky and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome; but our driver was careful, and the horſes accuſtomed to the frequent and ſudden acclivities and deſcents! ſo that not apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any danger, I played with my girl, whom I would not leave to Marguerite's care, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her timidity.</p>
               <p>Stopping at a little inn to bait the horſes, I ſaw the firſt countenance in Sweden that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed me, though the man was better dreſſed than any one who had as yet fallen in my way. An altercation took place between him and my hoſt, the purport of which I could not gueſs, excepting that I was the occaſion of it, be it what it would. The ſequel was his leaving the houſe angrily; and I was immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that he was the cuſtom-houſe officer. The profeſſional had indeed effaced the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

character, for living as he did with theſe frank hoſpitable people, ſtill only the exciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man appeared,—the counterpart of ſome I had met with in England and France. I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided with a paſſport, not having entered any great town. At Gothenburg I knew I could immediately obtain one, and only the trouble made me object to the ſearching my trunks. He bluſtered for money; but the lieutenant was determined to guard me, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to promiſe, from impoſition.</p>
               <p>To avoid being interrogated at the town-gate, and obliged to go in the rain to give an account of myſelf, merely a form, before we could get the refreſhment we ſtood in need of, he requeſted us to deſcend, I might have ſaid ſtep, from our car, and walk into town.</p>
               <p>I expected to have found a tolerable inn, but was uſhered into a moſt comfortleſs one; and, becauſe it was about five o'clock, three or four hours after their dining hour, I could not prevail on them to give me any thing warm to eat.</p>
               <p>The appearance of the accommodations oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to deliver one of my recommendatory letters, and the gentleman, to whom it was addreſſed, ſent to look out for a lodging for me whilſt I partook of his ſupper.

               <p>GOTHENBURG is a clean airy town, and having been built by the dutch, has canals running through each ſtreet, and in ſome of them there are rows of trees that would render it very pleaſant were it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral rich commercial houſes, ſcotch, french, and ſwediſh; but the ſcotch, I believe, have been the moſt ſucceſsful. The commerce and commiſſion buſineſs with France ſince the war, has been very lucrative, and enriched the merchants, I am afraid, at the expence of the other inhabitants, by raiſing the price of the neceſſaries of life.</p>
               <p>As all the men of conſequence, I mean men of the largeſt fortune, are merchants, their principal enjoyment is a relaxation from buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the table, which is ſpread at, I think, too early an hour (between one and two) for men who have letters to write and accounts to ſettle after paying due reſpect to the bottle. However, when numerous circles are to be brought together, and when neither literature nor public amuſements furniſh topics for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, a good dinner appears to be the only
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031653_0019_0fed8e1c59efc158"/>
centre to rally round, eſpecially as ſcandal, the zeſt of more ſelect parties, can only be whiſpered. As for politics, I have ſeldom found it a ſubject of continual diſcuſſion in a country town in any part of the world. The politics of the place being on a ſmaller ſcale, ſuits better with the ſize of their faculties; for, generally ſpeaking, the ſphere of obſervation determines the extent of the mind.</p>
               <p>The more I ſee of the world, the more I am convinced that civilization is a bleſſing not ſufficiently eſtimated by thoſe who have not traced its progreſs; for it not only refines our enjoyments, but produces a variety which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us to retain the primitive delicacy of our ſenſations. Without the aid of the imagination all the pleaſures of the ſenſes muſt ſink into groſſneſs, unleſs continual novelty ſerve as a ſubſtitute for the imagination, which being impoſſible, it was to this wearineſs, I ſuppoſe, that Solomon alluded when he declared that there was nothing new under the ſun!—no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the common ſenſations excited by the ſenſes. Yet who will deny that the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and underſtanding have made many, very many diſcoveries ſince thoſe days, which only ſeem harbingers of others ſtill more noble and beneficial. I never met with much imagination amongſt people who had not acquired a habit. of reflection; and in that ſtate of ſociety in which the judgment and taſte are not called forth, and formed by the cultivation of the arts and ſciences, little of that delicacy of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thinking is to be found characterized
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031653_0020_0fed8e1f605661a0"/>
by the word ſentiment. The want of ſcientific purſuits perhaps accounts for the hoſpitality, as well as for the cordial reception which ſtrangers receive from the inhabitants of ſmall towns.</p>
               <p>Hoſpitality has, I think, been too much praiſed by travellers as a proof of goodneſs of heart, when in my opinion indiſcriminate hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality is rather a criterion by which you may form a tolerable eſtimate of the indolence or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of a head; or, in other words, a fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ſocial pleaſures in which the mind not having its proportion of exerciſe, the bottle muſt be puſhed about.</p>
               <p>Theſe remarks are equally applicable to Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, the moſt hoſpitable city I ever paſſed through. But I will try to confine my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations more piticularly to Sweden.</p>
               <p>It is true I have only had a glance over a ſmall part of it; yet of its preſent ſtate of manners and acquirements I think I have formed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct idea, without having viſited the capital, where, in fact, leſs of a national character is to be found than in the remote parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>The swedes pique themſelves on their polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but far from being the poliſh of a cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind, it conſiſts merely of tireſome forms and ceremonies. So far indeed from entering immediately into your character, and making you feel inſtantly at your eaſe, like the well-bred french, their over-acted civility is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031653_0021_0fed8e21053413b8"/>
reſtraint on all your actions. The ſort of ſuperiority which a fortune gives when there is no ſuperiority of education, excepting what conſiſts in the obſervance of ſenſeleſs forms, has a contrary effect than what is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that I could not help reckoning the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry the politeſt people of Sweden, who only aiming at pleaſing you, never think of being admired for their behaviour.</p>
               <p>Their tables, like their compliments, ſeem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually a caricature of the french. The diſhes are compoſed, as well as theirs, of a variety of mixtures to deſtroy the native taſte of the food without being as reliſhing. Spicies and ſugar are put into every thing, even into the bread; and the only way I can account for their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality to high-ſeaſoned diſhes, is the conſtant uſe of ſalted proviſions. Neceſſity obliges them to lay up a ſtore of dried fiſh, and ſalted meat, for the winter; and in ſummer, freſh meat and fiſh taſte inſipid after them. To which may be added the conſtant uſe of ſpirits. Every day, before dinner and ſupper, even whilſt the diſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are cooling on the table, men and women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to a ſide-table, and to obtain an appetite, eat bread and butter, cheeſe, raw ſalmon, or anchovies, drinking a glaſs of brandy. Salt fiſh or meat then immediately follows, to give a further whet to the ſtomach. As the dinner advances, pardon me for taking up a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes to deſcribe what, alas! has detained me two or three hours on the ſtretch, obſerving, diſh after diſh is changed, in endleſs rotation,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031653_0022_0fed8e2413826668"/>
and handed round with ſolemn pace to each gueſt; but ſhould you happen not to like the firſt diſhes, which was often my caſe, it is a groſs breach of politeneſs to aſk for part of any other till its turn comes. But have patience, and there will be eating enough. Allow me to run over the act of a viſiting day, not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking the interludes.</p>
               <p>Prelude a luncheon—then a ſucceſſion of fiſh, fleſh and fowl for two hours: during which time the deſert, I was ſorry for the ſtrawber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and cream, reſts on the table to be impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the fumes of the viands. Coffee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows in the drawing-room; but does not preclude punch, ale, tea and cakes, raw ſalmon, &amp;c. A ſupper bring up the rear, nor forgetting the introductory luncheon, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt equalling in removes the dinner. A day of this kind you would imagine ſufficient—but a to-morow and a to-morrow—A never ending, ſtill beginning feaſt may be bearable, perhaps, when ſtern winter frowns, ſhaking with chill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſpect his hoary locks; but during a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſweet as fleeting, let me, my kind ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, eſcape ſometimes into your fir groves, wander on the margin of your beautiful lakes, or climb your rocks to view ſtill others in end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perſpective; which, piled by more than giants hand, ſcale the heavens to intercept its rays, or to receive the parting tinge of linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. day—day that, ſcarcely ſoftened into twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, allows the freſhening breeze to wake, and the moon to burſt forth in all her glory to

               <p>The cow's bell has ceaſed to tinkle the herd to reſt; they have all paced acroſs the heath. Is not this the witching time of night?

Eternity is in theſe moments; worldly cares melt into the airy ſtuff that dreams are made of; and reveries, mild and enchanting as the firſt hopes of love, or the recollection of loſt enjoyment, carry the hapleſs wight into futurity, who, in buſtling life, has vainly ſtrove to throw off the grief which lies heavy at the heart. Good night! A creſcent hangs out in the vault before, which woos me to ſtray abroad:—it is not a ſilvery reflection of the ſun, but glows with all its gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſplendour.

               <p>THE population of Sweden has been eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated from two millions and a half to three millions: a ſmall number for ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe tract of country: of which only ſo much is cultivated, and that in the ſimpleſt manner, as is abſolutely neceſſary to ſupply the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of life; and near the ſeaſhore, from whence herrings are eaſily procured, there ſcarcely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a veſtige of cultivation. The ſcattered huts that ſtand ſhivering on the naked rocks, braving the pitileſs elements, are formed of logs of wood, rudely hewn; and ſo little pains are taken with the craggy foundation, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a path-way points out the door.</p>
               <p>Gathered into himſelf by the cold, lowering his viſage to avoid the cutting blaſt, is it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing that the churliſh pleaſure of drinking drams takes place of ſocial enjoyments amongſt the poor, eſpecially if we take into the account, that they moſtly live on high-ſeaſoned proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and rye bread? Hard enough, you may imagine, as it is only baked once a year. The ſervants alſo, in moſt families, eat this kind of bread, and have a different kind of food from their maſters, which, in ſpite of all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <p>In fact, the ſituation of the ſervants in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpect, particularly that of the women, ſhews how far the ſwedes are from having a juſt conception of rational equality. They are not <hi>te-med</hi> ſlaves; yet a man may ſtrike a man with impunity becauſe he pays him wages; though theſe wages are ſo low, that neceſſity muſt teach them to pilfer, whilſt ſervility ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them falſe and booriſh. Still the men ſtand up for the dignity of man, by oppreſſing the women. The moſt menial, and even laborious offices, are therefore left to theſe poor drudges. Much of this I have ſeen. In the winter, I am told, they take the linen down to the river, to waſh it in the cold water; and though their hands, cut by the ice are cracked and bleeding, the men, their fellow ſervants, will not diſgrace their manhood by carrying a tub to lighten their burden.</p>
               <p>You will not be ſurpriſed to hear that they do not wear ſhoes or ſtockings, when I inform you that their wages are ſeldom more than twenty or thirty ſhillings per annum. It is the cuſtom, I know, to give them a new year's gift, and a preſent at ſome other period; but can it all amount to a juſt indemnity for their labour? The treatment of ſervants in moſt countries, I grant, is very unjuſt; and in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, that boaſted land of freedom, it is often extremely tyrannical. I have freq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I do not know a more agreeable ſight than to ſee ſervants part of a family. By taking an intereſt, generally ſpeaking, in their concerns, you inſpire them with one for yours.

               <p>It is, in fact, much more difficult for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who are tantalized by ſeeing and prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dainties of which they are not to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, to remain honeſt, than the poor, whoſe thoughts are not led from their homely fare; ſo that, though the ſervants here are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thieves, you ſeldom hear of houſe-breaking, or robbery on the highway. The country is, perhaps, too thinly inhabited to produce many of that deſcription of thieves termed footpads, or highwaymen. They are uſually the ſpawn of great cities; the effect of the ſpurious deſires generated by wealth, rather than the deſperate ſtruggles of poverty to eſcape from miſery.</p>
               <p>The enjoyment of the peaſantry was drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brandy and coffee, before the latter was prohibited, and the former not allowed, to be

privately diſtilled. The wars carried on by the late king rendering it neceſſary to increaſe the revenue, and retain the ſpecie in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by every poſſible means.</p>
               <p>The taxes before the reign of Charles the twelfth were inconſiderable. Since then, the burden has continually been growing heavier, and the price of proviſions has proportionably increaſed; nay, the advantage-accruing from the exportation of corn to France, and rye to Germany, will probably produce a ſcarcity in both Sweden and Norway, ſhould not a peace put a ſtop to it this autumn; for ſpeculations of various kinds have already almoſt doubled the price.</p>
               <p>Such are the effects of war, that it ſaps the vitals even of the neutral countries, who, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a ſudden influx of wealth, appear to be rendered flouriſhing by the deſtruction which ravages the hapleſs nations who are ſacrificed to the ambition of their governors. I ſhall not, however, dwell on the vices, though they be of the moſt contemptible and embruting caſt, to which a ſudden acceſſion of fortune gives birth, becauſe I believe it may be delivered as an ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iom that it is only in proportion to the induſtry neceſſary to acquire wealth, that a nation is really benefited by it.</p>
               <p>The prohibition of drinking coffee, under a penalty, and the encouragement given to public diſtilleries, tend to impoveriſh the poor, who are not affected by the ſumptuary law;

               <p>Beſides, the french revolution has not only rendered all the crowned heads more cautious, but has ſo decreaſed every where (excepting amongſt themſelves) a reſpect for nobility, that the peaſantry have not only loſt their blind reverence for their ſeigniors, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, in a manly ſtyle, of oppreſſions which before they did not think of denominating ſuch, becauſe they were taught to conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as a different order of beings. And, perhaps, the efforts which the ariſtocrats are making here, as well as in every other part of Europe, to ſecure their ſway, will be the moſt effectual mode of undermining it; taking into the calculating, that the king of Sweden, like moſt of the potentates of Europe, has continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been augmenting his power by encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the privileges of the nobles.</p>

This may be reckoned an advantage in ſome reſpects; but it prevents the cultivation of their own, and any conſiderable advance in literary purſuits.</p>
               <p>A ſenſible writer<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Cooper's Account of America.</note> has lately obſerved. (I have not his work by me, therefore cannot quote his exact words) 'that the americans very wiſely let the europeans make their books and faſhions for them.' But I cannot coincide with him in this opinion. The reflection ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to produce a certain number even of tolerable productions, augments, more than he is aware of, the maſs of knowledge in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. Deſultory reading is commonly mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a paſtime. But we muſt have an object to refer our reflections to, or they will ſeldom go below the ſurface. As in travelling, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a journal excites to many uſeful enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that would not have been thought of, had the traveller only determined to ſee all he could ſee, without ever aſking himſelf for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Beſides, the very dabbling in literature furniſhes harmleſs topics of converſations: for the not having ſuch ſubjects at hand, though they are often inſupportably fatiguing, renders the inhabitants of little towns prying and cenſorious. Idleneſs, rather than ill-nature, gives birth to ſcandal, and to the obſervation
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031653_0030_0fed8e3d2f0eebb8"/>
of little incidents which narrows the mind. It is frequently only the fear of being talked of, which produces that puerile ſcrupuloſity about trifles incompatible with an enlarged plan of uſefulneſs, and with the baſis of all moral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples—reſpect for the virtues which are not merely the virtues of convention.</p>
               <p>I am, my friend, more and more convinced that a metropolis, or an abode abſolutely ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, is the beſt calculated for the improvement of the heart, as well as the underſtanding; whether we deſire to become acquainted with man, nature, or ourſelves. Mixing with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, we are obliged to examine our preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and often imperceptibly loſe, as we analyze them. And in the country, growing intimate with nature, a thouſand little circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, unſeen by vulgar eyes, give birth to ſentiments dear to the imagination, and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which expand the ſoul, particularly when cultivation has not ſmoothed into inſipidity all its originality of character.</p>
               <p>I love the country; yet whenever I ſee a pictureſque ſituation choſen on which to erect a dwelling, I am always afraid of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements. It requires uncommon taſte to form a whole, and to introduce accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ornaments analogous with the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding ſcene <note n="*" place="bottom">With reſpect to gardening in England, I think we often make an egregious blunder by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing too much ſhade; not conſidering that the ſhade which our climate requires need not be very thick. If it keep off the intenſe heat of the ſun, and afford a ſolitary retirement, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. But in many great gardens, or pleaſure-grounds, the ſun's rays can ſcarcely ever pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. Theſe may amuſe the eye; yet they are not <hi>home-walks</hi> to which the owner can retire to enjoy air and ſolitude; for, excepting during an extraordinary dry ſummer, they are damp and chill. For the ſame reaſon, grottoes are abſurd in this temperate climate. An umbrageous tree will afford ſufficient ſhelter from the moſt ardent heat, that we ever felt. To ſpeak explicitly, the uſefulneſs of a garden ought to be conſpicuous, becauſe it ought not to be planted for the ſeaſon when nature wantons in her prime; for the whole country is then a garden—far ſweeter. If not very extenſive, I think a garden ſhould contain more ſhrubs and flowers than lofty trees; and in order to admit the ſun-beams to enliven our ſpring, autumn and winter, ſerpentine walks, the rage for the line of beauty, ſhould be made to ſubmit to convenience. Yet, in this country, a broad ſtraight gravel walk is a great conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for thoſe who wiſh to take exerciſe in all ſeaſons, after rain particularly.

               <p>THE ſeverity of the long ſwediſh winter tends to render the people ſluggiſh; for, though this ſeaſon has its peculiar pleaſures, too much time is employed to guard againſt its inclemency. Still, as warm clothing is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, the women ſpin, and the men weave, and by theſe exertions get a fence to keep out the cold. I have rarely paſſed a knot of cottages without ſeeing cloth laid out to bleach; and when I entered, always found the women ſpinning or knitting.</p>
               <p>A miſtaken tenderneſs, however, for their children, makes them, even in ſummer, load them with flannels; and, having a ſort of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural antipathy to cold water, the ſqualid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the poor babes, not to ſpeak of the noxious ſmell which flannel and rugs retain, ſeems a reply to a queſtion I had often aſked— Why I did not ſee more children in the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages I paſſed through? Indeed the children appear to be nipt in the bud, having neither the graces nor charms of their age. And this, I am perſuaded, is much more owing to the ignorance of the mothers than to the rudeneſs of the climate. Rendered feeble by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual perſpiration they are kept in, whilſt

But it moſt be their ſtars, not the zephyrs gently ſtealing on their ſenſes, which here lead frail women aſtray.— Who can look at theſe rocks, and allow the voluptuouſneſs of nature to be an excute for gratifying the deſires it inſpires? We muſt, therefore, find ſome other cauſe beſide vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs, I believe, to account for the conduct of the ſwediſh and american country girls; for I am led to conclude, from all the obſervations I have made, that there is always a mixture of ſentiment and imagination in voluptuouſneſs, to which neither of them have much pretenſion.</p>
               <p>The country girls of Ireland and Wales equally feel the firſt impulſe of nature, which, reſtrained in England by fear or delicacy, proves that ſociety is there in a more advanced

ſtate. Beſides, as the mind is cultivated and taſte gains ground, the paſſions become ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and reſt on ſomething more ſtable than the caſual ſympathies of the moment.

               <p>The manners of Stockholm are refined, I hear, by the introduction of gallantry but in the country, romping and courſe freedoms, with coarſer alluſſions, keep the ſpirits awake.

and turn for humour, rather than for wit or ſetiment. I include not, as you may ſuppoſe, in this general character, ſome of the nobility and officers, who having travelled, are polite and well informed.</p>
               <p>I muſt own to you, that the lower claſs of people here amuſe and intereſt me much more than the middling, with their apiſh good breeding and prejudices. The ſympathy and frankneſs of heart conſpicuous in the peaſantry produces even a ſimple gracefulneſs of deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which has frequently ſtruck me as very pictureſque; I have often alſo been touched by their extreme deſire to oblige me, when I could not explain my wants, and by their earneſt manner of expreſſing that deſire. There is ſuch a charm in tenderneſs!—It is ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to love our fellew-creatures, and meet the honeſt affections as they break forth. Still, my good friend, I begin to think that I ſhould not like to live continually in the country, with people whoſe minds have ſuch a narrow range.

               <p>The beauties of nature appear to me now even more alluring than in my youth, becauſe my intercourſe with the world has formed, without vitiating my taſte.

               <p>HAD I determined to travel in Sweden merely for pleaſure, I ſhould probably have choſen the road to Stockholm, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, by repeated obſervation, that the manners of a people are beſt diſcriminated in the country. The inhabitants of the capital are all of the ſame genus; for the varieties in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies we muſt, therefore, ſearch where the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations of men are ſo ſeparated as to allow the difference of climate to have its natural effect. And with this difference we are, perhaps, moſt forcibly ſtruck at the firſt view, juſt as we form an eſtimate of the leading traits of a character at the firſt glance, of which intimacy after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards makes us almoſt loſe ſight.</p>
               <p>As my affairs called me to Stromſtad (the frontier town of Sweden) in my way to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, I was to paſs over, I heard, the moſt uncultivated part of the country. Still I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the grand features of Sweden are the ſame every where, and it is only the grand fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that admit of deſcription. There is an individuality in every proſpect, which remains in the memory as forcibly depicted as the particular features that have arreſted our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet we cannot find words to diſcriminate
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031653_0039_0fed8e5b6702e488"/>
that individuality ſo as to enable a ſtranger to ſay, this is the face, that the view. We may amuſe by ſetting the imagination to work; but we cannot ſtore the memory with a fact.</p>
               <p>As I wiſh to give you a general idea of this country, I ſhall continue in my deſultory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to make ſuch obſervations, and reflections as the circumſtances draw forth, without loſing time, by endeavouring to arrange them.</p>
               <p>Travelling in Sweden is very cheap, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven commodious, if you make but the proper arrangements. Here, as in other parts of the continent, it is neceſſary to have your own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and to have a ſervant who can ſpeak the language, if you are unacquainted with it. Sometimes a ſervant who can drive would be found very uſeful, which was our caſe, for I travelled in company with two gentlemen, one of whom had a german ſervant who drove very well. This was all the party; for not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make a long ſtay, I left my little girl be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me.</p>
               <p>As the roads are not much frequented, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void waiting three or four hours for horſes, we ſent, as is the conſtant cuſtom, an <hi>avant courier</hi> the night before, to order them at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very poſt, and we conſtantly found them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Our firſt ſet I jokingly termed <hi>requiſition</hi> horſes; but afterwards we had almoſt always little ſpirited animals that went on at a round pace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:031653_0040_0fed8e5d0ba844a8"/>The roads, making allowance for the ups and downs, are uncommonly good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. The expence, including the poſtillions and other incidental things, does not amount to more than a ſhilling the ſwediſh mile.<note n="*" place="bottom">A Swediſh mile is nearly ſix Engliſh miles.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The inns are tolerable; but not liking the rye bread, I found it neceſſary to furniſh my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſome wheaten before I ſet out. The beds too were particularly diſagreable to me. It ſeemed to me that I was ſinking into a grave when I entered them; for, immerſed it down placed in a ſort of box, I expected to be ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated before morning. The ſleeping between two down beds, they do ſo even in ſummer, muſt be very unwholeſome during any ſeaſon; and I cannot conceive how the people can bear it, eſpecially as the ſummers are very warm. But warmth they ſeem not to feel; and, I ſhould think, were afraid of the air, by always keeping their windows ſhut. In the winter, I am perſuaded, I could not exiſt in rooms thus cloſed up, with ſtoves heated in their manner; for they only put wood into them twice a day; and, when the ſtove is thoroughly heated, they ſhut the flue, not admitting any air to renew its elaſticity, even when the rooms are crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with company. Theſe ſtoves are made of earthenware, and often in a form that orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments an apartment, which is never the caſe with the heavy iron ones I have ſeen elſewhere. Stoves may be economical; but I like a fire, a wood one, in preference; and I am convinced
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031653_0041_0fed8e5ea93da1e8"/>
that the current of air which it attracts renders this the beſt mode of warming rooms.</p>
               <p>We arrived early the ſecond evening at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle village called Quiſtram, where we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to paſs the night; having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that we ſhould not afterwards find a tolerable inn until we reached Stromſtad.</p>
               <p>Advancing towards Quiſtram, as the ſun was beginning to decline, I was particularly impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the beauty of the ſituation. The road was on the declivity of a rocky mountain, ſlightly covered with a moſſy herbage and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant firs. At the bottom, a river, ſtraggling amongſt the receſſes of ſtone, was haſtening forward to the ocean and its grey rocks, of which we had a proſpect on the left, whilſt on the right it ſtole peacefully forward into the meadows, loſing itſelf in a thickly wooded riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground. As we drew near, the lovelieſt banks of wild flowers variegated the proſpect, and promiſed to exhale odours to add to the ſweetneſs of the air, the purity of which you could almoſt ſee, alas! not ſmell, for the putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying herrings, which they uſe as manure, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the oil has been extracted, ſpread over the patches of the earth, claimed by cultivation, deſtroyed every other.</p>
               <p>It was intolerable, and entered with us into the inn, which was in other reſpects a charming retreat</p>
               <p>Whilſt ſupper was preparing I croſſed the

               <p>Seated on it, I could not avoid noting an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious remark. Sweden appeared to me the country in the world moſt proper to form the botaniſt and natural hiſtorian: every object ſeemed to remind me of the creation of things, of the firſt efforts of ſportive nature. When a country arrives at a certain ſtate of perfection, it looks as if it were made ſo; and curioſity is not excited. Beſides, in ſocial life too many objects occur for any to be diſtinctly obſerved by the generality of mankind; yet a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative man, or poet, in the country, I do not mean the country abjacent to cities, feels and ſees what would eſcape vulgar eyes, and draws ſuitable inferences. This train of reflections might have led me further, in every ſenſe of the word; but I could not eſcape from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable evaporation of the herrings, which poiſoned all my pleaſure.</p>

               <p>The laſt battle between the Danes and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031653_0043_0fed8e64b261cbf0"/>
Swedes, which gave new life to their ancient enmity, was fought at this place 1788; only ſeventeen or eighteen were killed; for the great ſuperiority of the Danes and Norwegians obliged the Swedes to ſubmit; but ſickneſs, and a ſcarcity of proviſions, proved very fatal to their opponents, on their return.</p>
               <p>It would be very eaſy to ſearch for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of this engagement in the publications of the day; but as this manner of filling my pages does not come within my plan, I probably ſhould not have remarked that the battle was fought here, were it not to relate an anecdote which I had from good authority.</p>
               <p>I noticed when I firſt mentioned this place to you, that we deſcended a ſteep before we came to the inn; an immenſe ridge of rocks ſtretching out on one ſide. The inn was ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered under them; and about a hundred yards from it was a bridge that croſſed the river, whoſe murmurs I have celebrated; it was not fordable. The ſwediſh general received orders to ſtop at the bridge, and diſpute the paſſage; a moſt advantageous poſt for an army ſo much inferior in force: but the influence of beauty is not confined to courts. The miſtreſs of the inn was handſome: when I ſaw her there were ſtill ſome remains of beauty; and, to preſerve her houſe, the general gave up the only tenable ſtation. He was afterwards broke for contempt of orders.</p>
               <p>Approaching the frontiers, conſequently the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:031653_0044_0fed8e6952778618"/>
ſea, nature reſumed an aſpect ruder and ruder, or rather ſeemed the bones of the world wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be clothed with every thing neceſſary to give life and beauty. Still it was ſublime.</p>
               <p>The clouds caught their hue of the rocks that menaced them. The ſun appeared afraid to ſhine, the birds ceaſed to ſing, and the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to bloom; but the eagle fixed his neſt high amongſt the rocks, and the vulture hovered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this abode of deſolation. The farm houſes, in which only poverty reſided, were formed of logs ſcarcely keeping off the cold and drift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſnow; out of them the inhabitants ſeldom peeped, and the ſports or prattling of children was neither ſeen nor heard. The current of life ſeemed congealed at the ſource: all were not frozen; for it was ſummer, you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but every thing appeared ſo dull, that I waited to ſee ice, in order to reconcile me to the abſence of gaiety.</p>
               <p>The day before, my attention had frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been attracted by the wild beauties of the country we paſſed through.</p>
               <p>The rocks which toſſed their fantaſtic heads ſo high were often covered with pines and firs, varied in the moſt pictureſque manner. Little woods filled up the receſſes, when foreſts did not darken the ſcene; and vallies and glens, cleared of the trees, diſplayed a dazzling ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure which contraſted with the gloom of the ſhading pines. The eye ſtole into many a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert where tranquillity ſeemed to have taken

The little cultivation which appeared did not break the enchantment, nor did caſtles rear their tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets aloft to cruſh the cottages, and prove that man is more ſavage than the natives of the woods. I heard of the bears, but never ſaw them ſtalk forth, which I was ſorry for; I wiſhed to have ſeen one in its wild ſtate. In the winter, I am told, they ſometimes catch a ſtray cow, which is a heavy loſs to the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>The farms are ſmall. Indeed moſt of the houſes we ſaw on the road indicated poverty, or rather that the people could juſt live. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the frontiers they grew worſe and worſe in their appearance, as if not willing to put ſterility itſelf out of countenance. No gardens ſmiled round the habitations, not a potatoe or cabbage to eat with the fiſh drying on a ſtick near the door. A little grain here and there appeared, the long ſtalks of which you might almoſt reckon. The day was gloomy when we paſſed over this rejected ſpot, the wind bleak, and winter ſeemed to be contending with nature, faintly ſtruggling to change the ſeaſon. Surely, thought I, if the ſun ever ſhines here, it cannot warm thoſe ſtones; moſs only cleaves to them, partaking of their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and nothing like vegetable life appears to chear with hope the heart.</p>

The conduct of the followers of Mahomet, and the cruſaders, will ſufficiently corroborate my aſſertion.</p>
               <p>Approaching nearer to Stromſtad, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the town proved to be quite in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with the country we had juſt paſſed through. I heſitated to uſe the word country, yet could not find another; ſtill it would ſound abſurd to talk of fields of rocks.</p>
               <p>The town was built on, and under them. Three or four weather-beaten trees were
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031653_0047_0fed8e73d775b8d8"/>
ſhrinking from the wind; and the graſs grew ſo ſparingly, that I could not avoid thinking Dr. Johnſon's hyperbolical aſſertion <q>that the man merited well of his country who made a few blades of graſs grow where they never grew before,</q> might here have been uttered with ſtrict propriety. The ſteeple likewiſe towered aloft; for what is a church, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Lutherans, without a ſteeple? But to prevent miſchief in ſuch an expoſed ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is wiſely placed on a rock at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, not to endanger the roof of the church.</p>
               <p>Rambling about, I ſaw the door open, and entered, when to my great ſurpriſe I found the clergyman reading prayers, with only the clerk attending. I inſtantly thought of Swift's "Dearly beloved Roger;" but on enquiry I learnt that ſome one had died that morning, and in Sweden it is cuſtomary to pray for the dead.</p>
               <p>The ſun, who I ſuſpected never dared to ſhine, began now to convince me that he came forth only to torment; for though the wind was ſtill cutting, the rocks became intolerably warm under my feet; whilſt the herring ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia, which I before found ſo very offenſive, once more aſſailed me. I haſtened back to the houſe of a merchant, the little ſovereign of the place, becauſe he was by far the richeſt, though not the mayor.</p>
               <p>Here we were moſt hoſpitably received, and introduced to a very fine and numerous family.

               <p>I did not know, for I had not thought of it, that we were to ſcale ſome of the moſt mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cliffs of Sweden, in our way to the furry which ſeparates the two countries.</p>
               <p>Entering amongſt the cliffs, we were ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from the wind; warm ſun-beams began to play, ſtreams to flow, and groves of pines diverſified the rocks. Sometimes they became ſuddenly bare and ſublime. Once, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, after mounting the moſt terrific precipice, we had to paſs through a tremendous defile, where the cloſing chaſm ſeemed to threaten us with inſtant deſtruction, when turning quickly, verdant meadows and a beautiful lake relieved and charmed my eyes.</p>
               <p>I have never travelled through Switzerland; but one of my companions aſſured me, that I ſhould not there find any thing ſuperior, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the wild grandeur of theſe views.</p>
               <p>As we had not taken this excurſion into our plan, the horſes had not been previouſly order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which obliged us to wait two hours at the firſt poſt. The day was wearing away. The road was ſo bad, that walking up the precipices conſumed the time inſenſibly. But as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired horſes at each poſt ready at a certain hour, we reckoned on returning more ſpeedily.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:031653_0050_0fed8ec4c8f82868"/>We ſtopt to dine at a tolerable farm. They brought us out ham, butter, cheeſe, and milk; and the charge was ſo moderate, that I ſcattered a little money amongſt the children who were peeping at us, in order to pay them for their trouble.</p>
               <p>Arrived at the ferry, we were ſtill detained; for the people who attend at the ferries have a ſtupid kind of ſluggiſhneſs in their manner, which is very provoking when you are in haſte. At preſent I did not feel it; for ſcrambling up the cliffs, my eye followed the river as it rolled between the grand rocky banks; and to complete the ſcenery, they were covered with firs and pines, through which the wind ruſtled, as if it were lulling itſelf to ſleep with the declining ſun.</p>
               <p>Behold us now in Norway; and I could not avoid feeling ſurpriſe at obſerving the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the manners of the inhabitants of the two ſides of the river; for every thing ſhews that the norwegians are more induſtrious and more opulent. The Swedes, for neighbours are ſeldom the beſt friends, accuſe the norwegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of knavery, and they retaliate by bringing a charge of hypocriſy againſt the Swedes. Local circumſtances probably render both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, ſpeaking from their feelings, rather than reaſon: and is this aſtoniſhing when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that moſt writers of travels have done the ſame, whoſe works have ſerved as materials for the compilers of univerſal hiſtories. All are eager to give a national character; which is

rarely juſt, becauſe they do not diſcriminate the natural from the acquired difference.

               <p>A people have been characterized as ſtupid by nature; what a paradox! becauſe they did not conſider that ſlaves, having no object to ſtimulate induſtry, have not their faculties ſharpened by the only thing that can exerciſe them, ſelf intereſt.

               <p>Arriving at Fredericſhall at the ſiege of which Charles XII. loſt his life, we had only time to take a tranſient view of it, whilſt they were preparing us ſome refreſhment.</p>
               <p>Poor Charles! I thought of him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. I have always felt the ſame for Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; with whom he has been claſſed as a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by ſeveral writers, who have reaſoned ſuperficially, confounding the morals of the day with the few grand principles on which unchangeable morality reſts. Making no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for the ignorance and prejudices of the period, they do not perceive how much they themſelves are indebted to general improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the acquirements, and even the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which they would not have had the force
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031653_0053_0fed8e800621e688"/>
of mind to attain, by their individual exertions in a leſs advanced ſtate of ſociety.</p>
               <p>The evening was fine, as is uſual at this ſeaſon; and the refreſhing odour of the pine woods became more perceptible; for it was nine o'clock when we left Fredericſhall. At the ferry we were detained by a diſpute rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to our ſwediſh paſſport, which we did not think of getting counterſigned in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Midnight was coming on; yet it might with ſuch propriety have been termed the noon of night, that had Young ever travelled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the north, I ſhould not have wondered at his becoming enamoured of the moon. But it is not the queen of night alone who reigns here in all her ſplendor, though the ſun, loit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering juſt below the horizon, decks her with a golden tinge from his car, illuminating the cliffs that hide him; the heavens alſo, of a clear ſoftened blue, throw her forward, and the evening ſtar appears a leſſer moon to the naked eye. The huge ſhadows of the rocks, fringed with firs, concentrating the views, without darkening them, excited that tender melancholy which, ſublimating the imagination, exalts, rather than depreſſes the mind.</p>
               <p>My companions fell aſleep:—fortunately they did not ſnore; and I contemplated, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of idle queſtions, a night ſuch as I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before ſeen or felt to charm the ſenſes, and calm the heart. The very air was balmy, as it freſhened into morn, producing the moſt voluptuous ſenſations. A vague pleaſurable ſentiment abſorbed me, as I opened my boſom
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031653_0054_0fed8ecc6a844700"/>
to the embraces of nature; and my ſoul roſe to its author, with the chirping of the ſolitary birds, which began to feel, rather than ſee, advancing day. I had leiſure to mark its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. The grey morn, ſtreaked with ſilvery rays, uſhered in the orient beams,—how beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully varying into purple!—yet, I was ſorry to loſe the ſoft watry clouds which preceded them, exciting a kind of expectation that made me almoſt afraid to breathe, leſt I ſhould break the charm. I ſaw the ſun—and ſighed.</p>
               <p>One of my companions, now awake, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the poſtillion had miſtaken the road, began to ſwear at him, and rouſed the other two, who reluctantly ſhook off ſleep.</p>
               <p>We had immediately to meaſure back our ſteps, and did not reach Stromſtad before five in the morning.</p>
               <p>The wind had changed in the night, and my boat was ready.</p>
               <p>A diſh of coffee, and freſh linen, recruited my ſpirits; and I directly ſet out again for Norway; purpoſing to land much higher up the coaſt.</p>
               <p>Wrapping my great coat round me, I lay down on ſome ſails at the bottom of the boat, its motion rocking me to reſt, till a diſcourteous wave interrupted my ſlumbers, and obliged me to riſe and feel a ſolitarineſs which was not ſo ſoothing as that of the paſt night.</p>

               <head>LETTER VI.</head>
               <p>THE ſea was boiſterous; but, as I had an experienced pilot, I did not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any danger. Sometimes I was told, boats are driven far out and loſt. However, I ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom calculate chances ſo nicely—ſufficient for the day is the obvious evil!</p>
               <p>We had to ſteer amongſt iſlands and huge rocks, rarely loſing ſight of the ſhore, though it now and then appeared only a miſt that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the water's edge. The pilot aſſured me that the numerous harbours on the Norway coaſt were very ſafe, and the pilot-boats were always on the watch. The Swediſh ſide is very dangerous, I am alſo informed; and the help of experience is not often at hand, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtrange veſſels to ſteer clear of the rocks, which lurk below the water, cloſe to the ſhore.</p>
               <p>There are no tides here, nor in the cattegate; and, what appeared to me a conſequence, no ſandy beach. Perhaps this obſervation has been made before; but it did not occur to me till I ſaw the waves continually beating againſt
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031653_0056_0fed8ecf70731f38"/>
the bare rocks, without ever receding to leave a ſediment to harden.</p>
               <p>The wind was fair, till we had to tack about in order to enter Laurvig, where we arrived towards three o'clock in the afternoon. It is a clean, pleaſant town, with a conſiderable iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, which gives life to it.</p>
               <p>As the norwegians do not frequently ſee tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, they are very curious to know their buſineſs, and who they are—ſo curious that I was half tempted to adopt Dr. Franklin's plan, when travelling in America, where they are equally prying, which was to write on a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for public inſpection, my name, from whence I came, where I was going, and what was my buſineſs. But if I were importuned by their curioſity, their friendly geſtures gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified me. A woman, coming alone, intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. And I know not whether my weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs gave me a look of peculiar delicacy; but they approached to aſſiſt me, and enquire after my wants, as if they were afraid to hurt, and wiſhed to protect me. The ſympathy I inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thus dropping down from the clouds in a ſtrange land, affected me more than it would have done, had not my ſpirits been haraſſed by various cauſes—by much thinking—muſing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to madneſs—and even by a ſort of weak melancholy that hung about my heart at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my daughter for the firſt time.</p>
               <p>You know that as a female I am particularly attached to her—I feel more than a mother's
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031653_0057_0fed8e8349b97c98"/>
fondneſs and anxiety, when I reflect on the dependent and oppreſſed ſtate of her ſex. I dread leſt ſhe ſhould be forced to ſacrifice her heart to her principles, or principles to her heart. With trembling hand I ſhall cultivate ſenſibility, and cheriſh delicacy of ſentiment, leſt, whilſt I lend freſh bluſhes to the roſe, I ſharpen the thorns that will wound the breaſt I would fain guard—I dread to unfold her mind, leſt it ſhould render her unfit ſo the world ſhe is to inhabit—Hapleſs woman! what a fate is thine!</p>
               <p>But whither am I wandering? I only meant to tell you that the impreſſion the kindneſs of the ſimple people made viſible on my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance increaſed my ſenſibility to a painful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. I wiſhed to have had a room to myſelf; for their attention, and rather diſtreſſing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, embarraſſed me extremely. Yet, as they would bring me <hi>eggs,</hi> and make my cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, I found I could not leave them without hurting their feelings of hoſpitality.</p>
               <p>It is cuſtomary here for the hoſt and hoſteſs to welcome their gueſts as maſter and miſtreſs of the houſe.</p>
               <p>My clothes, in their turn, attracted the attention of the females; and I could not help thinking of the fooliſh vanity which makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny women ſo proud of the obſervation of ſtrangers as to take wonder very gratuitouſly for admiration. This error they are very apt to fall into; when arrived in a foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

                  </gap>gularity of a gown, is often the cauſe of the flattering atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which afterwards ſupports a fantaſtic ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure of ſelf-conceit.</p>
               <p>Not having brought a carriage over with me, expecting to have met a perſon where I lauded, who was immediately to have procured me one, I was detained whilſt the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the inn ſent round to all their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ſearch for a vehicle. A rude ſort of <hi>cabriole</hi> was at laſt found, and a driver half drunk, who was not leſs eager to make a good bargain on that account. I had a daniſh cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a ſhip and his mate with me: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was to ride on horſeback, at which he was not very expert, and the latter to partake of my ſeat. The driver mounted behind to guide the horſes, and flouriſh the whip over our ſhoulders; he would not ſuffer the reins out of his own hands. There was ſomething ſo groteſque in our appearance, that I could not avoid ſhrinking into myſelf when I ſaw a gentleman-like man in the group which crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round the door to obſerve us. I could have broken the driver's whip for cracking to call the women and children together; but ſeeing a ſignificant ſmile on the face, I had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, I burſt into a laugh, to allow him to do ſo too.—and away we ſlew. This is not a flouriſh of the pen; for we actually went on full gallop a long time, the horſes being very good; indeed I have never met with better, if ſo good, poſt-horſes, as in Norway; they

               <p>I had to paſs over, I was informed, the moſt fertile and beſt cultivated tract of country in Norway. The diſtance was three norvegian miles, which are longer than the ſwediſh. The roads were very good; the farmers are obliged to repair them; and we ſcampered through a great extent of co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

houſe could ſpeak engliſh or french. The may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, my friend, however, ſent a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to me who ſpoke a little engliſh, and ſhe agreed to call on me twice a day, to receive my orders, and tranſlate them to my hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs.</p>
               <p>My not underſtanding the language was an excellent pretext for dining alone, which I prevailed on them to let me do at a late hour; for the early dinners in Sweden had entirely deranged my day. I could not alter it there, without diſturbing the economy of a family where I was as a viſitor; neceſſity having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to except of an invitation from a private family, the lodgings were ſo incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the norwegians I had the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my own time; and I determined to regulate it in ſuch a manner, that I might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy as much of their ſweet ſummer as I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could;—ſhort, it is true; but "paſſing ſweet."</p>
               <p>I never endured a winter in this rude clime; conſequently it was not the contraſt, but the real beauty of the ſeaſon which made the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſummer appear to me the fineſt I had ever ſeen. Sheltered from the north and eaſtern winds, nothing can exceed the ſalubrity, the ſoft freſhneſs of the weſtern gales. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they alſo die away; the aſpen leaves trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into ſtillneſs, and repoſing nature ſeems to be warmed by the moon, which here aſſumes
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031653_0061_0fed8e8c34138ee8"/>
a genial aſpect: and if a light ſhower has chanced to fall with the ſun, the juniper the underwood of the foreſt, exhales a wild per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume, mixed with a thouſand nameleſs ſweets, that, ſoothing the heart, leave images in the memory which the imagination will ever hold dear.</p>
               <p>Nature is the nurſe of ſentiment,—the true ſource of taſte;—yet what miſery, as well as rapture, is produced by a quick perception of the beautiful and ſublime, when it is exerciſed in obſerving animated nature, when every beautious feeling and emotion excites reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſympathy, and the harmonized ſoul ſinks into melancholy, or riſes to extaſy, juſt as the chords are touched, like the aeolian harp agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the changing wind. But how danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is it to foſter theſe ſentiments in ſuch an imperfect ſtate of exiſtence; and how difficult to eradicate them when an affection for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, a paſſion for an individual, is but the unfolding of that love which embraces all that is great and beautiful.</p>
               <p>When a warm heart has received ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſſions, they are not to be effaced. Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons become ſentiments; and the imagination renders even tranſient ſenſations permanent, by fondly retracing them. I cannot, without a thrill of delight, recollect views I have ſeen, which are not to be forgotten,—nor looks I have felt in every nerve which I ſhall never more meet. The grave has cloſed over a dear friend, the friend of my youth; ſtill ſhe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031653_0062_0fed8ed720905d60"/>
with me, and I hear her ſoft voice warb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as I ſtray over the heath. Fate has ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated me from another, the fire of whoſe eyes tempered by infantine tenderneſs, ſtill warms my breaſt; even when gazing on theſe tremendous cliffs, ſublime emotions abſorb my ſoul. And, ſmile not, if I add, that the roſy tint of morning reminds me of a ſuffuſion which will never more charm my ſenſes, unleſs it reappears on the checks of my child. Her ſweet bluſhes I may yet hide in my boſom and ſhe is ſtill too young to aſk why ſtarts the tear, ſo near to pleaſure and pain?</p>

               <head>LETTER VII.</head>
               <p>THOUGH the king of Denmark be an abſolute monarch, yet the norwegians appear to enjoy all the bleſſings of freedom. Norway may be termed a ſiſter kingdom; but the people have no viceroy to lord it over them and fatten his dependants with the fruit of their labour.</p>
               <p>There are only two counts in the whole country, who have eſtates, and exact ſome feudal obſervances from their tenantry. All the reſt of the country is divided into ſmall farms, which belong to the cultivator. It is true, ſome few, appertaining to the church, are let; but always on a leaſe for life, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renewed in favour of the eldeſt ſon, who has this advantage, as well as a right to a double portion of the property. But the value of the farm is eſtimated; and after his portion is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to him, he muſt be anſwerable for the reſidue to the remaining part of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Every farmer, for ten years, is obliged to attend annually about twelve days, to learn the military exerciſe; but it is always at a ſmall
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:031653_0064_0fed8edcf334d360"/>
diſtance from his dwelling, and does not lead him into any new habits of life.</p>
               <p>There are about ſix thouſand regulars alſo, garriſoned at Chriſtiania and Fredericſhall, which are equally reſerved, with the militia, for the defence of their own country. So that when the prince royal paſſed into Sweden, in 1788, he was obliged to requeſt, not command, them to accompany him on this expedition.</p>
               <p>Theſe corps are moſtly compoſed of the ſons of the cottagers, who being labourers on the farms, are allowed a few acres to cultivate for themſelves. Theſe men voluntarily enliſt; but it is only for a limited period, (ſix years) at the expiration of which they have the liberty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring. The pay is only two-pence a day, and bread; ſtill, conſidering the cheapneſs of the country, it is more than ſixpence in England.</p>
               <p>The diſtribution of landed property into ſmall farms, produces a degree of equality which I have ſeldom ſeen elſewhere; and the rich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all merchants, who are obliged to divide their perſonal fortune amongſt their children, the boys always receiving twice as much as the girls, property has not a chance of accumulating till overgrown wealth deſtroys the balance of liberty,</p>
               <p>You will be ſurpriſed to hear me talk of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; yet the norwegians appear to me to be the moſt free community I have ever obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:031653_0065_0fed8e8f8468d090"/>The mayor of each town or diſtrict, and the judges in the country, exerciſe an authority almoſt patriarchal. They can do much good, but little harm, as every individual can appeal from their judgment: and as they may always be forced to give a reaſon for their conduct, it is generally regulated by prudence. 'They have not time to learn to be tyrants,' ſaid a gentleman to me, with whom I diſcuſſed the ſubject.</p>
               <p>The farmers not fearing to be turned out of their farms, ſhould they diſpleaſe a man in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and having no vote to be commanded at an election for a mock repreſentative, are a manly race: for not being obliged to ſubmit to any debaſing tenure, in order to live, or advance themſelves in the world, they act with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſpirit. I never yet have heard of any thing like domineering, or oppreſſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſuch as has ariſen from natural cauſes. The fredom the people enjoy may, perhaps, render them a little litigious, and ſubject them to the impoſitions of cunning practitioners of the law: but the authority of office is bounded, and the emoluments of it do not deſtroy its utility.</p>
               <p>Laſt year a man, who had abuſed his power, was caſhiered, on the repreſentation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the bailiff of the diſtrict.</p>
               <p>There are four in Norway, who might with propriety be termed ſheriffs; and, from their
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031653_0066_0fed8ede97479458"/>
ſentence, an appeal, by either party, may be made to Copenhagen.</p>
               <p>Near moſt of the towns are commons, on which the cows of all the inhabitants, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately, are allowed to graze. The poor, to whom a cow is neceſſary, are almoſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by it. Beſides, to render living more eaſy, they all go out to fiſh in their own boats; and fiſh is their principal food.</p>
               <p>The lower claſs of people in the towns are in general ſailors; and the induſtrious have uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly little ventures of their own that ſerve to render the winter comfortable.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the country at large, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation is conſiderably in favour of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>They are forbidden, at preſent, to export corn or rye, on account of the advanced price.</p>
               <p>The reſtriction which moſt reſembles the painful ſubordination of Ireland, is that veſſels, trading to the Weſt Indies, are obliged to paſs by their own ports, and unload their cargoes at Copenhagen, which they afterwards re-ſhip. The duty is indeed inconſiderable; but the navigation being dangerous, they run a double riſk.</p>
               <p>There is an exciſe on all articles of conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought to the towns; but the officers are
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031653_0067_0fed8e91247651f0"/>
not ſtrict; and it would be reckoned invidious to enter a houſe to ſearch, as in England.</p>
               <p>The norwegians appear to me a ſenſible, ſhrewd people, with little ſcientific knowledge, and ſtill leſs taſte for literature: but they are arriving at the epoch which precedes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of the arts and ſciences.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the towns are ſea-ports, and ſeaports are not favourable to improvement. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains acquire a little ſuperficial knowledge by travelling, which their indefatigable attention to the making of money prevents their digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the fortune that they thus labouriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquire, is ſpent, as it uſally is in towns of this deſcription, in ſhew and good living. They love their country, but have not much public ſpirit.<note n="*" place="bottom">The grand virtues of the heart particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the enlarged humanity which extends to the whole human race, depend more on the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I believe, than is generally imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Their exertions are, generally ſpeaking, only for their families; which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive will always be the caſe, till politics, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a ſubject of diſcuſſion, enlarges the heart by opening the underſtanding. The french revolution will have this effect, They ſing at preſent, with great glee, many repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican ſongs, and ſeem earneſtly to wiſh that the republic may ſtand; yet they appear very much attached to their prince royal; and, as far as rumour can give an idea of a character, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031653_0068_0fed8ee035feccb8"/>
to merit their attachment. When I am at Copenhagen, I ſhall be able to aſcertain on what foundation their good opinion is built; at preſent I am only the echo of it.</p>
               <p>In the year 1788 he travelled through Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and acts of mercy gave dignity to the parade, and intereſt to the joy, his preſence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired. At this town he pardoned a girl con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die for murdering an illegitimate child, a crime ſeldom committed in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. She is ſince married, and become the careful mother of a family. This might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as an inſtance, that a deſperate act is not always a proof of an incorrigible depravity of character; the only plauſible excuſe that has been brought forward to juſtify the infliction of capital puniſhments.</p>
               <p>I will relate two or three other anecdotes to you; for the truth of which I will not vouch, becauſe the facts were not of ſufficient conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for me to take much pains to aſcertain them; and, true or falſe, they evince that the people like to make a kind of miſtreſs of their prince.</p>
               <p>An officer, mortally wounded at the ill-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed battle of Quiſtram, deſired to ſpeak with the prince; and, with his dying breath, earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly recommended to his care a young woman of Chriſtiania, to whom he was engaged. When the prince returned there, a ball was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the chief inhabitants. He inquired whether this unfortunate girl was invited, and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:031653_0069_0fed8e96b1589950"/>
requeſted that ſhe might, though of the ſecond claſs. The girl came; ſhe was pretty; and finding herſelf amongſt her ſuperiors, baſhfully ſat down as near the door as poſſible, nobody taking notice of her. Shortly after, the prince entering, immediately inquired for her, and aſked her to dance, to the mortification of the rich dames. After it was over he handed her to the top of the room, and placing himſelf by her, ſpoke of the loſs ſhe had ſuſtained, with tenderneſs, promiſing to provide for any one ſhe ſhould marry,—as the ſtory goes. She is ſince married, and he has not forgotten his promiſe.</p>
               <p>A little girl, during the ſame expedition, in Sweden, who informed him that the logs of a bridge were cut underneath, was taken by his orders to Chriſtiania, and put to ſchool at his expence.</p>
               <p>Before I retail other beneficial effects of his journey, it is neceſſary to inform you that the laws here are mild, and do not puniſh capitally for any crime but murder, which ſeldom oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs. Every other offence merely ſubjects the delinquent to impriſonment and labour in the caſtle, or rather arſenal, at Chriſtiania, and the fortreſs at Fredericſhall. The firſt and ſecond conviction produces a ſentence for a limited number of years,—two, three, five, or ſeven, proportioned to the atrocity of the crime. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the third he is whipped, branded in the forehead, and condemned to perpetual ſlavery. This is the ordinary march of juſtice.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031653_0070_0fed8ee4aaf62f28"/>
For ſome flagrant breaches of truſt, or acts of wanton cruelty, criminals have been condemned to ſlavery for life, the firſt time of conviction, but not frequently. The number of theſe ſlaves do not, I am informed, amount to more than an hundred, which is not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, compared with the population, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of eight hundred thouſand. Should I paſs through Chriſtiania, on my return to Gothenburg, I ſhall probably have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of learning other particulars.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a houſe of correction at Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ania for trifling miſdemeanors, where the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are confined to labour and impriſonment even for life. The ſtate of the priſoners was repreſented to the prince; in conſequence of which, he viſited the arſenal and houſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The ſlaves at the arſenal were loaded with irons of a great weight; he ordered them to be lightened as much as poſſible.</p>
               <p>The people in the houſe of correction were commanded not to ſpeak to him; but four wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, condemned to remain there for life, got into the paſſage, and fell at his feet. He grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them a pardon; and inquiring reſpecting the treatment of the priſoners, he was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they were frequently whipt going in, and coming out; and for any fault, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the inſpectors. This cuſtom he hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely aboliſhed; though ſome of the principal inhabitants, whoſe ſituation in life had raiſed them above the temptation of ſtealing, were of opinion that theſe chaſtiſements were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and wholeſome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:031653_0071_0fed8e9b61f95788"/>In ſhort, every thing ſeems to announce that the prince really cheriſhes the laudable ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fulfilling the duties of his ſtation. This ambition is cheriſhed and directed by the count Bernſtorf, the prime miniſter of Denmark, who is univerſally celebrated for his abilities and virtue. The happineſs of the people is a ſubſtantial eulogium: and, from all I can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the inhabitants of Denmark and Norway are the leaſt oppreſſed people of Europe. The preſs is free. They tranſlate any of the french publications of the day, deliver their opinion on the ſubject and diſcuſs thoſe it leads to with great freedom, and without fearing to diſpleaſe the government.</p>
               <p>On the ſubject of religion they are likewiſe becoming tolerant, at leaſt, and perhaps have advanced a ſtep further in free-thinking. One writer has ventured to deny the divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, and to queſtion the neceſſity or utility of the chriſtian ſyſtem, without being conſidered univerſally as a monſter, which would have been the caſe a few years ago. They have tranſlated many german works on education; and though they have not adopted any of their plans, it is become a ſubject of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion. There are ſome grammar and free ſchools; but, from what I hear, not very good ones. All the children learn to read, write, and caſt accounts, for the purpoſes of common life. They have no univerſity; and nothing that deſerves the name of ſcience is taught; nor do individuals, by purſuing any branch of knowledge, excite a degree of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031653_0072_0fed8ee7b77a4540"/>
which is the forerunner of improvement. Knowledge is not abſolutely neceſſary to enable a conſiderable portion of the community to live; and, till it is, I fear, it never becomes general.</p>
               <p>In this country, where minerals abound, there is not one collection; and, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, I venture a conjecture, the want of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical and chemical knowledge renders the ſilver mines unproductive; for the quantity of ſilver obtained every year is not ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the expences. It has been urged, that the employment of ſuch a number of hands is very beneficial. But a poſitive loſs is never to be done away; and the men, thus employed, would naturally find ſome other means of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inſtead of being thus a dead weigh on go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or rather on the community from whom its revenue is drawn.</p>
               <p>About three engliſh miles from Tonſberg there is a ſalt work, belonging, like all their eſtabliſhments, to government, in which they employ above an hundred and fifty men, and maintain nearly five hundred people, who earn their living. The clear profit, an increaſing one, amounts to two thouſand pounds ſterling. And as the eldeſt ſon of the inſpector, an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious young man, has been ſent by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to travel, and acquire ſome mathematical and chemical knowledge in Germany, it has a chance of being improved. He is the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I have met with here, who appears to have
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:031653_0073_0fed8e9e6aadb478"/>
a ſcientific turn of mind. I do not mean to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that I have not met with others, who have a ſpirit of inquiry.</p>
               <p>The ſalt-works at St. Ubes are baſons in the ſand, and the ſun produces the evaporation: but here there is no beach. Beſides, the heat of ſummer is ſo ſhort-lived, that it would be idle to contrive machines for ſuch an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable portion of the year. They therefore always uſe fires; and the whole eſtabliſhment appears to be regulated with judgment.</p>
               <p>The ſituation is well choſen and beautiful. I do not find, from the obſervation of a perſon who has reſided here for forty years, that the ſea advances or recedes on this coaſt.</p>
               <p>I have already remarked, that little attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is paid to education, excepting reading, writing, and the rudiments of arithmetic; I ought to have added, that a catechiſm is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taught, and the children obliged to read in the churches, before the congregation, to prove that they are not neglected.</p>
               <p>Degrees, to enable any one to practiſe any profeſſion, muſt be taken at Copenhagen; and the people of this country, having the good ſenſe to perceive that men who are to live in a community ſhould at leaſt acquire the elements of their knowledge, and form their youthful attachments there, are ſeriouſly endeavoring to eſtabliſh an univerſity in Norway. And
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031653_0074_0fed8ee95a50b990"/>
Tonſberg, as a centrical place in the beſt part of the country, had the moſt ſuffrages; for, experiencing the bad effects of a metropolis, they have determined not to have it in or near Chriſtiania. Should ſuch an eſtabliſhment take place, it will promote inquiry throughout the country, and give a new face to ſociety. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums have been offered, and prize queſtions written, which I am told have merit. The building college-halls, and other appendages of the ſeat of ſcience, might enable Tonſberg to recover its priſtine conſequence; for it is one of the moſt ancient towns of Norway, and once contained nine churches. At preſent there are only two. One is a very old ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and has a gothic reſpectability about it, which ſcarcely amounts to grandeur, becauſe, to render a gothic pile grand, it muſt have a huge unwieldineſs of appearance. The chapel of Windſor may be an exception to this rule; I mean before it was in its preſent <hi>nice, clean</hi> ſtate. When I firſt ſaw it, the pillars within had acquired, by time, a ſombre hue, which accorded with the architecture; and the gloom increaſed its dimenſions to the eye by hiding its parts; but now it all burſts on the view at once; and the ſublimity has vaniſhed before the bruſh and broom; for it has been white-waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſcraped till it is become as bright and neat as the pots and pans in a notable houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife's kitchen—yes; the very ſpurs on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent knights were deprived of their vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ruſt, to give a ſtriking proof that a love of order in trifles, and taſt for proportion and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:031653_0075_0fed8ea0109bc908"/>
arrangement, are very diſtinct. The glare of light thus introduced, entirely deſtroys the ſentiment theſe piles are calculated to inſpire; ſo that, when I heard ſomething like a jig from the organ-loft, I thought it an excellent hall for dancing or feaſting. The meaſured pace of thought with which I had entered the cathedral, changed into a trip; and I bounded on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>The norwegians are fond of muſic; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little church has an organ. In the church I have mentioned, there is an inſcription import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a king, <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>There is a little receſs full of coffins, which contains bodies embalmed long ſince—ſo long, that there is not even a tradition to lead to a gueſs at their names.</p>
               <p>A deſire of preſerving the body ſeems to have prevailed in moſt countries of the world, futile as it is to term it a preſervation, when the nobleſt parts are immediately ſacrificed merely to ſave the muſcles, ſkin and bone from rottenneſs. When I was ſhewn theſe human petrifactions, I ſhrunk back with diſguſt and horror. "Aſhes to aſhes!" thought I—"Duſt to duſt!"—If this be not diſſolution, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe than natural decay—It is treaſon againſt humanity, thus to lift up the awful veil which would fain hide its weakneſs. The grandeur of the active principle is never more ſtrongly felt than at ſuch a ſight; for nothing is ſo ugly as the human form when deprived of life, and thus dried into ſtone, merely to preſerve the moſt diſguſting image of death.

The contemplation of noble ruins produces a melancholy that exalts the mind.—We take a retroſpect of the exertions of man, the fate of empires and their rulers; and marking the grand deſtruction of ages, it ſeems the neceſſary change of time leading to improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—Our very ſoul expands, and we forget our littleneſs; how painfully brought to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection by ſuch vain attempts to ſnatch from decay what is deſtined ſo ſoon to periſh.

               <p>TONSBERG was formerly the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of one of the little ſovereigns of Norway; and on an adjacent mountain the veſtiges of a fort remain, which was battered down by the ſwedes; the enterance of the bay lying cloſe to it.</p>
               <p>Here I have frequently ſtrayed, ſovereign of the waſte. I ſeldom met any human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and ſometines, reclining on the moſſy down, under the ſhelter of a rock, the prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of the ſea amongſt the pebbles has hilled me to ſleep—no fear of any r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Balmy were the ſlumbers, and ſoft the gales, that refreſhed me, when I awoke to follow, with an eye vaguely curious, the white ſails, as they turned the cliffs, or ſeemed to take ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the pines which covered the little iſlands that ſo gracefully roſe to render the terrific ocean beautiful. The fiſhermen were calmly caſting their nets; whilſt the ſeagulls hovered over the unruffled deep. Every thing ſeemed to harmonize into tranquility—even the mournful call of the bittern was in cadence with the tinkling bells on the necks of the cows, that, pacing ſlowly one after the other,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031653_0080_0fed8ef2774648a8"/>
along an inviting path in the vale below, were repairing to the cottages to be milked. With what ineffable pleaſure have I not gazed—and gazed again, loſing my breath through my eyes—my very ſoul diffuſed itſelf in the ſcene and, ſeeming to become all ſenſes, glided in the ſcarcely-agitated waves, melted in the freſhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breeze, or, taking its flight with fairy wing, to the miſty mountains which bounded the proſpect, fancy tript over new lawns, more beautiful even than the lovely ſlopes on the winding ſhore before me.—I pauſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain breathleſs, to trace, with renewed delight, ſentiments which entranced me, when, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my humid eyes from the expanſe below to the vault above, my ſight pierced the fleecy clouds that ſoftened the azure brightneſs; and, imperceptibly recalling the reveries of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, I bowed before the awful throne of my Creator, whilſt I reſted on its footſtool.</p>
               <p>You have ſometimes wondered, my dear friend, at the extreme affection of my nature— But ſuch is the temperature of my ſoul—It is not the vivacity of youth, the hay-day of exiſtance. For years have I endeavoured to calm an impetuous tide—labouring to make my feelings take an orderly courſe.—It was ſtriving againſt the ſtream.—I muſt love and admire with warmth, or I ſink into ſadneſs. Tokens of love which I have received have rapt me in elyſium—purifying the heart they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted.—My boſom ſtill glows.—Do not ſaucily aſk, repeating Sterne's queſtion, <q>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria is it ſtill ſo warm?</q> Sufficiently, O my

God! has it been chilled by ſorrow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs—ſtill nature will prevail—and if I bluſh at recollecting paſt enjoyment, it is the roſy hue of pleaſure heightened by modeſty; for the bluſh of modeſty and ſhame are as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct as the emotions by which they are produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>I need ſcarcely inform you, after telling you of my walks, that my conſtitution has been renovated here; and that I have recovered my activity, even whilſt attaining a little <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonpoint.</hi> My imprudence laſt winter, and ſome untoward accidents juſt at the time I was weaning my child, had reduced me to a ſtate of weakneſs which I never before experienced. A ſlow fever preyed on me every night, during my reſidence in Sweden, and after I arrived at Tonſberg. By chance I found a fine rivulet filtered through the rocks, and confined in a baſon for the cattle. It taſted to me like a chalybeat; at any rate it was pure; and the good effect of the various waters which inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids are ſent to drink, depends, I believe more on the air, exerciſe and change of ſcene, than on their medicinal qualities. I therefore deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to turn my morning walks towards it, and ſeek for health from the nymph of the fountain; partaking of the beverage offered to the tenants of the ſhade.</p>
               <p>Chance likewiſe led me to diſcover a new pleaſure, equally beneficial to my health. I wiſhed to avail myſelf of my vicinity to the ſea, and bathe; but it was not poſſible near the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031653_0082_0fed8ef585247f70"/>
town: there was no convenience. The young woman whom I mentioned to you, propoſed rowing me acroſs the water, amongſt the rocks; but as ſhe was pregnant, I inſiſted on taking one of the oars, and learning to row. It was not difficult; and I do not know a pleaſanter exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. I ſoon became expert, and my train of thinking kept time, as it were, with the oars, or I ſuffered the boat to be carried along by the current, indulging a pleaſing forgetfulneſs, or fallacious is hopes.—How fallacious! yet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hilation—the only thing of which I have ever felt a dread—I cannot bear to think of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more—of loſing myſelf—though exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is often but a painful conſciouſneſs of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; nay, it appears to me impoſſible that I ſhould ceaſe to exiſt, or that this active, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſpirit, equally alive to joy and ſorrow, ſhould only be organized duſt—ready to fly abroad the moment the ſpring ſnaps, or the ſpark goes out, which kept it together. Surely ſomething reſides in this heart that is not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable—and life is more than a dream.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, to take up my oar, once more, when the ſea was calm, I was amuſed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the innumerable young ſtar fiſh which floated juſt below the ſurface: I had never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them before; for they have not a hard ſhell, like thoſe which I have ſeen on the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore. They look like thickened water, with a white edge; and four purple circles, of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent forms, were in the middle, over an incredible number of fibres, or white lines.

Touching them, the cloudy ſubſtance would turn or cloſe, firſt on one ſide, then on the other, very gracefully; but when I took one of them up in the ladle with which I heaved the water out of the boat, it appeared only a colourleſs jelly.</p>
               <p>I did not ſee any of the ſeals, numbers of which followed our boat when we landed in Sweden; for though I like to ſport in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſhould have had no deſire to join in their gambols.</p>
               <p>Enough, you will ſay, of inanimate nature, and of brutes, to uſe the lordly phraſe of man; let me hear ſomething of the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The gentleman with whom I had buſineſs, is the mayor of Tonſberg; he ſpeaks engliſh intelligibly; and, having a ſound underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I was ſorry that his numerous occupations prevented my gaining as much information from him as I could have drawn forth, had we frequently converſed. The people of the town, as far as I had an opportunity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſentiments, are extreamly well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his manner of diſcharging his office. He has a degree of information and good ſenſe which excites reſpect, whilſt a chearfulneſs, almoſt amounting to gaiety, enables him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile differences, and keep his neighbours in good humour.—I loſt my horſe, <q>ſaid a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to me; but ever ſince, when I want to ſend to the mill, or go out, the mayor
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031653_0084_0fed349aeee0f618"/>
lends me one.—He ſcolds if I do not come for it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A criminal was branded, during my ſtay here, for the third offence; but the relief he received made him declare that the judge was one of the beſt men in the world.</p>
               <p>I ſent this wretch a trifle, at different times, to take with him into ſlavery. As it was more than he expected, he wiſhed very much to ſee me; and this wiſh brought to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance an anecdote I heard when I was in Liſbon.</p>
               <p>A wretch who had been impriſoned ſeveral years, during which period lamps had been put up, was at laſt condemned to a cruel death; yet, in his way to execution, be only wiſhed for one night's reſpite, to ſee the city light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Having dined in company at the mayor's, I was invited with his family to ſpend the day at one of the richeſt merchant's houſes.—Though I could not ſpeak daniſh, I knew that I could ſee a great deal: yes; I am perſuaded that I have formed a very juſt opinion of the character of the norwegians, without being able to hold converſe with them.</p>
               <p>I had expected to meet ſome company; yet was a little diſconcerted at being uſhered into an appartment full of well-dreſſed people; and, glancing my eyes round, they reſted on ſeveral
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:031653_0085_0fed8eb0d61fa2a0"/>
very pretty faces. Roſy cheeks, ſparkling eyes, and light brown or golden locks; for I never ſaw ſo much hair with a yellow caſt; and, with their fine complexions, it looked very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming.</p>
               <p>Theſe women ſeem a mixture of indolence and vivacity; they ſcarcely ever walk out, and were aſtoniſhed that I ſhould, for pleaſure; yet they are immoderately fond of dancing. Unaffected in their manners, if they have no pretentions to elegance, ſimplicity often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a gracefulneſs of deportment, when they are animated by a particular deſire to pleaſe— which was the caſe at preſent. The ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my ſituation, which they thought ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, intereſted them very much in my favour. They gathered round me—ſung to me—and one of the prettieſt, to whom I gave my hand, with ſome degree of cordiality, to meet the glance of her eyes, kiſſed me very affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>At dinner which was conducted with great hoſpitality, though we remained at table too long, they ſung ſeveral ſongs, and, amongſt the reſt, tranſlations of ſome patriotic french ones. As the evening advanced, they became playful, and we kept up a ſort of converſation of geſtures. As their minds were totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated, I did not loſe much, perhaps gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by not being able to underſtand them; for fancy probably filled up, more to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the void in the picture. Be that as it may, they excited my ſympathy; and I was
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:031653_0086_0fed8efcf7485418"/>
very much flattered when I was told, the next day, that they ſaid it was a pleaſure to look at me, I appeared ſo good natured.</p>
               <p>The men were generally captains of ſhips. Several ſpoke engliſh very tolerably; but they were merely matter of fact men, confined to a very narrow circle of obſervation. I found it difficult to obtain from them any informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpecting their own country, when the fumes of tobacco did not keep me at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>I was invited to partake of ſome other feaſts, and always had to complain of the quantity of proviſion, and the length of time taken to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it; for it would not have been proper to have ſaid devour, all went on ſo fair and ſoftly. The ſervants wait as ſlowly as their miſtreſſes carve.</p>
               <p>The young women here, as well as in Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, have commonly bad teeth, which I attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the ſame cauſes. They are fond of finery, but do not pay the neceſſary attention to their perſons, to render beauty leſs tranſient than a flower; and that intereſting expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſentiment and accompliſhments give, ſeldom ſupplies its place.</p>
               <p>The ſervants have likewiſe an inferior ſort of food here; but their maſters are not allowed to ſtrike them with impunity. I might have added miſtreſſes; for it was a complaint of this
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:031653_0087_0fed8eb276c1a3a0"/>
kind, brought before the mayor, which led me to a knowledge of the fact.</p>
               <p>The wages are low, which is particularly unjuſt, becauſe the price of clothes is much higher than proviſions. A young woman, who is wet nurſe to the miſtreſs of the inn where I lodge, receives only twelve dollars a year, and pays ten for the nurſing of her own child; the father had run away to get clear of the expence. There was ſomething in this moſt painful ſtate of widowhood which excited my compaſſion, and led me to reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the inſtability of the moſt flattering plans of happineſs, that were painful in the extreme, till I was ready to aſk whether this world was not created to exhibit every poſſible combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wretchedneſs. I aſked theſe queſtions of a heart writhing with anguiſh, whilſt I liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a melancholy ditty ſung by this poor girl. It was too early for thee to be abandoned, thought I, and I haſtened out of the houſe, to take my ſolitary evening's walk—And here I am again, to talk of any thing, but the pangs ariſing from the diſcovery of eſtranged affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the lonely ſadneſs of a deſerted heart.</p>
               <p>The father and mother, if the father can be aſcertained, are obliged to maintain an illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate child at their joint expence; but, ſhould the father diſappear, go up the country or to ſea, the mother muſt maintain it herſelf. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, accidents of this kind do not prevent their marrying; and then it is not unuſual to take the child or children home; and they are
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031653_0088_0fed8f0006cead00"/>
brought up very amicably with the marriage progeny.</p>
               <p>I took ſome pains to learn what books were written originally in their language; but for any certain information reſpecting the ſtate of daniſh literature, I muſt wait till I arrive at Copenhagen.</p>
               <p>The ſound of the language is ſoft, a great proportion of the words ending in vowels; and there is a ſimplicity in the turn of ſome of the phraſes which have been tranſlated to me, that pleaſed and intereſted me. In the country, the farmers uſe the <hi>thou</hi> and <hi>thee</hi>; and they do not acquire the police plurals of the towns by meeting at market. The not having markets eſtabliſhed in the large towns appears to me a great inconvenience. When the farmers have any thing to ſell, they bring it to the neighbouring town, and take it from houſe to houſe. I am ſurpriſed that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants do not feel how very incommodions this uſage is to both parties, and redreſs it. They indeed perceive it; for when I have introduced the ſubject, they acknowledged that they were often in want of neceſſaries, there being no butchers, and they were often obliged to buy what they did not want; yet it was the <hi>cuſtom</hi>; and the changing of cuſtoms of a long ſtanding requires more energy than they yet poſſeſs. I received a ſimilar reply, when I attempted to perſuade the women that they injured their children by keeping them too warm. The only way of parrying off my reaſoning was,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031653_0089_0fed8eb581a55360"/>
that they muſt do as other people did. In ſhort, reaſon on any ſubject of change, and they ſtop you by ſaying that "the town would talk." "A perſon of ſenſe, with a large fortune, to inſure reſpect might be very uſeful here, by inducing them to treat their children, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their ſick properly, and eat food dreſſed in a ſimpler manner: the example, for inſtance, of a count's lady.</p>
               <p>Reflecting on theſe prejudices made me revert to the wiſdom of thoſe legiſlators who eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed inſtitutions for the good of the body, under the pretext of ſerving heaven for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſoul. Theſe might with ſtrict propriety be termed pious frauds; and I admire the peruvian pair for aſſerting that they came from the ſun, when their conduct proved that they meant to enlighten a benighted country, whoſe obedience, or even attention, could only be ſecured by awe.</p>
               <p>Thus much for conquering the <hi>inertia</hi> of reaſon; but, when it is once in motion, fables, once held ſacred, may be ridiculed; and ſacred they were, when uſeful to mankind.—Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus alone ſtole fire to animate the firſt man; his poſterity need not ſupernatural aid to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſpecies, though love is generally term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a flame; and it may not be neceſſary much longer to ſuppoſe men inſpired by heaven to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate the duties which demand ſpecial grace, when reaſon convinces them that they are the happieſt who are the moſt nobly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:031653_0090_0fed8f01a6c3e788"/>In a few days I am to ſet out for the weſtern part or Norway, and then ſhall return by land to Gothenburg. I cannot think of leaving this place without regret. I ſpeak of the place before the inhabitants, though there is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs in their artleſs kindneſs which attaches me to them; but it is an attachment that inſpires a regret very different from that I felt at leaving Hull, in my way to Sweden. The domeſtic happineſs, and good-humoured gaiety, of the amiable family where I and my Frances were ſo hoſpitably received, would have been ſufficient to inſure the tendereſt remembrance, without the recollection of the ſocial evenings to ſtimulate it, when good-breeding gave dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſympathy, and wit, zeſt to reaſon.</p>

               <head>LETTER IX.</head>
               <p>I HAVE already informed you that there are only two noblemen who have eſtates of any magnitude in Norway. One of theſe has a houſe near Tonſberg, at which he has not reſided for ſome years, having been at court, or on embaſſies. He is now the daniſh ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador in London. The houſe is pleaſantly ſituated, and the grounds about it fine; but their neglected appearance plainly tells that there is nobody at home.</p>
               <p>A ſtupid kind of ſadneſs, to my eye, always reigns in a huge habitation where only ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants live to put caſes on the furniture and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the windows. I enter as I would into the tomb of the Capulets, to look at the family pictures that here frown in armour, or ſmile in ermine. The mildew reſpects not the lordly robe; and the worm riots unchecked on the cheek of beauty.</p>
               <p>There was nothing in the architecture of the building, or the form of the furniture, to detain me from the avenue where the aged pines ſtretched along majeſtically. Time had given a greyiſh caſt to their ever-green foliage; and they ſtood, like firs of the foreſt, ſhelt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:031653_0092_0fed8f0779ee0848"/>
on all ſides by a riſing progeny. I had not ever ſeen ſo many oaks together in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as in theſe woods, nor ſuch large aſpens as here were agitated by the breeze, rendering the wind audible—nay, muſical; for melody ſeemed on the wing around me. How differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent was the freſh odour that re-animated me in the avenue, from the damp chillneſs of the apartments; and as little did the gloomy thoughtfulneſs excited by the duſty hangings, and worm-eaten pictures, reſemble the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries inſpired by the ſoothing melancholy of their ſhade. In the winter, theſe auguſt pines, tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering above the ſnow, muſt relieve the eye beyond meaſure, and give life to the white waſte.</p>
               <p>The continual recurrence of pine and fir groves, in the day, ſometimes wearies the ſight; but, in the evening, nothing can be more pictureſque, or, more properly ſpeaking, better calculated, to produce poetical images. Paſſing through them, I have been ſtruck with a myſtic kind of reverence, and I did, as it were, homage to their venerable ſhadows. Not nymphs, but philoſophers, ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit them—ever muſing; I could ſcarcely conceive that they were without ſome conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of exiſtence—without a calm enjoyment of the pleaſure they diffuſed.</p>
               <p>How often do my feelings produce ideas that remind me of the origin of many poetical fictions. In ſolitude, the imagination bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lies forth its conceptions unreſtrained, and ſtops
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:031653_0093_0fed8ebd07308f98"/>
enraptured to adore the beings of its own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe are moments of bliſs; and the memory recalls them with delight.</p>
               <p>But I have almoſt forgotten the matters of fact I meant to relate, reſpecting the counts. They have the preſentation of the livings on their eſtates, appoint the judges, and different civil officers, the crown reſerving to itſelf the privilege of ſanctioning them. But, though they appoint, they cannot diſmiſs. Their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants alſo occupy their farms for life, and are obliged to obey any ſummons to work on the part he reſerves for himſelf; but they are paid for their labour. In ſhort, I have ſeldom heard of any nobleman ſo innoxious.</p>
               <p>Obſerving that the gardens round the count's eſtate were better cultivated than any I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeen, I was led to reflect on the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which naturally accrue from the feudal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures. The tenants of the count are obliged to work at a ſtated price, in his grounds and garden; and the inſtruction which they imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly receive from the head gardener, tends to render them uſeful, and makes them, in the common courſe of things, better huſbandmen and gardeners on their own little farms. Thus the great, who alone travel, in this period of ſociety, for the obſervation of manners and cuſtoms made by ſailors is very confined, bring home improvement to promote their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which is gradually ſpread abroad amongſt the people, till they are ſtimulated to think for themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:031653_0094_0fed8f091d761958"/>The biſhops have not large revenues; and the prieſts are appointed by the king before they come to them to be ordained, There is commonly ſome little farm annexed to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage; and the inhabitants ſubſcribe volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, three times a year, in addition to the church fees, for the ſupport of the clergyman. The church lands were ſeized when lutheraniſm was introduced; the deſire of obtaining them being probably the real ſtimulus of reformation. The tithes, which are never required in kind, are divided into three parts; one to the king, another to the incumbent, and the third to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the delapidations of the parſonage. They do not amount to much. And the ſtipend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the different civil officers is alſo too ſmall, ſcarcely deſerving to be termed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence; that of the cuſtom-houſe officers is not ſufficient to procure the neceſſaries of life— no wonder, then, if neceſſity leads them to knavery. Much public virtue cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected till every employment, putting perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites out of the queſtion, has a ſalary ſufficient to reward induſtry, whilſt none are ſo great as to permit the poſſeſſor to remain idle. It is this want of proportion between profit and labour which debaſes men, producing the ſycophantic appellations of patron and client; and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious <hi>eſprit du corps,</hi> proverbially vicious.</p>
               <p>The farmers are hoſpitable, as well as inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent. Offering once to pay for ſome coffee I drank when taking ſhelter from the rain, I was aſked, rather angrily, if a little coffee was worth paying for. They ſmoke,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031653_0095_0fed8ec00d9f6188"/>
and drink drams; but not ſo much as formerly. Drunkenneſs, often the attendant diſgrace of hoſpitality, will here, as well as every where elſe, give place to gallantry and refinement of manners; but the change will not be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly produced.</p>
               <p>The people of every claſs are conſtant in their attendance at church; they are very fond of dancing: and the ſunday evenings in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as in catholic countries, are ſpent in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes which exhilerate the ſpirits, without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating the heart. The reſt of labour ought to be gay; and the gladneſs I have felt in France on a ſunday, or decadi, which I caught from the faces around me, was a ſentiment more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religious than all the ſtupid ſtillneſs which the ſtreets of London ever inſpired where the ſabbath is ſo decorouſly obſerved. I recollect, in the country parts of England the church-wardens uſed to go out, during the ſervice, to ſee if they could catch any luckleſs wight play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at bowls or ſkittles; yet what could be more harmleſs? It would even, I think, be a great advantage to the Engliſh, if feats of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, I do not include boxing matches, were encouraged on a ſunday, as it might ſtop the progreſs of methodiſm, and of that fanatical ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which appears to be gaining ground. I was ſurpriſed when I viſited Yorkſhire, in my way to Sweden, to find that ſullen narrowneſs of thinking had made ſuch a progreſs ſince I was an inhabitant of the country. I could hardly have ſuppoſed that ſixteen or ſeventeen years could have produced ſuch an alteration for the
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:031653_0096_0fed8f0ac074beb8"/>
worſe in the morals of a place; yes, I ſay morals; for obſervance of forms, and avoiding of practices, indifferent in themſelves, often ſupplies the place of that regular attention to duties which are ſo natural, that they ſeldom are vauntingly exerciſed, though they are worth all the precepts of the law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Beſides, many of theſe deluded people, with the beſt meaning, actually loſe their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and become miſerable, the dread of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation throwing them into a ſtate which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits the term: and ſtill more, in runing after their preachers, expecting to promote their ſalvation, they diſregard their welfare in this world, and neglect the intereſt and comfort of their families: ſo that in proportion as they attain a reputation for piety, they become idle.</p>
               <p>Ariſtocracy and fanaticiſm ſeem equally to be gaining ground in England, particularly in the place I have mentioned: I ſaw very little of either in Norway. The people are regular in their attendance on public worſhip; but religion does not interfere with their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>As the farmers cut away the wood, they clear the ground. Every year, therefore, the country is becoming fitter to ſupport the inhabitants. Half century ago the Dutch, I am told, only paid for the cutting down of the wood, and the farmers were glad to get rid of it without giving themſelves any trouble. At preſent they form a juſt eſtimate of its
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:031653_0097_0fed8ec325dadb60"/>
value; nay, I was ſurpriſed to find even fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood ſo dear, when it appears to be in ſuch plenty. The deſtruction, or gradual reduction, of their foreſts, will probably meliorate the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; and their manners will naturally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in the ſame ratio as induſtry requires ingenuity. It is very fortunate that men are, a long time, but juſt above the brute creation, or the greater part of the earth would never have been rendered habitable; becauſe it is the patient labour of men, who are only ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a ſubſiſtence, which produces whatever embelliſhes exiſtence, affording leiſure for the cultivation of the arts and ſciences, that lift man ſo far above his firſt ſtate. I never, my friend, thought ſo deeply of the advantages ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by human induſtry as ſince I have been in Norway. The world requires, I ſee, the hand of man to perfect it; and as this taſk na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally unfolds the faculties he exerciſes, it is phyſically impoſſible that he ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Rouſſeau's golden age of ſtupidity. And, conſidering the queſtion of human hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, where, oh! where does it reſide? Has it taken up its abode with unconſcious igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or with the high-wrought mind? Is it the offspring of thoughtleſs animal ſpirits, or the elve of fancy continually flitting around the expected pleaſure?</p>
               <p>The increaſing population of the earth muſt neceſſarily tend to its improvement, as the means of exiſtence are multiplied by inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <head>LETTER X.</head>
               <p>I HAVE once more, my friend, taken flight; for I left Tonſberg yeſterday: but with an intention of returning, in my way back to Sweden.</p>
               <p>The road to Laurvig is very fine, and the country the beſt cultivated in Norway. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before admired the beech tree; and when I met ſtragglers here, they pleaſed me ſtill leſs. Long and lank, they would have forced me to allow that the line of beauty requires ſome curves, if the ſtately pine, ſtanding near, erect, throwing her vaſt arms around, had not looked beautiful, in oppoſition to ſuch narrow rules.</p>
               <p>In theſe reſpects my very reaſon obliges me to permit my feelings to be my criterion. Whatever excites emotion has charms for me; though I inſiſt that the cultivation of the mind, by warming, nay almoſt creating the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, produces taſte and an immenſe variety of ſenſations and emotions, partaking of the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite pleaſure inſpired by beauty and ſublimity. As I know of no end to them, the word infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, ſo often miſapplied, might, on this occaſion, be introduced with ſomething like propriety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:031653_0100_0fed8f54604c1cb8"/>But I have rambled away again. I intended to have remarked to you the effect produced by a grove of towering beech. The airy lightneſs of their follage admitting a degree of ſunſhine, which, giving a tranſparency to the leaves, exhibited an appearance of freſhneſs and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance that I had never before remarked. I thought of deſcriptions of Italian ſcenery. But theſe evaneſcent graces ſeemed the effect of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment; and I imperceptibly breathed ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leſt I ſhould deſtroy what was real, yet looked ſo like the creation of fancy. Dryden's fable of the flower and the leaf was not a more poetical reverie.</p>
               <p>Adieu, however, to fancy, and to all the ſentiments which ennoble our nature. I arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Laurvig, and found myſelf in the midſt of a group of lawyers, of different deſcriptions. My head turned round, my heart grew ſick, as I regarded viſages deformed by vice; and liſtened to accounts of chicanery that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually embroiling the ignorant. Theſe locuſts will probably diminiſh, as the people become more enlightened. In this period of ſocial life the commonalty are always cunningly attentive to their own intereſt; but their faculties, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a few objects, are ſo narrowed, that they cannot diſcover it in the general good. The profeſſion of the law renders a ſet of men ſtill ſhrewder and more ſelfiſh than the reſt; and it is theſe men, whoſe wits have been ſharpened by knavery, who here undermine morality, confounding right and wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="unknown:031653_0101_0fed8f13a35de8c8"/>The count of Bernſtorff, who really appears to me, from all I can gather, to have the good of the people at heart, aware of this, has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent to the mayor of each diſtrict to name, according to the ſize of the place, four or ſix of the beſt-informed inhabitants, not men of the law, out of which the citizens were to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect two, who are to be termed <hi>mediators.</hi> Their office is to endeavour to prevent litigious ſuits, and conciliate differences. And no ſuit is to be commenced before the parties have diſcuſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſpute at their weekly meeting. If a reconciliation ſhould, in conſequence, take place, it is to be regiſtered, and the parties are not allowed to retract.</p>
               <p>By theſe means ignorant people will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from applying for advice to men who may juſtly be termed ſtirrers-up of ſtrife. They have, for a long time, to uſe a ſignificant vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariſm, ſet the people by the ears, and lived by the ſpoil they caught up in the ſcramble. There is ſome reaſon to hope that this regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will diminiſh their number, and retrain their miſchievous activity. But till trials by jury are eſtabliſhed, little juſtice can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Norway. Judges who cannot be bribed are often timid, and afraid of offending bold knaves, leſt they ſhould raiſe a ſet of hornets about themſelves. The fear of cenſure under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines all energy of character; and, labouring to be prudent, they loſe ſight of rectitude. Beſides, nothing is left to their conſcience, or ſagacity; they muſt be governed by evidence, though internally convinced that it is falſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="unknown:031653_0102_0fed8f58d32035b0"/>There is a conſiderable iron manufactory at Laurvig, for coarſe work, and a lake near the town ſupplies the water neceſſary for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral mills belonging to it.</p>
               <p>This eſtabliſhment belongs to the count of Laurvig. Without a fortune, and influence equal to his, ſuch a work could not have been ſet afloat; perſonal fortunes are not yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſupport ſuch undertakings; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the inhabitants of the town ſpeak of the ſize of his eſtate as an evil, becauſe it obſtructs commerce. The occupiers of ſmall forms are obliged to bring their wood to the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſea-ports, to be ſhipped; but he, wiſhing to increaſe the value of his, will not allow it to be thus gradually cut down; which turns the trade into another channel. Added to this; nature is againſt them, the bay being open and inſecure. I could not help ſmiling when I was informed that in a hard gale a veſſel had been wrecked in the main ſtreet. When there are ſuch a number of excellent harbours on the coaſt, it is a pity that accident has made one of the largeſt towns grow up in a bad one.</p>
               <p>The father of the preſent count was a diſtant relation of the family; he reſided conſtantly in Denmark; and his ſon follows his example. They have not been in poſſeſſion of the eſtate many years; and their predeceſſor lived near the town, introducing a degree of profligacy of manners which has been ruinous to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in every reſpect, their fortunes not being equal to the prevailing extravagance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="unknown:031653_0103_0fed8f1547897d38"/>What little I have ſeen of the manners of the people does not pleaſe me ſo well as thoſe of Tonſberg. I am forewarned that I ſhall find them ſtill more cunning and fraudulent as I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards the weſtward, in proportion as traffic takes place of agriculture; for their towns are built on naked rocks: the ſtreets are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bridges; and the inhabitants are all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring men, or owners of ſhips, who keep ſhops.</p>
               <p>The inn I was at in Laurvig, this journey, was not the ſame that I was at before. It is a good one; the people civil, and the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations decent. They ſeem to be better provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Sweden; but in juſtice I ought to add, that they charge more extravagantly. My bill at Tonſberg was alſo much higher than I had paid in Sweden, and much higher than it ought to have been where proviſions are to cheap. Indeed they ſeem to conſider foreigners as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers whom they ſhould never ſee again, and might fairly pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck. And the inhabitants of the weſtern coaſt, inſulated, as it were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> regard thoſe of the eaſt almoſt as ſtrangers. Each town in that quarter ſeems to be a great family, ſuſpicious of every other, allowing none to cheat them, but themſelves; and, right or wrong, they ſupport one another in the face of juſtice.</p>
               <p>On this journey I was fortunate enough to have one companion with more enlarged views than the generality of his countrymen, who ſpoke engliſh tolerably.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="unknown:031653_0104_0fed8f5bd8d325f8"/>I was informed that we might ſtill advance a mile and a quarter in our <hi>cabrioles;</hi> afterwards there was no choice, but of a ſingle horſe and wretched path, or a boat, the uſual mode of travelling.</p>
               <p>We therefore ſent our baggage forward in the boat, and followed rather ſlowly, for the road was rocky and ſandy. We paſſed, however, through ſeveral beech groves, which ſtill delighted me by the freſhneſs of their light green foliage, and the elegance of their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage, forming retreats to veil, without obſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſun.</p>
               <p>I was ſurpriſed, at approaching the water, to find a little cluſter of houſes pleaſantly ſituated, and an excellent inn. I could have wiſhed to have remained there all night; but as the wind was fair, and the evening fine, I was afraid to truſt to the wind, the uncertain wind of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow. We therefore left Helgeraac imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, with the declining ſun.</p>
               <p>Though we were in the open ſea, we ſailed more amongſt the rocks and iſlands than in my paſſage from Stromſtad; and they often formed very pictureſque combinations. Few of the high ridges were entirely bare; the ſeeds of ſome pines or ſirs had been wafted by the winds or waves, and they ſtood to brave the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Sitting then in a little boat on the ocean, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt ſtrangers, with ſorrow and care preſſing

hard on me,—buffeting me about from clime to clime,—I felt
<q>
                     <l>Like the loan ſhrub at random caſt,</l>
                     <l>That ſighs and trembles at each blaſt!</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>On ſome of the largeſt rocks there were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually groves, the retreat of foxes and hares which, I ſuppoſe, had tript over the ice during the winter, without thinking to regain the main land before the thaw.</p>
               <p>Several of the iſlands were inhabited by pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots; and the norwegian pilots are allowed to be the beſt in the world; perfectly acquainted with their coaſt, and ever at hand to obſerve the firſt ſignal or ſail. They pay a ſmall tax to the king, and to the regulating officer, and enjoy the fruit of their indefatigable induſtry.</p>
               <p>One of the iſlands, called Virgin Land, is flat, with ſome depth of earth, extending for half a norwegian mile, with three farms on it, tolerably well cultivated.</p>
               <p>On ſome of the bare rocks I ſaw ſtraggling houſes; they roſe above the denomination of huts inhabited by fiſhermen. My companions aſſured me that they were very comfortable dwellings, and that they have not only the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, but even what might be reckoned the ſuperfluities of life. It was too late for me to go on ſhore, if you will allow me to give that name to ſhiveing rocks, to aſcertain the fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:031653_0106_0fed902508d17628"/>But rain coming on, and the night growing dark, the pilot declared that it would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for us to attempt to go to the place of our deſtination, <hi>Eaſt Riiſoer,</hi> a norwegian mile and a half further; and we determined to ſtop for the night at a little haven; ſome half dozen houſes ſcattered under the curve of a rock. Though it became darker and darker, our pilot avoided the blind rocks with great dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.</p>
               <p>It was about ten o'clock when we arrived; and the old hoſteſs quickly prepared me a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable bed—a little too ſoft, or ſo; but I was weary; and opening the window to admit the ſweeteſt of breezes to fan me to ſleep, I ſunk into the moſt luxurious reſt: it was more than refreſhing. The hoſpitable ſprites of the grots ſurely hovered round my pillow; and if I woke, it was to liſten to the melodious whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering of the wind amongſt them, or to feel the mild breath of morn. Light ſlumbers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced dreams, where Paradiſe was before me. My little cherub was again hiding her face in my boſom. I heard her ſweet cooing beat on my heart from the cliffs, and ſaw her tiny footſteps on the ſands. New-born hopes ſeemed, like the rainbow, to appear in the clouds of ſorrow, faint, yet ſufficient to amuſe away de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>
               <p>Some refreſhing but heavy ſhowers have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and here I am writing quite alone —ſomething more than gay, for which I want a name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:031653_0107_0fed8f188a2e04a0"/>I could almoſt fancy myſelf in Nootka Sound or on ſome of the iſlands on the north weſt coaſt of America. We entered by a narrow paſs through the rocks, which from this abode appear more romantic than you can well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; and ſeal-ſkins, hanging at the door to dry, add to the illuſion.</p>
               <p>It is indeed a corner of the world; but you would be ſurpriſed to ſee the cleanlineſs and comfort of the dwelling. The ſhelves are not only ſhining with pewter and queen's ware, but ſome articles in ſilver, more ponderous, it it is true, than elegant. The linen is good, as well as white. All the females ſpin; and there is a loom in the kitchen. A ſort of individual taſte appeared in the arrangement of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, (this is not the place for imitation) and a kindneſs in their deſire to oblige—how ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the apiſh politeneſs of the towns! where the people, affecting to be well bred, fatigue with their endleſs ceremony.</p>
               <p>The miſtreſs is a widow; her daughter is married to a pilot, and has three cows. They have a little patch of land at about the diſtance of two engliſh miles, where they make hay for the winter, which they bring home in a boat. They live here very cheap, getting money from the veſſels which ſtreſs of weather, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſes, bring into their harbour, I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, by their furniture, that they ſmuggle a little. I can now credit the account of the other houſes, which I laſt night thougth exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:031653_0108_0fed8f5edeb8d288"/>I have been converſing with one of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions reſpecting the laws and regulations of Norway. He is a man with a great portion of common ſenſe, and heart,—yes, a warm heart. This is not the firſt time I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked heart without ſentiment: they are diſtinct. The former depends on the rectitude of the feelings, on truth of ſympathy: theſe characters have more tenderneſs than paſſion; the latter has a higher ſource; call it imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, genius, or what you will, it is ſomething very different. I have been laughing with theſe ſimple, worthy <hi>folk,</hi> to give you one of my half ſcore daniſh words, and letting as much of my heart flow out in ſympathy as they can take. Adieu! I muſt trip up the rocks. The rain is over. Let me catch pleaſure on the wing—I may be melancholy to-morrow. Now all my nerves keep time with the melody of nature. Ah! let me be happy whilſt I can. The tear ſtarts as I think of it. I muſt fly from thought, and find refuge from ſorrow in a ſtrong imagination— the only ſolace for a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart. Phantoms of bliſs! ideal forms of excellence! again incloſe me in your magic cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and wipe clear from my remembrance the diſappointments which render the ſympathy painful, which experience rather increaſes than damps; by giving the indulgence of feeling the ſanction of reaſon.</p>

               <p>I LEFT Portoer, the little haven I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſoon after I finiſhed my laſt letter. The ſea was rough; and I perceived that our pilot was right not to venture further during a hazy night. We had agreed to pay four dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars for a boat from Helgeraac. I mention the ſum, becauſe they would demand twice as much from a ſtranger. I was obliged to pay fifteen for the one I hired at Stromſtad. When we were ready to ſet out, our boatman offered to return a dollar, and let us go in one of the boats of the place, the pilot who lived there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better acquainted with the coaſt. He only demanded a dollar and a half, which was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. I ſound him a civil and rather intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent man: he was in the american ſervice ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years, during the revolution.</p>
               <p>I ſoon perceived that an experienced mariner was neceſſary to guide us; for we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually obliged to tack about, to avoid the rocks, which, ſcarcely reaching to the ſurface of the water, could only be diſcovered by the breaking of the waves over them.</p>
               <p>The view of this wild coaſt, as we failed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long it, afforded me a continual ſubject for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031653_0110_0fed8f6082725ba8"/>
I anticipated the future improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, and obſerved how much man had ſtill to do, to obtain of the earth all it could yield. I even earned my ſpeculations ſo far as to advance a million or two of years to the moment when the earth would perhaps be ſo perfectly cultivated, and ſo completely peopled, as to render it neceſſary to inhabit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſpot; yes; theſe bleak ſhores. Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion went ſtill farther, and pictured the ſtate of man when the earth could no longer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him. Where was he to fly to from uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal famine? Do not ſmile: I really became diſtreſſed for theſe fellow creatures, yet unborn.</p>
               <p>The images faſtened on me, and the world ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a vaſt priſon. I was ſoon to be in a ſmaller one—for no other name can I give to Ruſocr. It would be difficult to form an idea of the place, if you have never ſeen one of theſe rocky coaſts.</p>
               <p>We were a conſiderable time entering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the iſlands, before we ſaw about two hundred houſes crowded together, under a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high rock—ſtill higher appearing above. Talk not of baſtilles! To be born here, was to be baſtilled by nature—ſhut out from all that opens the underſtanding, or enlarges the heart. Huddled one behind another, not more than a quarter of the dwellings even had a proſpect of the ſea. A few planks formed paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages from houſe to houſe, which you muſt often ſcale, mounting ſteps like ladder, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:031653_0111_0fed8f23183a9360"/>The only road acroſs the rocks leads to a habitation, ſterile enough, you may ſuppoſe, when I tell you that the little earth on the adjacent ones was carried there by the late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant. A path, almoſt impracticable for a horſe, goes on to Arendall, ſtill further to the weſtward.</p>
               <p>I enquired for a walk, and mounting near two hundred ſteps made round a rock, walked up and down for about a hundred yards, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſea, to which I quickly deſcended by ſteps that cheated the declivity. The ocean, and theſe tremendous bulwarks, encloſed me on every ſide. I felt the confinement, and wiſhed for wings to reach ſtill loftier cliffs, whoſe ſlippery ſides no foot was to hardy as to tread; yet what was it to ſee?—only a boundleſs waſte of water—not a glimpſe of ſmiling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—not a patch of lively green to relieve the aching ſight, or vary the objects of meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>I felt my breath oppreſſed, though nothing could be clearer than the atmoſphere. Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering there alone, I found the ſolitude de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable; my mind was ſtored with ideas, which this new ſcene aſſociated with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing rapidity. But I ſhuddered at the thought of receiving exiſtence, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, in the ſolitude of ignorance, till forced to leave a world of which I had ſeen ſo little; for the character of the inhabitants is as uncultivated, if not as pictureſquely wild, as their abode.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="unknown:031653_0112_0fed8f6388f0e508"/>Having to employment but traffic, of which a contraband, trade makes the baſis of their profit, the coarſeſt feelings of honeſtly are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blunted. You may ſuppoſe that I ſpeak in general terms; and that, with all the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of nature and circumſtances, there are ſtill ſome reſpectable exceptions, the more praiſe worthy, as tricking is a very contagious mental diſeaſe that dries up all the generous juices of the heart. Nothing genial, in fact, appears around this place or within the circle of its rocks. And, now I recollect, it ſeems to me that the moſt genial and humane char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters I have met with in life, were moſt alive to the ſentiments inſpired by tranquil country ſcenes. What, indeed, is to humaniſe theſe beings, who reſt ſhut up, for they ſeldom even open their windows, ſmoaking, drinking bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and driving bargains? I have been almoſt ſtifled by theſe ſmoakers. They begin in the morning, and are rarely without their pipe till they go to bed. Nothing can be more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting than the rooms and men towards the evening: breath, teeth, clothes, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all are ſpoilt. It is well that the women are not very delicate, or they would only love their huſbands becauſe they were their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. Perhaps, you may add, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark need not be confined to ſo ſmall a part of the world; and, <hi>entre nous,</hi> I am of the ſame opinion. You muſt not term this inuendo ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for it does not come home.</p>
               <p>If I had not determined to write, I ſhould have found my confinement here, even for
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:031653_0113_0fed8f24b7eb8d40"/>
three or four days, tedious. I have no books; and to pace up and dawn a ſmall room, looking at tiles, overhung by rocks, ſoon becomes wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome. I cannot mount two hundred ſteps, to walk a hundred yards, many times in the day. Beſides, the rocks, retaining the heat of the ſun, are intolerably warm. I am never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs very well; for though there is a ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the character of theſe people, depraved by a ſorded love of money which repels me, ſtill the compariſons they force me to make keep my heart calm, by exerciſing my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Every where wealth commands too much reſpect; but here, almoſt excluſively; and it is the only object perſued—not through brake and briar, but over rocks and waves—yet of what uſe would riches be to me? I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aſked myſelf, were I confined to live in ſuch a ſpot. I could only relieve a few diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed objects, perhaps render them idle, and all the reſt of life would be a blank.</p>
               <p>My preſent journey has given freſh force to my opinion, that no place is ſo diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unimproving as a country town. I ſhould like to divide my time between the town and country; in a lone houſe, with the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of farming and planting, where my mind would gain ſtrength by ſolitary muſing; and in a metropolis to rub off the ruſt of thought, and poliſh the taſte which the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of nature had rendered juſt. Thus do we wiſh as we float down the ſtream of life,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:031653_0114_0fed8f696c6c7790"/>
whilſt chance does more to gratify a deſire of knowledge than our beſt-laid plans. A degree of exertion, produced by ſome want, more or leſs painful, is probably the price we muſt all pay for knowledge. How few authors or artiſts have arrived at eminence who have not lived by their employment?</p>
               <p>I was interrupted yeſterday by buſineſs, and was prevailed upon to dine with the engliſh vice-conſul. His houſe being open to the ſea, I was more at large; and the hoſpitality of the table pleaſed me, though the bottle was rather too freely puſhed about. Their manner of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining was ſuch as I have frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked when I have been thrown in the way of people without education, who have more money than wit, that is, than they know what to do with. The women were unaffected, but had not the natural grace which was often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous at Tonſberg. There was even a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difference in their dreſs; theſe having loaded themſelves with finery, in the ſtyle of the ſailors' girls of Hull or Portſmouth. Taſte has not yet taught them to make any but an oſtentations diſplay of wealth: yet I could perceive even here the firſt ſteps of the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I am perſuaded will make a very obvious progreſs in the courſe of half a centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and it ought not to be ſooner, to keep pace with the cultivation of the earth. Improving manners will introduce finer moral feelings. They begin to read tranſlations of ſome of the moſt uſeful german productions lately publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and one of our party ſung a ſong, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culing

the powers coaleſced againſt France, and the company drank confuſion to thoſe who had diſmembered Poland.</p>
               <p>The evening was extreamly calm and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. Not being able to walk, I requeſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a boat, as the only means of enjoying free air.</p>
               <p>The view of the town was now extremely fine. A huge rocky mountain ſtood up behind it; and a vaſt cliff ſtreached on each ſide, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſemicircle. In a receſs of the rocks was a clump of pines, amongſt which a ſteeple roſe pictureſquely beautiful.</p>
               <p>The church-yard is almoſt the only verdant ſpot in the place. Here, indeed, friendſhip extends beyond the grave; and, to grant a ſod of earth, is to accord a favour. I ſhould rather chuſe, did it admit of a choice, to ſleep in ſome of the caves of the rocks; for I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better reconciled to them ſince I climbed their craggy ſides, laſt night, liſtening to the fineſt echoes I ever heard. We had a french-horn with us; and there was an enchanting wildneſs in the dying away of the reverberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that quickly tranſported me to Shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare's magic iſland. Spirits unſeen ſeemed to walk abroad, and flit from cliff to cliff, to ſooth my ſoul to peace.</p>
               <p>I reluctantly returned to ſupper, to be ſhut up in a warm room, only to view the vaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the rocks extending on the ſlumbering waves. I ſtood at the window ſome time before
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:031653_0116_0fed8f6b0fc63928"/>
a buzz filled the drawing-room; and now and then the daſhing of a ſolitary oar rendered the ſcene ſtill more ſolemn.</p>
               <p>Before I came here, I could ſcarcely have imagined that a ſimple object, rocks, could have admited of ſo many intereſting combinations— always grand, and often ſublime.</p>

               <p>I LEFT Eaſt Ruſoer the day before ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday. The weather was very fine; but ſo calm that we loitered on the water near fourteen hours, only to make about ſix and twenty miles.</p>
               <p>It ſeemed to me a ſort of emancipation when we landed at Helgeraac. The confinement which every where ſtruck me whilſt ſojourning amongſt the rocks, made me hail the earth as a land of promiſe; and the ſituation ſhone with freſh luſtre from the contraſt—from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be a free abode. Here it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to travel by land—I never thought this a comfort before, and my eyes, fatigued by the ſparkling of the ſun on the water, now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly repoſed on the green expanſe, half perſuaded that ſuch verdant meads had never till then regaled them.</p>
               <p>I roſe early to purſue my journey to Tonſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg. The country ſtill wore a face of joy— and my ſoul was alive to its charms. Leaving the moſt lofty, and romantic of the cliffs behind us, we were almoſt continually deſcending to Tonſberg, through elyſian ſcenes: for not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſea, but mountains, rivers, lakes, and
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:031653_0118_0fed8f6cae5505e0"/>
groves, gave an almoſt endleſs variety to the proſpect. The cottagers were ſtill leading home the bay; and the cottages, on this road, looked very comfortable. Peace and plenty— I mean not abundance, ſeemed to reign around —ſtill I grew ſad as I drew near my old abode. I was ſorry to ſee the ſun ſo high; it was broad noon. Tonſberg was ſomething like a home— yet I was to enter without lighting-up pleaſure in any eye—I dreaded the ſolitarineſs of my apartment, and wiſhed for night to hide the ſtarting tears, or to ſhed them on my pillow, and cloſe my eyes on a world where I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined to wander alone. Why has nature ſo many charms for me—calling forth and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refined ſentiments, only to wound the breaſt that foſters them? How illuſive, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the moſt ſo, are the plans of happineſs founder on virtue and principle; what inlets of miſery do they not open in a half civilized ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety? The ſatiſfaction ariſing from conſcious rectitude, will not calm an injured heart, when tenderneſs is ever finding excuſes; and ſelf-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe is a cold ſolitary feeling, that cannot ſupply the place of diſappointed affection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out throwing a gloom over every proſpect, which, baniſhing pleaſure, does not exclude pain. I reaſoned and reaſoned; but my heart was two full to allow me to remain in the houſe, and I walked, till I was wearied out, to purchaſe reſt—or rather forgetfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Employment has beguiled this day, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow I ſet out for Moſs, in my way to Stromſtad. At Gothenburg I ſhall embrace my
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:031653_0119_0fed9038b4351cc0"/>
                  <hi>Fannikin:</hi> probably ſhe will not know me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain— and I ſhall be hurt if ſhe do not. How childiſh is this! ſtill it is a natural feeling. I would not permit myſelf to indulge the "thick coming fears" of fondneſs, whilſt I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by buſineſs.—Yet I never ſaw a calf bounding in a meadow, that did not remind me of my little frolicker. A calf, you ſay. Yes; but a <hi>capital</hi> one, I own.</p>
               <p>I cannot write compoſedly—I am every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſinking into reveries—my heart flutters, I know not why. Fool! It is time thou wert at reſt.</p>
               <p>Friendſhip and domeſtic happineſs are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually praiſed; yet how little is there of either in the world, becauſe it requires more cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind to keep awake affection, even in our own hearts, than the common run of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſuppoſe. Beſides, few like to be ſeen as they really are; and a degree of ſimplicity, and of undiſguiſed confidence, which, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted obſervers, would almoſt border on weakneſs, is the charm, nay the eſſence of love or friendſhip: all the bewitching graces of childhood again appearing. As objects merely to exerciſe my taſte, I therefore like to ſee people together who have an affeſtion for each other; every turn of their features touches me, and remains pictured on my imagination in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible characters. The zeſt of novelty is, however, neceſſary to rouſe the languid ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies which have been hacknied in the world; as is the factitious behaviour, falſely termed good-breeding, to amuſe thoſe, who, defective
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:031653_0120_0fed8f6fb8277d00"/>
in taſte, continually rely for pleaſure on their animal ſpirits. which not being maintained by the imagination, are unavoidably ſooner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted than the ſentiments of the heart. Friendſhip is in general ſincere at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement, and laſts whilſt there is any thing to ſupport it; but as a mixture of novelty and vanity is the uſual prop, no wonder if it fall with the ſlender ſtay. The fop in the play, payed a greater compliment than he was aware of, when he ſaid to a perſon, whom he meant to flatter, <q>I like you almoſt as well as a <hi>new acquaintance.</hi>
                  </q> Why am I talking of friendſhip, after which I have had ſuch a wild-gooſe chace.—I thought only of telling you that the crows, as well as wild-geeſe, are here birds of paſſage.</p>

               <p>I LEFT Tonſberg yeſterday, the 22d of Auguſt. It is only twelve or thirteen en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh miles to Moſs through a country, leſs wild than any tract I had hitherto paſſed over in Norway. It was often beautiful; but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom afforded thoſe grand views, which fill, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſooth the mind.</p>
               <p>We glided along the meadows, and through the woods, with ſun-beams playing around us; and though no caſtles adorned the proſpects, a greater number of comfortable farms met my eyes, during this ride, than I have ever ſeen, in the ſame ſpace, even in the moſt cultivated part of England. And the very appearance of the cottages of the labourers, ſprinkled amidſt them, excluded all thoſe gloomy ideas inſpired by the contemplation of poverty.</p>
               <p>The hay was ſtill bringing in; for one har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt in Norway, treads on the heels of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The woods were more variegated; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed with ſhrubs. We no longer paſſed through foreſts of vaſt pines, ſtretching along with ſavage magnificence. Foreſts that only exhibited the ſlow decay of time, or the devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation produced by warring elements. No;
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:031653_0122_0fed9032d248f438"/>
oaks, aſhes, beech; and all the light and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tenants of our woods here ſported luxuriant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I had not obſerved many oaks before; for the greater part of the oak planks, I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, come from the weſtward.</p>
               <p>In France the farmers generally live in vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, which is a great diſadvantage to the country; but the norwegian farmers, always owning their farms, or being tenants for life, reſide in the midſt of them; allowing ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers a dwelling, rent free, who have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle land appertaining to the cottage, not only for a garden, but for crops of different kinds, ſuch as rye, oats, buck-wheat, hemp, flax, beans, potatoes, and hay, which are ſown in ſtrips about it; reminding a ſtranger of the firſt attempts at culture, when every family was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to be an independent community.</p>
               <p>Theſe cottagers work at a certain price, ten-pence per day, for the farmers on whoſe ground they live; and they have ſpare time enough to cultivate their own land; and lay in a ſtore of fiſh for the winter. The wives and daughters ſpin; and the huſbands and ſons weave: ſo that they may fairly be reckoned independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; having alſo a little money in hand to buy coffee, brandy, and ſome other ſuperfluities.</p>
               <p>The only thing I diſliked was the military ſervice, which trammels them more than I at firſt imagined. It is true that the militia is only called out once a year—yet, in caſe of war, they have no alternative, but muſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:031653_0123_0fed8f310ee7faa0"/>
their families. Even the manufacturers are not exempted, though the miners are, in order to encourage undertakings which require a capital at the commencement. And what appears more tyrannical, the inhabitants of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſtricts are appointed for the land, others for the ſea ſervice. Conſequently, a peaſant, born a ſoldier, is not permitted to follow his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, ſhould it lead him to go to ſea: a natural deſire near ſo many ſea ports.</p>
               <p>In theſe regulations the arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the king of Denmark being the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute monarch in Europe, appears, which in other reſpects, ſeeks to hide itſelf in a lenity that almoſt renders the laws nullities. If any alteration of old cuſtoms is thought of, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the whole country is required, and maturely conſidered. I have ſeveral times had occaſion to obſerve, that fearing to appear ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, laws, are allowed to become obſolete, which ought to be put in force, or better ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in their ſtead; for this miſtaken mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which borders on timidity, favours the leaſt reſpectable part of the people.</p>
               <p>I ſaw on my way not only good parſonage houſes, but comfortable dwellings, with glebe land for the clerk: always a conſequential man in every country: a being proud of a little ſmattering of learning, to uſe the appropriate epithet, and vain of the ſtiff good-breeding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected from the vicar; though the ſervility practiſed in his company gives it a peculiar caſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="unknown:031653_0124_0fed8f7596d33360"/>The widow of the clergymen is allowed to receive the benefit of the living for a twelve-month, after the death of the incumbent.</p>
               <p>Arriving at the ferry, the paſſage over to Moſs is about ſix or eight engliſh miles; I ſaw the moſt level ſhore I had yet ſeen in Norway. The appearance of the circumjacent country had been preparing me for the change of ſcene, which was to greet me, when I reached the coaſt. For the grand features of nature had been dwindling into prettineſs as I advanced; yet the rocks, on a ſmaller ſcale, were finely wooded to the water's edge. Little art appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet ſublimity every where gave place to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legance. The road had often aſſumed the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a graveled one, made in pleaſure grounds, whilſt the trees excited only an idea of embelliſhment. Meadows, like lawns, in an endleſs variety, diſplayed the careleſs graces of nature; and the ripening corn gave a rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the landſcape, analogous with the other objects.</p>
               <p>Never was a ſouthern ſky more beautiful, nor more ſoft its gales. Indeed, I am led to conclude, that the ſweeteſt ſummer in the world, is the northern one. The vegetation being quick and luxuriant, the moment the earth is looſened from its icy fetters, and the bound ſtreams regain their wonted activity. The balance of happineſs, with reſpect to cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, may be more equal than I at firſt imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the inhabitants deſcribe with warmth the pleaſures of a winter, at the thoughts of
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:031653_0125_0fed8f32ada7e590"/>
which I ſhudder. Not only their parties of pleaſure but of buſineſs are reſerved for this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when they travel with aſtoniſhing rapidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the moſt direct way, ſkimming over hedge and ditch.</p>
               <p>On entering Moſs I was ſtruck by the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which ſeemed to reſult from induſtry. The richeſt of the inhabitants keep ſhops, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling in their manners, and even the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of their houſes, the trades-people of Yorkſhire; with an air of more independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or rather conſequence, from feeling themſelves the firſt people in the place. I had not time to ſee the iron works, belonging to Mr. Anker, of Chriſtiania, a man of fortune and enterpriſe, and I was not very anxious to ſee them, after having viewed thoſe at Laur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vig.</p>
               <p>Here I met with an intelligent literary man, who was anxious to gather information from me, relative to the paſt and preſent ſituation of France. The newſpapers printed at Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, as well as thoſe in England, give the moſt exaggerated accounts of their atrocities and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes; but the former without any apparent comments or inferences. Still the norwegians, though more connected with the engliſh, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their language, and copying their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, wiſh well to the republican cauſe, and follow, with the moſt lively intereſt, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the french arms. So determined were they, in fact, to excuſe every thing, diſgrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtruggle of freedom, by admiting the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:031653_0126_0fed8f7736a545e8"/>
tyrant's plea neceſſity, that I could hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them that Robeſpierre was a monſter.</p>
               <p>The diſcuſſion of this ſubject is not ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as in England, being confined to the few, the clergy and phyſician, with a ſmall portion of people who have a literary turn and leiſure: the greater part of the inhabitants, having a variety of occupations, being owners of ſhips, ſhopkeepers and farmers, have employment enough at home. And their ambition to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich may tend to cultivate the common ſenſe, which characterizes and narrows both their hearts and views; confining the former to their families, taking the <hi>handmaids</hi> of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the circle of pleaſure, if not of intereſt; and the latter to the inſpection of their workmen, including the noble ſcience of bargain-making —that is getting every thing at the cheapeſt, and ſelling it at the deareſt rate. I am now more than ever convinced, that it is an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with men of ſcience and artiſts, which not only diffuſes taſte, but gives that freedom to the underſtanding, without which I have ſeldom met with much benevolence of character, on a large ſcale.</p>
               <p>Beſides though you do not hear of much pilfering and ſtealing in Norway, yet they will, with a quiet conſcience, buy things at a price which muſt convince them they were ſtolen. I had an opportunity of knowing that two or three reputable people had purchaſed ſome articles of vagrants, who were detected. How much of the virtue, which appears in the world,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:031653_0127_0fed8f38c366ae88"/>
is put on for the world! And how little dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſelf reſpect—ſo little, that I am ready to repeat the old queſtion—and aſk, where is truth or rather principle to be found? Theſe are, perhaps, the vapourings of a heart ill at eaſe—the effuſions of a ſenſibility wounded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to madneſs. But enough of this—we will diſcuſs the ſubject in another ſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence—where truth and juſtice will reign. How cruel are the injuries which make us quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with human nature!—At preſent black me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy hovers round my footſteps; and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſheds a mildew over all the future proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, which hope no longer gilds.</p>
               <p>A rainy morning prevented my enjoying the pleaſure the view of a pictureſque coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would have afforded me; for though this road paſſed through a country, a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of which was under cultivation, than I had uſually ſeen here, it nevertheleſs retained all the wild charms of Norway. Rocks ſtill encloſed the valleys, whoſe grey ſides enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened their verdure. Lakes appeared like branches of the ſea, and branches of the ſea aſſumed the appearance of tranquil lakes; whilſt ſtreamlets prattled amongſt the pebbles, and the broken maſs of ſtone which had rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into them; giving fantaſtic turns to the trees whoſe roots they bared.</p>
               <p>It is not, in fact, ſupriſing that the pine ſhould be often undermined, if ſhoots its fibres in ſuch an horizontal direction, merely on the ſurface of the earth, requiring only enough to
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:031653_0128_0fed8f78d8af7540"/>
cover thoſe that cling to the craggs. Nothing proves to me, ſo clearly, that it is the air which principally nouriſhes trees and plants, as the flouriſhing appearance of theſe pines.— The firs demanding a deeper ſoil, are ſeldom ſeen in equal health, or ſo numerous on the barren cliffs. They take ſhelter in the crevices, or where, after ſome revolving ages, the pines have prepared them a footing.</p>
               <p>Approaching, or rather deſcending, to Chriſtiania, though the weather continued a little cloudy, my eyes were charmed with the view of an extenſive undulated valley, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out under the ſhelter of a noble amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of pine-covered mountains. Farm houſes ſcattered about animated, nay, graced a ſcene which ſtill retained ſo much of its native wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the art which appeared, ſeemed ſo neceſſary it was ſcarcely perceived. Cattle were grazing in the ſhaven meadows; and the lively green, on their ſwelling ſides, contraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ripening corn and rye. The corn that grew on the ſlopes, had not, indeed, the laughing luxuriance of plenty, which I have ſeen in more genial climes. A freſh breeze ſwept acroſs the grain, parting its ſlender ſtalks; but the wheat did not wave its head with its wonted, careleſs dignity, as if nature had crowned it the king of plants.</p>
               <p>The view, immediately on the left, as we drove down the mountain, was almoſt ſpoilt by the depredations committed on the rocks to make alum. I do not know the proceſs.—I
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:031653_0129_0fed902fc7cf8eb8"/>
only ſaw that the rocks looked red after they had been burnt; and regretted that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould leave a quantity of rubbiſh, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce an image of human induſtry in the ſhape of deſtruction. The ſituation of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiania is certainly uncommonly fine; and I never ſaw a bay that ſo forcibly gave me an idea of a place of ſafety from the ſtorms of the ocean—all the ſorrounding objects were beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and even grand. But neither the rocky mountains, nor the woods that graced them, could be compared with the ſublime proſpects I had ſeen towards the weſtward; and as for the hills, "capped with <hi>eternal</hi> ſnow," Mr. Coxe's deſcription led me to look for them; but they had flown; for I looked vainly around for this noble back-ground,</p>
               <p>A few months ago the people of Chriſtiania roſe, exaſperated by the ſcarcity, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent high price of grain. The immediate cauſe was the ſhipping of ſome, ſaid to be for Moſs; but which they ſuſpected was only a pretext to ſend it out of the country: and I am not ſure that they were wrong in their conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—Such are the tricks of trade! They threw ſtones at Mr. Anker, the owner of it, as he rode out of town to eſcape from their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; they aſſembled about his houſe. And the people demanded afterwards, with ſo much impetuoſity, the liberty of thoſe who were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in conſequence of the tumult, that the Grand Bailiff thought it prudent to releaſe them without further altercation.</p>

                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:031653_0130_0fed8f7a768876e8"/>You may think me too ſevere on commerce; but from the manner it is at preſent carried on, little can be advanced in favour of a purſuit that wears out the moſt ſacred principles of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and rectitude. What is ſpeculation, but a ſpecies of gambling, I might have ſaid fraud, in which addreſs generally gains the prize? I was led into theſe reflections when I heard of ſome tricks practiſed by merchants, miſ-called reputable, and certainly men of property, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent war, in which common honeſty was violated: damaged goods, and proviſions, having been ſhipped for the expreſs purpoſe of falling into the hands of the engliſh, who had pledged themſelves to reimbuſe neutral nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the cargoes they ſeized: cannon, alſo ſent back as unfit for ſervice, have been ſhipped as <hi>a good ſpeculation</hi>; the captain receiving or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to cruize about till he fell in with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh frigate. Many individuals, I believe, have ſuffered by the ſeizures of their veſſels; ſtill I am perſuaded that the engliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been very much impoſed upon in the charges made by merchants, who contrived to get their ſhips taken. This cenſure is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the danes. Adieu! For the preſent, I muſt take advantage of a moment of fine wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to walk out and ſee the town.</p>
               <p>At Chriſtiania I met with that polite recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which rather characteriſes the progreſs of manners in the world, than of any particular portion of it. The firſt evening of my arrival I ſupped with ſome of the moſt faſhionable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the place; and almoſt imagined myſelf
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031653_0131_0fed8f3a61b155f0"/>
in a circle of engliſh ladies, ſo much did they reſemble them in manners, dreſs, and even in beauty; for the faireſt of my country women would not have been ſorry to rank with the Grand Bailiff's lady. There were ſeveral pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty girls preſent, but ſhe outſhone them all; and what intereſted me ſtill more, I could not avoid obſerving that in acquiring the eaſy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs which diſtinguiſhes people of quality, ſhe had preſerved her norwegian ſimplicity. There was, in fact, a graceful timidity in her addreſs, inexpreſſibly charming. This ſurpriſed me a little, becauſe her huſband was quite a frenchman of the <hi>ancien regime,</hi> or rather a courtier, the ſame kind of animal in every country.</p>
               <p>Here I ſaw the cloven foot of deſpotiſm. I boaſted, to you, that they had no viceroy in Norway; but theſe grand bailiffs, particularly the ſuperior one, who reſides at Chriſtiania, are political monſters of the ſame ſpecies. Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſycophants are provided for by their relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and connexions at Copenhagen, as at other courts. And though the norwegians are not in the abject ſtate of the iriſh, yet this ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand government is ſtill felt by their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of ſeveral natural advantages to benefit the domineering ſtate.</p>
               <p>The grand bailiffs are moſtly noblemen from Copenhagen, who act as men of common minds will always act in ſuch ſituations—ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a degree of courtly parade which claſhes with the independent character of a magiſtrate.
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:031653_0132_0fed8f81d27f6d88"/>
Beſides, they have a degree of power over the country judges, which ſome of them who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a juriſdiction truly patriarchal, moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully feel. I can ſcarcely ſay why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my friend, but in this city, thoughtfulneſs ſeemed to be ſliding into melancholy, or rather dullneſs.— The fire of fancy, which had been kept alive in the country, was almoſt extinguiſhed by reflections on the ills that haraſs ſuch a large portion of mankind.—I felt like a bird flutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ground unable to mount; yet unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to crawl tranquilly like a reptile, whilſt ſtill conſcious it had wings.</p>
               <p>I walked out, for the open air is always my remedy when an aching-head proceeds from an oppreſſed heart. Chance directed my ſteps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the fortreſs, and the ſight of the ſlaves, working with chains on their legs, only ſerved to embitter me ſtill more againſt the regulations of ſociety, which treated knives in ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent mannar, eſpecially as there was a degree of energy in ſome of their countenances which unavoidably excited my attention, and almoſt created reſpect.</p>
               <p>I wiſhed to have ſeen, through an iron grate, the face of a man who has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined ſix years, for having induced the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to revolt againſt ſome impoſitions of the government. I could not obtain a clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the affair; yet, as the complaint was againſt ſome farmers of taxes, I am inclined to beleive, that it was not totally without founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He muſt have poſſeſſed ſome eloquence,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:031653_0133_0fed8f3c02a951f8"/>
or have had truth on his ſide; for the farmers roſe by hundreds to ſupport him, and were very much exaſperated at his impriſonment; which will probably laſt for life, though he has ſent ſeveral very ſpirited remonſtrances to the upper court, which makes the judges ſo averſe to giving a ſentence which may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The greater number of the ſlaves. I ſaw here, were not confined for life. Their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not hard; and they work in the open air, which prevents their conſtitutions from ſuffering by impriſonment. Still as they are allowed to aſſociate together, and boaſt of their dexterity, not only to each other but to the ſoldiers around then, in the garriſon, they commonly, it is natural to conclude, go out more confirmed, and more expert knaves than when they entered.</p>
               <p>It is not neceſſary to trace the origin of the aſſociation of ideas, which led me to think that the ſtars and gold keys, which ſurrounded me the evening before, diſgraced the wearers, ſo much as the fetters I was viewing—perhaps more. I even began to inveſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gate the reaſon which led me to ſuſpect that the former produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the latter.</p>
               <p>The norwegians are extravagantly fond of courtly diſtinction, and of titles, though they
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:031653_0134_0fed8f836f27fdb0"/>
have no immunities annexed to them, and are eaſily purchaſed. The proprietors of mines have many privileges: they are almoſt exempt from taxes, and the peaſantry born on their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, as well as thoſe on the count's, are not born ſoldiers or ſailors.</p>
               <p>One diſtinction, or rather trophy of nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which might have occured to the Hotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots, amuſed me; it was a bunch of hog's briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles placed on the horſes' heads; ſurmounting that part of the harneſs to which a round piece of braſs often dangles, fatiguing the eye with its idle motion.</p>
               <p>From the fortreſs I returned to my lodging, and quickly was taken out of town to be ſhewn a pretty villa, and engliſh garden. To a nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegian both might have been objects of curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of uſe, by exciting to the compariſon which leads to improvement. But whilſt I gazed, I was employed in reſtoring the place to nature, or taſte, by giving it the character of the ſurrounding ſcene. Serpentine walks, and flowering ſhrubs, looked trifling in a grand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the rocks, ſhaded by towering pines. Groves of leſſer trees might have been ſheltered under them, which would have melted into the landſcape, diſplaying only the art which ought to point out the vicinity of a human abode, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſome elegance. But few people have ſufficient taſte to diſcern, that the art of embelliſhing, conſiſts in intereſting, not in aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:031653_0135_0fed8f3da14bb268"/>Chriſtiania is certainly very pleaſantly ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; and the environs I paſſed through, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this ride, afforded many fine, and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated proſpects; but, excepting the firſt view approaching to it, rarely preſent any combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of objects ſo ſtrikingly new, or pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque, as to command remembrance.</p>

               <head>LETTER XIV.</head>
               <p>CHRISTIANIA is a clean, neat city; but it has none of the graces of architecture, which ought to keep pace with the refining manners of a people— or the outſide of the houſe will diſgrace the inſide; giving the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder an idea of overgrown wealth devoid of taſte. Large ſquare wooden houſes offend the eye, diſplaying more than gothic barbariſm. Huge gothic piles, indeed, exhibit a character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic ſublimity, and a wildneſs of fancy peculiar to the period when they were erected; but ſize, without grandeur or elegance, has an emphatical ſtamp of meanneſs, of poverty of conception, which only a commercial ſpirit could give.</p>
               <p>The ſame thought has ſtruck me, when I have entered the meeting-houſe of my reſpected friend, Dr. Price. I am ſurpriſed that the diſſenters, who have not laid aſide all the pomps and vanities of life, ſhould imagine a noble pillar, or arch, unhallowed. Whilſt men have ſenſes, whatever ſooths them lends wings to devotion; elſe why do the beauties of nature, where all that charm them are ſpread around with a laviſh hand, force even the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing heart to acknowledge that exiſtence is
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:031653_0137_0fed8f44e2a37268"/>
a bleſſing; and this acknowledgement is the moſt ſublime homage we can pay to the Deity.</p>
               <p>The argument of convenience is abſurd. Who would labour for wealth, if it were to procure nothing but conveniences? If we wiſh to render mankind moral from principle, we muſt, I am perſuaded, give a greater ſcope to the enjoyments of the ſenſes, by blending taſte with them. This has frequently occurred to me ſince I have been in the north, and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that their ſanguine characters always take refuge in drunkenneſs after the fire of youth is ſpent.</p>
               <p>But I have flown from Norway, to go back to the wooden houſes. Farms conſtructed with logs, and even little villages, here erected in the ſame ſimple manner, have appeared to me very pictureſque. In the more remote parts I had been particularly pleaſed with many cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſituated cloſe to a brook, or bordering on a lake, with the whole farm contiguous. As the family increaſes, a little more land is cultivated: thus the country obviouſly enriched by popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Formerly the farmers might more juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been termed wood-cutters. But now they find it neceſſary to ſpare the woods a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and this change will be univerſally benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial; for whilſt they lived entirely by ſelling the trees they felled, they did not pay ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient attention to huſbandry; conſequently, advanced very ſlowly in agricultural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Neceſſity will in future more and more ſpur them on; for the ground, cleared of
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:031653_0138_0fed34a5348f0c30"/>
wood, muſt be cultivated, or the farm loſes its value: there is no waiting for food till another generation of pines be grown to maturity.</p>
               <p>The people of property are very careful of their timber; and, rambling through a foreſt near Tonſberg, belonging to the count, I have ſtopt to admire the appearance of ſome of the cottages inhabited by a woodman's family—a man employed to cut down the wood neceſſary for the houſhold and the eſtate. A little lawn was cleared, on which ſeveral lofty trees were left which nature had grouped, whilſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circling firs ſported with wild grace. The dwelling was ſheltered by the foreſt, noble pines ſpreading their branches over the roof; and before the door a cow, goat, nag, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d children, ſeemed equally content with their lot; and if contentment be all we can attain, it is, perhaps, beſt ſecured by ignorance.</p>
               <p>As I have been moſt delighted with the country parts of Norway, I was ſorry to leave Chriſtiania, without going further to the north, though the advancing ſeaſon admoniſhed me to depart, as well as the calls of buſineſs and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>June and July are the months to make a tour through Norway; for then the evenings and nights are the fineſt I have ever ſeen; but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the middle, or latter end of Auguſt, the clouds begin to gather, and ſummer diſappears almoſt before it has ripened the fruit of autumn —even, as it were, ſlips from your embraces,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:031653_0139_0fed8f46855451a0"/>
whilſt the ſatiſfied ſenſes ſeem to reſt in enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</p>
               <p>Yon will aſk, perhaps, why I wiſhed to go further northward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Why? not only becauſe the country, from all I can gather, is moſt ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic, abounding in foreſts and lakes, and the air pure, but I have heard m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A man, who has been detected in any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt act, can no longer live among them. He is univerſally ſhunned, and ſhame becomes the ſevereſt puniſhment. Such a contempt have they, in fact, for every ſpecies of fraud, that they, will not allow the people on the weſtern coaſt to be their countrymen; ſo much do they deſpiſe the arts for which thoſe traders who live on the rocks are notorious.</p>

               <p>A law in Norway, termed the <hi>odels right,</hi> has lately been modified, and probably will be aboliſhed as an impediment to commerce. The heir of an eſtate had the power of repurchaſing it at the original purchaſe money, making al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for ſuch improvements as were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, during the ſpace of twenty years. At preſent ten is the term allowed for after thought; and when the regulation was made, all the men of abilities were invited to give their opinion whether it were better to abrogate or modify it. It is certainly a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and ſafe way of mortgaging land; yet the moſt rational men, whom I converſed with on the ſubject, ſeemed convinced that the right was more injurious than beneficial to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; ſtill if it contribute to keep the farms in the farmers own hands, I ſhould be ſorry to hear that it were aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>The arictocracy in Norway, if we keep clear of Chriſtiania, is far from being formidable; and it will require a long time to enable the merchants to attain a ſufficient monied intereſt to induce them to reinforce the upper claſs, at the expence of the yeomanry, with whom they are uſually connected.</p>
               <p>England and America owe their liberty to commerce, which created a new ſpecies of power to undermine the feudal ſyſtem. But

               <p>I LEFT Chriſtiania yeſterday. The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not very fine; and having been a little delayed on the road, I found that it was too late to go round, a couple of miles, to ſee the caſcade near Fredericſtadt, which I had determined to viſit.

               <p>The road along the river is very romantic, though the views are not very grand; and the riches of Norway, its timber, floats ſilently down the ſtream, often impeded in its courſe by iſlands and little cataracts, the offspring, as it were, of the great one I had frequently heard deſcribed.</p>
               <p>I found an excellent inn at Fredericſtadt, and was gratified by the kind attention of the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, who, perceiving that my clothes were wet, took great pains to procure me, as a ſtranger, every co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>How I am altered by diſappointment!— When going to Liſbon, the elaſticity of my mind was ſufficient to ward of wearineſs, and my imagination ſtill could dip her bruſh in the rainbow of fancy, and ſketch futurity in glowing colours. Now—but let me talk of ſomething elſe—will you go with me to the caſcade?</p>
               <p>The croſs road to it was rugged and dreary; and though a conſiderable extent of land was cultivated on all ſides, yet the rocks were entirely bare, which ſurpriſed me, as they were more on a level with the ſurface than any I had yet ſeen. On enquiry, however, I learnt that ſome years ſince a foreſt had been burnt. This appearance of deſolation was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure gloomy, inſpiring emotions that ſterility had never produced. Fires of this kind are occaſioned by the wind ſuddenly riſing when the farmers are burning roots of trees, ſtalks of beans, &amp;c. with which they manure
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:031653_0144_0fed8f8f9c4941b8"/>
the ground. The devaſtation muſt, indeed, be terrible, when this, literally ſpeaking, wild fire, runs along the foreſt, flying from top to top, and crackling amongſt the branches. The ſoil, as well as the trees, is ſwept away by the deſtructive torrent; and the country, deſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of beauty and riches, is left to mourn for ages.</p>
               <p>Admiring, as I do, theſe noble foreſts, which ſeem to bid defiance to time, I looked with pain on the ridge of rocks that ſtretched far beyond my eye, formerly crowned with the moſt beautiful verdure.</p>
               <p>I have often mentioned the grandeur, but I feel myſelf unequal to the taſk of conveying an idea of the beauty and elegance of the ſcene when the ſpiral tops of the pines are loaded with ripening ſeed, and the ſun gives a glow to their light green tinge, which is changing into purple, one tree more or leſs advanced, contraſting with another. The profuſion with which nature has decked them, with pendant honours, prevents all ſurpriſe at ſeeing, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very crevice, ſome ſapling ſtruggling for exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Vaſt maſſes of ſtone are thus encircled; and roots, torn up by the ſtorms, become a ſhelter for a young generation. The pine and fir woods, left entirely to nature, diſplay an endleſs variety; and the paths in the wood are not entangled with fallen leaves, which are only intereſting whilſt they are fluttering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween life and death. The grey cobweb-like appearance of the aged pines, is a much finer
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:031653_0145_0fed8f4fb1ea5db8"/>
image of decay; the fibres whitening as they loſe their moiſture, impriſoned life ſeems to be ſtealing away. I cannot tell why—but death, under every form, appears to me like ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing getting free—to expand in I know not what element; nay I feel that this conſcious being muſt be as unfettered, have the wings of thought, before it can be happy.</p>
               <p>Reaching the caſcade, or rather cataract, the roaring of which had a long time announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced its vicinity, my ſoul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous daſhing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and I aſked myſelf why I was chained to life and its miſery? Still the tumultuous emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this ſublime object excited, were pleaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and, viewing it, my ſoul roſe, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed dignity, above its cares—graſping at immortality—it ſeemed as impoſſible to ſtop the current of my thoughts, as of the always vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtill the ſame, torrent before me—I ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark ſpeak of life to come.</p>
               <p>We turned with regret from the caſcade. On a little hill, which commands the beſt view of it, ſeveral obeliſks are erected to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate the viſits of different kings. The appearance of the river above and below the falls is very pictureſque, the ruggedneſs of the ſcenery diſappearing as the torrent ſubſides
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:031653_0146_0fed8f9140258190"/>
into a peaceful ſtream. But I did not like to ſee a number of ſaw-mills crowded together cloſe to the cataracts; they deſtroyed the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the proſpect.</p>
               <p>The ſight of a bridge erected acroſs a deep valley, at a little diſtance, inſpired very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilar ſenſations. It was almoſt ingeniouſly ſupported by maſt-like trunks, juſt ſtript of their branches; and logs, placed one acroſs the other, produced an appearance equally light and firm, ſeeming almoſt to be built in the air when we were below it; the height taking from the magnitude of the ſupporting trees give them a ſlender, graceful look.</p>
               <p>There are two noble eſtates in this neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, the proprietors of which ſeem to have caught more than their portion of the enterpriſing ſpirit that is gone abroad. Many agricultural experiments have been made; an the country appears better encloſed and cultivated; yet the cottages had not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable aſpect of thoſe I had obſerved near Moſs, and to the weſtward. Man is always debaſed by ſervitude, of any deſcription; and here the peaſantry are not entirely free.</p>

               <p>I SET out from Fredericſtadt about three o'clock in the afternoon, and expected to reach Stromſtad before the night cloſed in; but the wind dying away, the weather became ſo calm, that we ſcarcely made any perceptible advances towards the oppoſite coaſt, though the men were fatigued with rowing.</p>
               <p>Getting amongſt the rocks and iſlands as the moon roſe, and the ſtars darted forward out of the clear expanſe. I forgot that the night ſtole on, whilſt indulging affectionate reveries, the poetical fictions of ſenſibility: I was not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, aware of the length of time we had been toiling to reach Stromſtadt. And when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to look around, I did not perceive any thing to indicate that we were in its neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. So far from it, that when I inquired of the pilot, who ſpoke a little engliſh, I found that he was only accuſtomed to coaſt along the norwegian ſhore; and had been, only once, acroſs to Stromſtad. But he had brought with him a fellow better acquainted, he aſſured me, with the rocks by which they were to ſteer our courſe; for he had not a compaſs on board; yet, as he was half a fool, I had little confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his ſkill There was then great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031653_0149_0fed8f98c12af340"/>
to fear that we had loſt our way, and were ſtraying amidſt a labyrinth of rocks, without a clue.</p>
               <p>This was ſomething like an adventurer; but not of the moſt agreaable caſt; beſides, I was impatient to arrive at Stromſtad, to be able to ſend forward, that night, a boy to order hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on the road to be ready; for I was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to remain there a day, without having any thing to detain me from my little girl; and from the letters which I was impatient to get from you.</p>
               <p>I began to expoſtulate, and even to ſcold the pilot, for not having informed me of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, previous to my departure. This made him row with more force; and we turned round one rock only to ſee another, equally deſtitute of the tokens we were in ſearch of to tell us where we were. Entering alſo into creek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter creek, which promiſed to be the entrance of the bay we were ſeeking, we advanced mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to find ourſelves running aground.</p>
               <p>The ſolitarineſs of the ſcene, as we glided under the dark ſhadows of the rocks, pleaſed me for a while; but the fear of paſſing the whole night thus wandering to and fro, and loſing the next day, rouſed me. I begged the pilot to return to one of the largeſt iſlands, at the ſide of which we had ſeen a boat moored. As we drew nearer, a light through a window on the ſummit, became our beacon; but we were farther off than I ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="unknown:031653_0150_0fed8fe50fa83978"/>With ſome difficulty the pilot got on ſhore, not diſtinguiſhing the landing place; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the boat, knowing that all the relief we could expect, was a man to direct us. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waiting ſome time, for there is an inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the very movements of theſe people,<note n="*" place="bottom">It is very poſſible that he ſtaid to ſmoke a pipe, though I was waiting in the cold.</note> that would weary more than ordinary patience, he brought with him a man, who aſſiſting them to row, we landed at Stromſtad a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one in the morning.</p>
               <p>It was too late to ſend off a boy; but I did not go to bed before I had made the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments neceſſary to enable me to ſet out as early as poſſible.</p>
               <p>The ſun roſe with ſplendor. My mind was too active to allow me to loiter long in bed, though the horſes did not arrive till between ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and eight. However, as I wiſhed to let the boy, who went forward to order the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, get conſiderably the ſtart of me, I briddled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my impatience.</p>
               <p>This precaution was unavailing, for after the three firſt poſts, I had to wait two hours, whilſt the people at the poſt-houſe went, fair and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the farm, to bid them bring up the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which were carrying in the firſt fruits of the harveſt. I diſcovered here that theſe ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh peaſants had their ſhare of cunning. Though they had made me pay for a horſe, the boy had
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:031653_0151_0fed8f9bc9844f50"/>
gone on foot, and only arrived half an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. This diſconcerted the whole arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the day; and being detained again three hours, I reluctantly determined to ſleep at Quiſtram, two poſts ſhort of Uddervalla, where I had hoped to have arrived that night.</p>
               <p>But, when I reached Quiſtram, I found I could not approach the door of the inn, for men, horſes, and carts, cows, and pigs hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled together. From the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="6 letters">

                  </gap>e of people, I had met on the road, I conjectured that there was a fair in the neighbourhood, this crowd convinced me that it was but too true. The boiſterous merriment that almoſt every inſtant produced a quarrel or made me dread one, with the clouds of tobacco, and fumes of brandy, gave an infernal appearance to the ſcene. There was every thing to drive me back, nothing to excite ſympathy in a rude tumult of the ſenſes, which I foreſaw would end in a groſs debauch. What was to be done? No bed was to be had, or even a quiet corner to retire to for a moment —all was loſt in noiſe, riot, and confuſion.</p>
               <p>After ſome debating they promiſed me horſes, which were to go on to Uddervalla, two ſtages. I requeſted ſomething to eat firſt, not having dined; and the hoſteſs, whom I have mentioned to you before, as knowing how to take care of herſelf, brought me a plate of fiſh, for which ſhe charged a rix dollar and a half. This was making hay whilſt the ſun ſhone. I was glad to get out of the uproar, though not diſpoſed to travel in an incommodious open
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:031653_0152_0fed8fe6ae931c68"/>
carriage all night, had I thought that there was any chance of getting horſes.</p>
               <p>Quitting Quiſtram, I met a number of joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous groups, and though the evening was freſh, many were ſtretched on the graſs like weary cattle; and drunken men had fallen by the road ſide. On a rock, under the ſhade of lofty trees, a large party of men and women had lighted a fire, cutting down fuel around to keep it alive all night. They were drinking, ſmoaking, and laughing, with all their might and main. I felt for the trees whoſe torn branches ſtrewed the ground.—Hapleſs nymphs! thy haunts I fear were polluted by many an unhallowed flame; the caſual burſt of the moment.</p>
               <p>The horſes went on very well; but when we drew near the poſt-houſe, the poſtilion ſtopt ſhort, and neither threats, nor promiſes, could prevail on him to go forward. He even began to howl and weep, when I inſiſted on his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his word. Nothing, indeed, can equal the ſtupid obſtinacy of ſome of theſe half alive beings, who ſeem to have been made by Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, when the fire he ſtole from Heaven was ſo exhauſted, that he could only ſpare a ſpark to give life, not animation, to the inert clay.</p>
               <p>It was ſome time before we could rouſe any body; and, as I expected, horſes we were told could not be had in leſs than four or five hours. I again attempted to bribe the churliſh brute, who brought us there; but I
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:031653_0153_0fed8f9d67559098"/>
diſcovered, that in ſpite of the courteous ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſs's promiſe, he had received orders not to go any farther.</p>
               <p>As there was no remedy I entered, and was almoſt driven back by the ſtench—a ſofter phraſe would not have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Two or three of the men or women were lying on the benches, others on old cheſts; and one figure ſtarted half out of a trunk to look at me, whom I might have taken for a ghoſt, had the <hi>chemiſe</hi> been white, to contraſt with the ſallow viſage. But the <hi>coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tume</hi> of apparitions not being preſerved I paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nothing dreading, excepting the effluvia, warily amongſt the pots, pans, milk-pails, and waſhing tubs. After ſcaling a ruinous ſtaircaſe, I was ſhewn a bed-chamber. The bed did not invite me to enter; opening, therefore, the window, and taking ſome clean towels out of my night-ſack, I ſpread them over the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, on which tired nature found repoſe, in ſpite of the previous diſguſt.</p>
               <p>With the grey of the morn the birds awoke me; and deſcending to enquire for the horſes, I haſtened through the apartment, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed, not wiſhing to aſſociate the idea of a pigſtye with that of a human dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>I do not wonder that the girls loſe their fine

complexions at ſuch an early age, or that love here is merely an appetite, to fulfil the main deſign of nature, never enlivened by either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or ſentiment.</p>
               <p>For a few poſts we found the horſes waiting; but afterwards I was retarded, as before, by the peaſants, who, taking advantage of my ignorance of the language, made me pay for the fourth horſe, that ought to have gone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to have the other in readineſs, though it had never been ſent. I was particularly im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>patient at the laſt poſt, as I longed to aſſure my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that my child was well.</p>
               <p>My impatience, however, did not prevent my enjoying the journey. I had ſix weeks before paſſed over the ſame ground, ſtill it had ſufficient novelty to attract my attention, and beguile, if not baniſh, the ſorrow that had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up its abode in my heart. How intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are the varied beauties of nature; and what peculiar charms characterize each ſeaſon! The purple hue which the heath now aſſumed, gave it a degree of richneſs, that almoſt exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the luſtre of the young green of ſpring— and harmonized exquiſitely with the rays of the ripening corn. The weather was uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptedly fine, and the people buſy in the fields cutting down the corn, or binding up the ſheaves, continually varied the proſpect. The rocks, it is true, were unuſually rugged and dreary, yet as the road runs for a conſiderable way by the ſide of a fine river, with extended paſtures on the other ſide, the image of ſterility
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:031653_0156_0fed8fa06fc81610"/>
was not the predominant object, though the cottages looked ſtill more miſerable, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen the norwegian farms. The trees, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, appeared of the growth of yeſterday, compared with thoſe Neſtors of the foreſt I have frequently mentioned. The women and children were cutting off branches from the beech, birch, oak, &amp;c, and leaving them to dry—This way of helping out their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>odder, injures the trees. But the winters are ſo long, that the poor cannot afford to lay in a ſufficient ſtock of hay. By ſuch means they juſt keep life in the poor cows, for little milk can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected when they are ſo miſerably fed.</p>
               <p>It was ſaturday, and the evening was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly ſerene. In the villages I every where ſaw preparations for ſunday; and I paſſed by a little car loaded with rye, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, for the pencil and heart, the ſweeteſt picture of a harveſt home I had ever beheld. A little girl was mounted a ſtraddle on a ſhag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy horſe, brandiſhing a ſtick over its head; the father was walking at the ſide of the car with a child in his arms, who muſt have come to meet him with tottering ſteps, the little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ſtretching out its arms to cling round his neck; and a boy, juſt above petticoats, was labouring hard, with a fork, behind, to keep the ſheaves from falling.</p>
               <p>My eyes followed them to the cottage, and an involuntary ſigh whiſpered to my heart, that I envied the mother, much as I diſlike cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who was preparing their pottage. I was
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:031653_0157_0fed8fecd0c117d0"/>
returning to my babe, who may never experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a father's care or tenderneſs. The boſom that nurtured her, heaved with a pang at the thought which only an unhappy mother could feel.</p>

               <p>I WAS unwilling to leave Gothenburg, without viſiting Trolhaettae. I wiſhed not only to ſee the caſcade, but to obſerve the progreſs of the ſtupendous attempt to form a canal through the rocks, to the extent of an engliſh mile and a half.</p>
               <p>This work is carried on by a company who employ daily nine hundred men; five years was the time mentioned in the propoſals, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the public, as neceſſary for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion. A much more conſiderable ſum than the plan requires has been ſubſcribed, for which there is every reaſon to ſuppoſe the promoters will receive ample intereſt.</p>
               <p>The Danes ſurvey the progreſs of this work with a jealous eye, as it is principally underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to get clear of the Sound duty.</p>
               <p>Arrived at Trolhaettae, I muſt own that the firſt view of the caſcade diſappointed me: and the ſight of the works, as they advanced, though a grand proof of human induſtry, was not calculated to warm the fancy. I, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, wandered about; and at laſt coming to the conflux of the various cataracts, ruſhing
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:031653_0159_0fed8ff2a30fa1b8"/>
from different falls, ſtruggling with the huge maſſes of rocks, and rebounding from the profound cavities, I immediately retracted, acknowledging that it was indeed a grand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. A little iſland ſtood in the midſt, covered with firs, which, by dividing the torrent, rendered it more pictureſque; one half ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to iſſue from a dark cavern, that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy might eaſily imagine a vaſt fountain, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up its waters from the very centre of the earth.</p>
               <p>I gazed I know not how long, ſtunned with the noiſe, and growing giddy with only look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the never-ceaſing tumultuous motion, I liſtened, ſcarcely conſcious where I was, when I obſerved a boy, half obſcured by the ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling foam, fiſhing under the impending rock on the other ſide. How he had deſcended I could not perceive; nothing like human footſteps ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; and the horrific craggs ſeemed to bid defiance even to the goat's activity. It looked like an abode only fit for the eagle. though in its crevices ſome pines darted up their ſpiral heads; but they only grew near the caſcade: every where elſe ſterility itſelf reigned with dreary grandeur; for the hugegrey maſſy rocks which probably had been torn aſunder by ſome dreadful convulſion of nature, had not even their firſt covering of a little cleaving moſs. There were ſo many appearances to excite the idea of chaos, that, inſtead of admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the canal and the works, great as they are termed, and little as they appear, I could not help regretting that ſuch a noble ſcene had not
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:031653_0160_0fed8fa802232e20"/>
been left in all its ſolitary ſublimity. Amidſt the awful roaring of the impetuous torrents, the noiſe of human inſtruments, and the buſtle of workmen, even the blowing up of the rocks, when grand maſſes trembled in the darkened air—only reſembled the inſignificant ſport of children.</p>
               <p>One fall of water, partly made by art, when they were attempting to conſtruct ſluices, had an uncommonly grand effect; the water precipitated itſelf with immenſe velocity down a perpendicular, at leaſt fifty or ſixty yards, into a gulph, ſo concealed by the foam as to give full play to the fancy: there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual uproar: I ſtood on a rock to obſerve it, a kind of bridge formed by nature, nearly on a level with the commencement of the fall. After muſing by it a long time, I turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other ſide, and ſaw a gentle ſtream ſtray calmly out. I ſhould have concluded that it had no communication with the torrent, had I not ſeen a huge log, that fell headlong down the caſcade, ſteal peacefully into the purl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtream.</p>
               <p>I retired from theſe wild ſcenes with regret to a miſerable inn, and next norning returned to Gothenburg, to prepare for my journey to Copenhagen.</p>
               <p>I was ſorry to leave Gothenburg, without travelling further into Sweden; yet I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, I ſhould only have ſeen a romantic coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try thinly inhabited, and theſe inhabitants
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:031653_0161_0fed8ff44645aac8"/>
ſtruggling with poverty. The norwegian pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry, moſtly independent, have a rough kind of frankneſs in their manner; but the ſwediſh, rendered more abject by miſery, have a degree of politeneſs in their addreſs, which, though it may ſometimes border on inſincerity, is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the effect of a broken ſpirit, rather ſoftened than degraded by wretchedneſs.</p>
               <p>In Norway there are no notes in circulation of leſs value than a ſwediſh rixdollar. A ſmall ſilver cion, commonly not worth more than a penny, and never more than twopence, ſerves for change: but in Sweden they have notes as low as ſixpence. I never ſaw any ſilver pieces there, and could not without difficulty, and giving a premium, obtain the value of a rixdol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, in a large copper coin, to give away on the road to the poor who open the gates</p>
               <p>As another proof of the poverty of Sweden, I ought to mention that foreign merchants, who have acquired a fortune there, are oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depoſit the ſixth part when they leave the kingdom. This law, you may ſuppoſe, is frequently evaded.</p>
               <p>In fact, the laws here, as well as in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, are ſo relaxed, that they rather favour than reſtrain knavery.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was at Gothenburg, a man who had been confined for breaking open his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's deſk, and running away with five or ſix thouſand rixdollars, was only ſentenced to
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:031653_0162_0fed8fa9a04e5ed8"/>
forty days confinement on bread and water; and this ſlight puniſhment his relations render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nugatory by ſupplying him with more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury food.</p>
               <p>The ſwedes are in general attached to their families; yet a divorce may be obtained by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, on proving the infidelity of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or acknowledging it themſelves. The women do not often recur to this equal privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; for they either retaliate on their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, by following their own devices, or ſink into the mereſt domeſtic drudges, worn down by tyranny to ſervile ſubmiſſion. Do not term me ſevere, if I add, that after youth is flown, the huſband becomes a ſot; and the wife amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes herſelf by ſcolding her ſervants. In fact what is to be expected in any country where taſte and cultivation of mind do not ſupply the place of youthful beauty and animal ſpirits? Affection requires a firmer foundation than ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy; and few people have a principle of action ſufficiently ſtable to produce rectitude of feeling; for, in ſpite of all the arguments I have heard to juſtify deviations from duty, I am perſuaded that even the moſt ſpontaneous ſenſations are more under the direction of principle than weak people are willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>But adieu to moralizing. I have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe laſt ſheets at aniun in Elſineur, where I am waiting for horſes; and as they are not yet ready, I will give you a ſhort account of my journney from Gothenburg; for I ſet out

the morning after I returned from Trolbaettae.</p>
               <p>The country, daring the firſt day's journey, preſented a moſt barren appearance; as rocky, yet not ſo pictureſque as Norway, becauſe on a diminutive ſcale. We ſtopt to ſleep at a toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable inn in Falckerlberg, a decent little town.</p>
               <p>The next day beeches and oaks began to grace the proſpects, the ſea every now and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to give them dignity. I could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void obſerving alſo, that even in this part of Sweden, one of the moſt ſterile, as I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there was more ground under cultivation than in Norway. Plains of varied crops ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to a conſiderable extent, and ſloped down to the ſhore, no longer terrific. And, as far as I could judge, from glancing my eye over the country, as we drove along, agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was in a more advanced ſtate; though, in the habitations, a greater appearance of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtill remained. The cottages indeed often looked moſt uncomfortable, but never ſo miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as thoſe I had remarked on the road to Stromſtad; and the towns were equal, if not ſuperior to many of the little towns in Wales, or ſome I have paſſed through in my way from Calais to Paris.</p>
               <p>The inns, as we advanced, were not to be complained of, unleſs I had always thought of England. The people were civil, and much more moderate in their demands than the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegians, particularly to the weſtward, where
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:031653_0154_0fed8facabfa3978"/>
they boldly charge for what you never had, and ſeem to conſider you, as they do a wreck, if not as lawful prey, yet as a lucky chance, which they ought not to neglect to ſeize.</p>
               <p>The proſpect of Elſineur, as we paſſed the Sound, was pleaſant. I gave three rixdollars for my boat, including ſomething to drink. I mention the ſum, becauſe they impoſe on ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>

               <head type="sub">COPENHAGEN.</head>
               <p>THE diſtance from Elſineur to Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen is twenty-two miles; the road is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, over a flat country diverſified with wood, moſtly beech, and decent manſions. There appeared to be a great quantity of corn land; and the ſoil looked much more fertile than it is in general ſo near the ſea. The riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounds indeed were very few; and around Copenhagen it is a perfect plain, of courſe has nothing to recommend it, but cultivation, not decorations. If I ſay that the houſes did not diſguſt me, I tell you all I remember of them; for I cannot recollect any pleaſurable ſenſations they excited: or that any object, produced by nature or art, took me out of myſelf. The view of the city, as we drew near, was rather grand, but without any ſtriking feature to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt the imagination, excepting the trees which ſhade the foot-paths.</p>
               <p>Juſt before I reached Copenhagen, I ſaw a number of tents on a wide plain, and ſuppoſed that the rage for encampments had reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this city; but I ſoon diſcovered that they
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:031653_0165_0fed8fb286a71060"/>
were the aſylum of many of the poor families who had been driven out of their habitations by the late fire.</p>
               <p>Entering ſoon after, I paſſed amongſt the duſt and rubbiſh it had left, affrighted by view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extent of the devaſtation; for at leaſt a quarter of the city had been deſtroyed. There was little in the appearance of fallen bricks and ſtacks of chimneys to allure the imagination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſoothing melancholy reveries; nothing to attract the eye of taſte, but much to afflict the benevolent heart. The depredations of time have always ſomething in them to employ the fancy, or lead to muſing on ſubjects which, withdrawing the mind from objects of ſenſe, ſeem to give it new dignity: but here I was treading on live aſhes. The ſufferers were ſtill under the preſſure of the miſery occaſioned by this dreadful conflagration. I could not take refuge in the thought; <hi>they ſuffered—but they are no more!</hi> a reflection I frequently ſummon to calm my mind when ſympathy riſes to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; I therefore deſired the driver to haſten to the hotel recommended to me, that I might avert in my eyes, and ſnap the train of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which had ſent me into all the corners of the city, in ſearch of houſeleſs heads.</p>
               <p>This morning I have been walking round the town, till I am weary of obſerving the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages. I had often heard the danes, even thoſe who had ſeen Paris and London, ſpeak of Copenhagen with rapture. Certainly I have ſeen it in a very diſadvantageous light, ſome of
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:031653_0166_0fed8ffecf40b960"/>
the beſt ſtreets having been burnt and the whole place thrown into confuſion. Still the utmoſt that can, or could ever, I believe, have been ſaid in its praiſe, might be compriſed in a few words. The ſtreets are open, and many of the houſes large; but I ſaw nothing to rouſe the idea of elegance or grandeur, if I except the circus where the king and prince royal reſide.</p>
               <p>The palace, which was conſumed about two years ago, muſt have been a handſome ſpacious building: the ſtone-work is ſtill ſtanding; and a great number of the poor, during the late fire, took refuge in its rains, till they could find ſome other abode. Beds were thrown on the landing places of the grand ſtair-caſe, where whole families crept from the cold, and every little nook is boarded up as a retreat for ſome poor creatures deprived of their home. At preſent a roof may be ſufficient to ſhelter them from the night air; but as the ſeaſon advances, the extent of the calamity will be more ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felt, I fear, though the exertions on the part of government are very conſiderable. Private charity has alſo, no doubt, done much to alleviate the miſery which obtrudes itſelf at every turn; ſtill public ſpirit appears to me to be hardly alive here. Had it exiſted, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tion might have been ſmothered in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as it was at laſt, by tearing down ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral houſes before the flames had reached them. To this the inhabitants would not conſent; and the prince royal not having ſufficient ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of character to know when he ought to be
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:031653_0167_0fed8fb42552b7d0"/>
abſolute, calmly let them purſue their own courſe, till the whole city ſeemed to be threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with deſtruction. Adhering, with pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile ſcrupuloſity, to the law, which he has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on himſelf, of acting exactly right, he did wrong by idly lamenting, whilſt he marked the progreſs of a miſchief that one decided ſtep would have ſtopt. He was afterwards obliged to reſort to violent meaſures; but then—who could blame him? And, to avoid cenſure, what ſacrifices are not made by weak minds!</p>
               <p>A gentleman, who was a witneſs of the ſcene, aſſured me, likewiſe, that if the people of property had taken half as much pains to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the fire, as to preſerve their valuables and furniture, it would ſoon have been got under. But they who were not immediately in danger did not exert themſelves ſufficiently, till fear, like an electrical ſhock, rouſed all the inhabitants to a ſenſe of the general evil. Even the fire engines were out of order, though the burning of the palace ought to have admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of the neceſſity of keeping them in conſtant repair. But this kind of indolence, reſpecting what does not immediately concern them, ſeems to characterize the danes. A ſluggiſh concentration in themſelves makes them ſo careful to preſerve their property, that they will not venture on any enterpriſe to increaſe it, in which there is a ſhadow of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>
               <p>Conſidering Copenhagen as the capital of Denmark and Norway, I was ſurpriſed not to
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:031653_0168_0fed90006d518c18"/>
ſee ſo much induſtry or taſte as in Chriſtiania. Indeed from every thing I have had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of obſerving, the danes are the people who have made the feweſt ſacrifices to the graces.</p>
               <p>The men of buſineſs are domeſtic tyrants, coldly immerſed in their own affairs, and ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the ſtate of other countries, that they dogmatically aſſert that Denmark is the happieſt country in the world; the prince royal the beſt of all poſſible princes; and count Bernſtorff the wiſeſt of miniſters.</p>
               <p>As for the women, they are ſimply notable houſewives; without accompliſhments, or any of the charms that adorn more advanced ſocial life. This total ignorance may enable them to ſave ſomething in their kitchens; but it is far from rendering them better parents. On the contrary, the children are ſpoilt; as they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are, when left to the care of weak, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent mothers, who having no principle of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to regulate their feelings, become the ſlaves of infants, enfeebling both body and mind by falſe tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>I am perhaps a little prejudiced, as I write from the impreſſion of the moment; for I have been tormented to-day by the preſence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly children, and made angry by ſome invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives throw out againſt the maternal character of the unfortunate Matilda. She was cenſured, with the moſt cruel inſinuation, for her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of her ſon; though, from what I
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:031653_0169_0fed8fb5c790ef78"/>
could gather, ſhe gave proofs of good ſenſe, as well as tenderneſs in her attention to him. She uſed to bathe him herſelf every morning; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on his being looſely clad; and would not permit his attendants to injure his digeſtion, by humouring his appetite. She was equally care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to prevent his acquiring haughty airs, and playing the tyrant in leading-ſtrings. The queen dowager would not permit her to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle him; but the next child being a daughter, and not the heir apparent of the crown, leſs oppoſition was made to her diſcharging the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a mother.</p>
               <p>Poor Matilda! thou haſt haunted me ever ſince my arrival; and the view I have had of the manners of the country, exciting my ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, has increaſed my reſpect for thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory!</p>
               <p>I am now fully convinced that ſhe was the victim of the party ſhe diſplaced, who would have overlooked, or encouraged, her attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had her lover not, aiming at being uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, attempted to overturn ſome eſtabliſhed abuſes before the people, ripe for the change, had ſufficient ſpirit to ſupport him when ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling in their behalf. Such indeed was the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity ſharpened againſt her, that I have heard her, even after ſo many years have elapſed, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with licentiouſneſs, not only for endeavouring to render the public amuſements more elegant, but for her very charities, becauſe ſhe erected amongſt other inſtitutions, an hoſpital to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive foundlings. Diſguſted with many cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:031653_0170_0fed9002103834d8"/>
which paſs for virtues, though they are nothing more than obſervances of forms, often at the expence of truth, ſhe probably ran into an error common to innovators, in wiſhing to do immediately what can only be done by time.</p>
               <p>Many very cogent reaſons have been urged by her friends to prove, that her affection for Struenſee was never carried to the length al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt her, by thoſe who feared her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. Be that as it may, ſhe certainly was not a woman of gallantry; and if ſhe had an attachment for him, it did not diſgrace her heart or underſtanding the king being a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious debauchee, and an idiot into the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. As the king's conduct had always been directed by ſome favourite, they alſo endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to govern him, from a principle of ſelf-preſervation, as well as a laudable ambition; but, not aware of the prejudicies they had to encounter, the ſyſtem they adopted diſplayed more benevolence of heart than ſoundneſs of judgement. As to the charge, ſtill believed, of their living the king drugs to injure his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, it is too abſurd to be refuted. Their oppreſſors had better have accuſed them of dab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in the black art; for the potent ſpell ſtill keeps his wits in bondage.</p>
               <p>I cannot deſcribe to you the effect it had on me to ſee this puppet of a monarch moved by the ſtrings which count Bernſtorff holds faſt; ſit, with vacant eye, erect, receiving the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of courtiers, who mock him with a ſhew
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:031653_0171_0fed8fb766d12240"/>
of reſpect. He is, in fact, merely a machine of ſtate, to ſubſcribe the name of a king to the acts of the government, which, to avoid danger, have no value, unleſs counterſigned by the prince royal, for he is allowed to be abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an idiot, excepting that now and then an obſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What a farce is life! This effigy of majeſty is allowed to burn down to the ſocket, whilſt the hapleſs Matilda was hurried into an untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grave.</p>

               <head>LETTER XIX.</head>
               <p>BUSINESS having obliged me to go a few miles out of town this morning, I was ſurpriſed at meeting a crowd of people of every deſcription; and enquiring the cauſe, of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who ſpoke french, I was informed that a man had been executed two hours before, and the body afterwards burnt. I could not help looking with horror around—the fields loſt their verdure—and I turned with diſguſt from the well-dreſſed women, who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with their children from this ſight. What a ſpectacle for humanity! The ſeeing ſuch a flock of idle gazers, plunged me into a train of reflections, on the pernicious effects produced by falſe notions of juſtice. And I am perſuaded that till capital puniſhments be entirely aboliſhed, executions ought to have every appearance of horrour given to them; inſtead of being, as they are now, a ſcene of amuſement for the gaping crowd, where ſympathy is quickly effaced by curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>I have always been of opinion that the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actors to die, in the preſence of the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, has an immoral tendency; but trifling when compared with the ferocity acquire
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:031653_0173_0fed8fbee61ff6c8"/>
viewing the reality as a ſhow; for it ſeems to me, that in all countries the common people go to executions to ſee how the poor wretch plays his part, rather than to commiſerate his fate, much leſs to think of the breach of morality which has brought him to ſuch a deplorable end. Conſequently executions, far from being uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful examples to the ſurvivors, have, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, a quite contrary effect, by hardening the heart they ought to terrify. Beſides, the fear of an ignominious death, I believe, never deterred any one from the commiſſion of a crime, becauſe in committing it, the mind is rouſed to activity about preſent circumſtances. It is a game at hazard, at which all expect the turn of the die in their own favour; never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the chance of ruin, till it comes. In fact, from what I ſaw, in the fortreſſes of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, I am more and more convinced that the ſame energy of character, which renders a man a daring villain, would have rendered him uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſociety, had that ſociety been well orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized. When a ſtrong mind is not diſciplined by cultivation, it is a ſenſe of injuſtice that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it unjuſt.</p>
               <p>Executions, however, occur very rarely at Copenhagen; for timidity, rather than cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, palſies all the operations of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent government. The malefactor, who died this morning, would not, probably, have been puniſhed with death at any other period; but an incendiary excites univerſal execration; and as the greater part of the inhabitants are ſtill diſtreſſed by the late conflagration, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:031653_0174_0fed900b0612fa38"/>
was thought abſolutely neceſſary; though, from what I can gather, the fire was accidental.</p>
               <p>Not, but that I have very ſeriouſly been informed, that combuſtible materials were placed at proper diſtances, by the emiſſaries of Mr. Pitt; and, to corroborate the fact, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people inſiſt, that the flames burſt out at once in different parts of the city; not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wind to have any hand in it. So much for the plot. But the fabricators of plots in all countries build their conjectures on the "baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fabric of a viſion;" and, it ſeems even a ſort of poetical juſtice, that whilſt this miniſter is cruſhing at home, plots of his own conjuring up, that on the continent, and in the north he ſhould, with as little foundation, be accuſed of wiſhing to ſet the world on fire.</p>
               <p>I forgot to mention, to you, that I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by a man of veracity, that two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons came to the ſtake to drink a glaſs of the criminal's blood, as an infallible remedy for the apoplexy. And when I animadverted in the company, where it was mentioned, on ſuch a horrible violation of nature, a daniſh lady re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved me very ſeverely, aſking how I knew that it was not a cure for the diſeaſe? adding, that every attempt was juſtifiable in ſearch of health. I did not, you may imagine, enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an argument with a perſon the ſlave of ſuch a groſs prejudice. And I allude to it not only as a trait of the ignorance of the people, but to cenſure the government, for not preventing
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:031653_0175_0fed8fc088972860"/>
ſcenes that throw an odium on the human race.</p>
               <p>Empiriciſm is not peculiar to Denmark; and I know no way of rooting it out, though it be a remnant of exploded witchcraft, till the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a general knowledge of the component parts of the human frame, become a part of public education.</p>
               <p>Since the fire, the inhabitants have been very aſſiduouſly employed in ſearching for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty ſecreted during the confuſion; and it is aſtoniſhing how many people, formerly term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reptuable, had availed themſelves of the common calamity to purloin what the flames ſpared. Others, expert at making a diſtinction without a difference, concealed what they found, not troubling themſelves to enquire for the owners, though they ſcrupled to ſearch for plunder any where, but amongſt the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins.</p>
               <p>To be honeſter than the laws require, is by moſt people thought a work of ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and to ſlip through the grate of the law, has ever exerciſed the abilities of adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, who wiſh to get rich the ſhorteſt way. Knavery, without perſonal danger, is an art, brought to great perfection by the ſtateſman and ſwindler; and meaner knaves are not tardy in following their footſteps.</p>
               <p>It moves my gall to diſcover ſome of the commercial frauds practiſed during the preſent
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:031653_0176_0fed900ca41fa670"/>
war. In ſhort, under whatever point of view I conſider ſociety, it appears, to me, that an adoration of property is the root of all evil. Here it does not render the people enterpriſing, as in America, but thrifty and cautions. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, therefore was in a capital where there was ſo little appearance of active induſtry; and as for gaiety, I looked in vain for the ſprightly gait of the norwegians, who in every reſpect appear to me to have got the ſtart of them. This difference I attribute to their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more liberty; a liberty which they think their right by inheritance, whilſt the danes, when they boaſt of their negative happineſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mention it as the boon of the prince roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, under the ſuperintending wiſdom of count Bernſtorff. Vaſſallage is nevertheleſs ceaſing throughout the kingdom, and with it will paſs away that ſordid avarice which every modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſlavery is calculated to produce.</p>
               <p>If the chief uſe of property be power, in the ſhape of the reſpect it procures, is it not among the inconſiſtencies of human nature moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, that men ſhould find a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in hoarding up property which they ſteal from their neceſſities, even when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it would be dangerous to diſplay ſuch an enviable ſuperiority? Is not this the ſituation of ſerfs in every country; yet a rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to accumulate money ſeems to become ſtronger in proportion as it is allowed to be uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>Wealth does not appear to be ſought for, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:031653_0177_0fed8fc2273c3080"/>
the danes, to obtain the elegant luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of life; for a want of taſte is very conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous at Copenhagen; ſo much ſo, that I am not ſurpriſed to hear that poor Matilda offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rigid lutherans, by aiming to refine their pleaſures. The elegance which ſhe wiſhed to introduce, was termed laſciviouſneſs: yet I do not find that the abſence of gallantry renders the wives more chaſte, or the huſbands more conſtant. Love here ſeems to corrupt the morals, without poliſhing the manners, by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing confidence and truth, the charm as well as cement of domeſtic life. A gentleman, who has reſided in this city ſome time, aſſures me that he could not find language to give me an idea of the groſs debaucheries into which the lower order of people fall; and the promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous amours of the men of the middling claſs with their female ſervants, debates both beyond meaſure, weakening every ſpecies of family affection.</p>
               <p>I have every where been ſtruck by one cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic difference in the conduct of the two ſexes; women, in general, are ſeduced by their ſuperiors, and men jilted by their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; rank and manners awe the one, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and wantonneſs ſubjugate the other; am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition creeping into the woman's paſſion, and tyranny giving force to the man's; for moſt men treat their miſtreſſes as kings do their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites: <hi>ergo</hi> is not man then the tyrant of the creation?</p>
               <p>Still harping on the ſame ſubject, you will
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:031653_0178_0fed900e47b90530"/>
exclaim—How can I avoid it, when moſt of the ſtruggles of an eventful life have been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the oppreſſed ſtate of my ſex; we reaſon deeply, when we forcibly feel.</p>
               <p>But to return to the ſtraight road of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſenſuality ſo prevalent appears to me to ariſe rather from indolence of mind, and dull ſenſes, than from an exuberance of life, which often fructifies the whole character when the vivacity of youthful ſpirits begins to ſubſide unto ſtrength of mind.</p>
               <p>I have before mentioned that the men are domeſtic tyrants, conſidering them as fathers, brothers, or huſbands; but there is a kind of interregnum between the reign of the father and huſband, which is the only period of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and pleaſure that the women enjoy. Young people, who are attached to each other, with the conſent of their friends, exchange rings, and are permitted to enjoy a degree of liberty together, which I have never noticed in any other country. The days of courtſhip are therefore prolonged, till it be perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to marry: the intimacy often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes very tender: and if the lover obtain the privilege of a huſband, it can only be termed half by ſtealth, becauſe the family is wilfully blind. It happens very rarely that theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary engagements are diſſolved or diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a ſtigma being attached to a breach of faith, which is thought more diſgraceful, if not ſo

And, to deal ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with you, I believe I ſhould have been leſs ſevere in the remarks I have made on the vanity and depravity of the french, <note n="*" place="bottom">See Hiſtorical and Moral View of the French Revolution.</note> had I travelled towards the north before I viſited France.</p>
               <p>The intereſting picture frequently drawn of the virtues of a riſing people has, I fear, been fallacious, excepting the accounts of the enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm which various public ſtruggles have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. We talk of the depravity of the french, and lay a ſtreſs on the old age of the nation; yet where has more virtuous enthuſiaſm been diſplayed than during the two laſt years, by the common people of France and in their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? I am obliged ſometimes to recollect the numberleſs inſtances which I have either wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, or heard well authenticated, to balance the account of horrours, alas! but too true. I am, therefore, inclined to believe that the groſs vices which I have always ſeen allied with ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of manners, are the concomitants of ignorance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:031653_0180_0fed900fe69c56a0"/>What, for example, has piety, under the heathen or chriſtian ſyſtem, been, but a blind faith in things contrary to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of reaſon? And could poor reaſon make conſiderable advances, when it was reckoned the higheſt degree of virtue to do violence to it's dictates? Lutherans preaching refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, have built a reputation for ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the ſame foundation as the catholics; yet I do not perceive that a regular attendance on public worſhip, and their other obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, make them a whit more true in their affections, or honeſt in their private tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>It ſeems, indeed, quite as eaſy to preve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricate with religious injunctions as human laws, when the exerciſe of their reaſon does not lead people to acquire principles for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the criterion of all thoſe they receive from others.</p>
               <p>If travelling as the completion of a liberal education, were to be adopted on rational grounds, the northern ſtates ought to be viſited before the more poliſhed parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, to ſerve as the elements even of the knowledge of manners, only to be acquired by tracing the various ſhades in different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.

               <p>I HAVE formerly cenſured the french for their extreme attachment to theatrical exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, becauſe I thought that they tended to render them vain and unnatural characters. But I muſt acknowledge, eſpecially as women of the town never appear in the pariſian, as at our theatres, that the little ſaving of the week is more uſefully expended there, every ſunday, than in porter or brandy, to intoxicate or ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pify the mind. The common people of France have a great ſuperiority over that claſs in every other country on this very ſcore. It is merely the ſobriety of the pariſians which renders their fetes more intereſting, their gaiety never becoming diſguſting or dangerous; as is always the caſe when liquor circulates. Intoxication is the pleaſure of ſavages, and of all thoſe whoſe employments rather exhauſt their animal ſpirits, than exerciſe their faculties. Is not this, in fact, the vice, both in England and the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern ſtates of Europe, which appears to be the greateſt impediment to general improvement? Drinking is here the principal relaxation of the men, including ſmoking; but the women are very abſtemious, though they have no public amuſements as a ſubſtitute. I ought to except one theatre, which appears more than
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:031653_0183_0fed8fce0d07f7d0"/>
is neceſſary; for when I was there, it was not half full; and neither the ladies nor actreſſes diſplayed much fancy in their dreſs.</p>
               <p>The play was founded on the ſtory of the Mock Doctor; and, from the geſtures of the ſervants, who were the beſt actors, I ſhould imagine contained ſome humour. The farce, termed ballat, was a kind of pantomime, the childiſh incidents of which were ſufficient to ſhew the ſtate of the dramatic art in Denmark, and the groſs taſte of the audience. A magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, in the diſguiſe of a tinker, enters a cottage where the women are all buſy ironing, and rubs a dirty frying-pan againſt the linen. The women raiſe an hue-and-cry, and dance after him, rouſing their huſbands, who join in the dan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, but get the ſtart of them in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. The tinker, with the frying-pan for a ſhield, renders them immoveble, and blacks their cheeks. Each laughs at the other, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious of his own apearance; mean while the women enter to enjoy the ſport, <hi>'the rare fun,'</hi> with other incidents of the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>The ſinging was much on a par with the danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the one as deſtitute of grace, as the other of expreſſion; but the orcheſtra was well filled, the inſtrumental being far ſuperior to the vocal muſic.</p>
               <p>I have likewiſe viſited the public library and muſeum, as well as the palace of Roſembourg. This palace, now deſerted, diſplays a gloomy
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:031653_0184_0fed901a40447758"/>
kind of grandeur throughout; for the ſilence of ſpacious apartments always makes itſelf to be felt; I at leaſt feel it; and I liſten for the ſound of my footſteps, as I have done at midnight to the ticking of the death-watch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> encouraging a kind of fanciful ſuperſtition. Every object carried me back to paſt times, and impreſſed the manners of the age forcibly on my mind. In this point of view the preſervation of old palaces, and their tarniſhed furniture, is uſeful; for they may be conſidered as hiſtorical docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The vacuum left by departed greatneſs was every where obſervable, whilſt the battles and proceſſions, pourtrayed on the walls, told you who had here excited revelry after retiring from ſlaughter; or diſmiſſed pageantry in ſearch of pleaſure. It ſeeemed a vaſt tomb, full of the ſhadowy phantoms of thoſe who had played or toiled their hour out, and ſunk behind the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry, which celebrated the conqueſts of love or war. Could they be no more—to whom my imagination thus gave life; Could the thoughts, of which there remained ſo many veſtiges, have vaniſhed quite away? And theſe beings, compoſed of ſuch noble materials of thinking and feeling, have they only melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the elements to keep in motion the grand maſs of life? It cannot be!—As eaſily could I believe that the large ſilver lions, at the top of the banqueting room, thought and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned. But avaunt! ye waking dreams!— yet I cannot deſcribe the curioſities to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="unknown:031653_0185_0fed8fcfac12a760"/>There were cabinets full of baubles, and gems, and ſwords, which muſt have been wielded by giant's hand. The coronation ornaments wait quietly here till warned; and the wardrobe exhibits the veſtments which formerly graced theſe ſhews. It is a pity they do not lend them to the actors, inſtead of allowing them to periſh ingloriouſly.</p>
               <p>I have not viſited any other palace, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hirſholm; the gardens of which are laid out with taſte, and command the fineſt views the country affords. As they are in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern and engliſh ſtyle, I thought I was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the footſteps of Matilda, who wiſhed to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply around her the images of her beloved country. I was alſo gratified by the ſight of a norwegian landſcape in miniature, which with great propriety makes a part of the daniſh king's garden. The cottage is well imitated, and the whole has a pleaſing effect, particularly ſo to me who love Norway—it's peaceful farms and ſpacious wilds.</p>
               <p>The public library conſiſts of a collection much larger than I expected to ſee; and it is well arranged. Of the value of the Icelandic manuſcripts I could not form a judgment, though the alphabet of ſome of them amuſed me, by ſhewing what immenſe labour men will ſubmit to, in order to tranſmit their ideas to poſterity. I have ſometimes thought it a great misfortune for individuals to acquire a certain delicacy of ſentiment, which often makes them weary of the common occurrences of life;
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:031653_0186_0fed901bdeda7fa0"/>
yet it is this very delicacy of feeling and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which probably has produced moſt of the performances that have benefited mankind. It might with propriety, perhaps, he termed the malady of genius: the cauſe of that character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic melancholy which 'grows with its growth, and ſtrengthens with its ſtrength.'</p>
               <p>There are ſome good pictures in the royal muſeum—Do not ſtart—I am not going to trouble you with a dull catalogue, or ſtupid criticiſms on maſters, to whom time has aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their juſt niche in the temple of fame; had there been any by living artiſts of this country, I ſhould nave noticed them, as making a part of the ſketches I am drawing of the preſent ſtate of the place. The good pictures were mixed indiſcriminately with the bad ones, in order to aſſort the frames. The ſame fault is conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the new ſplendid gallery forming at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris; though it ſeems an obvious thought that a ſchool for artiſts ought to be arranged in ſuch a manner, as to ſhew the progreſſive diſcoveries and improvements in the art.</p>
               <p>A collection of the dreſſes, arms, and imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Laplanders attracted my attention, diſplaying that firſt ſpecies of ingenuity which is rather a proof of patient perſeverance, than comprehenſion of mind. The ſpecimens of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hiſtory, and curioſities of art, were likewiſe huddled together without that ſcientific order which alone renders them uſeful; but this may partly have been occaſioned by the haſty manner in which they were removed from the palace, when in flames.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="unknown:031653_0187_0fed8fd15016a318"/>There are ſome reſpectable men of ſcience here, but few literary characters, and fewer artiſts. They want encouragement, and will continue, I fear, from the preſent appearance of things, to languiſh unnoticed a long time; for neither the vanity of wealth, nor the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing ſpirit of commerce, has yet thrown a glance that way.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the prince royal, determined to be oeconomical, almoſt deſcends to parſimony; and perhaps depreſſes his ſubjects, by labouring not to oppreſs them; for his intentions always ſeem to be good—yet nothing can give a more forcible idea of the dullneſs which eats away all activity of mind, than the inſipid routine of a court, without magnificence or elegance.</p>
               <p>The prince, from what I can now collect, has very moderate abilities; yet is ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that count Bernſtorff finds him as tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as he could wiſh; for I conſider the count as the real ſovereign, ſcarcely behind the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; the prince having none of that obſtinate ſelf-ſufficiency of youth, ſo often the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of deciſion of character. He, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs his wife, dine every day with the king, to ſave the expence of two tables. What a mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery it muſt be to treat as a king a being who has loſt the majeſty of man! But even count Bernſtorff's morality ſubmits to this ſtanding impoſition; and he avails himſelf of it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, to ſoften a refuſal of his own, by ſaying it is the <hi>will</hi> of the king, my maſter, when every body knows that he has neither
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:031653_0188_0fed901d81addee0"/>
will nor memory. Much the ſame uſe is made of him as, I have obſerved, ſome termagant wives make of their huſbands; they would dwell on the neceſſity of obeying their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, poor paſſive ſouls, who never were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>to will,</hi> when they wanted to conceal their own tyranny.</p>
               <p>A ſtory is told here of the king's formerly making a dog counſellor of ſtate, becauſe when the dog, accuſtomed to eat at the royal table, ſnatched a piece of meat off an old officer's plate, he reproved him jocoſely, ſaying that he, <hi>monſieur le chien,</hi> had not the previlege of dining with his majeſty; a privilege annexed to this diſtinction.</p>
               <p>The burning of the palace was, in fact, a fortunate circumſtance, as it afforded a pretext for reducing the eſtabliſhment of the houſhold, which was far too great for the revenue of the crown. The prince Royal, at preſent, runs into the oppoſite extreme; and the formality, if not the parſimony, of the court, ſeems to extend to all the other branches of ſociety, which I had an opportunity of obſerving; though hoſpitality ſtill characterizes their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>But let me now ſtop; I may be a little partial and view every thing with the jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced eye of melancholy—for I am ſad—and have cauſe.</p>

               <p>I HAVE ſeen count Bernſtorff; and his converſation confirms me in the opinion I had previouſly formed of him;—I mean, ſince my arrival at Copenhagen, He is a worthy man, a little vain of his virtue <hi>a la Necker</hi>; and more anxious not to do wrong, that is to avoid blame, than deſirous of doing good; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if any particular good demands a change. Prudence, in ſhort, ſeems to be the baſis of his character; and, from the tenour of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhould think inclining to that cautious circumſpection which treads on the heels of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity. He has conſiderable information, and ſome fineſſe; or he could not be a miniſter. Determined not to riſk his popularity, for he is tenderly careful of his reputation, he will never gloriouſly fail like Struenſee, or diſturb, with the energy of genius, the ſtagnant ſtate of the public mind.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe that Lavater, whom he invited to viſit him two years ago, ſome ſay to fix the principles of the chriſtian religion firmly in the prince royal's mind, found lines in his face to prove him a ſtateſman of the firſt order; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has a knack at ſeeing a great character in the countenances of men in exalted ſtations,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:031653_0190_0fed9021f7b02638"/>
who have noticed him, or his works. Beſides, the count's ſentiments relative to the french revolution, agreeing with Lavater's, muſt have enſured his applauſe.</p>
               <p>The danes, in general, ſeem extremely averſe to innovation, and, if happineſs only conſiſts in opinion, they are the happieſt people in the world; for I never ſaw any ſo well ſatisfied with their own ſituation. Yet the climate appears to be very diſagreeable; the weather being dry and ſultry, or moiſt and cold; the atmoſphere never having that ſharp, bracing purity, which in Norway pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares you to brave its rigours. I do not then hear the inhabitants of this place talk with delight of the winter, which is the conſtant theme of the norwegians, on the contrary they ſeem to dread its comfortleſs inclemency.</p>
               <p>The ramparts are pleaſant, and muſt have been much more ſo before the fire, the walkers not being annoyed by the clouds of duſt, which, at preſent, the ſlighteſt wind wafts from the ruins. The wind-mills, and the comfortable houſes contiguous, belonging to the millers, as well as the appearance of the ſpacious barracks for the ſoldiers and ſailors, tend to render this walk more agreeable.</p>
               <p>The view of the country has not much to recommend it to notice, but its extent and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation: yet as the eye always delights to dwell on verdant plains, eſpecially when we are reſident in a great city, theſe ſhady walks
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:031653_0191_0fed8fda4852d818"/>
ſhould be reckoned amongſt the advantages pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the government for the inhabitants. I like them better than the royal gardens, alſo open to the public, becauſe the latter ſeem ſunk in the heart of the city, to concentrate its fogs.</p>
               <p>The canals, which interſect the ſtreets, are equally convenient and wholeſome; but the view of the ſea, commanded by the town, had little to intereſt me whilſt the remembrance of the various bold and pictureſque ſhores, I had ſeen, was freſh in my memory. Still the opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inhabitants, who ſeldom go abroad, muſt find the ſpots where they fix their country ſeats much pleaſanter on account of the vicini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ocean.</p>
               <p>One of the beſt ſtreets in Copenhagen is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt filled with hoſpitals, erected by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and, I am aſſured, as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated as inſtitutions of this kind are in any country; but whether hoſpitals, or work-houſes, are any where ſuperintended with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient humanity, I have frequently had reaſon to doubt.</p>
               <p>The autumn is ſo uncommonly fine, that I am unwilling to put off my journey to Hamburg much longer, leſt the weather ſhould alter ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and the chilly harbingers of winter catch me here, where I have nothing now to detain me but the hoſpitality of the families to whom I had recommendatory letters. I lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at an hotel ſituated in a large open ſquare,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:031653_0192_0fed34a05b7e21b8"/>
where the troops exerciſe, and the market is kept. My apartments were very good; and, on account of the fire, I was told that I ſhould be charged very high; yet, paying my bill juſt now, I find the demands much lower in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion than in Norway, though my dinners were in every reſpect better.</p>
               <p>I have remained more at home, ſince I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Copenhagen, than I ought to have done in a ſtrange place; but the mind is not always equally active in ſearch of information; and my oppreſſed heart too often ſighs out.</p>

               <p>The man I had hired at Copenhagen adviſed me to go round, about twenty miles, to avoid paſſing the Little Belt, excepting by a ferry, as the wind was contrary. But the gentlemen over-ruled his arguments, which we were all very ſorry for afterwards, when we found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves becalmed on the Little Belt ten hours, tacking about, without ceaſing, to gain on the ſhore.</p>
               <p>An over-ſight likewiſe made the paſſage ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear much more tedious, nay almoſt inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. When I went on board at the Great Belt, I had provided refreſhments in caſe of detention, which remaining untouched, I thought not then any ſuch precaution neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the ſecond paſſage, miſſed by the epithet of little, though I have ſince been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that it is frequently the longeſt.</p>
               <p>This miſtake occaſioned much vexation; for the child, at laſt, began to cry ſo bitterly for

               <p>I then ſupped with my companions, with whom I was ſoon after to part for ever—al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a moſt melancholy, death-like idea—a ſort of ſeparation of ſoul; for all the regret which follows thoſe from whom fate ſeparates us, ſeems to be ſomething torn from ourſelves. Theſe were ſtrangers I remember; yet when there is any originality in a countenance, it takes its place in our memory; and we are ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to loſe an acquaintance the moment he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to intereſt us, though picked up on the highway. There was, in fact, a degree of intelligence, and ſtill more ſenſibility in the features and converſation of one of the gentlemen, that made me regret the loſs of his ſociety during the reſt of the journey; for he was compelled to travel poſt, by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to reach his eſtate before the arrival of the french.</p>
               <p>This was a comfortable inn, as were ſeveral others I ſtopt at; but the heavy ſandy roads were very fatiguing, after the fine ones we had lately ſkimmed over both in Sweden and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. The country reſembled the moſt open part of England; laid out for corn, rather
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:031653_0197_0fed8fe36bdc1e70"/>
than grazing: it was pleaſant; yet there was little in the proſpects to awaken curioſity, by diſplaying the peculiar characteriſtics of a new country, which had ſo frequently ſtole me from myſelf in Norway. We often paſſed over large unincloſed tracts, not graced with trees, or at leaſt very ſparingly enlivened by them; and the half-formed roads ſeemed to demand the landmarks, ſet up in the waſte, to prevent the traveller from ſtraying far out of his way, and plodding through the weariſome ſand.</p>
               <p>The heaths were dreary, and had none of the wild charms of thoſe of Sweden and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to cheat time; neither the terrific rocks, nor ſmiling herbage, grateful to the ſight, and ſcented from afar, made us forget their length; ſtill the country appeared much more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and the towns, if not the farm-houſes, were ſuperior to thoſe of Norway. I even thought that the inhabitants of the former had more intelligence, at leaſt I am ſure they had more vivacity in their countenances than I had ſeen during my northern tour: their ſenſes ſeemed awake to buſineſs and pleaſure. I was therefore, gratified by hearing once more the buſy h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

appearance, as we approached, was often very pictureſque, and, when we entered, diſplayed the comfort and cleanlineſs of eaſy, if not the eligance of opulent, circumſtances. But the cheerfulneſs of the people in the ſtreets was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly grateful to me, after having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the death-like ſilence of thoſe of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, where every houſe made me think of a tomb. The dreſs of the peaſantry is ſuited to the climate; in ſhort, none of that poverty and dirt appeared, at the ſight of which the heart ſickens.</p>
               <p>As I only ſtopt to change horſes, take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, and ſleep, I had not an opportunity of knowing more of the country than concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the information gathered by my eyes enabled me to draw; and that was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to convince me that I ſhould much rather have lived in ſome of the towns I now paſs through, than in any I had ſeen in Sweden or Denmark. The people ſtruck me, as having arrived at that period when the faculties will unfold themſelves; in ſhort, they look alive to improvement, neither congealed by indolence, nor bent down by wretchedneſs to ſervility.</p>

before the ſun. As I ſaw the reality, I ſhould, probably have diſcovered much lurking miſery the conſequence of ignorant oppreſſion, no doubt, had I had time to inquire into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; but it did not ſtalk abroad, and infect the ſurface over which my eye glanced. Yes, I am perſuaded that a conſiderable degree of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral knowledge pervades this country; for it is only from the exerciſe of the mind that the body acquires the activity from which I drew theſe inferences. Indeed the king of Denmark's german dominions, Holſtein, appeared to me far ſuperiour to any other part of his kingdom which had fallen under my view; and the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt ruſtics to have their muſcles braced, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the <hi>as it were</hi> lounge of the daniſh peaſantry.</p>
               <p>Arriving at Sleſwick, the reſidence of prince Charles of Heſſe-Caſſel, the ſight of the ſoldiers recalled all the unpleaſing ideas of german deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, which imperceptibly vaniſhed as I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into the country. I viewed, with a mixture of pity and horror, theſe beings train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſold to ſlaughter, or be ſlaughtered, and fell into reflections, on an old opinion of mine, that it is the preſervation of the ſpecies, not of individuals, which appears to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Deity throughout the whole of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Bloſſoms come forth only to be blighted; fiſh lay their ſpawn where it will be devoured; and what a large portion of the human race are born merely to be ſwept prematurely away. Does not this waſte of budding life emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſert, that it is not men, but man, whoſe
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:031653_0200_0fed903a583f4680"/>
preſervation is ſo neceſſary to the completion of the grand plan of the univerſe? Children peep into exiſtence, ſuffer, and die; men play like moths about a candle, and ſink into the flame: war, and "the thouſand ills which fleſh is heir to," mow them down in ſhoals, whilſt the more cruel prejudices of ſociety pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies exiſtence, introducing not leſs ſure, though ſlower decay.</p>
               <p>The caſtle was heavy and gloomy; yet the grounds about it were laid out with ſome taſte; a walk, winding under the ſhade of lofty trees, led to a regularly built, and animated town.</p>
               <p>I croſſed the draw-bridge, and entered to ſee this ſhell of a court in miniature, mounting ponderous ſtairs, it would be a ſoleciſm to ſay a flight, up which a regiment of men might have marched, ſhouldering their firelocks, to exerciſe in vaſt galleries, where all the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the princes of Heſſe-Caſſel might have been muſtered rank and file, though not the phantoms of all the wretched they had bartered to ſupport their ſtate, unleſs theſe airy ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could ſhrink and expand, like Miltons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, to ſuit the occaſion.</p>

               <p>Waiting for our horſes, we were amuſed by obſerving the dreſs of the women, which was very groteſque and unwieldy. The falſe noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of beauty which prevails here, as well as in Denmark, I ſhould think very inconvenient in ſummer, as it conſiſts in giving a rotundity to a certain part of the body, not the moſt ſlim, when nature has done her part. This dutch prejudice often leads them to toil under the weight of ſome ten or a dozen petricoats, which with an enormous baſket, literally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a bonnet, or a ſtraw hat of dimenſions equally gigantic, almoſt completely concealing the human form, as well as face divine, often worth ſhewing—ſtill they looked clean, and tript along, as it were, before the wind, with a weight of tackle that I could ſcarcely have lifted. Many of the country girls, I met, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me pretty, that is, to have fine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, ſparkling eyes, and a kind of arch, hoyden playfulneſs which diſtinguiſhes the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage coquette. The ſwains, in their ſunday trim, attended ſome of theſe fair ones, in a more ſlouching pace, though their dreſs was not ſo cumberſome. The women ſeem to take the lead in poliſhing the manners every where, that being the only way to better their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

I do not think the ſituation of the poor in England is much, if at all ſuperior to that of the ſame claſs in different parts of the world; and in Ireland, I am ſure, it is much inferiour. I allude to the former ſtate of England; for at preſent the accumulation of national wealth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſes the cares of the poor, and hardens the hearts of the rich, in ſpite of the highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled rage for alms-giving.</p>

               <p>After leaving Sleſwick, we paſſed through ſeveral pretty towns; Itzchol particularly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me; and the country ſtill wearing the ſame aſpect, was improved by the appearance of more trees and encloſures.

                  <pb n="204" facs="unknown:031653_0203_0fed90420d961e70"/>The farm-houſes, likewiſe, with the huge ſtables, into which we drove, whilſt the horſes were putting to, or baiting, were very clean and commodious. The rooms, with a door in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this hall like ſtable and ſtorehouſe in one, were decent; and there was a compactneſs in the appearance of the whole family lying thus ſnugly together under the ſame roof, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried my fancy back to the primitive times, which probably never exiſted with ſuch a golden luſtre as the animated imagination lends, when only able to ſeize the prominent fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>At one of them, a pretty young woman, with languiſhing eyes, of celeſtial blue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us into a very neat parlour; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving how looſely, and lightly, my little girl was clad, began to pity her in the ſweeteſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, regardleſs of the roſy down of health on her cheeks. This ſame damſel was dreſſed, it was ſunday, with taſte, and even coquetry, in a cotten jacket, ornamented with knots of blue ribbon, fancifully diſpoſed to give life to her fine complexion. I loitered a little to admire her, for every geſture was graceful; and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the other villagers, ſhe looked like a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lilly ſuddenly rearing its head amongſt grain, and corn-flowers. As the houſe was ſmall, I gave her a piece of money, rather larger than it was my cuſtom to give to the female waiters; for I could not prevail on her to fit down; which ſhe received with a ſmile; yet took care to give it, in my preſence, to a girl, who had

brought the child a ſlice of bread; by which I perceived that ſhe was the miſtreſs, or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the houſe—and without doubt the <hi>belle</hi> of the village. There was, in ſhort, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of chearful induſtry, and of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of comfort which ſhut out miſery, in all the little hamlets as I approached Hamburg, which agreeably ſurpriſed me.</p>
               <p>The ſhort jackets which the women wear here, as well as in France, are not only more becoming to the perſon, but much better cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for women who have ruſtic or houſhold employment, than the long gowns worn in England, dangling in the dirt.</p>
               <p>All the inns on the road were better than I expected, though the ſoftneſs of the beds ſtill haraſſed me, and prevented my finding the reſt I was frequently in want of, to enable me to bear the fatigue of the next day.

               <p>The gates of Hamburg are ſhut at ſeven, in the winter, and nine in the ſummer, leſt ſome ſtrangers, who come to traffic in Hamburg, ſhould prefer living, and conſequently, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly do they calculate, ſpend their money out of the walls of the hamburger's world.

               <p>Madame La Fayette left altona the day I arrived, to endeavour, at Vienna, to obtain the enlargement of her huſband, or permiſſion to ſhare his priſon. She lived in a lodging up two pair of ſtairs, without a ſervant, her two daughters chearfully aſſiſting; chaſing, as well as herſelf, to deſcend to any thing before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary obligations. During her proſperity, and conſequent idleneſs, ſhe did not, I am told, enjoy a good ſtate of health, having a train of nervous complaints which, though they have not a name, unleſs the ſignificant word <hi>ennui</hi> be borrowed, had an exiſtence in the higher french circles; but adverſity and virtuous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions put theſe ills to flight, and diſpoſſeſſed her of a devil, who deſerves the appellation of legion.</p>
               <p>Madame Genlis, alſo, reſided at Altona ſome time, under an aſſumed name, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſufferers of leſs note, though higher rank. It is, in fact, ſcarcely poſſible to ſtir out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting intereſting countenances, every lineament of which tells you that they have ſeen better days.</p>
               <p>At Hamburg, I was informed, a duke had entered into partnerſhip with his cook, who

               <p>At Altona, a preſident of one of the <hi>ci-devant</hi> parliaments keeps an ordinary, in the french ſtyle; and his wife, with chearful dignity, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to her fate, though ſhe is arrived at an age when people ſeldom relinquiſh their prejudices.

This houſe was particularly recommended to me by an acquaintance of your's, the author of the American Farmer's Letters. I generally dine in company with him: and the gentleman whom I have already mentioned, is often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by our declamations againſt commerce, when we compare notes reſpecting the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtics of the hamburgers. "Why, madam," ſaid he to me one day, <q>your will not meet with a man who has any calf to his leg; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul, muſcles and heart, are equally ſhrivelled up by a thirſt of gain. There is nothing generous even in their youthful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; profit is their only ſtimulus, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations the ſole employment of their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; unleſs we except ſome groſs animal

               </p>
               <p>Perhaps you may alſo think us too ſevere; but I muſt add, that the more I ſaw of the manners of Hamburg, the more was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my opinion relative to the baleful effect of extenſive ſpeculations on the moral character. Men are ſtrange machines; and their whole ſyſtem of morality is in general held together by one grand principle, which loſes its force the moment they allow themſelves to break with impunity over the bounds which ſecured their ſelf-reſpect. A man ceaſes to love hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and then individuals, as he advances in the chaſe after wealth; as one claſhes with his intereſt, the other with his pleaſures: to buſineſs, as it is termed, every thing muſt give way; nay, is ſacrificed; and all the endearing charities of citizen, huſband, father, brother, become empty names. But—but what? Why, to ſnap the chain of thought, I muſt ſay fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. Caſſandra was not the only propheteſs whoſe warning voice has been diſregarded. How much eaſier it is to meet with love in the world, than affection!</p>

               <head>LETTER XXIV.</head>
               <p>MY lodgings at Altona are tolerably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, though not in any proportion to the price I pay; but, owing to the preſent circumſtances, all the neceſſaries of life are here extravagantly dear. Conſidering it as a temporary reſidence, the chief inconvenience of which, I am inclined to complain, is the rough ſtreets that muſt be paſſed before Marguerite and the child can reach a level road.</p>
               <p>The views of the Elbe, in the vicinity of the town, are pleaſant, particularly as the proſpects here afford ſo little variety. I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to deſcend, and walk cloſe to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter edge; but there was no path; and the ſmell of glue, hanging to dry, an extenſive manufactory of which is carried on cloſe to the beach, I found extremely diſagreeable. But to commerce every thing muſt give way; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and profit are the only ſpeculations——"double——double, toil and trouble." I have ſeldom entered a ſhady walk without being ſoon obliged to turn aſide to make room for the rope-makers; and the only tree, I have ſeen, that appeared to be planted by the hand of taſte, is in the church-yard, to ſhade the tomb of the poet Klopſtock's wife.</p>

                  <pb n="214" facs="unknown:031653_0213_0fed90622d5ee610"/>Moſt of the merchants have country houſes to retire to, during the ſummer; and many of them are ſituated on the banks of the Elbe, where they have the pleaſure of ſeeing the packet-boats arrive, the periods of moſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to divide their week.</p>
               <p>The moving picture, conſiſting of large veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and ſmall-craft, which are continually changing their poſition with the tide, renders this noble river, the vital ſtream of Hamburg, very intereſting; and the windings have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a very fine effect, two or three turns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſible, at once, interſecting the flat mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows: a ſudden bend often increaſing the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the river; and the ſilvery expanſe, ſcarcely gliding, though bearing on its boſom ſo much treaſure, looks, for a moment, like a tranquil lake.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be ſtronger than the contraſt which this flat country and ſtrand afford, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the mountains, and rocky coaſt, I have lately dwelt ſo much among. In fancy I return to a favourite ſpot, where I ſeemed to have retired from man and wretchedneſs; but the din of trade drags me back to all the care I left behind, when loſt in ſublime emotions. Rocks aſpiring towards the heavens, and, as it were, ſhutting out ſorrow, ſurrounded me, whilſt peace appeared to ſteal along the lake to calm my boſom, modulating the wind that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated the neighbouring poplars. Now I hear only an account of the tricks of trade, or liſten to the diſtreſsful tale of ſome victim of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <pb n="215" facs="unknown:031653_0214_0fed906536fc3f88"/>The hoſpitality of Hamburg is confined to ſunday invitations to the country houſes I have mentioned, when diſh after diſh ſmoaks upon the board; and the converſation ever flowing in the muddy channel of buſineſs it is not eaſy to obtain any appropriate information.

               <p>THERE is a pretty little french theatre at Altyna; and the actors are much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to thoſe I ſaw at Copenhagen. The the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres at Hamburg are not open yet, but will very ſhortly, when the ſhutting of the gates at ſeven o'clock forces the citizens to quit their country houſes.

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>PRIVATE buſineſs and cares have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo abſorbed me, as to prevent my obtaining all the information, during this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which the novelty of the ſcene would have afforded, had my attention been continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally awake to inquiry. This inſenſibility to preſent objects I have often had occaſion to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince I have been preparing theſe letters for the preſs; but, as a perſon of any thought naturally conſiders the hiſtory of a ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to contraſt the former with the preſent ſtate of its manners, a conviction of the increaſing knowledge and happineſs of the kingdoms I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through, was perpetually the reſult of my comparative reflections.</p>
            <p>The poverty of the poor, in Sweden, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the civilization very partial; and ſlavery has retarded the improvement of every claſs in Denmark; yet both are advancing; and the gigantic evils of deſpotiſm and anarchy have in a great meaſure vaniſhed before the meliorating manners of Europe. Innumerable evils ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, it is true, to afflict the human inveſtigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and hurry the benevolent reformer into a labyrinth of errour, who aims at deſtroying prejudices quickly which only time can root out, as the public opinion becomes ſubject to reaſon.</p>
            <p>An ardent affection for the human race makes enthuſiaſtic characters eager to produce altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in laws and governments prematurely. To reader them uſeful and permanent, they muſt

be the growth of each particular ſoil, and the gradual fruit of the ripening underſtanding of the nation, matured by time, not forced by an unnatural fermentation. And, to convince me that ſuch a change is gaining ground, with accelerating pace, the view I have had of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, during my northern journey, would have been ſufficient, had I not previouſly conſidered the grand cauſes which combine to carry man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind forward, and diminiſh the ſum of human miſery.</p>

               <p>NORWAY, according to geometrical meaſure, is <hi>202</hi> miles in length. In breadth it is very unequal. The common Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way mile contains <hi>24,000</hi> yards Engliſh meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Norway is reckoned to contain <hi>7558</hi> quadrate miles: it is divided into four parts. There are four grand bailiffs, and four biſhops. The four chief towns are Chriſtiania, Thordhiem, Bergen, and Chriſtianſand. Its natural products are wood, ſilver, copper, and iron, a little gold has been found, fiſh, marble, and the ſkins of ſeveral animals. The exportation exceeds the importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The balance in favour of Norway, in the year <hi>1767,</hi> was about <hi>476,085</hi> rixdollars, <hi>95, 217</hi>l ſterling. It has been increaſing ever ſince. The ſilver mines of Kongſberg yield ſilver to the amount of <hi>350,000</hi> rixdollars, <hi>70,000</hi>l. ſterling; but it is aſſerted, that this ſum is not ſufficient to defray the expences of working them. Kongſberg is the only inland town, and contains <hi>10,000</hi> ſouls.</p>
               <p>The copper mines at Rorraas yield about <hi>4000</hi> ſhip-pound a year; a ſhip-pound is <hi>320</hi> pounds: the yearly profit amounts to <hi>150,000</hi> rixdollars, <hi>30,000</hi>l. ſterling. There are fifteen or ſixteen iron works in Norway, which produce iron to the value of <hi>400,000</hi> rixdollars, <hi>80,000</hi>l. per annum.</p>

               <p>There are four regiments of dragoons, each conſiſting of <hi>108</hi> men, officers included; two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of marching infantry, <hi>1157</hi> men each, with five companies in garriſon, amounting to <hi>3377</hi> men; thirteen regiments of militia, <hi>1916</hi> men each, making <hi>24,908</hi> men, <hi>960</hi> men, light troops, who, in winter, whilſt the ſnow is on the ground, run along on a kind of ſkates—a couple of long inſtruments made of wood.</p>
