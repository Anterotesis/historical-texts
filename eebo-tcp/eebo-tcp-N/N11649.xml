            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>'THE theatre is not yet opened, wherein ſolid happineſs can be found by man.' God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſigned we ſhould enjoy compleat felicity in this ſtate of diſcipline. Every ſcene that opens upon us, in the preſent drama of human life, has in it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture of good and evil. The moſt proſperous and happy condition is attended with many unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſorrows and troubles. There is alſo a certain proportion of good to be found in the moſt adverſe and diſtreſſing circumſtances. In proſperity we find enough of evil to wean us from this world, and teach
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014723_0004_0F9486AED048B768"/>
us to ſeek for happineſs in that <hi>better country,</hi> which chriſtianity opens to our view. And in adverſity we experience ſo much of the undeſerved goodneſs of God, as affords abundant matter for thankſgiving, and lays a foundation for hope and truſt.</p>
            <p>But ſuch is the perverſeneſs of our nature, that proſperity is apt to make us forgetful of God and our future intereſts; and adverſity, to fill our minds with murmuring and deſpondency, and to turn off our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from the many mercies that are intermixed with our troubles, and which demand our grateful acknowledgments.</p>
            <p>In times of calamity, men are apt to confine their views too much to the dark ſide of things, and, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the gloomy mediums of doubt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, to wrap their minds in clouds of ominous dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and fill them with anxious anticipations of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evils, which may never happen. From hence ariſe unworthy thoughts of God and his providential government, inconſiſtent with that grateful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned frame of mind, which it becomes us as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures, and as chriſtians, to cultivate and preſerve "through all the changing ſcenes of life." Did we but frequently turn our eyes off from the dark, and fix them upon the fair and bright ſide of things, we ſhould find ourſelves ſurrounded with ſo many mercies, even in the moſt unfavourable concurrence of events, as would, at the ſame time, ſerve to mitigate our ſorrows, to excite our gratitude to God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage a religious and cheerful dependance on his providence.</p>
            <p>Though the diſpenſations of divine providence are ſometimes overcaſt with clouds and darkneſs, yet even at ſuch times, we are not left wholly deſtitute and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014723_0005_0F9486AF77A55898"/>
but have many experimental evidences of the paternal care of our heavenly father. Some rays of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs ſhine through the darkeſt ſcenes. And if, religiouſly reſigned to the will of God, we behave well, in times of trouble, we have reaſon to hope, that in the iſſue of things, good will come to us out of evil. For that God conſults the good of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not only in the mercies he beſtows, but in the evils he brings upon them, during their ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, is a truth, which no one can doubt of, who entertains juſt apprehenſions of the perfections of his nature. Juſtice and righteouſneſs are the pillars of his throne; and his dominion is founded in infinite wiſdom, equity and benevolence.</p>
            <p>But, beſides an attention to the many bleſſings, that are mingled with the troubles and afflictions of this life, it would be well for us, in all times of adverſity, diſtreſs and danger; and whenever the aſpects of providence are dark, and our minds are agitated with anxious ſollicitudes about the event of things; to turn our thoughts back upon paſt favours, and reflect on the manifold mercies we have already received. This would tend to baniſh all murmuring, diſtruſt and ill-boding apprehenſions from our minds; to awaken thoſe grateful ſentiments for favours paſt, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to prepare us for the reception of future need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mercies; and to diſpoſe us to exerciſe ſuch an humble and cheerful dependance on the goodneſs of God for all neceſſary ſuccour and relief, as would be a mighty ſupport to our ſpirits, under the moſt griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous outward trials and calamities. This, as appears from the paſſage at the head of this diſcourſe, was the method which the Pſalmiſt took, to raiſe himſelf from deſpondency, and encourage his hope in God, in a time of diſtreſs and affliction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:014723_0006_0F9486B04054EE30"/>What the particular calamities were, that the pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt here refers to, or whether they were of a publick or private nature, we cannot perhaps certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but it is plain they were ſuch as lay very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy on his mind, and cauſed him almoſt to doubt of the goodneſs of divine providence. "His complaints, as one obſerves, ſeem to be of perſonal grievances, but the encouragements relate to the public concerns of the church: If they were private troubles that he was groaning under, we are therefore taught that what God has wrought for his church in general, may be improved for the comfort of particular belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: If it was ſome public calamity, that he is here lamenting, his ſpeaking of it ſo feelingly, as if it was ſome particular trouble of his own, ſhews us how much we ſhould lay to heart the intereſts of the church of God, and make them our own."</p>
            <p>The Pſalmiſt under melancholy fears and preſages reſpecting the iſſue of his troubles, and almoſt ready to renounce his hope in God, expreſſes himſelf in the language of a diſconſolate, deſerted ſoul, walking in darkneſs, with ſcarcely one reviving ray of light, to comfort and cheer it. <hi>Will the Lord caſt off forever? And will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy clean gone forever? Doth his promiſe fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath be in anger ſhut up his tender mercies?</hi> But as he is going on in this melancholy ſtrain, he ſuddenly checks himſelf, with that word, <hi>Selah.</hi> He pauſes, and, on a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's reflection, finds that his thoughts had taken a wrong turn. <hi>This is my infirmity,</hi> ſays he; that is, theſe diſtruſtful thoughts of providence; theſe gloomy fears and apprehenſions, are owing to my weakneſs and wrong views of things. And in order to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf from this ſtate of dejection, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his truſt in God for deliverance, he calls to mind
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014723_0007_0F9486B107ABBAD8"/>
his paſt favours and loving-kindneſſes. <hi>I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the years of the right hand of the Moſt High. I will remember the works of the Lord; ſurely I will remember thy wonders of old,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The text does therefore, naturally ſuggeſt the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing obſervation, viz. That in times of trouble, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and danger, a grateful commemoration of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inſtances of divine mercy and goodneſs, would be of excellent ſervice, to keep us from deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to encourage a cheerful hope in God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on his providence for all needed ſalvation.</p>
            <p>I preſume, my hearers, you all believe that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God preſides over the world, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in all human affairs; that all ſecond cauſes and ſubordinate agents are ſubject to his government; that no events happen contrary to, or beſide his will, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive or permiſſive; that riches, and honour, and proſperity, come from him; and that all adverſities and calamities, whether public or private, are order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. Without ſuch a faith as this, we cannot take a ſingle ſtep towards a religious improvement, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mercies or afflictions. Such a faith is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to lay a foundation for gratitude in proſperity, and for reſignation and truſt in God in adverſity. This faith is the ſupport of good men, amidſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions and diſorders, the wars, tumults and revolutions of this world, and in all times of hazard and danger. Such men, believing that all things are ſubject to the ſuperintending providence of God, infinitely wiſe and infinitely gracious, cheerfully refer themſelves to his mercy, in confidence that he will ſo diſpoſe events, as ſhall be for their intereſt and advantage, on the whole. Upon the wiſdom, power, and goodneſs of God, they depend; and are ready to ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>God is our refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014723_0008_0F9486B2F6077B60"/>
help in trouble: therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midſt of the ſea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, and the mountains ſhake with the ſwelling thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is an immutable being. He is <hi>the ſame yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to-day, and forever; without any variableneſs, or ſhadow of turning.</hi> Unchangeable in his nature and perfections, his power, wiſdom and goodneſs endure forever. And therefore, as in his paſt dealings with us, he hath given a full demonſtration of his infinite benevolence, and the brighteſt evidences of his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpoſition towards us, it becomes us, while with gratitude we recollect the ſame, from thence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ourſelves ſtill to hope and truſt in him, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difficulties and troubles, we may be involved in.</p>
            <p>We ſhort-ſighted mortals can ſee but little way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vaſt ſcheme of divine providence. There are no certain principles upon which we can proceed in calculating the revolutions of the ſecret wheels there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. We are unable to trace things into their various connections, or to look forward into all their remote and diſtant conſequences The moſt perplexed and calamitous circumſtances, and gloomieſt appearances of things, are no ſure indications of God's having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken us finally. In the hidden, and to us uncertain connection of events, the moſt afflictive diſpenſations of providence, may be beſt adapted to promote our well-being. As God treats us as beings in a ſtate of trial and diſcipline, ſo it cannot be reaſonably doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he will order all events reſpecting us, in ſuch a manner, as his infinite wiſdom ſhall ſee beſt calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to promote our happineſs, taking our preſent and future exiſtence into one connected view. In this view, the troubles and calamities, which we meet
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014723_0009_0F9486B345C5B110"/>
with in this world, may be conſidered as diſciplinary corrections, proceeding from the mercy of God, who hath aſſured us, that, although for the preſent, they are not <hi>joyous</hi> but <hi>grievous,</hi> yet, if we improve them aright, they will finally <hi>work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Nor have thoſe things which are grievous to us, for the preſent, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial tendency in reference to our future ſtate on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but they may alſo be meant for our good even in this world, and be deſigned in providence to prepare the way for our greater proſperity and outward feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. The good patriarch, Jacob, when he cried out, <hi>All theſe things are againſt me,</hi> little thought how wonderfully providence was working for the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf and his family.</p>
            <p>Whatever unfavourable concluſions, any perſons, in the deſpondency and dejection of their ſpirits, may draw from the publick troubles we are now involved in, the ſupreme. Governor of all things may have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them for the opening a way for the exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the American colonies to the higheſt pitch of glory, honour, opulence, and renown.

            <p>But whatever favourable or unfavourable conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures any one may make, we know that the event of things is in the hands of God. We are unable to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the volumes of futurity; and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with infallible certainty determine, what will be the iſſue of the preſent civil commotions and hoſtile conteſts. However, let us, this day, in imitation of the Pſalmiſt, by a grateful recollection of paſt favours, cheer and encourage our hearts, and endeavour to raiſe our confidence in Almighty God, the ſupreme diſpoſer of all events, who can eaſily break in pieces that yoke of bondage, which is prepared for our necks.

            <p>When we conſider that the grand motive, which induced our forefathers to leave their native country, and to tranſplant themſelves into the uncultivated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts of America, where they were ſure of meeting with the greateſt hardſhips and difficulties in acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a comfortable ſubſiſtence, was a love of liberty, the bleſſings whereof they were not permitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy on cheaper terms: When we conſider alſo the many indubitable proofs, which the American colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have given, from the beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of their loyalty and firm allegiance to the Britiſh ſovereigns, and their warm affection for the parent-ſtate; and likewiſe that Great-Britain has been amply repaid for all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence ſhe has ever been at in protecting them, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating and reſtricting their commerce in ſuch a manner, as to ſecure the principal advantages and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits thereof to herſelf:—When we conſider theſe things, how unjuſt and cruel muſt it appear in her, to attempt to deprive us of our dearly bought and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forfeited liberty, and reduce us to ſervitude and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage? Will ſhe never let us reſt in peace, until we come to that place where all <hi>the weary are at reſt</hi>? Is it not enough that ſhe drove out our progenitors by the iron rod of tyranny and oppreſſion, and forced them to flee for refuge into the howling wilderneſs of America? Will ſhe alſo purſue us, their poſterity, into theſe remote regions, to chaſtiſe us with the ſame iron rod, for no other fault than that of being a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and being reſolved to continue ſo?

            <p>Depotiſm has for ſome time been advancing with alarming ſtrides againſt American liberty.

ſubjects, for the baſe purpoſe of enſlaving them. They have wantonly ravaged and deſtroyed ſome of our maritime towns. Our capital, once the ſeat of peace, proſperity and opulence, wreſted from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per owners, they have made the ſeat of violence and all the rigours of military deſpotiſm. Many of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, driven from thence and from other ſea-ports, have been obliged to ſeek an aſylum in the country, from the unprovoked inſults and outrages of theſe inſtruments of miniſterial vengeance and ambition. Some of our brave ſons have been ſlain in battle, whoſe memories are dear to us, for having fallen in defence of their country. Unwearied pains have been taken to rouſe the Canadians and the ſavages of the wilderneſs againſt us, and excite them to fall on our frontiers. In ſhort, every iniquitous method hath been attempted, for bringing ſlavery and miſery upon us.</p>
            <p>But God hath not forſaken us in theſe times of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and danger. He hath ſhewn mercy to us in a variety of inſtances. Many beams of his goodneſs have ſhone upon us through theſe dark ſcenes. The Canadians and ſavage Indians hath he inſpired with friendly diſpoſitions, and defeated all attempts to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to draw the ſword againſt us. Our Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern expedition hath he remarkably proſpered, giving into our hands many important forts and garriſons of our enemies, and enabling us to penetrate into the heart of Canada.

And though they may boaſt of victory in the never to be forgotten battle of Charleſtown, yet it was bought at the expence of ſo many lives on their ſide, that a few more ſuch victories would prove their total defeat.</p>
            <p>It alſo demands our grateful notice, that the ſupreme diſpoſer of all things, who has acceſs to all minds, and influences them as he pleaſes, has inſpired the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies with one heart and one ſoul; and by inkindling within them that ardent love of liberty, which glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the breaſts of the firſt ſettlers of this country, and which has all along been a diſtinguiſhing charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic of New-Englad, has diſpoſed them to unite as a band of brethren, for the defence of their common liberties and privileges, againſt the hoſtile invaſions of arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>It becomes us alſo, with thankful hearts, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the goodneſs of God to us, in beſtowing on us a great variety of private perſonal bleſſings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the public calamities which have fallen upon us. Amidſt the dark aſpects of providence, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to our public affairs, we have enjoyed competent ſupplies of food and raiment, and been favoured, not only with the neceſſaries, but with many of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and pleaſant enjoyments of life. And although in addition to our other troubles, God has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this year to ſend the peſtilence into many of our towns, whereby we have been bereaved of many of our dear friends and relatives, and to viſit us with a ſevere drought, which prevailed for a while, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us with famine; yet through his good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the voice of health is again reſtored, and the earth has yielded her increaſe in ſufficient plenty for the comfortable ſupply of all our wants.</p>
            <p>It likewiſe deſerves our moſt grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that God has not yet permitted our religious

privileges to be formally invaded; and that we have hitherto quietly enjoyed his word and ordinances, and been allowed to worſhip him agreable to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
            <p>Theſe, with many other inſtances of divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which every grateful ſoul will naturally recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, are plain evidences, that God hath not <hi>forgotten to be gracious</hi>; and they call for our devout and thankful acknowlegdments this day.</p>

All the boaſted omnipotence of Britain, which has been thundered in our ears, in order to intimidate us into a tame ſurrender of our privileges, we know, is as nothing in compariſon with the power of the Lord God of Hoſts, who can accompliſh his purpoſes, in ſpite of the utmoſt oppoſition of earth and hell.

It concerns us the efore to give all dilligence to ſecure his friendſhip and patronage, by repentence and a cheerful ſubmiſſion to his laws and authority. Our preſent troubles are indications of his diſpleaſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, as a people, for our ſins. By them he is now calling upon us to forſake our ſins and amend our lives, that iniquity may not prove our ruin. If we hearken to his monitory warning voice, and reform, we may hope that he will ſoon <hi>cauſe his face to ſhine</hi> upon us, and ſcatter the preſent gloomy ſhades of night by the return of a bright and joyful day. For this is his language; <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it: If that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we look above inſtruments to the ſupreme diſpoſer of all events, we muſt acknowledge that we are juſtly dealt with, in the troubles that have been brought upon us. <hi>For, ſhall not the judge of all the earth do right?</hi> We know that it is impoſſible for him to do otherwiſe. The moſt intricate footſteps of his providence are agreable to the everlaſting rules of righteouſneſs, and would appear ſo to us, had we a thorough comprehenſion of the whole ſcheme of his <hi>moral government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though we muſt acknowledge our troubles to be juſt conſidered as ordered by God, yet have we reaſon to accuſe the <hi>inſtruments</hi> thereof of <hi>great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and cruelty.</hi> I truſt we can ſafely appeal to that Being, <hi>who ſearches all hearts,</hi> to witneſs for our ſincerity, when we declare, that we have deſired
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014723_0017_0F9486BD0FFE9AC0"/>
no more than the peaceable enjoyment of our juſt rights and liberties. The invaſion of theſe, in viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſacred ſecurity of charters founded on royal faith, is the ſole ground of the preſent reſiſtance of America. The charges of diſloyalty and rebellious diſpoſitions, that have been brought againſt us, have had no foundation, but in the calumnies of enemies. Though I will not vouch for the effects of the deſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration into which the colonies are now driven, yet I will venture to affirm that their reſiſtance to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of adminiſtration, did not originate from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of independancy. They had it not even in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation to break their connection with Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. On the contrary, it has been their warmeſt wiſh, to live in friendly union with her, might they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to do ſo, without a reſignation of their invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rights. Had ſhe adhered to that true art of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which, as the Biſhop of St. Aſaph obſerves, lies in <hi>not governing too much,</hi> they would never have made any reſiſtance. But when ſhe had puſhed things to ſuch an extremity, that there was no other alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, but either ſuch conceſſions and ſubmiſſions as they plainly perceived would be fatal to their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or reſiſtance; impreſſed with a ſenſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of freedom, they chooſe the latter.</p>
            <p>However bad we may be in a moral view, yet we are perſwaded our cauſe is good. Happy would it be for us, if we had the ſatisfaction of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God, as we have of a good cauſe. The cauſe in which we are engaged, is the ſame, for which our worthy anceſtors ſacrificed every thing elſe that was dear to them. For the ſake of Liberty they quitted their tendereſt connections and the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt delights of life, and voluntarily expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all hazards, and encountered all perils and difficulties. And the Almighty manifeſted his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014723_0018_0F9486BDC1073AB8"/>
of their cauſe, by remarkably ſupporting and proſpering their noble exertions. From hence we have reaſon to hope that he will alſo graciouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for us, and eſpouſe our cauſe, if we put our truſt in him, and pay him due acknowledgments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
            <p>Time would fail me to recount the wonders, which God hath wrought for his <hi>American Iſrael</hi> in times paſt; how he ſhielded them againſt the rage of the Savages of the wilderneſs; and cauſed them, when few in number, to triumph over their numerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; how often he relieved them in diſtreſſes, and protected them in dangers, and interpoſed to defeat the crafty policies and miſchievous machinations of thoſe that roſe up againſt them; how wonderfully he provided for them in all their ſtraits, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened them to overcome difficulties, to human appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance unſurmountable: But there are two remarkable inſtances of the goodneſs of providence towards this land, which, at ſuch a day as this, it may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to call to remembrance, in order to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our hope and truſt in God; I mean, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the arbitrary ſchemes of that tyrannical deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot, James the ſecond, under the adminiſtration of Sir Edmond Andros, about ninety years ago; and the defeat of the French fleet and army, at Chebuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tah, about thirty years ſince.</p>
            <p>The firſt charter of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, with other charters of the New-England provinces, having been unrighteouſly <note n="*" place="bottom">After a Quo-Warranto was iſſued againſt their charter, the Maſſachuſetts province were cited by a writ of Scire Facias to appear at Weſtminſter to make their defence; but the time allowed them was ſo ſhort, that before they received the Scire Facias, the caſe was decided againſt them. Though it was ſtrongly urged in the Court of Chancery, that in the time given it was impoſſible to have a return from New-England, and that as they had not given time long enough, it was, in effect, giving no time at all, yet the court, being predetermined, decreed the Charter ſurfeited ON DEFAULT OF APPEAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANCE.

and properties of the inhabitants, became ſubject to the abſolute diſpoſal of the government at home, which was ſufficiently inclined to tyranny. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, James the ſecond, an avowed papiſt, a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ceded to the throne, whoſe reign was diſtinguiſhed, by his reſolute endeavours to baniſh liberty from his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and enſlave all his ſubjects. In 1686 he ſent Sir Edmond Andros to execute his tyrannical ſchemes in New-England. No ſooner had Sir Edmond arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Boſton, and entered on his government, but, (as it is no unuſual thing for the greateſt tyrants to do) he made high profeſſions of regard for the publick good and the welfare of the people. But "<hi>Nero concealed his tyrannical diſpoſition more years, than Sir Edmond did months. It was not long before the caſe of ſome, who apprehended themſelves to be oppreſſed, came under conſideration, and one of the council told them that they muſt not think the privileges of Engliſhmen would follow them to the end of the world.—Men's titles to their eſtates were declared of no value, and they were called upon to purchaſe new patents.—The people were menaced that their meeting-houſes ſhould be taken from them, and the public worſhip, in the congregational way, ſhould not be tolerated.</hi>—The <hi>Governor threatned to puniſh any man who gave two-pence towards the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a non-conformiſt miniſter." "Some churches who had agreed to ſet a-part days of thankſgiving on a particular occaſion, were told, that they ſhould meet at their peril, and that ſoldiers ſhould be ſent to guard their meeting-houſes</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe things are related on the authority of one of our own Hiſtorians, who, it may be preſumed, would not exaggerate the methods take on the ſide of government to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the liberties of the people, ſince in a letter to a member of parliament, relative to the preſent diſputes, he gives it as his opinion, that THERE MUST BE AN ABRIDG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT OF WHAT ARE CALLED ENGLISH LIBERTIES.</note>."</p>
            <p>The inſults and oppreſſions of Sir Edmond's admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration at length became intolerable. The people, exaſperated beyond all patience, flew to arms, ſeized

the Governor with many others who had been aiding to his arbitrary meaſures, being reſolved, at all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, if poſſible, to tear from their necks that griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous yoke of bondage, that was put upon them. What would have been the effect of the people's riſing and taking arms on this occaſion, had James accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his arbitrary deſigns in Great-Britain, we cannot tell. The vengeance of that haughty deſpot would, no doubt, have attempted ſome ſevere puniſhment. But Heaven prevented. For providence ordering a Revolution <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>The people of England, provoked at the arbitrary meaſures of James the ſecond, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their oppoſition to ſuch an height, that he, through fear, left the kingdom; upon which, declaring the throne vacant, and excluding James and his family, they put the ſceptre into the hands of William, Prince of Orange, and changed the line of ſucceſſion.</p>
                  <p>And it may be obſerved in juſtification of America, that the principles upon which this memorable revolution was conducted and brought about, and the principles upon which ſhe reſiſts and oppoſes the unlimited claims of the Britiſh legiſlature, are much the ſame. For as it matters not whether ſlavery comes from the hands of one or of many, ſo the ſame reaſon that will juſtify a people in oppoſing arbitrary power in a ſingle man, will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually hold to juſtify them in oppoſing the ſame kind of power in a number of men. No one, I believe, is poſſeſſed of ſuch an acute diſcernment, as to be able to perceive any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difference between being ſubject to unlimited deſpotiſm in a ſingle perſon, under the title of abſolute monarch, and being ſubject to the like deſpotic power claimed by a far diſtant legiſlature, in which we are not repreſented. A right in the Britiſh parliament to legiſlate for us 'in all caſes whatſoever,' as a ſenſible writer obſerves, "Would place us in the ſame ſituation the people of England would have been reduced to, had James the firſt and his family ſucceeded in their ſchemes of arbitrary power. Changing the word STUARTS for PARLIAMENT, and BRITONS for AMERICANS, the arguments of the illuſtrious patriots of thoſe times, apply with an expreſſible force and appoſiteneſs, in maintainance of our cauſe, and in refutation of the pretenſions ſet up by then too forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful poſterity over their unhappy coloniſts." And when we conſider, that on the principles of the revolution, which are evidently in favour of America, his preſent Majeſty's right to the throne depends; is there not reaſon to ſuſpect, that the movers and abettors of the preſent oppreſsive and violent meaſures proſecuted againſt the colonies, (however free they are to charge us with diſloyalty) are themſelves Jacobites in heart; and have had it in view, firſt to produce a rupture between Britain and America, and then to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereof, to introduce the Pretender, and advance the Stuart family to its ancient dignity!</p>
               </note> in England about the ſame time, the power of oppreſſion was broken, and this people were happily delivered from the ſad effects of enraged ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, which they might otherwiſe have feared, and reſtored to the peaceable enjoyment of the bleſſings of liberty <note n="‡" place="bottom">Though the people of this province had reaſon to rejoice with others, in the happy revelation, that was brought about in England, whereby they were delivered from the tyranny of the Stuart family, yet they never recovered their firſt charter, which ought in equity to have been reſtored, ſince it was unjuſtly wreſted from them, in arbitrary times, when many other charters, which were afterwards reſtored, fell a ſacrifice to lawleſs power and ambition. However, they obtained another charter, which, though it abridged ſome of their former privileges, was yet ſo favourable to their liberties as Engliſhmen, that they cheerfully accepted the ſecurity it promiſed them againſt all future encroachments on their rights.

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:014723_0021_0F9486BFF4951AF8"/>This deliverance ought ever to be remembered by us with gratitude to the <hi>Moſt High, who ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whomſoever he pleaſeth.</hi> And it ſhould encourage us to put our truſt in the Almighty, who is able to defeat the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſchemes of thoſe, who without cauſe have riſen up againſt us, and to return their oppreſſions on their own heads.</p>
            <p>The other remarkable inſtance of God's merciful interpoſition for the ſalvation of New-England, which deſerves our grateful commemoration, is the defeat of the French fleet and army at Chebuctah, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty years ago. This armament was the moſt powerful that ever before was ſent to America. It conſiſted, ſays a credible writer, of "twenty men of war, an hundred tranſports, about eight thouſand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined troops with veteran officers, and vaſt quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of proviſion, powder, ſhot, arms, cannon, bombs and mortars, ſufficient to take the ſtrongeſt places; and all under one commander of figure, Duke D'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, a nobleman of ability, ſkill and courage." And New-England was then in a weak and defenceleſs ſtate, unable to withſtand ſuch a mighty force. But the Lord God omnipotent interpoſed, and marvellouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defeated this formidable armada. He cauſed <hi>the ſtars in their courſes to fight againſt them,</hi> as they did againſt Siſera of old. The winds and ſeas were muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered againſt them; the peſtilence was commiſſioned to invade their hoſt; innumerable blocks and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen croſs accidents were thrown in their way; by all which, they were baffled, confounded, defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014723_0022_0F9486C0CE1D01B0"/>
and obliged to return aſhamed, with a wretched remnant, to their own country. Thus ſalvation was wrought for us in a moſt miraculous manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the inſtrumentality of human means. This was the <hi>Lord's doing,</hi> and it ought always to be <hi>marvelous in our eyes.</hi> And this may teach us that the events of war, are not always agreable to human conjectures and probabilities, but at God's diſpoſal, who can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, by ways and means little thought of by men, diſconcert the beſt concerted human ſchemes, and cruſh into abortion the unrighteous enterprizes of his people's enemies.</p>
            <p>Now, when we recollect theſe and ſuch-like ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal interpoſitions of divine providence in favour of New-England and America, what abundant reaſon have we to hope and truſt in God, in the preſent dark and difficult day? However great the power or policy of our enemies may be, ſtill we have this to comfort us, that <hi>the Lord reigneth,</hi> who is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the deepeſt policies of men, to turn their wiſeſt counſels into fooliſhneſs, to overthrow all their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous devices, and entangle them in the ſnares, which they have prepared for others. The wrath of man is under his controul; he ſetteth bounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and ſaith, <hi>thus far ſhalt thou come, but no further.</hi> Whatever men may deſign, or attempt, <hi>the counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand.</hi> And from what he has done for his American heritage in times paſt, we have reaſon to hope that he will never ſuffer it to be given up to reproach and ruin, but will ſtill protect and defend it, and fruſtrate all the evil deſigns of its enemies, if prevailing ſin does not obſtruct the courſe of his mercy.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of Liberty, is the cauſe of learning, arts, virtue and religion,

            <p>Slavery tends directly to increaſe the degeneracy of human nature, and to extinguiſh every ſpark of genius: It is the prolific ſource of ignorance, groſs ſuperſtition, and ſavage barbariſm: It is the bane of all ſocial virtues, a mortal enemy to the liberal arts and ſciences, and to <hi>pure and undefiled religion.</hi> The cauſe of liberty is therefore the cauſe of God. And if we do not exclude ourſelves from his favour by incorrigible wickedneſs, we may reaſonably hope that he will eventually ſucceed our exertions in this noble cauſe, either by inſpiring the minds of our unnatural enemies with ſuch peaceable diſpoſitions, as may lay a foundation for a juſt and amicable accommodation; or by throwing ſuch inſuperable obſtacles in their way, as ſhall compel them to lay aſide their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſchemes, and permit us again, in tranquillity, to enjoy that freedom, to which we have an unalienable right, founded in the great charter of our being. If we <hi>order our converſation aright,</hi> and humbly ſeek to God for help and deliverance, we cannot hope for too much from his providence. If we will but amend our ways, and imitate the piety of our worthy anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, we ſhall have grounds to hope, as our cauſe is good, that God will appear for us, as he often did for them, and cauſe us to <hi>ſee his ſalvation.</hi>

            <p>Were our noble anceſtors, who came over to this country for the ſake of liberty, to riſe from their graves, and make their appearance on the ſtage, at this day; with what inflamed indignation would they behold that ſyſtem of oppreſſion and ſlavery, which has been lately formed againſt New-England and America, and which has forced people, though with reluctant hearts, to take arms for their defence? How would their generous ſouls be fired with honeſt

reſentment at the arbitrary ſchemes, and ſanguinary violent meaſures of the Britiſh miniſtry, deſigned to rob their poſterity of that ineſtimable patrimony of liberty, which at the deareſt rate they obtained for them, and tranſmitted down to them, to be by them inviolably preſerved, and handed from one generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to another, to the end of time! With what pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſatisfaction and ſmiling approbation, would they behold their ſons, warmed with the ſame ſacred flame of liberty, which once animated their breaſts, zealouſly exerting themſelves in freedom's noble cauſe, and earneſtly contending for the defence and ſupport of their invaded rights! And while with pity they beheld thoſe ſervile timid ſpirits, who, rather than engage in any noble exertion or tempt any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard for the ſake of freedom, would Iſſachar-like, baſely <hi>bow their ſhoulders to bear, and become ſervants unto tribute</hi>; with what ſovereign contempt would they look down on thoſe venal ſordid few, who, in hopes of aggrandizing themſelves, and rioting in the ſpoils of injured and oppreſſed innocence, have been inculcating the long exploded and treaſonable <note n="*" place="bottom">If the doctrine of unlimited ſubmiſſion and paſſive obedience to the POWERS IN BEING, be once admitted as juſt and reaſonable, it will follow by inevitable conſequence, that the laſt revolution in England was a grand rebellion; and that all who had an hand in it, were rebels and traitors; and that all the Kings who have reigned ſince that time in Great-Britain, deſerve the title of uſurpors.</note> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance, and aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the utmoſt of their power, the unconſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal meaſures of adminiſtration, for the enſlaving, and ruining their native country? And with what ardor and earneſtneſs, would they warn us againſt ſubmitting to any yoke of bondage, and enjoin it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to ſtand faſt in our liberties, and to perſevere in our laudible ſtruggles for the defence and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them!—Methinks I hear theſe brave and venerable perſonages, beſpeaking us in the following ſtrain; "We fled from our native land for the ſake
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014723_0025_0F9486C6AEEC96A8"/>
of liberty, which we eſteemed the ſovereign boon of Heaven, and deareſt of all outward enjoyments: For the ſake of this ineſtimable bleſſing, we croſſed the dangerous ſeas, and took up our reſidence in this then uncultivated wilderneſs: For the ſake of this invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enjoyment, we expended our treaſure, endured all fatigues and hardſhips, and often jeoparded our lives in bloody wars with the ſavage natives: We have ſuffered every thing in the cauſe of freedom— for this we have fought—for this we have bled. You have entered into our labours, and without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expoſed to any great hardſhips and dangers, have enjoyed, till lately, the benign ſmiles of liberty, which coſt us ſo much toil and blood. But now the day of trial is come. That infernal monſter, Slavery, from which we fled, not diſcouraged by former unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attempts, has again in great wrath, croſſed the Atlantic, determined, if poſſible, to erect his throne on theſe weſtern ſhores. Be not daunted at his hedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous form, nor affrighted at his menaces. Oppoſe him as a fiend of hell. Collect all your zeal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution into one united and vigorous effort, to expel him from hence. Quit yourſelves like men; be brave; be courageous; be determined, would you be free. Liberty is the legacy, the rich legacy, which we have bequeathed to you, under a ſacred entail, to be by you conveyed inviolate to your poſterity. Let it never be ſaid of our ſons that they have baſely given up this legacy, and puſillanimouſly ſubmitted their necks to the iron yoke of bondage. Let it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſaid of our ſons, that they conſented to live in thraldom themſelves, and to leave a race of ſlaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. Diſgrace not your noble parentage; bring not everlaſting infamy upon yourſelves, and perpetual miſery upon your deſcendants, by any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions pernicious to liberty. Be not diſmayed at the appearance of dangers and difficulties, but with
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014723_0026_0F9486C6CCEA36A0"/>
fortitude and heroiſm becoming the importance of the cauſe, continue your zealous endeavours, to ſave yourſelves, your country and poſterity from impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervitude. And for your encouragement, <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the years of the right hand of the Moſt High,</hi> and call to mind the many wonders which he has wrought in times paſt, in favour of his church and people in this land; and conſider that <hi>his arm is not ſhortned that he cannot ſave,</hi> but that he is as able to help and deliver you, as he was your forefathers. Make him your friend and ally, and apply to him for aid, and doubt not, but he will interpoſe, to divert the evils that are levelled againſt you, to baniſh ſervitude far from you, and to ſucceed and proſper your laudible conteſts for the maintaining and ſecuring the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of freedom. May <hi>the Lord of Hoſts be with you,</hi> and <hi>the God of Jacob be your refuge.</hi>"</p>
            <p>In imitation of our pious progenitors, let us, while we are in the uſe of all natural and lawful means of defence and ſafety, put our truſt in God, the only hope and ſaviour of his people in times of trouble. And while we refer our cauſe to him, let us take care to approve ourſelves to him, by a conſcientious obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his holy will, as we deſire that he ſhould eſpouſe our cauſe, and ſecure to us thoſe outward li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and privileges, for which we are now earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contending. Let us be thankful to him for ſuch mercies as we have received and ſtill enjoy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our gratitude by a pious and holy converſation. Whatever bleſſings he is pleaſed to beſtow upon us, let us improve to his honour, with ſobriety and thankſgiving. Let us beware of pride, and cautiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſlain from intemperance, prodigality and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance, vices, which, as they are contrary to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of religion, and highly provoking to Heaven, ſo they alſo, in the natural courſe of things, tend to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014723_0027_0F9486C7D0B6C348"/>
bring poverty and ruin upon a people; and which, we have reaſon to think, have had a great hand in pulling down the preſent calamities upon us. Let us, in our manner of living, confine ourſelves to the ſtricteſt rules of frugality and prudential oeconomy, as being highly ornamental to chriſtians; greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the proſperity of ſociety, at all times; and peculiarly neceſſary at ſuch a day as this. And to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and oeconomy let us add induſtry, and then, while we are bleſſed with the common ſmiles of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, we need not fear being ſtarved into ſlavery, in ſuch a land of plenty as this. The ſimplicity of living which obtained among our forefathers in the early age of this country, much reſembling the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the patriarchal ages, was much better adapted to promote temporal felicity, than the luxury, which, with the increaſe of wealth, has ſince taken place and prevailed. Nature is content with little. It is comparatively eaſy to ſupply the neceſſities of nature; but to ſatisfy pride is impoſſible. Pride introduces luxury and expenſive ways of living; and cuſtom gives ſuch a currency to ſuperfluities, that frugality can ſcarcely eſcape the odious epithets of meanneſs and avarice. But by whatever hard names it may be called, frugality is a virtue of high importance to a people's proſperity; and therefore, as we wiſh well to our country, in the preſent troubleſome times, it behoves us to retrench our extravagancies and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous expences; to drop foreign luxuries; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ourſelves, as much as poſſible, to our own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, and the productions of our own land. This is what providence is now inculcating upon us, by the obſtructions thrown in the way of foreign commerce. And happy ſhall we be, and abundant reaſon ſhall we have to give thanks to God, if we can enjoy our liberty, though we ſhould be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of thoſe foreign ſuperfluities, which have been
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014723_0028_0F9486C862A22660"/>
generally too ſhamefully abuſed as occaſions of pride and vanity.</p>
            <p>But let us, my hearers, more eſpecially take care to make a wiſe improvement of our religious advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and privileges, which, through the goodneſs of God, have been hitherto preſerved to us entire. Let us live up to our obligations as chriſtians, and by a diligent improvement of the means of grace, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make ſeaſonable preparation for a bleſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality in the world to come. This world, at beſt, is a <hi>vale of tears.</hi> Many are the unavoidable ſorrows and infelicities, that flow from the frailties of our frame, and the precarious unſtable nature of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyments; much greater and more numerous are the troubles, vexations and woes, that flow from the ungoverned luſts of men, which are an unhappy ſource of perpetual diſcord, variance, ſtrife, rapine, violence and war. But we are aſſured that there is a better world, prepared beyond the grave, for all good men, where they ſhall be exempt from all evil, and enjoy compleat and endleſs felicity. Thither let us ſoar in our affections; thither let us bend our courſe; and to prepare therefor let us make the main buſineſs of our lives. If we will do thus, the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of future bleſſedneſs and glory, which, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing brightneſs will open to our view, will great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleviate and aſſuage the ſorrows of this life, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us conſolation amidſt all the afflictions and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations of this troubleſome tranſitory world.</p>
            <p>Religion, my friends, the religion of Jeſus imbib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the heart, and reduced to practice, is the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel through which the greateſt comforts that can be enjoyed on earth, are conveyed unto men. This will give us hope in God, and quiet repoſe under the wings of his mercy, in times of the greateſt trouble
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014723_0029_0F9486C9046AA550"/>
and danger. This will give us liberty of a far more noble and happifying nature, than that outward civil liberty for which we are contending, this day. This will free us from the tyrannical dominion of our luſts and paſſions, and advance us to the <hi>glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the children of God,</hi> wherein the perfection and happineſs of human nature conſiſt, and without which, we ſhall be ſlaves, how much ſoever we may hate the name. This, in fine, will afford us great joys, in the views of divine favour, here; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way for our admiſſion to <hi>joys unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> to joys uninterrupted, everlaſting, and adequate to our capacities, in the beatific preſence of God, hereafter. AMEN.</p>
