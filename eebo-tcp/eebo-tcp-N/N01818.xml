            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN his Nature, Man was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in more eſpecially advanced, that he was endued with an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Reaſonable Soul, and ſo made capable of acting as a Cauſe by Counſel, and of governing his Inferiour Powers by Moral Principles and Rules; and

               </gap> Man in <hi>Making</hi> him ſuch an Excellent Creature; ſo He has done the like alſo in the way of his <hi>Dealing with</hi> him, ever ſince He firſt gave him his Being.</p>
            <p>THUS GOD has done, while He has continually treated Man as a Creature, in reſpect of his natural Powers, capable of underſtanding his own Duty, and of aiming at his proper End, of chooſing his own way, and weighing the Obligations which he lieth under, to ſerve the Lord; and of conſidering the Equity of His Dealings with him, and purſuing thoſe things that are of the greateſt Importance and Advantage to him.</p>
            <p>ONE Inſtance of GOD's dealing thus with Men we have in the Words now under Conſideration. Towards the beginning of the Chapter, He does by the Prophet Expoſtulate with His Covenant People of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> on the Account of their many heinous Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; and in particular He upbraids them with the want of Conſideration, as the Cauſe of all their other Miſcarriages. Verſe 3. <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Aſs his Maſters crib; but Iſrael doth not know, my People doth not conſider.</hi> He blames them for this, That tho' they were Rational Creatures, yet they did not improve their Reaſon and Underſtanding as they ought to do.</p>
            <p>FROM the 5th to the 9th Verſe, He declareth unto them what heavy Judgments they had expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto by their Iniquities; and becauſe they were too apt to Plead their own Righteouſneſs, in reſpect
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002152_0004_0FBC77EB86BC3E40"/>
of the many Outward Religious Services, which they Performed; GOD does from Verſe 10. to 15. reject all theſe Services of theirs as vain and unacceptable to Him, becauſe while they performed them, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill in their wicked and moſt abominable Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices. He therefore exhorts them unto Repentance and Reformation, as the ſure and only way to eſcape His Judgments, and come to enjoy His Favour, from Verſ. 16. to 19.</p>
            <p>AND whereas this People were often too ready to think GOD dealt hardly with them, when their Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Performances found no acceptance with Him, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, ſay they, and thou ſeeſt it not,</hi> &amp;c. He offereth in the Wards before us to argue the Caſe with them, and invites them as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures, to a Rational Diſcuſſion of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Controverſy betwixt Him and them, that ſo He might in this way clear up the Equity of His Dealings with them, and make it evident that the Terms of Peace were very reaſonable, yea very gracious, which He now propounded to them.</p>
            <p>I am not now to conſider the matter then in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy betwixt GOD and that People; but the Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, which the Lord was pleaſed to give them to come to a fair Debate upon the Point, <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE meaning of the Words is not, that GOD would Viſibly appear to them, and Diſpute with them Face to Face, as one Man Diſputes with another, (though there ſeems to be in the Words an Alluſion unto ſuch a Diſpute) but GOD here ſpeaks unto His People after the manner of Men, and the deſign of His Words is to ſignify to them that as He had to do with reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures; ſo His Dealings with them were ſuch as Reaſon would juſtifie and diſcover to be moſt juſt and equal, yea and exceeding Merciful alſo, as they themſelves, upon a due Improvement of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding might evidently ſee.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002152_0005_0FBC77ED0A44B538"/>THE DOCTRINE I would obſerve from the Words is this, <hi>Viz.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>FOR the clearing up of this Truth, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, 1. <hi>To ſhew that GOD doth indeed thus Deal with Men.</hi> 2. <hi>To give ſome Reſons why He does ſo.</hi>

               <p>As,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance,</hi> 1. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <hi>In that He taketh Care, and uſeth Means to inſtruct them in Sublime and Excellent Myſteries, which only Rational and Intelligent Beings can uderſtand.</hi> Very Great and Excellent are the Myſteries which the Bleſſed GOD is in the way of His Dealing with the Children of Men, taking Care to Inſtruct them in. 1 Tim 3.16. <hi>Without controverſy great is the Miſtery of Godlineſs, God was manifeſt in the Fleſh, justified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, believed on in the World, received up into Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Doctrine of the Trinity in the Unity of the Godhead, and of the Decrees of GOD and His Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the Incarnation of the Son of GOD; and the way of Redemption and Salvation by Him, and the like; are Myſteries very wonderful indeed. They are Myſteries which the <hi>Angels deſire to look into,</hi> 1 Pet 2.12 They are fitly called, <hi>The deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor 2.10</p>
               <p>BUT ſuch things as theſe, GOD is pleaſed to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king known unto Men, by His Word written in the Holy Scriptures; and by His Miniſters, whom he ſends to explain His Oracles unto them. <hi>He hath written
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002152_0006_0FBC77EE84524708"/>
to them the great things of His Law,</hi> Hoſ. 8.12. And is by His Servants making known to them the Rich and Glorious Myſteries of the Goſpel. as <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> Chap. 3. and <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25.27.</note> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> does in his Epiſtles declare: And thoſe Myſteries He Revealeth ſavingly by His Spirit, to as many as He pleaſeth as <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 2. throughout.</note> the Scriptures alſo teſtify.</p>
               <p>THAT GOD thus taketh Care and uſeth Means to Inſtruct the Children of Men in the Great Truths and Myſteries of the Goſpel, does certainly ſuppoſe them to have Excellent Underſtandings in them, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving the Inſtructions of Wiſdom which are by Him deſigned for their Illumination; and GOD herein treateth Men as Creatures that have a Capacity to <hi>Know Wiſdom and Inſtruction,</hi> and <hi>to perceive the Words of Underſtanding,</hi> Prov. 1.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance,</hi> 2. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <hi>In that He directeth them to him at a moſt Excellent End, and by the moſt proper and ſuitable means to purſue it.</hi> Thus to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify GOD, and to enjoy <hi>Him</hi> for ever, is the Great End which <hi>He</hi> requireth Men to aim at, and in order to their compaſſing this End, they are commanded to make uſe of the moſt ſuitable Means, and in the Improvement of theſe, to <hi>Work out their own Salvation,</hi> Phil. 2.12. Unto this End Men are required diligently to attend and improve all the Means of Grace that GOD is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to favour them withal. This is what is intended by their <hi>Hearing of Wiſdom, watching daily at her Gates, and waiting at the Poſts of her Doors,</hi> Prov. 8.34.</p>
               <p>NOW thus aiming at a determinate End, and fixing upon, and making uſe of the moſt proper and ſuitable Means for the attainment of it, does certainly ſuppoſe Reaſon and Underſtanding in thoſe that do or ought to do it; and when GOD puts Men upon thus acting
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002152_0007_0FBC77F00B2F0980"/>
He treats them as Intelligent and Rational Beings, and Honours them as Creatures capable of the higheſt Views, and the moſt Excellent Employments and Enjoyments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance,</hi> 3. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <hi>In that He Dealeth with them in the way of a Covenant, which the Unreaſonable part of the Creation are utter by uncapable of.</hi> It is certain that GOD has always dealt with Mankind in a Covenant way. When Man was firſt Created, GOD entred into a Covenant of Works with him, promiſing Life to him, on Condition of perfect and perpetual Obedience; and threatning him with Death in caſe of the leaſt Failure, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 12. And after Mankind had in <hi>Adam</hi> their Common Head and Repreſentative broken that Covenant, GOD was pleaſed to propoſe another Covenant, unto them, <hi>viz.</hi> The New-Covenant or Covenant of Grace, according unto which they might be delivered from the Curſe and Death due to them on the Account of their Violation of the Covenant, firſt made with them, and might alſo obtain Eternal Happineſs through a Glorious Redeemer provided for them.</p>
               <p>THIS Covenant was, tho' in obſcure. Terms, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the Relief of Sinful Man, ſoon after his Fall into Sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. but has been more fully opened and explained, unto Sinners ſince in the Scriptures, eſpecially in thoſe of the New-Teſtament, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. to 10. and elſewhere.</p>
               <p>IN theſe Covenants are expreſſed the Duties which Men owe unto GOD, according to the Tenure of them, and the Sins alſo which are contrary unto theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Here alſo are ſet down the Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which Men are to expect according as they do or do not keep Covenant with the Lord their GOD, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> Chap. 28.</p>

Thoſe who lay hold of the Covenant of Grace, are by GOD dealt withal according to the Tenure of that Covenant, <hi>Rome</hi> 6.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7, — 9.</p>
               <p>THUS GOD treateth Men in the way of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and every Man muſt receive a Reward accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Tenure of that Covenant, wherein he ſtandeth related unto GOD; and while GOD does thus deal with Men in a Covenant way, He Dealeth with them as with Rational Beings; He treateth them as ſuch as are capable of Underſtanding the Nature of a Covenant, the Conditions of that in which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are; and ſo the Terms wherein they ſtand with GOD, who has been pleaſed to enter into Covenant with them, as alſo of weighing on the one hand the Advantages they may have by complying with what is in the Covenant required of them; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of Counting the coſt of their neglecting, or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo to do.</p>

               <p>BUT there is eſpecially one Caſe wherein GOD puts Men unto their own free Choice, wherein their chooſing well, is of the laſt Importance to them; and GOD in putting Men to their Choice in ſuch a caſe as this, does evidently treat them as ſuch, as have good Underſtandings in them, capable of making ſuch a Choice as they ought to do.

                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002152_0011_0FBC77F88E814990"/>SOMETIMES Again, GOD lets Men know how unworthy and diſingenious they will ſhew themſelves to be, if by their Iniquities they Reward Him Evil for His Goodneſs. Deut. 32.6. <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh and unwiſe? Is He not thy Father that bought thee? Hath He not made thee and formed thee</hi>? When GOD thus Argueth with Men He certainly Dealeth with them as with Reaſonable Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance,</hi> 6. GOD Dealeth thus with Men, <hi>In that as occaſion does require, He uſeth Means to Convince them of the unreaſonableneſs of their Actions and Carriages towards Him.</hi> As GOD would in a Rational way reſtrain Men from Sin; ſo when they have Sinned, He uſeth Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Methods to convince them of their Folly and Madneſs in Departing from Him, and to bring them unto a due ſenſe of the unreaſonableneſs of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment and Behaviour before Him.</p>
               <p>TO this end GOD ſhews ſuch as have departed from Him, and by their Sins provoked Him, That they have no good Plea or Excuſe to make for their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So in Judg. 2.2. <hi>Ye have not obeyed my Voice: Why have ye done this</hi>? Hear how GOD argueth with Iſrael to this purpoſe, Jer. 2 5, 6 <hi>What Iniquity have your Fathers found in me that they are gone far from me, and have walked after Vanity and are become vain? Neither ſaid they where is the Lord that brought us up out of Aegypt,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo Micah 6.2, 3. <hi>The Lord hath a Controverſy with His People, and will plead with Iſrael, O my People, What have I done unto thee, and wherein have I wearied thee? Teſtify against Me.</hi> Thus GOD convinceth His People that they have nothing to alledge againſt Him as a Reaſon of their forſaking of Him.</p>
               <p>TO the ſame End GOD frequently ſheweth Men now unreaſonable their Carriages are in reſpect of the Ingratitude of which they are guilty in them; ſo in Iſa. 1.2, <hi>I have nouriſhed and brought up Children, and they
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002152_0012_0FBC77F9B61F1A40"/>
have rebelled againſt me.</hi> Alſo Iſa. 63.9.10. <hi>In all their affliction he was afflicted; and the Angel of his Preſence ſaved them, in his love and in his pity be redeemed them, and he have them, and carryed them all the Dayes of old. But they rebelled and vexed his Holy Spirit.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9, — 19, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6 24.</note> This Argument is much inſiſted on in Scripture, GOD would have Men ſee that ſuch a deportment before Him, is very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
               <p>WITH the ſame deſign GOD ſometimes ſhews Men how abſurd and ridiculous their Practices are, that ſo He may make them aſhamed of their Abominations. Thus GOD by a Prophet ſaid to <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 Chron. 25.15. <hi>Why haſt thou ſought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thy hand</hi>? In this way GOD would have made <hi>Iſrael</hi> aſhamed of their Idolatry, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. from ver. 9. to 18. where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at large expoſed the abſurdity of their firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king gods and then falling down and worſhipping the ſame; He in Verſe 19. ſpeaketh thus to, and of them. <hi>None conſidereth in his heart, neither is their knowledge, nor underſtanding to ſay, I have burnt part of it in the Fire; yea alſo I have baked bread upon the Coals thereof: I have roaſted Fleſh and eaten it; and ſhall I make the reſidue thereof an Abomination? ſhall I fall down to the Stock of a Tree?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN GOD thus ſheweth Men how unreaſonably they act in Sinning againſt Him, He Dealeth with them as with Reaſonable Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance,</hi> 7. GOD thus Dealeth with Men, <hi>In that as need calls for it, He clears up to then the equity of His Dealings with them.</hi> Men are very apt to find fault with GOD; and to quarrel at His Diſpenſations; they are often ready to think that GOD Dealeth hardly with them: but He is ever ready to give pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſuitable Anſwers to what they have to Object
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002152_0013_0FBC77FBF7E58648"/>
againſt Him, and to make it evident that He no way wrongs them. Thus in our Text, GOD calls His People to Reaſon with Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſo He might make them ſee the Equity, yea the Kindneſs of His way of Dealing with them.</p>
               <p>GOD indeed ſometimes Anſwers Men's proud and unreaſonable cavils againſt Him, by aſſerting His own abſolute Soveraignity over them, and ſo His Right to do with them, what ſeemeth good in His ſight. But even then, when GOD pleadeth His own abſolute Dominion over Men, He ſtill dealeth with them as with Rational and Intelligent Beings, in that He ſheweth them that it is highly Reaſonable, that He ſhould exerciſe ſuch a Dominion over every thing that He has made. To this purpoſe GOD argueth with Men, in <hi>Rom. Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Ver.</hi> 19. Men are brought in thus Diſputing againſt GOD, <hi>Why doth he yet find fault, for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Unto which cavil GOD by the Apoſtle thus anſwereth, Verſe 20, 21. <hi>Nay but O Man, who art thou that replyeſt against God? Shall the thing formed ſay unto him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the ſame lump to make one Veſſel unto honour, and another to diſhonour</hi>?</p>
               <p>SOMETIMES GOD is pleaſed to anſwer Mens Objections againſt Him, without thus inſiſting upon His own abſolute Soveraignty. Thus in <hi>Ezek.</hi> Chap. 18. GOD anſwereth the Objection made by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt Him, <hi>That the Fathers had eaten ſowre Grapes, and the Childrens teeth were ſet on edge</hi>; by which was meant that the Children were puniſhed for the Sins of the Parents, and from this the People inferred, <hi>That the way of the Lord was not equal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN Anſwer unto this Objection, GOD ſhewed the People their great miſtake, in alleging that Children were puniſhed for their Parents Sins. He ſhewed them at large, that the Soul that Sinneth ſhall die; and that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002152_0014_0FBC77FE8144B8E8"/>
the Son ſhall not bear the Iniquity of the Father; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Father bear the Iniquity of the Son, but that every one ſhall be Rewarded according to his own Works; and then He proceeded thus to Expoſtulate with them. Ver. 29. <hi>Yet ye ſay the way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now O houſe of Iſrael, Are not my ways equal? Are not your ways unequal</hi>?</p>
               <p>THUS alſo GOD cleareth up the Equity of His Dealings with His People with reſpect to the Means He afforded them for their good. GOD conſidereth Men as Reaſonable Creatures, and therefore affordeth them ſufficient Means for the Ends He obligeth them to purſue and proſecute. He puteth a Price into their hands to be improved for their Advantage, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17 16. He diſtributeth Talents unto one and another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their reſpective Abilities, and requireth them to trade with them <hi>Mith.</hi> 25.14, 15, 16. And if it be needful, He convinceth them, that nothing hath been wanting on His part, that could Reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of Him, in Order to the promoting of their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
               <p>THUS GOD Convinced the <hi>Jews</hi> of the Sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Means and Cultivations He afforded to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.1, — 5. Where ſpeaking of them under the Similitude of a Vineyard. He (1.) declareth that He had <hi>Planted this Vineyard of his, in a very fruitful Hill, and had fenced it, and gathered out the Stones thereof, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with the choiſeſt Vine,</hi> &amp;c. thereby ſignifying what Means He had uſed, and what Coſt and Pains He had been at, for the good of His People. (2) He ſhews them the Expectation He thereupon had that His Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard would have brought forth good Fruit, <hi>He looked that it would have brought forth Grapes</hi> (3.) He decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the diſappointment He had with reſpect hereto, <hi>It brought forth Wild Grapes</hi>; bad Fruit, inſtead of good. (4.) He hereupon thus Reaſoneth with His People, this Vineyard of His. <hi>And now O Inhabitants of Jeruſalem,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002152_0015_0FBC7800760A7130"/>
and Men of Judah, judge I pray you betwixt me, and my Vineyard; What could have been done more to my Vineyard than I have done in it? Wherefore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth Grapes, brought it forth Wild Grapes</hi>?</p>
               <p>SURELY, this is to deal with Men as with Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creatures; GOD does here Appeal unto His People's own Reaſon and Conſcience, whether He had not dealt very well by them, in affording a ſufficiency of Means to them; ſo that their unfruitfulneſs did evidently appear to be from their own unreaſonable and culpable neglect; and was not in any wiſe to be Charged upon Him. He let them know that He dealt not by them as thoſe <hi>unreaſonable Men</hi> their <hi>Aegyptian Task masters</hi> had formerly done, in requiring Brick of them in full Tale; but not affording them Straw, <hi>Exod.</hi> Chap. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſtance,</hi> 8. GOD dealeth thus with Men, <hi>In that He cleareth up to them, the fairneſs of the Proceſs at the Great Aſſize or Day of Judgment; and the Juſtice of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that ſhall then be paſſed upon both Good and Bad.</hi> As Men are fully aſſured that there will be a Great and General Day of Judgment, in which all Rational and Intelligent Creatures, muſt give an Account of themſelves and of their Actions unto GOD, (as it is Reaſon they ſhould do,) <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12. So GOD alſo aſſures them that the Proceedings of that Day ſhall be moſt Juſt and Reaſonable. He does aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Men that things ſhall not in that Day be managed in a way merely Arbitary, without reſpect to Reaſon and Juſtice; but that all Cauſes and Pleas ſhall be then duly heard &amp; conſidered, &amp; that Right Judgment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Law and Evidence, ſhall then proceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE Books therefore are then to be Opened, and the dead,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe that were ſo) <hi>are to be judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the things written therein, according to their Works,</hi> Rev. 20.12. Therefore, <hi>Every Work muſt be</hi> then

                  <hi>brought into Judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil,</hi> Eccl. 12.14. There will be no partiality then uſed, but Sentence will be given without reſpect of Perſons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. — 11. Then as many as have Sinned without the written Law of GOD, ſhall be Puniſhed without it; and as many as have Sinned under the Law, ſhall be judged by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12. — 16 Every one ſhall then be convinced, that the judgment of GOD is according to Truth, againſt thoſe that do ſuch things as Men ſhall be puniſhed for The End of the laſt Judgment as it reſpects the wicked, is not only that they may be puniſhed but alſo that they may be convinced of their wickedneſs, and of the Juſtice of GOD, in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſſed on them. <hi>For behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints, to execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all the hard ſpeeches, which ungodly Sinners have ſpoken againſt him,</hi> Jude, ver. 14.15. Not only the Conſciences; but even the Mouths of wicked Men ſhall then bear witneſs againſt themſelves. Luk. 19.22, 23. <hi>Out of thine own Mouth will I Judge thee, thou wicked Servant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>HOW fair the Proceſs of the Great and laſt Day of Judgment will be, and how juſt the Sentence, both with reſpect to the Righteous, and the wicked; Jeſus Chriſt the Great Judge, does Himſelf aſſure us, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.31, — 46 where the reaſon of the Sentence, with reſpect unto both, is diſtinctly cleared up, that every one may ſee the Juſtice and Equity of it. GOD in dealing thus with Men, and in leting them know before-hand that they ſhall be thus treated, dealeth with them as with Reaſonable Creatures.</p>
               <p>AND to add but one thing more,</p>

                  <hi>Inſtance,</hi> 9. GOD dealeth thus with Men, <hi>In that he often puteth them upon a deep and ſerious Conſideration of thoſe things wherein, or wherewith, as Rational and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Beings, they are concerned.</hi> As GOD has made Man a Creature capable of thinking, ſo He treateth him as ſuch a Creature, in putting him upon ſuch a uſe and improvement of his Reaſon and Underſtanding, as does become one that is endued with ſuch noble and excellent Powers as Man is; and GOD is diſpleaſed at it, if Man ſhew himſelf bruitiſhly inconſiderate, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3.</p>
               <p>HOW often do we find GOD in Scripture, putting Men upon the Study and Conſideration of thoſe things wherein His Glory is concerned, and which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of, may be of Advantage to themſelves. Thus GOD requireth that Men <hi>Know and conſider in their hearts, that the Lord he is God in Heaven above, and in the earth beneath, and that there is none elſe,</hi> Deut. 4.39. And that they <hi>Stand ſtill and conſider the wondrous works of God,</hi> Job 37.14. That they <hi>Conſider what great things God hath done for them,</hi> 1 Sam 12.24. And that they alſo Conſider what He in His Word ſays to them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. They ought alſo to <hi>Study how to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves approved unto God,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.15. And ſhould <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their ways,</hi> and GOD's Diſpenſations towards them. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.5, — 7. GOD does moreover re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that Men <hi>Examine</hi> and Conſider, <hi>Whether they be in the Faith</hi> or not, 2. Cor. 13.5. And that every Man ſhould by ſerious Conſideration, <hi>Prove his own Work,</hi> Gal. 6.4.</p>
               <p>THESE and many other things of the like Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, GOD is in His Word, putting Men upon the Conſideration of, and it is certain that He herein treateth them as Rational and Intelligent Beings capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of proper Meditations and Reflections upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Objects propoſed to their Contemplation; which that they really are, has been ſuppoſed in all that has
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002152_0018_0FBC7804F671F148"/>
been ſaid to prove that GOD dealeth with them as with Reaſonable Creatures; and that He does ſo, has been now made ſufficiently evident. I ſhall therefore proceed,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="part">
               <head>II. <hi>TO give ſome Reaſons Why He does ſo.</hi> And they are ſuch as here follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon,</hi> 1. GOD dealeth with Men as with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures; <hi>Becauſe ſuch they are, and it is very ſuitable that they ſhould by GOD be dealt withal in ſuch a Way as is agreeable to the Natures by Himſelf given unto them.</hi> As there is an excellent Harmony among the Divine Attributes; ſo there is a very remarkable agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the Divine Operations: This appears in GODs delighting to work in, with, and by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes, in a way agreeable to the Natural Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Diſpoſitions, which He Himſelf has put into them In this He ſhews His Wiſdom, and puts an Honour upon the works of His own Hands: He here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhews that it is not in vain that He has put ſuch Principles and Qualities into them, ſeeing He maketh uſe of them, and worketh with and by them in the Government of the World. As therefore Inanimate and Irrational Creatures are governed in a way ſuitable to the Natures given unto them; ſo alſo Rationable and Intelligent Beings, as Angels and Men, are ruled and ordered in ſuch a way, as is agreeable unto the excellent Natures with which they are indued. Man therefore being a Reaſonable Creature, GOD con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deals with him as ſuch an One, treating him in a way agreeable to his Nature, and influencing of him by ſuch Means as none but Intelligent Beings can be moved by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon,</hi> 2. GOD dealeth thus with Men, <hi>Becauſe the Nature of the Government which He has ſet up over them
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002152_0019_0FBC7808A0DD5C50"/>
does Neceſſarily call for it.</hi> As GOD made Men capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being governed by Laws with Sanctions, which Irrational Creatures are not; ſo He has determined to govern them by ſuch Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> Precepts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, with Promiſes and Threatnings: But now the Nature of this kind of Government does require that Men be dealt withal as Intelligent and Rational Beings, capable of acting as Free-Agents; and of being influenced by Moral conſiderations; and if they were moved in any other way, as by meer Phyſical Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, this would not agree unto the Nature of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubjection unto GOD, which conſiſts in a Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous, or Voluntary Obedience and Submiſſion unto His Will: Therefore if Men ſhould in theſe things be dealt withal in any other way than as Reaſonable Creatures, they could be no more ſaid to obey GOD in their Motions, than Irrational Animals, and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without Life, may be ſaid to do; which would be very far from that Reaſonable Service which GOD requireth of Men, and will only accept at their Hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon,</hi> 3. GOD dealeth thus with Men, <hi>Becauſe this way ſutes well with His Deſign of diſplaying His own Glory, and being admired on the account of it.</hi> Tho' GOD might have been Perfectly and Eternally happy in the Enjoyment of Himſelf, tho' no Creature had ever been made; yet it hath pleaſed Him to create the World to be a kind of Mirror wherein His own Glory may be ſeen and admired; and to make a Number of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures capable of viewing His Perfections ſhining forth therein, and of giving Him Glory on the account of them.</p>
               <p>UNTO this Number Mankind belong, and as they are capable of glorifying <hi>GOD</hi> in an active way, ſo this is the Sum of what <hi>He</hi> requires of them: And that He may effectually oblige them to perform their duty herein, He treats them as Reaſonable and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002152_0020_0FBC7809CFE0D5A8"/>
Beings, capable of Underſtanding their Duty and doing it, and of ſeeing the Obligations they lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, willingly to engage in the Great Work incumbent on them. He requireth them to behold &amp; admire His Glory, which appeareth in His admirable works of Creation, Providence, and Redemption; and then to ſhew forth His Praiſe unto Others, by <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 105.2.</note> Talking of the Marvellous things that He hath done. And when they are defective herein He lays great blame to them on the account thereof. He lets them know <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.7, 8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.4.</note> that Glory is due to Him, and how reaſonable a thing it is that they ſhould render it to His Name.</p>
               <p>AND GOD does not only thus call and require Men to give Glory to Him but gives rational Anſwers to all ſuch Objections as they are ready to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. He takes up all the ſtumbling Blocks out of the way, that nothing may hinder them from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their duty herein; and if there be any thing that ſeemeth to reflect Diſhonour upon Him, He plainly and fairly removeth it, as in <hi>James</hi> 1.13, 14.</p>
               <p>NOW in all this, Men are treated as Reaſonable Creatures, and that they ſhould be ſo, tends ſo much to GODs Glory, and ſutes ſo well with His Deſign of exalting His own Name, that this may be looked upon as one Reaſon of His dealing thus with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon,</hi> 4. <hi>THERE is much to be aſcribed unto the Soveraign good Will and Pleaſure of the bleſſed GOD, with reſpect to His thus dealing with Men.</hi> Whatſoever Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be aſſigned for His dealing thus with them; yet it is certain that as the caſe now ſtands, GOD's doing thus is very much to be aſcribed to His Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002152_0021_0FBC780AF8C1D4B8"/>MAN-kind have by their Apoſtaſy from GOD forfeited all the Advantages which in their Eſtate of Integrity they had ſome right unto; ſo that in point of Juſtice, Men do not now deſerve to be by GOD treated as they are; but on the contrary, that GOD ſhould deal with them in a way of Wrath and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure only: There therefore now appeareth in the way of GOD's treating the Children of Men, much of His Condeſcending Goodneſs; and here-unto muſt His dealing with them in ſuch a Manner as now He does, be very much aſcribed.</p>
               <p>THAT now GOD perſwades Men, Reaſons the Caſe with them, anſwereth their ſinful Cavils, and vain and fooliſh Objections, with ſo much Patience, and Long-ſuffering, as He ſtill does; muſt needs be attributed to His Great Mercy and Kindneſs. It is certain, this is that which moves Him to treat ſuch as have exceedingly provoked Him, as He does theſe unto whom He ſpeaks in our Text, when He calls them to come and reaſon with Him, about thoſe things wherein their Eternal Welfare is concerned.</p>

            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE,</hi> I. DOES GOD deal with Men is with Reaſonable Creatures, <hi>Then have Men no just Cauſe to complain of His Dealings with them; but great Reaſon to acknowledge them to be very Wiſe, Juſt, and Merciful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. IF GOD dealeth thus with Men, <hi>He certainly dealeth Wiſely with them,</hi> in that He treateth them in a way agreeable to the Natures He hath given to them. GOD perfectly knoweth what kind of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Men are; and hath ſet up ſuch a ſort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over them, as is ſuitable to the Nature of ſuch Creatures as they be; and He manageth His Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them in ſuch a way and manner as is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Laws</hi> by which He Rules them, as well
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002152_0022_0FBC780C9875BFD0"/>
as unto their <hi>Natures.</hi> He makes known His Laws to them, ſhews them the Equity and Goodneſs of them, the Advantages they may have by keeping them, and the Miſeries they will expoſe themſelves unto by breaking them; and when at any time they tranſgreſs againſt Him, He ſheweth them how Reaſonable a thing it is that they Repent of their Miſcarriages, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Lives and Converſations; and that their future and Eternal Well being does depend upon their ſo doing. He uſeth Means for their Inſtruction and Illumination, ſhews them how Juſtice may be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed for their Offences; and how they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto GOD, againſt whom they have offended. He propoſeth Arguments for the over-coming, and gaining of cheir Wills; and makes Repreſentations to them, that are ſuitable to work on their Affections. Thus <hi>He draws them with the Cords of a Man,</hi> Hoſ. 11.4. And He herein doubtleſs dealeth very wiſely with them, becauſe in a way ſuitable to their Nature, and the Great deſign He is managing with them.</p>
               <p>THUS alſo GOD dealth wiſely with them, in ſuting His Providences unto the Circumſtances they are under. GOD wiſely conſidereth the Condition that Men are in. He duly weigheth their Eſtate and Circumſtances, and ſo what may be neceſſary for them, and what hurtful to them; and then orders out Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and Afflictions, and proportioneth them, as in His Wiſdom He ſeeth neceſſary, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27.8.</p>
               <p>MEN have, on theſe accounts, great Reaſon to acknowledge that GOD dealeth very wiſely with them. If they ſpeak truly, they muſt confeſs, <hi>He hath abounded towards them in all Wiſdom and Prudence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. IF GOD dealeth thus with Men, <hi>He alſo dealeth very Justly with them.</hi> His dealings with them are ſuch that nothing can be rationally and fairly objected againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:002152_0023_0FBC780E044379F8"/>GOD can, in point of Reaſon and Equity, Juſtify all His Actions towards the Children of Men; ſo that if He ſhould enter into a calm debate with them about the Juſtice and Equity of His Diſpenſation, allowing them <hi>to talk with Him of His Judgments,</hi> and ſhould not ſuffer <hi>His Terrors to make them afraid</hi>; He could ſo fully anſwer all Objections that they could poſſibly make with reſpect to the Juſtice of His deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them; that if it were not their own fault, they might clearly ſee the Reaſonableneſs of them. <hi>He will not,</hi> He does not, <hi>lay upon Man more than is Right, that he ſhould enter into Judgment with GOD</hi>: Or have juſt Reaſon to complain of His dealings with Him, <hi>Job</hi> 34.23.</p>
               <p>MEN are very apt to complain of GOD, as if He dealt very hardly by them, or as if <hi>His Ways were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal</hi>; But GOD can, and does afford them matter of Rational Conviction that they have no good reaſon for ſuch Complaints. Thus ſtood the caſe betwixt GOD and His People, <hi>Ezek Chap.</hi> 18. But He ſaid that to them which either did, or ſhould have fully ſatisfyed them, that His dealings with them were very reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Whatever ſome Men may think of GOD, yet He is, and in the Iſſue, will appear to be, <hi>Righteous in all His ways, and Holy in all His works,</hi> Pſal. 145.17. GOD will ſhortly ſo fully clear up the Juſtice of His dealings with His Creatures, that they ſhall ſee and acknowledge the Equity of them all, and be obliged to Glorify Him on that account. It will appear that neither Men nor Angels have had any good reaſon to complain of Him.</p>
               <p>AND I ſhall here obſerve, That tho' Soveraignty be an Attribute of GOD, who <hi>does,</hi> and may do <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to His Will in the Army of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth; and none can ſtay His Hand, or ſay unto Him, What doeſt thou?</hi> Dan. 4.35. Yet is GOD's Juſtice and Soveraignty are diſtinguiſhable one from
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002152_0024_0FBC780FADDCA578"/>
the other, ſo it is not to be ſuppoſed that GOD ever <hi>ſo</hi> exerciſeth His Soveraign Power as to act any ways contrary to Juſtice or Equity. We muſt remember that the object of Divine Soveraignty, is What with reſpect to GODs other Glorious Attributes, may be either fitly done, or not done; and it is with reſpect to ſuch things as theſe that GOD doth in Scripture Juſtifie His Actions on the Account of His Soveraign Power and Lordſhip: As therefore GOD by His So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power, neither does nor can act any thing Contrary to His Infinite Wiſdom, and Unalterable Truth; ſo neither can nor will He by the ſame Power and Authority do any thing contrary to His moſt perfect Juſtice: And thus there appeareth a moſt exact Harmony among the Divine Attributes; and herein I conceive the Holineſs of GOD eminently to conſiſt.</p>
               <p>AND hence, as it is a true Propoſition, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever GOD does is very juſt and equal; ſo it is no leſs true, that there are ſome things that are in their own Nature unjuſt, and therefore ſuch as GOD nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can nor will do. This Truth is ſuppoſed in all thoſe <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> Chap. 18. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.33. <hi>Job</hi> 34.10, 11, 12.</note> Places of Scripture, wherein the Juſtice and Equity of GOD's Dealings with His Creatures is vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, and His Care to deal Righteouſly by them is aſſerted. But here poor ſimple Men muſt be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and not be over confident with reſpect to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular things, either that they may be juſtly done, or not, leaſt they Sin in charging GOD fooliſhly. To be ſure it is a good Rule, that whatever GOD does, is very Juſt and Righteous, whether Men ſee the Equity of it, yea or no.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IF GOD dealeth thus with Men, <hi>He dealeth very mercifully and kindly by them.</hi> In this not only His Juſtice,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002152_0025_0FBC7810F55CE380"/>
but even his Mercy and Kindneſs towards Men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. In the Condition that Mankind now are, GOD in treating of them as He does, while He is dealing with them as with Reaſonable Creatures, does ſhew abundance of undeſerved Favour and Kindneſs unto them. How kindly does GOD treat Men, when He ſpeaks to them as in our Text, and the Words immediately following, <hi>Come now, and let us reaſon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſaith the Lord: Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wooll.</hi> Thus GOD <hi>draws Men with the bands of Love,</hi> Hoſ. 11.4. <hi>Allures them, and ſpeaks Comfortably unto them,</hi> Chap. 2. ver. 14. He ſwears to them, that <hi>He taketh no pleaſure in their Death, but on the contrary that they ſhould turn from their own evil ways and live,</hi> Ezek. 33.11.</p>
               <p>THUS kindly doth GOD deal with Men. To be ſure if they duely conſider how He treats them, they muſt acknowledge He dealeth very well by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE,</hi> II. DOES GOD deal with Men as with Reaſonable Creatures, <hi>Then ſurely Men ought to deal thus with one another.</hi> If GOD, who is Infinitely Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour unto the greateſt Men in the World, does yet not diſdain thus to treat them, How much more may they expect to be thus treated by thoſe who are <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 27.16.</note> of one Blood with them, and ſo by Nature equal to them.</p>
               <p>MAN-kind was not made to be Goverened by meer force and violence and driven <hi>to</hi> and <hi>fro,</hi> as thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Creatures were that were put in Subjection to them. GOD Himſelf does not ſo Exerciſe His Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them; He conſiders and deals by them as MEN, and would have them know themſelves ſo to be, and expect to be dealt with accordingly, and would
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002152_0026_0FBC781499831CD8"/>
have others alſo obſerve it, in order to their treating of them in ſuch a manner as is ſuitable to ſo noble a Species of Being as they are.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to this we find that tho' <hi>Iſrael</hi> be Metaphorically ſpoken of as a Flock of Sheep under Shepherds, unto whoſe care they were committed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> Chap. 34. Yet they were in the cloſe of that Chapter, by GOD put in mind of what they really were, Verſ. 31. <hi>And ye my Flock, the Flock of my Paſture, are Men, and I am your God, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> If GOD's Flock be <hi>Men,</hi> their Shepherds ought to carry it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them accordingly, by treating them as Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creatures <note n="†" place="bottom">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3</note> 
                  <hi>Not lording of it over them</hi>; but ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them their Duty, and by whoſe Authority they are called to it, and what Obligations they are under to perform it. Theſe ſhould therefore be Men able to render a Reaſon, and by ſolid Arguments, to prove what they ſay, and to <hi>Convince gain-ſayers</hi>; for if Men's Reaſon and Conſciences be not convinced, all the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes denounced from <hi>Mount-Ehal,</hi> will avail very little to oblige them to their Duty, nor will External force and compulſion, if uſed, make any good Impreſſions on them. Miniſters therefore who treat with Men in GOD's Name ſhould, like <hi>Paul,</hi> Reaſon about the Things of which they Diſcourſe, He <hi>Reaſoned of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Temperance, and Judgment to come,</hi> and <hi>Faelia trembled,</hi> Acts 24.25. And this ſeems to have been <hi>Paul</hi>'s ordinary way, Acts 17.2. <hi>And Paul as his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was, went in unto them, &amp; three Sabbath Days Reaſoned with them out of the Scriptures.</hi> This courſe alſo <hi>Samuel</hi> took with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 Sam. 12.6, 7. He <hi>ſaid unto them, — Stand ſtill, that I may Reaſon with you before the Lord.</hi> —</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE,</hi> III. DOES GOD deal with Men as with Reaſonable Creatures, <hi>Then ſurely Men ſhould take heed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002152_0027_0FBC78157A2EB6E0"/>
of every thing, which tendeth to render them uncapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus treated, with Advantage or Succeſs.</hi> As GOD made us Rational Creatures; ſo He condeſcends to Reaſon and Argue with us, about things that are of the greateſt importance and concernment to us; He is willing that Reaſon ſhould decide every caſe wherein He has to do with us: And if there be any matters of Controverſy betwixt Him and us, He invites us to argue with Him upon them, and gives us leave to <hi>bring forth our strong Reaſons,</hi> if we have any ſuch, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.21.</p>
               <p>AND are Men thus called to argue the Caſe with GOD, to hear Reaſon from Him, and to give good and wiſe Anſwers unto Him; ſurely they had need be well prepared for this, that in the things wherein they have to do with ſo wiſe and holy a Being as He is, they may behave themſelves as becomes Rational and Intelligent Beings, and not diſhonour themſelves by a carriage unworthy of the Character which they bear, and of the Honour that GOD is pleaſed to put upon them, in treating of them as He does; and they had need take ſpecial heed of every thing that tends to unfit them for behaving themſelves well, when they are called to Reaſon with Him.</p>
               <p>AND I ſhall here mention <hi>Three Things</hi> which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had need on this account, take great heed of, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>GROSS Ignorance.</hi> This exceedingly unfits Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for being treated as Reaſonable Creatures with Advantage. I ſpeak here of ſuch Ignorance as is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto Knowledge, that may be acquired by an Induſtrious uſe of means. Tho' Perſons have never ſo good natural Parts, yet if they are groſly Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, how exceedingly does this unfit them both for underſtanding Reaſon themſelves, and ſpeaking Reaſon
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002152_0028_0FBC7816F4E78C70"/>
unto others. <note n="†" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Wadſworth</hi>'s Preface to his Expoſition on the Aſſemblies Catechiſm, <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> Thus there are many who for want of common Learning, can hardly underſtand the Language in which People ordinarily ſpeak; and to be ſure are far from underſtanding much of the Language where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in GOD in the Scriptures ſpeaks to them. Such Words as Juſtification, Adoption and Regeneration are hard Words to them; and they have little benefit by the plaineſt Sermons, becauſe they cannot underſtand them.</p>
               <p>NOW how miſerably qualified are ſuch is theſe, to be treated in a Rational way, about things that have any difficulty in them Perſons ſhould take care that they may be more capable of underſtanding what GOD ſays to them, and the force of the Arguments He uſeth with them; and Heads of Families ſhould take care that their Children and Servants, may not want thoſe Inſtructions that are neceſſary unto this end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>STRONG Prejudices.</hi> Theſe do alſo exceedingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit Men for being treated in a Rational way, to any good Purpoſe, either by GOD or Men. When GOD dealeth with Men as with Reaſonable Creatures, He doubtleſs would have them uſe their Reaſon very free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and put forth the Powers of their Souls unto the utmoſt, in weighing and examining the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them, to be conſidered by them, and GOD ſays nothing to Men, but what will bear the ſtricteſt Examination and Trial.</p>
               <p>BUT now if Men ſuffer their Judgments to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled, and their Minds prepoſſeſſed with Prejudices, againſt the things that GOD would perſwade them unto, they do hereby render themſelves exceeding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for ſuch a Treaty as GOD is ſeeking to manage with them; and when it is thus, the plaineſt and

moſt forceable Reaſons and Motives will have very little Influence upon them. Thus when Men's Minds are filled with Prejudices againſt Religion and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Idols of Sin and the World are ſet up in their Hearts, if they be urged with the ſtrongeſt Arguments to forſake thoſe, and live Religiouſly; they will be ready to ſay with thoſe in Jer. 2.25. <hi>No, for we have loved ſtrangers, and after them we will go.</hi> They cannot now <hi>Hearken to the voice of the charmers, charming never ſo wiſely,</hi> Pſal. 58.5.</p>
               <p>I SHALL mention one thing more, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>DRUNKENNESS.</hi> How evidently does this unfit ſuch as are addicted to it, for being treated as Perſons that can uſe their Reaſon and Underſtanding well? How unfit are Drunken Men to be argued withal as with Reaſonable Creatures? Such as are actually Drunk are indeed more like Beaſts then Men. <hi>They are like the Horſe and Mule that have no underſtanding,</hi> Pſal. 32.9. Nay rather like ſome other Beaſts, with which wicked Men are compared in Scripture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. When Perſons are Drunk, they are unfit to be treated by Men in a Rational way, about the Affairs of this Life; and how much more unfit are they to be treated by the Bleſſed GOD, about the Affairs of their Immortal Souls, and the Eternal World? Can we think Drunken Men fit to be ſpoken unto by a Wiſe and Holy GOD, as GOD ſpeaks to Men in our Text, <hi>Come now, and let us Reaſon together, ſaith the Lord</hi>? No truely, they are very far from it. Yet ſome that are given to Drunkenneſs are ſcarce ever willing to Diſcourſe about the things of GOD and their Souls, but when they are Drunk, and ſo utterly unfit to be treated about them.</p>
               <p>BUT this is not all; for thoſe that do frequently inflame and intoxicate themſelves with Strong Drink,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002152_0030_0FBC781D1B2D6D90"/>
do generally, if not always ſo ſtepify their Senſes, and impair their Underſtandings by it (though they themſelves know it not,) as almoſt to unfit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be treated as Rational Creatures at any Time.</p>
               <p>LET therefore ſuch as <hi>Riſe up early in the Morning, that they may follow after Strong-Drink, and continue until Night, till Wine inflame them,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.11.</note> ſeriouſly conſider, when they are in ſuch a condition as to be capable of it, how much worſe than Bruits they are frequently making themſelves; and how much it concerns them to Reform their Lives, before they ſo far loſe the uſe of their Underſtandings, as to be uncapable of receiving any Benefit by thoſe Rational Methods, which GOD is ſtill making uſe of with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE,</hi> IV. DOES GOD deal with Men as with Reaſonable Creatures, <hi>Then ought Men to take great care to carry themſelves as Reaſonable Creatures ought to do, towards GOD, that ſo in the Things wherein they have to do with Him, He may have no juſt Reaſon to blame or condemn them.</hi> Since GOD is pleaſed to deal with Men as with Rational Creatures, certainly Men ſhould ſee to it, that they carry themſelves ſo, that Reaſon will juſtify them, whenever GOD ſhall call them to give an Account of their Actions, or ſhall enter into a Debate with them about them.</p>
               <p>WE are always accountable unto GOD, for what we do; and He has many wayes to bring the Reaſonableneſs of our Actions into Tryal. In His Word He deals with us about them. Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are His Vicegerents to Judge of them, and to Juſtifie or condemn them. There are Men Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by Him to examine as with reſpect to many
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002152_0031_0FBC781EDBA15D40"/>
of them. There will be a Great and General Day of Judgment, wherein we muſt give an Account of all of them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.14. GQD will ſhortly call us to an Account as Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, how we have behaved our ſelves in the World, He will bring us to a fair Tryal, that it may appear whether we can by Reaſon juſtifie our Actions and Carriages, or not. It muſt therefore needs greatly concern us to ſee to it, that our Caſe be good when GOD calls us to anſwer for our ſelves. We had need therefore ſay and reſolve as in Hab 2 1. unto which I may here allude, <hi>I will ſtand upon my watch, and will ſet me upon the Tower, and will watch to ſee what he will ſay unto me, and what I ſhall anſwer when I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,</hi> Or, as it is in the Margin, <hi>argued withal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>INASMUCH alſo as GOD puts a great Honour and Reſpect upon Men, in His treating of them as Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creatures, and deals very kindly by them; how vile a thing will it then be in Men, if they carry themſelves unreaſonably and bruitiſhly towards Him. How fitly may GOD ſay unto Them, as in Iſa. 46.8. <hi>Shew your ſelves Men.</hi> GOD juſtly expects that we ſhould behave our ſelves ſuitably to the dignity of our Natures, and to the honourable Way of His treating of us, and how baſe and unworthy ſhall we ſhew our ſelves, if our carriage and deportment towards Him be wholly Unanſwerable to His dealings with us, and expectations concerning us? GOD juſtly complains of Men, when they carry it not towards Him as Reaſonable Creatures ought to do, Jer. 4.22. <hi>My People are fooliſh, they have not known me, they are ſottiſh Children and have none Underſtanding, they are wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no Knowledge.</hi> And Jer. 8.7. <hi>The Stork in the Heavens knoweth her appointed times, and the Turtle and the Crane and the Swallow, obſerve the Time of their coming; but my People know not the Judgment of the Lord.</hi>

                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:002152_0032_0FBC7823A0CBB8B0"/>IT is then highly neceſſary, that we do endeavour in all points to behave our ſelves towards a Wiſe and Holy GOD, as does become Reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and thoſe that are by Him treated as ſuch, to do: And as ſuch we are Obliged wiſely to conſider ſuch things as theſe, and thus to Argue with our ſelves.</p>
               <p>HAVE we not Reaſon to believe that there is an Eternal GOD of Infinite Perfections, who has Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the World, and all things therein? How elſe came all theſe Things, which we behold, by their Being?</p>
               <p>HAVE we not Reaſon to believe that GOD made Reaſonable Creatures, to render unto Him a Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Service? Such as He made them capable of, and that He would therefore, ſome way or other make known His Mind and Will to them?</p>
               <p>HAVE we not Reaſon to believe that the Scriptures are of Divine Original? Or were given by Inſpiration of GOD, to direct Reaſonable Creatures in their Duty towards Him? Is there not the ſtamp of His Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon them? Are they not worthy of ſuch a One as He is, and every way ſuitable to ſuch an End, as to teach Men how they may Glorify GOD, and come to the Enjoyment of Him?</p>
               <p>IS there not good Reaſon that Men ſhould firmly believe all that GOD does in the Scriptures ſay unto them; yea, tho' they cannot comprehend ſome of the Myſteries therein delivered? And is not their Sin great, if they make Him a Lyar, by not believing what He ſpeaks, and teſtifies unto them?</p>
               <p>IS it not good Reaſon that we ſhould Obey the Laws of the Great <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> which are in His Word given unto us? Or ſhould not He that Made
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002152_0033_0FBC78247A8D0380"/>
us, and Continually Keeps us, alſo Rule and Govern us?</p>
               <p>HAVE we not abundant Reaſon to acknowledge that Mankind have fallen from GOD by Sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Him, and ſo become juſtly liable to innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and endleſs Miſeries?</p>
               <p>HAVE we not Reaſon to believe the Record that GOD has, in the Goſpel, given of His SON? Should we not look upon it as <hi>a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners?</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15.</p>
               <p>HAVE we not Reaſon to Eſteem the Terms of Peace propounded in the Goſpel, as very Reaſonable, and very Gracious? Or have we the leaſt Reaſon to think that GOD dealeth hardly with us, in holding us unto ſuch Terms? This is the caſe that GOD invites Men to Reaſon with Him about in the Text, as by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text does appear.</p>
               <p>IS it not a moſt Reaſonable thing, that Sinners ſhould ſincerely Repent of their many Sins againſt the bleſſed GOD, and turn to Him from them with all their Hearts and Souls; and that they ſhould wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accept the Terms of Peace offered to them thro' a Redeemer? And is not their folly exceeding great, if they refuſe thus to do?</p>
               <p>FINALLY, Have we not good Reaſon to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that if Men diſobey and diſhonour the Great GOD; if they deſpiſe His Authority, and will not hearken to His Voice; if they will reject His Mercy, and not believe in His Son; but trample His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood under foot, and utterly refuſe that He ſhould Rule over them.

               <p>BUT how has Men's Apoſtacy from the Bleſſed GOD depraved their Souls, and unfitted them for the due exerciſe of thoſe Faculties and Powers, which as Rational Beings, they are endued withal!

            <head>A Brief Account of the State of the <hi>Indians</hi> on <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> and the ſmall Iſlands Adjacent in <hi>Duke's-Country,</hi> from the Year <hi>1694</hi> to <hi>1720.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>MArtha's Vineyard</hi> is an Iſland lying in about the Latitude of 41. and is about 22 Miles in length, from Eaſt to Weſt, <hi>Chapaquidick</hi> and <hi>Capoag,</hi> near adjoyning at the Eaſt end, being included; the ſaid Iſland being about 8 Miles in breadth towards the Eaſt end of it, and about 3 towards the Weſt end, but the Soil of much of it, is very barren and uncultivated. The Sound on the North-ſide is about 3 Leagues over, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Falmouth</hi> on the Main, and to <hi>Elſabeth's</hi>-Iſlands, which lye South-Weſtward of <hi>Falmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the <hi>Gayhead</hi> at the Weſt end of the Iſland, to <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi>; it is about 12 Leagues, and from <hi>Edgartown</hi> Harbour at the Eaſt end of it, to <hi>Nantucket</hi>; is as Veſſels ſail, about 10.</p>
            <p>The Iſland called <hi>No-mans-land</hi> lies South-ward from the Weſt end of <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> about 4 Miles from the <hi>Gayhead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:002152_0037_0FBC782CB86531E0"/>Concerning the Converſion of the <hi>Indians</hi> on theſe Iſlands, and places adjacent on the Main, there was a brief Narrative written by <hi>Matthew Mayhew,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Eldeſt Son of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Thomas Mayhew,</hi> who firſt Preached the Goſpel unto them; which Narrative was Printed at <hi>Boſton</hi> in the Year 1694. and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed at <hi>London</hi> the next Year, under the Title of, <hi>The Conqueſts and Triumphs of Grace,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame, for Subſtance, being again Printed ſome Years after, in Dr. <hi>C. Mather's</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall begin my Account of the State of the <hi>Indians</hi> from the time the ſaid Book was firſt Publiſhed, that being about the time that I firſt began to Preach to them.</p>
            <p>The Number of <hi>Indians</hi> on theſe Iſlands is very much diminiſhed, ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> firſt ſettled on <hi>Martha's-Vineyard,</hi> which was in the Year 1642 there being then as was ſuppoſed on that Iſland about 1500 Souls. At preſent there are in the <hi>Vineyard</hi> ſix ſmall Villages, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all of them, about 155 Families, and the Number of Souls may be about eight hundred.</p>
            <p>Each of theſe Villages is provided with an <hi>Indian</hi> Preacher to diſpence the Word to them on the Lord's Days, when I am not with them. They meet for the Worſhip of GOD twice a Day on the Sabbath, and after Prayer, ſing a Pſalm; then there is a Sermon Preached on
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002152_0038_0FBC782E417B2680"/>
ſome Portion of Scripture, which being ended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſing again; while the Days be of a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient length; and then conclude with Prayer.</p>
            <p>Beſides the <hi>Indians</hi> on the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> there is a ſmall Aſſembly on <hi>Winthrop's</hi> Iſland, the Eaſtermoſt of <hi>Elſabeth's</hi> Iſlands before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and theſe alſo have ordinarily an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Miniſter to Preach the Word of GOD to them, and Mr. <hi>John Weeks</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Preached to them; but has lately, as I am informed, deſiſted from that Work.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Tucker's</hi>-Iſland, &amp; at <hi>Naſhaun</hi> or <hi>Slocum's</hi> Iſland, which lie near together, Weſtward of <hi>Winthrop's</hi> Iſland, are about 12 or 14 Families, and theſe, tho' their Number be ſmall, are provided with an Indian Preacher.</p>
            <p>At the before mentioned <hi>No-mans-land,</hi> there are now ſo few Indians left, that they have none to Preach conſtantly to them.</p>
            <p>Beſides the <hi>Indian Aſſemblies</hi> already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, there is one Aſſembly of <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> at the <hi>Gayhead</hi>; but the number of People belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto this, is very inconſiderable.</p>
            <p>Tho' there are many <hi>Indians</hi> on theſe Iſlands, who are very negligent as to their Attendance on the Publick Worſhip of GOD; yet I know of none, but what do make ſome Profeſſion of Religion, and will talk ſoberly, when treated withal about it; having made a trial on ſome that have been moſt ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002152_0039_0FBC782FB552BDD8"/>And tho' there are among theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> a great many who are very defective in their Morals; yet there are a conſiderable number, even of thoſe not yet joyned in Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, who live ſoberly, and Worſhip GOD in their Families.</p>
            <p>There has, from time to time, been much care taken that the ſeveral Villages might be provided with School-Maſters to teach the Children to Read and Write; yet ſome of them have not been ſo conſtantly ſupplied, as is to be deſired; and generally when the Spring of the Year comes on, the Indians take their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from School, alleging they want them for Tillage of the Land; and ſo the Schools fail till the Fall; and this has much hindred their Progreſs in Learning: Nevertheleſs, I think the greateſt number can Read, either in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or in the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue; and ſome in both.</p>
            <p>There is alſo care taken to <hi>Catechiſe</hi> the Youth, For beſides what is done in this kind, by the <hi>Indian</hi> School-Maſters &amp; Preachers, I frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine the Young People my ſelf, and have determined to attend this Service once a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, in ſome or other of the forementioned Villages; and this Method will I hope, prove very advantageous, many grown People as well as Children, attending theſe Exerciſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002152_0040_0FBC78339798DCF0"/>The <hi>Indian</hi> Church at <hi>Martha's-Vineyard,</hi> whereof Mr. <hi>Japheth Hannit</hi> an excellent <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Miniſter</hi> was formerly the Paſtor, but died in the Year 1712. had after his Death another Paſtor, called <hi>Sowomog</hi>: but he being an Old Man when he was firſt called unto that Office, lived but a very few Years.</p>
            <p>The Name of the preſent Paſtor of that Church is <hi>Joaſh Panu,</hi> who is a very ſerious prudent &amp; pious Man, of a good Converſation, and one who drinks no ſtrong drink, but is much grieved at thoſe of his Country-men who do err by means of it. If it pleaſe GOD to continue his Life, he is like to prove a good Inſtrument; but being lately fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Languiſhing Diſtemper, I fear what the iſſue of it may be.</p>
            <p>The number of Communicants, both Men and Women, in this Church, is about 110. the moſt of theſe are Inhabitants of <hi>Martha's-Vineyard,</hi> but not all; there being a few that have joyned themſelves there unto, not only from <hi>Elſabeth</hi>'s Iſlands, but from the Main Land alſo, lying next unto the <hi>Vineyard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord's Supper is ordinarily Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in that Church about 7 or 8 times in a Year, and Diſcipline is in ſome meaſure kept up in it. Unto this End, beſides other Church Meetings, there is conſtantly on the <hi>Thurſday</hi> or <hi>Friday</hi> before that Sacrament is Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002152_0041_0FBC78359312EB58"/>
a Meeting of the Church, wherein ſuch are ſuſpended from the Lords Table as having been over-taken in any fault, have not given due ſatisfaction. At this Meeting alſo there is ordinarily a Sermon Preached ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the occaſion.</p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledged that as the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are many of them much addicted unto ſtrong drink; ſo ſome of the Members of the Indian Church have been ſometimes found very faulty, on this account; yet it is alſo true, that ſuch as theſe have generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very Penitent. And tho' ſome have fallen quite away, and ſo have been cut off by the Sword of Diſcipline; yet others thro' the Grace of GOD, have been ſo far recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the Sins into which they have fallen, as that it may be hoped they will not again return to them; and there have all along been, and ſtill are, a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whoſe Converſation is, ſo far as I can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, very blameleſs, and who may be juſtly looked upon as Exemplary Chriſtians; what ever ſuch <hi>Engliſh Men</hi> as are filled with Prejudices againſt the <hi>Indians,</hi> may ſay to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Some Years after I firſt began to Preach to the <hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> on <hi>Martha's-Vineyard,</hi> did on a day of <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> appointed for that End, ſolemnly renew their Covenant
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002152_0042_0FBC7836A8D13FD0"/>
with GOD, engaging to endeavour to forſake thoſe Sins with which they confeſſed they were too eaſily beſet; and there was after this, for a Time, ſome Reformation: but I obſerved that two or three of the Brethren that could not be perſwaded to joyn in the Action, ſoon after fell into Scandalous Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours.</p>
            <p>I alſo obſerved, That after the Church had thus renewed their Covenant, the Means of Grace offered unto the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſeemed for a time to be attended with more of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of GOD, and the Influences of His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, than they were before, or have been ſince.</p>
            <p>It was then frequent to ſee Perſons at the Hearing of Sermons, very much affected, and ſome times as ſoon as Sermon was ended, there would ſtand up ſeveral, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and make very Penitential Confeſſions of their Sins, with Promiſes to endeavour to Live new Lives, deſiring alſo the Prayers of the People of GOD for them.</p>
            <p>About this time there joyned in full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion unto that ſmall Church on the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> in one Year, at leaſt 30 Perſons, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havour of many of whom did very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that of the Jailor, at his Converſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. GOD ſhewing us herein that He can make the <hi>Indians</hi> as well as Others a <hi>willing People in the Day of His Power.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002152_0043_0FBC7837F4CAE098"/>There is an Increaſe of Knowledge among theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> tho' it muſt be confeſſed that their progreſs herein is but ſlow, by reaſon of the want of a Learned Miniſtry conſtantly to Inſtruct them. Their ordinary Preachers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but little Learning, are not ſo able to feed them with Knowledge and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as is to be deſired; yet ſome of theſe have Gifts not to be deſpiſed in <hi>a day of ſmall things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Indian</hi> Miniſters as they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in full Communion of the Church on the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> ſo they do not engage in the work of the Miniſtry without the Conſent &amp; Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of that Church, as well as of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters that Preach unto the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and have an Inſpection over them.</p>
            <p>Having now Preached to the <hi>Indians</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Twenty-five Years, I have never yet had any ſpecial charge of any one ſingle Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation committed to me; but have viſited the ſeveral fore-mentioned Aſſemblies alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, as I have thought moſt neceſſary; Preaching ordinarily, unto ſome or other of them every Lord's Day, and on working days once a Fortnight; conſtantly alſo attending their Church-Meetings, to aſſiſt &amp; direct them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> when they are Sick, generally ſend for their Miniſters, and ſome times other Chriſtians with them, to viſit them and Pray with, and for them. I have ſome times
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002152_0044_0FBC783BA0EA6828"/>
been with them on ſuch occaſions, and heard them profeſs a great concern about their Souls; declaring that they did not regard any thing in this World, ſo they might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Intereſt in GOD's Favour; and I have known many of them who have profeſſed a good hope thro' CHRIST in their Death, and who have behaved themſelves on all accounts as does become dying Saints; nor have I any doubt, but that many of them have died in the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Mr. <hi>Joſiah Torrey,</hi> Paſtor of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church in <hi>Tiſbury</hi> on the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi> has alſo for many Years paſt Preached as a Lecturer unto the <hi>Indians</hi> on that Iſland, having for that End learned their Language. He Preacheth in ſome or other of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies once a Fortnight, and goes frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their Church-Meetings, to adviſe and aſſiſt them; ſo that the <hi>Indians</hi> have a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon every <hi>Thurſday</hi> Preached to them, either by Mr. <hi>Torrey,</hi> or my ſelf: And we ſtrengthen the hands of one another, by going together to theſe Weekly Exerciſes.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Mr. <hi>Samuel Wiſwall</hi> Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Edgartown,</hi> has alſo now almoſt learned the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue, with a deſign to do what Service he can among that People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> on <hi>Martha's Vineyard</hi> and the adjacent Iſlands, do hitherto underſtand the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002152_0045_0FBC783E089762F8"/>
               <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue much better than that of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and therefore complain much for want of <hi>Indian</hi> BIBLES, having now but very few among them. Nor are there any to be had; the laſt Edition being now gone. Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> are therefore very deſirous of another Impreſſion of the Bible, if it might be obtained; and divers of them have told me, as well as ſome of thoſe on <hi>Nantucket,</hi> (whom I have divers times viſited) that they ſhould be willing according to their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to contribute to it.</p>
            <p>But the diſadvantage which the <hi>Indians</hi> are under thro' the Scarcity of BIBLES is ſome-what helped by the Care of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Commiſſioners to ſupply them with other uſeful Books in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>New-England</hi> Confeſſion of Faith; Several Catechiſms; The Practice of Piety; Mr. <hi>Shepard's</hi> Sincere Convert; Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Call to the Unconverted. And ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sermon Books of Dr. <hi>Mather</hi>'s, &amp;c. beſides the Pſalter, and the Goſpel of JOHN, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Year 1709. And the <hi>Indian</hi> Primer Printed this Year, in <hi>Indian</hi> &amp; <hi>Engliſh.</hi> All which Books are now very uſeful unto them.</p>
            <p>As to their Civil Government, the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Dukes</hi> County, (as well as in other Places) are wholly under the <hi>Engliſh</hi>;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002152_0046_0FBC783F82570F60"/>
But becauſe their State does yet ſomewhat differ from that of their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Neighbours, there are ſeveral Laws made by the General Court of this <hi>Province,</hi> with a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the <hi>Indian</hi> Inhabitants of the ſame: And there are ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Juſtices eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commiſſionated to take care of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Inhabiting the ſeveral Counties of it; and <hi>theſe</hi> are directed to Nominate and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſeveral Officers among the <hi>Indians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to aſſiſt under their regulation, in the Government of that People.</p>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son of the fore-mentioned Mr. <hi>Thomas Mayhew,</hi> who firſt Preached to the <hi>Indians</hi> on the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> was long improved in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Indians</hi> there, and was both ſingularly Spirited &amp; Accompliſhed for that Service; as he was on divers other accounts, a very excellent Perſon: But he finiſhed his courſe <hi>July</hi> 21. 1715. And his Son <hi>Zacheus Mayhew</hi> ſucceeding him in that neceſſary but troubleſome Office and Imployment, does good Service in it.</p>
            <p>There are yet but few <hi>Indians</hi> on <hi>Martha</hi>'s-<hi>Vineyard</hi> that have Houſes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> faſhion, tho' the number of theſe is of late increaſed; but in reſpect of their Apparel, they are generally Cloathed as the Engliſh are, and they by degrees learn the Engliſh

way of Husbandry: Several of them have good Teams of Oxen, with which they Plough and Cart, for themſelves and Neighbours, as the Engliſh do. Many of them have alſo Horſes, Cows, Sheep and Swine. They have alſo among them ſome that have learned Trades; as at <hi>Martha's-Vineyard</hi> there are ſeveral Weavers, One or two Houſe-Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, One Wheel-wright, who is ſo good a Work-man, as to be frequently employed by his Engliſh Neighbours. There are ſeveral Tailors, and one if not more Shoe-makers, and one Black-ſmith, who not only took his Trade himſelf, but alſo made his Bellows, and other Tools; and one Cooper, <hi>viz. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Charles,</hi> who is a good Work-man. And tho' ſome of theſe may not be ſo accurate as our Engliſh Trades-men, yet this ſhews that as the <hi>Indians</hi> are capable of Learning ſuch Callings as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men follow; ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to come to it.</p>
