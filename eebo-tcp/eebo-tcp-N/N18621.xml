            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A FAITHFUL NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WITH regard to her temper of mind, her views of ſupernatural objects, and her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions with regard to the ſtate of her ſoul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards GOD, ſhe related as follows:</p>
            <p>From my youth up to my firſt awakening, I lived without GOD in the world, in a ſtupified forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the obligations I had ever been under to him. and of the ſolemn account I muſt one day render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him of the deeds done in the body, and of all my views and aims; till it pleaſed a ſovereign GOD, two years ago laſt July, to ſend his ſpirit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of my ſins, and lay open to my view the awful danger that was impending over me. At which time my ſins were ſet in order before me, in ſuch dreadful array, and the enmity of my heart, and my native oppoſition to GOD, ariſing to my view, produced ſuch diſtreſs and agony of ſoul, as to overpower all ſenſe of bodily pain, though I had for ſome time before been exerciſed with ſevere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs in body, and was at this time reduced to ſuch a ſtate of weakneſs, accompanied with continual wrecking pain, that my life was almoſt deſpaired of from day to day.</p>
            <p>It appears to me aſtoniſhing, upon every recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, that the agony of my mind did not diſolve the frame of my nature, and how I could ſubſiſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſmart and agony of ſuch a wounded ſpirit.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:024164_0003_0FC3DFA0C66BE3F0"/>
It ſeems to me now, that had it continued much longer, it muſt unavoidably have overpowered the remains of life in me, and put a period to my exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on earth. But after having remained for ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral days in this anguiſh of ſpirit, and dreadful bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſoul, I found relief in a manner moſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>After I had laid myſelf down on my bed, my mind was led to a moſt delightful and realizing view of the entire ſafety of truſting in the Divine Power and Mercy; that there was ſuch a fullneſs in GOD, of that which I needed for relief and comfort, that my heart within me was conſtrained to rejoice, and could not but roll my burden upon the Lord. At this time the words of the Pſalmiſt, in which he ſays, "Thou haſt brought my feet up out of the miry clay," &amp;c. were to my ſoul ſweeter than honey or the honey-comb; and alſo the 16th hymn of the third book of Dr. WATTS'S Hymns, was to my ſoul like a feaſt of fat things, and of wine upon the lees. For ſome conſiderable time after this, I enjoyed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without any intermiſſion, a moſt ſweet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſenſe of the beauty and glory of divine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But not underſtanding the treachery of my own heart, and the deceitfulneſs of ſin, I was allured away by degrees, into a forgetfulneſs of GOD, and from a cloſe walk with him, through an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that I might innocently indulge myſelf in join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with young people in what is uſually termed civil merriment; and which I was induced to do more eſpecially and principally that I might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an object of ridicule among them. But before I was aware of the danger I had incurred by turning in ſuch a manner to vanity, I found that my heart was ſenſibly alienated from GOD, and my whole ſoul was overwhelmed in guilt and darkneſs, and during
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024164_0004_0FC3DFA2240FFAB8"/>
the time of my perſiſting to join with young com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in what is termed civil recreation and merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I felt thoſe laſhes and ſtings of conſcience, which before this I had ever been an utter ſtranger to. In this ſtate of ſenſible guilt and darkneſs, I continued like one forſaken of GOD, and ſhut out from his preſence, till the firſt day of laſt July, when I was ſeized with convulſions, which came upon me with ſuch violence, that it appeared to myſelf and others, that my animal frame muſt ſoon yield to the force of the diſorder, and my life ſoon come to a period.</p>
            <p>She continued in this ſituation till the night of the 11th of July, when ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized with a moſt violent cramp in her ſtomach, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch agony and diſtreſs, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared impoſſible for her to live from one hour to another. In this ſituation ſhe continued till the following night, when the cramp in her ſtomach in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to ſuch a degree, that the conſtant wreck and agony of body cnnſtrained her to a continual rolling and tumbling on her bed, during which time ſhe remained ſpeechleſs, but appeared to have her ſenſes; for when any ſpoke, ſhe would take them by the hand, and intimate that ſhe underſtood what they ſaid. All hopes of life were now at an end in the view of the family, and neighbours, who had come together at the houſe on this occaſion. But after having continued in this extremity of diſtreſs till about midnight, ſhe appeared to be more eaſy, upon which the neighbours retired to their ſeveral homes. But ſoon after this ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized again, and ſuppoſed by the family to be dead; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the neighbours were called together to the houſe, with the tidings that POLLY was dead. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the arrival of the neareſt neighbour, he obſerved
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024164_0005_0FC3DFA39F2BC068"/>
that ſhe lay ſtretched out on her back, with her eyes about half open, and the ſight of her eye turned up into her head. She appeared at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> ſigh, and opened her eyes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> beyond all deſcription. It was a region of moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal darkneſs and ſmoke. In the midſt of theſe doleful ſhades, appeared to my view a perſon whom I knew; and after having had a ſight of him, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to ſink down into the darkneſs and ſmoke of the horrible pit. I heard the groans of the damned ſpirits, which indicated that agony and diſtreſs which is beyond all utterance or conception. In the utmoſt extremity of danger, and when I appeared to myſelf to be ready to plunge into the diſmal gulf of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſery, my Saviour took me by the hand, and told me to follow him. Upon which he led me through a place reſembling the moſt diſmal miry clay; and from thence through a hideous wilderneſs, after paſſing which every object which opened to my view appeared to be cloathed with an inexpreſſible beauty. My Saviour addreſſed me, and ſaid, he had brought my feet out of the miry clay, and had ſet them upon a rock; and he himſelf appeared to be the rock upon which my feet ſtood. I was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the heavenly world, where the Lord looked upon me and ſmiled, and told me I muſt return and warn a wicked world for a little ſeaſon; but ſhould, in a ſhort time return again. He told me I ſhould be much more ſick than I had been, but ſhould wholly recover and be well for a ſeaſon, I ſaw thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the heavenly hoſt cloathed in that beauty
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024164_0006_0FC3DFA795051698"/>
which cannot be uttered; and heard thoſe ſongs of praiſe, the melody of which is beyond the power of language to deſcribe</p>
            <p>Upon her having declared to the byſtanders theſe diſcoveries, ſhe remained for the ſpace of three days and three nights without food or ſleep during the whole of which time ſhe was almoſt inceſſantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in praying and, praiſing GOD, and warning others to prepare for death. After this ſhe gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally recovered to ſuch a degree of health, as to be able to walk about the houſe; and, at times, to walk abroad. In this ſpace ſhe frequently ſaid that ſhe ſhould be much ſicker than ever ſhe had been; but ſhould certainly reeover to a better ſtate of health than ſhe had enjoyed for four years paſt, She fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pointed out the week in which ſhe ſhould be taken ſick, and reduced to ſuch a ſtate of extreme weakneſs and diſtreſs; and accordingly on Friday of the ſame week ſhe had mentioned, (which was the 27th of July) ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized with a moſt violent cramp convulſion, which was ſoon accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a profuſe diſcharge of blood from her ſtomach; in which ſituation ſhe continued, till the 13th of Auguſt; during which time ſhe was reduced apparently to the laſt extremity, and all viſible proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the poſſibility of her living was now at an end.</p>
            <p>For the ſpace of ſixteen days ſhe was not known to turn herſelf in the bed, except once. From Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night to the Saturday night following, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained entirely without food or drink, except for once ſhe took down a little water; and upon her having for once ſwallowed a morſel of food, her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach immediately rejected it. She was ſo weak, that it was with difficulty, and very ſeldom, ſhe could make any one underſtand her by whiſpering in their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024164_0007_0FC3DFAB1CC72448"/>
ear. On Saturday ſhe was thought to be dying; but as ſhe had all along intimated to thoſe about her that ſhe ſhould certainly recover, ſo ſhe now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to intimate the ſame, by ſigns, to the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders. In this ſituation ſhe continued till about eight o'clock, in the evening; at which time, to the ſurpriſe of the byſtanders, ſhe ſpoke out in plain and audible words, and ſaid, "Stand by, and let me get up" Immediately upon which ſhe ſprang up from her bed, and walked the room with an aſtoniſhing nimbleneſs and alacrity, praiſing God, and calling on the byſtanders to join with her, to praiſe that bleſſed Saviour, who had appeared for her in that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner. But they ſtood like perſons over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed In aſtoniſhment, to ſee the wonders of GOD'S power diſplayed in ſuch a manner, in reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one to health and ſtrength in a moment, who had been reduced to ſo low a ſtate by extreme ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Upon this recovery, ſhe related that ſhe ſaw one ſtanding in white, who ſaid to her, "If you will get up, you ſhall be able to walk; and you muſt go up to SCOTT'S;" (which was one mile diſtant from her houſe) and accordingly that evening ſhe rode to Capt. SCOTT'S and tarried ſome hours, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home; and having retired to bed a little after day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, ſhe aroſe early on the morning, and before ſun-riſe was on her way to meeting at <hi>Corniſh,</hi> to the diſtance of five miles; from whence ſhe returned home on the ſame day.</p>
            <p>From the time of her recovery, ſhe has enjoyed hitherto a much better ſtate of health, than for four years paſt; and is now as well as is uſual for a female of a delicate conſtitution; and remains an evident monument of the Divine Power and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>The above mentioned POLLY DAVIS requeſts that her moſt affectionate love may be preſented to every
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024164_0008_0FC3DFAEE0DB4528"/>
reader; and aſks leave to teſtify, "That a ſenſe of GOD'S love in the heart is better than wine: and that all things which can be deſired, are not to be compared to it. Under a ſenſe of this, ſhe aſks liberty to call upon every reader to come and taſte that the LORD is gracious; and that her fellow youth, in ſpeical, would remember him in their early days, and regard his glory as their governing object. She does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them, in ſpecial, to forſake the vanities of the world and pride of life: And if they would walk with GOD, ſo as to enjoy the light of his countenance, and have comfort in their ſouls, they do ſacredly abſtain from, and forever abandon, that kind of fooliſh talking and jeſting, and that recreation and merriment, which generally paſſes, even amongſt many profeſſors of religion, for <hi>civil and innocent.</hi>— She certainly knows, by what ſhe has found upon trial, that theſe things, in their operation, will be like wormwood and gall to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Under a ſenſe that we are called with an high and holy calling, ſhe affectionately intreats every one to conſider, what manner of perſons we ought to be, in all holy converſation and godlineſs; looking for, and haſtening unto the day of GOD, that we may be found of him in peace at his appearing, and finally be received into his eternal kingdom.</p>
