            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A CAUTION AND WARNING &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AT a time when the general rights and liberties of mankind, and the preſervation of thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable privileges tranſmitted to us from our anceſtors, are become ſo much the ſubjects of univerſal conſideration; can it be an inquiry indifferent to any, how many of thoſe who diſtinguiſh themſelves as the Advocates of Liberty, remain inſenſible and inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the treatment of thouſands and tens of thouſands of our fellow-men, who, from motives of avarice, and the inexorable degree of tyrant cuſtom, are at this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time kept in the moſt deplorable ſtate of ſlavery, in many parts of the Britiſh Dominions.</p>
            <p>The intent of publiſhing the following ſheets, is more fully to make known the aggravated iniquity attending the practice of the Slave-Trade; whereby many thouſands of our fellow-creatures, as free as ourſelves by nature, and equally with us the ſubjects of Chriſt's redeeming grace, are yearly brought into inextricable and barbarous bondage; and many, very many, to miſerable and untimely ends.</p>
            <p>The truth of this lamentable complaint is ſo obvious to perſons of candour, under whoſe notice it hath fallen, that ſeveral have lately publiſhed their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereon; as a matter which calls for the moſt ſerious conſideration of all who are concerned for the civil or religious welfare of their country. How an evil of ſo deep a dye, hath ſo long, not only paſſed uninterrupted by Thoſe in Power, but hath even had
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010240_0003_0F7E08D840CDA0A0"/>their countenance, is, indeed, ſurpriſing, and, charity would ſuppoſe, muſt, in a great meaſure, have ariſen from this, that many perſons in government, both of the Clergy and Laity, in whoſe power it hath been to put a ſtop to the Trade, have been unacquainted with the corrupt motives which gives life to it; and the groans, the dying groans, which daily aſcend to God, the common Father of mankind, from the broken hearts of thoſe his deeply oppreſſed creatures; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the powers of the earth would not, I think I may venture to ſay, could not, have ſo long authoriſed a practice ſo inconſiſtent with every idea of liberty and juſtice, which, as the learned James Foſter ſays, <hi>Bids that God, which is the God and Father of the Gentiles, unconverted to Chriſtianity, moſt daring and hold defiance; and ſpurns at all the principles both of natural and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much might juſtly be ſaid of the temporal evils which attend this practice, as it is deſtructive of the welfare of human ſociety, and of the peace and proſperity of every country, in proportion as it prevails. It might be alſo ſhewn, that it deſtroys the bonds of natural affection and intereſt, whereby mankind in general are united; that it introduces idleneſs, diſcourages marriage, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the youth, ruins and debauches morals, excites continual apprehenſions of dangers, and frequent alarms, to which the Whites are neceſſarily expoſed from ſo great an encreaſe of a people, that, by their bondage and oppreſſions, become natural enemies, yet, at the ſame time, are filling the places and eating the bread of thoſe who would be the ſupport and ſecurity of the country. But as theſe and many more reflections of the ſame kind, may occur to a conſiderate mind, I ſhall only endeavour to ſhew, from the nature of the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010240_0004_0F7E08D8F5104250"/>Trade, the plenty which Guinea affords its inhabitants, the barbarous treatment of the Negroes, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations made thereon by authors of note, that it is inconſiſtent with the plaineſt precepts of the goſpel, the dictates of reaſon, and every common ſentiment of humanity.</p>
            <p>In an account of the European Setttlements in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, printed in London, 1757, the author ſpeaking on this ſubject, ſays: <q>The Negroes in our Colonies endure a ſlavery more compleat and attended with far worſe circumſtances than what any people in their condition ſuffer in any other part of the world, or have ſuffered in any other period of time: proofs of this are not wanting. The prodigious waſte which we experience in this unhappy part of our ſpecies, is a full and melancholy evidence of this truth. The Iſland of Barbados, (the Negroes upon which do not amount to eighty thouſand) notwithſtanding all the means which they uſe to encreaſe them by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, and that the climate is in every reſpect except that of being more wholeſome) exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the climate from whence they come; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, Barbados lies under a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of an annual recruit of five thouſand ſlaves, to keep up the ſtock at the number I have mentioned. This prodigious failure, which is at leaſt in the ſame proportion in all our Iſlands, ſhews demonſtratively that ſome uncommon and unſupportable hardſhip lies upon the Negroes, which wears them down in ſuch a ſurpriſing manner; and this, I imagine, is principally the exceſſive labour which they undergo.</q> In an account of part of North-America, publiſhed by Thomas Jeffery, printed 1761, ſpeaking of the uſage the Negroes receive in the Weſt-India Iſlands, thus
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010240_0005_0F7E08D9C3BD65C0"/>expreſſes himſelf: <q>It's impoſſible for a human heart to reflect upon the ſervitude of theſe dregs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, without in ſome meaſure feeling for their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, which ends but with their lives.—Nothing can be more wretched than the condition of this people. One would imagine, they were framed to be the diſgrace of the human ſpecies, baniſhed from their country, and deprived of that bleſſing Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, on which all other nations ſet the greateſt value, they are in a manner reduced to the condition of beaſts of burden: In general a few roots, potatoes eſpecially, are their food, and two rags, which neither ſcreen them from the heat of the day, nor the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary coolneſs of the night, all their covering; their ſleep very ſhort; their labour almoſt continual, they receive no wages, but have twenty laſhes for the ſmalleſt fault.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A conſiderate young perſon who was late in one of our Weſt-India Iſlands, where he obſerved the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſituation of the Negroes, makes the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, <q>I meet with daily exerciſe, to ſee the treatment which theſe miſerable wretches meet with from their maſters, with but few exceptions. They whip them moſt unmercifully, on ſmall occaſions. They beat them with thick clubs, and you will ſee their bodies all whaled and ſcarred; in ſhort, they ſeem to ſet no other value on their lives than as they coſt them ſo much money; and are not reſtrained from kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, when angry, by a worthier conſideration than that they loſe ſo much. They act as tho' they did not look upon them as a race of human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who have reaſon, and remembrance of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, but as beaſts, like oxen, who are ſtubborn, hardy and ſenſeleſs; fit for burdens, and deſigned to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010240_0006_0F7E08DA747FF4E8"/>bear them. They won't allow them to have any claim to human privileges, or ſcarce, indeed, to be regarded as the work of God. Tho' it was conſiſtent with the juſtice of our Maker to pronounce the ſentence on our common parent, and thro' him on all ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, <hi>That he and they ſhould eat their bread by the ſweat of their brow;</hi> yet, does it not ſtand record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame eternal truth, <hi>That the Labourer is worthy of his hire?</hi> It cannot be allowed in natural juſtice that there ſhould be a ſervitude without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: A cruel endleſs ſervitude. It cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable to natural juſtice, that whole nations; nay whole continents of men, ſhould be devoted to do the drudgery of life for others, be dragged away from their attachments of relations and ſocieties; and made to ſerve the appetites and pleaſures of a race of men whoſe ſuperiority has been obtained by an illegal force.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A particular account of the treatment theſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Africans receive in the Weſt-Indies, was lately publiſhed, which even by thoſe who, blinded by intereſt, ſeek excuſes for the Trade, and endeavour to palliate the cruelty exerciſed upon them, is allowed to be a true, tho' rather too favourable repreſentation of the uſage they receive, which is as follows, viz. <q>The iniquity of the Slave-trade is greatly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by the inhumanity with which the Negroes are treated in the Plantations, as well with reſpect to food and cloathing, as from the unreaſonable labour which is commonly exacted from them. To which may be added the cruel chaſtiſements they frequently ſuffer, without any other bounds than the will and wrath of their hard taſk-maſters. In Barbados, and ſome other of the Iſlands, ſix pints of Indian corn
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010240_0007_0F7E08DB36DC4BD8"/>and three herrings are reckoned a full week's allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for a working ſlave, and in the Syſtem of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy it is ſaid, <hi>That in Jamaica the owners of the Negroe-ſlaves, ſet aſide for each a parcel of ground, and allow them Sundays to manure it, the produce of which,</hi> with ſometimes a few herrings, or other ſalt fiſh, <hi>is all that is allowed for their ſupport.</hi> Their allowance for cloathing in the Iſlands is ſeldom more than ſix yards of oſenbrigs each year: and in the more northern Colonies, where the piercing weſterly winds are long and ſenſibly felt, theſe poor Africans ſuffer much for want of ſufficient cloathing, indeed ſome have none till they are able to pay for it by their labour. The time that the Negroes work in the Weſt-Indies, is from day-break till noon; then again from two o'clock till duſk: (during which time they are attended by overſeers, who ſeverely ſcourge thoſe who appear to them dilatory) and before they are ſuffered to go to their quarters, they have ſtill ſomething to do, as collecting of herbage for the horſes, gathering fuel for the boilers, &amp;c. ſo that it is often half paſt twelve before they can get home, when they have ſcarce time to grind and boil their Indian corn; whereby it often happens that they are called again to labour before they can ſatisfy their hunger: and here no delay or excuſe will avail, for if they are not in the field immediately upon the uſual notice, they muſt expect to feel the overſeers laſh. In crop-time (which laſts many months) they are obliged (by turns) to work moſt of the night in the boiling-houſe. Thus their owners, from a deſire of making the greateſt gain by the labour of their ſlaves, lay heavy burdens on them, and yet feed and clothe them very ſparingly, and ſome ſcarce feed or
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010240_0008_0F7E08DCB4C3B4A8"/>clothe them at all, ſo that the poor creatures are obliged to ſhift for their living in the beſt manner they can, which occaſions their being often killed in the neighbouring lands, ſtealing potatoes, or other food, to ſatisfy their hunger. And if they take any thing from the plantation they belong to, tho' under ſuch preſſing want, their owners will correct them ſeverely, for taking a little of what they have ſo hardly laboured for, whilſt they themſelves riot in the greateſt luxury and exceſs.—It is a matter of aſtoniſhment, how a people who, as a nation, are looked upon as generous and humane, and ſo much value themſelves for their uncommon ſenſe of the benefit of Liberty, can live in the practice of ſuch extreme oppreſſion and inhumanity, without ſeeing the inconſiſtency of ſuch conduct, and without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great remorſe: Nor is it leſs amazing to hear theſe men calmly making calculations about the ſtrength and lives of their fellow-men; in Jamaica, if ſix in ten, of the new imported Negroes ſurvive the ſeaſoning, it is looked upon as a gaining purchaſe: And in moſt of the other plantations, if the Negroes live eight or nine years, their labour is reckoned a ſufficient compenſation for their coſt.—If calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of this ſort were made upon the ſtrength and labour of beaſts of burden it would not appear ſo ſtrange, but even then a merciful man would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly uſe his beaſt with more mercy than is uſually ſhewn to the poor Negroes.—Will not the groans of this deeply afflicted and oppreſſed people reach heaven, and when the cup of iniquity is full, muſt not the inevitable conſequence be pouring forth of the judgments of God upon their oppreſſors. But, alas! is it not too manifeſt that this oppreſſion has
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010240_0009_0F7E08DD7608A828"/>already long been the object of the divine diſpleaſure, for what heavier judgment, what greater calamity can befall any people, than to become a prey to that hardneſs of heart, that forgetfulneſs of God, and inſenbility to every religious impreſſion; as well as that general depravation of manners, which ſo much prevails in the Colonies, in proportion as they have more or leſs enriched themſelves, at the expence of the blood and bondage of the Negroes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſituation of the Negroes in our Southern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces on the Continent, is alſo feelingly ſet forth by George Whitefield, in a letter from Georgia, to the inhabitants of Maryland, Virginia, North-and South-Carolina, printed in the year 1739, of which the following is an extract, <q>As I lately paſſed through your provinces, in my way hither, I was ſenſibly touched with a fellow-feeling of the miſeries of the poor Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes. Whether it be lawful for Chriſtians to buy ſlaves, and thereby encourage the nations from whom they are bought, to be at perpetual war with each other, I ſhall not take upon me to determine; ſure I am, it is ſinful, when bought, to uſe them as bad, nay worſe, than as though they were brutes; and whatever particular exception there may be, (as I would charitably hope there are ſome) I fear the generality of you, that own Negroes, are liable to ſuch a charge; for your ſlaves, I believe, work as hard, if not harder, than the horſes whereon you ride. Theſe, after they have done their work, are fed and taken proper care of; but many Negroes, when wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with labour, in your plantations, have been obliged to grind their own corn, after they return home; your dogs are careſſed and fondled at your tables; but your ſlaves, who are frequently ſtiled

When paſſing along, I have viewed your plantations cleared and cultivated, many ſpacious houſes built, and the owners of them faring ſumptuouſly every day, my blood has frequently almoſt run cold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me, to conſider how many of your ſlaves had neither convenient food to eat, or proper raiment to put on, notwithſtanding moſt of the comforts you enjoy were ſolely owing to their indefatigable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.—The Scripture ſays, Thou ſhalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. Does God take care for oxen; and will he not take care of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes alſo? undoubtedly he will.—Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you: Behold the proviſion of the poor Negroes, who have reaped down your fields, which is by you denied them, crieth; and the cries of them, which reaped, are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. We have a remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God's taking cognizance of, and avenging the quarrel of poor ſlaves, 2 Sam. xxi. 1. There was a famine in the days of David, three years, year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter year; and David enquired of the Lord: And the Lord anſwered, It is for Saul, and his bloody houſe, becauſe he ſlew the Gibeonites. Two things are here very remarkable: Firſt, Theſe Gibeonites were only hewers of wood and drawers of water, or in other words, ſlaves like yours. Secondly, That
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010240_0011_0F7E08E2163FD4D0"/>this plague was ſent by God many years after the injury, the cauſe of the plague, was committed. And for what end were this and ſuch like examples recorded in holy Scriptures, without doubt, for our learning.—For God is the ſame to-day, as he was yeſterday, and will continue the ſame for ever. He does not reject the prayer of the poor and deſtitute; nor diſregard the cry of the meaneſt Negro. The blood of them ſpilt for thoſe many years in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective provinces will aſcend up to heaven againſt you.</q>

            <p>Some who have only ſeen Negroes in an abject ſtate of ſlavery, broken-ſpirited and dejected, knowing nothing of their ſituation in their native country, may apprehend, that they are naturally unſenſible of the benefits of Liberty, being deſtitute and miſerable in every reſpect, and that our ſuffering them to live amongſt us (as the Gibeonites of old were permitted to live with the Iſraelites) tho' even on more oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive term, is to them a favour; but theſe are certainly erroneous opinions, with reſpect to far the greateſt part of them: Altho' it is highly probable that in a country which is more than three thouſand miles in extent from north to ſouth, and as much from eaſt to weſt, there will be barren parts, and many inhabitants more uncivilized and barbarous than others; as is the caſe in all other countries: Yet, from the moſt authentic accounts, the inhabitants of Guinea appear, generally ſpeaking, to be an induſtrious, humane, ſociable people, whoſe capacities are naturally as enlarged, and as open to improvement, as thoſe of the Europeans; and that their Country is fruitful, and in many places well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, abounding in cattle, grain and fruits: And as the earth yields all the year round a freſh ſupply of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010240_0012_0F7E08E39B8CB430"/>food, and but little cloathing is requiſite, by reaſon of the continual warmth of the climate; the neceſſaries of life are much eaſter procured in moſt parts of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, than in our more northern climes. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by many authors of note, who have reſided there; among others M. Adanſon, in his account of Gorée and Senegal, in the year 1754, ſays, <q>Which way ſoever I turned my eyes on this pleaſant ſpot, I beheld a perfect image of pure nature; an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſolitude, bounded on every ſide by charming landſcapes, the rural ſituation of cottages in the midſt of trees; the eaſe and indolence of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes reclined under the ſhade of their ſpreading foliage; the ſimplicity of their dreſs and manners; the whole revived in my mind the idea of our firſt parents, and I ſeemed to contemplate the world in its primitive ſtate: they are, generally ſpeaking, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good-natured, ſociable and obliging. I was not a little pleaſed with this my firſt reception; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me, that there ought to be a conſiderable abatement made in the accounts I had read and heard every-where of the ſavage character of the Africans. I obſerved, both in Negroes and Moors, great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and ſociableneſs, which gave me ſtrong hopes, that I ſhould be very ſafe amongſt them, and meet with the ſucceſs I deſired, in my inquiries after the curioſities of the country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>William Boſman, a principal factor for the Dutch, who reſided ſixteen years in Guinea, ſpeaking of the natives of that part, where he then was, ſays, <q>They are generally a good ſort of people, honeſt in their dealings;' others he deſcribes as 'being generally friendly to ſtrangers, of a mild converſation, affable and eaſy to be overcome with reaſon.' He adds,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010240_0013_0F7E08E4391FE6C0"/>That ſome Negroes, who have had an agreeable education, have manifeſted a brightneſs of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding equal to any of us.' Speaking of the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the country, he ſays, 'It was very populous, plentifully provided with corn, potatoes and fruit, which grew cloſe to each other; in ſome places a foot-path is the only ground that is not covered with them; the Negroes leaving no place, which is thought fertile, uncultivated; and immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have reaped, they are ſure to ſow again.' Other parts he deſcribes, as 'being full of towns and villages; the ſoil very rich, and ſo well cultivated as to look like an entire garden, abounding in rice, corn, oxen and poultry, and the inhabitants labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>William Smith, who was ſent by the African Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to viſit their ſettlements on the coaſt of Guinea, in the year 1726, gives much the ſame accout of the country of Delmina and Cape Corſe, &amp;c. for beauty and goodneſs, and adds, <q>The more you come down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards that part, called Slave-Coaſt, the more delightful and rich the ſoil appears.' Speaking of their diſpoſition, he ſays, 'They were a civil, good-natured people, induſtrious to the laſt degree. It is eaſy to perceive what happy memories they are bleſſed with, and how great progreſs they would make in the ſciences, in caſe their genius was culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated with ſtudy.' He adds, from the information he received of one of the Factors, who had reſided ten years in that country, 'That the diſcerning natives account it their greateſt unhappineſs, that they were ever viſited by the Europeans.—That the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians introduced the Traffick of Slaves; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our coming they lived in peace.</q>

Andrew Brue, a principal man in the French Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, in the account he gives of the great river Senegal, which runs many hundred miles up the country, tells his readers, <q>The farther you go from the ſea, the country on the river ſeems more fruitful and well improved. It abounds in Guinea and Indian corn, rice, pulſe, tobacco, and indigo. Here are vaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, which feed large herds of great and ſmall cattle; poultry are numerous, as well as wild fowl.' The ſame author, in his travels to the ſouth of the river Gambia, expreſſes his ſurprize, 'to ſee the land ſo well cultivated; ſcarce a ſpot lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improved; the low grounds, divided by ſmall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, were all ſowed with rice; the higher ground planted with Indian corn, millet, and peas of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſorts, beef and mutton very cheap, as well as all other neceſſaries of life.' The account this author gives of the diſpoſition of the natives, is, 'That they are generally good-natured and civil, and may be brought to any thing by fair and ſoft means.' Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, ſpeaking of the ſame people, ſays, 'They are a ſincere, inoffenſive people, and do no injuſtice either to one another or ſtrangers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe accounts, both of the good diſpoſition of the natives, and the fruitfulneſs of moſt parts of Guinea, which are confirmed by many other authors, it may well be concluded, that their acquaintance with the Europeans would have been a happineſs to them, had thoſe laſt not only bore the name, but indeed been influenced by the ſpirit of Chriſtianity; but, alas! how hath the conduct of the Whites contradicted the precepts and example of Chriſt? Inſtead of promote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of his coming, by preaching the goſpel of peace and good-will to man, they have, by their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010240_0015_0F7E08E5B6DF5D00"/>contributed to enflame every noxious paſſion of corrupt nature in the Negroes; they have incited them to make war one upon another, and for this purpoſe have furniſhed them with prodigious quantities of ammunition and arms, whereby they have been hurried into confuſion, bloodſhed, and all the extremities of temporal miſery, which muſt neceſſarily beget in their minds ſuch a general deteſtation and ſcorn of the Chriſtian name, as may deeply affect, if not wholly preclude their belief of the great truths of our holy religion. Thus an inſatiable deſire of gain hath become the principal and moving cauſe of the moſt abominable and dreadful ſcene, that was perhaps ever acted upon the face of the earth; even the power of their kings hath been made ſubſervient to anſwer this wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, inſtead of being protectors of their people, theſe rulers, allured by the tempting bait laid before them by the European Factors, &amp;c. have invaded the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their unhappy ſubjects, and are become their oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>Divers accounts have already appeared in print de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative of the ſhocking wickedneſs with which this Trade is carried on; theſe may not have fallen into the hands of ſome of my readers, I ſhall, therefore, for their information, ſelect a few of the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſtances that I have met with, ſhewing the method by which the Trade is commonly managed all along the African coaſt.</p>
            <p>Francis Moor, Factor to the African Company on the river Gambia, relates, <q>That when the King of Barſalli wants goods, &amp;c. he ſends a meſſenger to the Engliſh Governor at James' Fort, to deſire he would ſend up a ſloop with a cargo of goods; which (ſays the author) the Governor never fails to do:
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010240_0016_0F7E08E675106960"/>againſt the time the veſſel arrives, the King plunders ſome of his enemies towns, ſelling the people for ſuch goods as he wants.—If he is not at war with any neighbouring King, he falls upon one of his own towns, and makes bold to ſell his own miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſubjects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>N. Brue, in his account of the Trade, &amp;c. writes, <q>That having received a quantity of goods, he wrote to the King of the country, That if he had a ſufficient number of ſlaves, he was ready to trade with him. This Prince (ſays that author) as well as other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groe Monarchs, has always a ſure way of ſupplying his deficiencies by ſelling his own ſubjects.—The King had recourſe to this method, by ſeizing three hundred of his own people, and ſent word to Brue, that he had the ſlaves ready to deliver for the goods.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The miſery and bloodſhed, conſequent of the Slave-Trade, is amply ſet forth by the following extracts of two voyages to the Coaſt of Guinea for ſlaves. The firſt in a veſſel from Liverpool, taken verbatim from the original manuſcript of the Surgeon's journal, viz.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Seſtro, December the 29th, 1724. No trade to-day, tho' many Traders come on board, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that the people are gone to war within land, and will bring priſoners enough in two or three days; in hopes of which we ſtay.</p>
               <p>The 30th. No trade yet, but our Traders came on board to-day, and informed us, the people had burnt four towns of their enemies, ſo that to-morrow we expect ſlaves off. Another large ſhip is come in: yeſterday came in a large Londoner.</p>
               <p>The 31ſt. Fair weather, but no trade yet; we ſee each night towns burning; but we hear the Seſtro men are many of them killed by the inland
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010240_0017_0F7E08E73B955390"/>Negroes, ſo that we fear this war will be unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>The 2d January. Laſt night we ſaw a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fire break out about eleven o'clock, and this morning ſee the town of Seſtro burnt down to the ground, (it contained ſome hundreds of houſes) ſo that we find their enemies are too hard for them at preſent, and conſequently our trade ſpoiled here; ſo that about ſeven o'clock we weigh'd anchor, as did likewiſe the three other veſſels to proceed lower down.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The ſecond relation, alſo taken from the original manuſcript journal of a perſon of credit, who went Surgeon on the ſame account, in a veſſel from New-York to the Coaſt of Guinea, about eighteen years paſt, is as follows, viz. <q>Being on the coaſt at a place called Baſalia, the Commander of the veſſel, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cuſtom, ſent a perſon on ſhore with a preſent to the King, acquainting him with his arrival, and letting him know, they wanted a cargo of ſlaves. The King promiſed to furniſh them with ſlaves, and in order to do it, ſet out to go to war againſt his enemies, deſigning alſo to ſurprize ſome town, and take all the people priſoners: Sometime after, the King ſent them word, he had not yet met with the deſired ſucceſs, having been twice repulſed, in attempting to break up two towns; but that he ſtill hoped to procure a number of ſlaves for them; and in this deſign he perſiſted till he met his enemies in the field, where a battle was fought, which laſted three days, during which time the engagement was ſo bloody, that four thouſand five hundred men were ſlain on the ſpot. The perſon, that wrote the account, beheld the bodies as they lay on the field
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010240_0018_0F7E08E8000E5FB0"/>of battle. Think (ſays he in his journal) what a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſight it was, to ſee the widows weeping over their loſt huſbands, orphans deploring the loſs of their fathers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe, who are acquainted with the Trade, agree, that many Negroes on the ſea-coaſt, who have been corrupted by their intercourſe and converſe with the European Factors, have learnt to ſtick at no act of cruelty for gain. Theſe make it a practice to ſteal abundance of little Blacks of both ſexes, when found on the roads or in the fields, where their parents keep them all day to watch the corn, &amp;c. Some authors ſay, the Negroe Factors go ſix or ſeven hundred miles up the country with goods, bought from the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, where markets of men are kept in the ſame manner as thoſe of beaſts with us; when the poor ſlaves, whether brought from far or near, come to the ſea-ſhore, they are ſtripped naked, and ſtrictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the European Surgeons, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without the leaſt diſtinction or modeſty; thoſe which are approved as good, are marked with a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hot iron with the ſhip's mark, after which they are put on board the veſſels, the men being ſhackled with irons two and two together. Reader bring the matter home, and conſider whether any ſituation in life can be more completely miſerable than that of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed captives. When we reflect, that each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual of this number had ſome tender attachment which was broken by this cruel ſeparation; ſome pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or wife, who had not an opportunity of mingling tears in a parting embrace: perhaps ſome infant or aged parent whom his labour was to feed and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance protect; themſelves under the dreadful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of an unknown perpetual ſlavery; pent up
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010240_0019_0F7E08E8CE31E170"/>within the narrow confines of a veſſel, ſometimes ſix or ſeven hundred together, where they lie as cloſe as poſſible. Under theſe complicated diſtreſſes they are often reduced to a ſtate of deſperation, wherein many have leaped into the ſea, and have kept themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water, till they were drowned; others have ſtarved themſelves to death, for the prevention whereof ſome maſters of veſſels have cut off the legs and arms of a number of thoſe poor deſperate creatures, to terrify the reſt. Great numbers have alſo frequently been killed, and ſome deliberately put to death under the greareſt torture, when they have attempted to riſe, in order to free themſelves from their preſent miſery, and the ſlavery deſigned them. An inſtance of the laſt kind appears particularly in an account given by the maſter of a veſſel, who brought a cargo of ſlaves to Barbadoz; indeed it appears ſo irreconcileable to the common dictates of humanity, that one would doubt the truth of it, had it not been related by a ſerious perſon of undoubted credit, who had it from the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's own mouth. Upon an inquiry, What had been the ſucceſs of his voyage? He anſwered, <q>That he had found it a difficult matter to ſet the Negroes a fighting with each other, in order to procure the number he wanted; but that when he had obtained this end, and had got his veſſel filled with ſlaves, a new dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty aroſe from their refuſal to take food; thoſe deſperate creatures chuſing rather to die with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than to be carried from their native country.</q> Upon a farther inquiry, by what means he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon them to forego this deſperate reſolution, he anſwered, <q>That he obliged all the Negroes to come upon deck, where they perſiſting in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of not taking food, he cauſed his ſailors to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010240_0020_0F7E08E9753F68A0"/>lay hold upon one of the moſt obſtinate, and chopt the poor creature into ſmall pieces, forcing ſome of the others to eat a part of the mangled body; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſwearing to the ſurvivors, that he would uſe them all, one after the other, in the ſame manner, if they did not conſent to eat.</q> This horrid execution he applauded as a good act, it having had the deſired ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in bringing them to take food.</p>
            <p>A ſimilar caſe is mentioned in Aſtley's Collection of Voyages, by John Atkins, Surgeon on board Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Ogle's ſquadron, <q>Of one Harding, maſter of a veſſel, in which ſeveral of the men-ſlaves, and a woman-ſlave, had attempted to riſe, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their liberty; ſome of whom the maſter, of his own authority, ſentenced to cruel death; making them firſt eat the heart and liver of one of thoſe he killed. The woman he hoiſted by the thumbs; whipped and ſlaſhed with knives before the other ſlaves, till ſhe died.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As deteſtable and ſhocking as this may appear to ſuch, whoſe hearts are not yet hardened by the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that cruelty, which the love of wealth, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, introduceth into the human mind; it will not be ſtrange to thoſe who have been concerned or employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Trade. Now here ariſes a neceſſary query to thoſe who hold the ballance and ſword of juſtice; and who muſt account to God for the uſe they have made of it. Since <hi>our Engliſh law is ſo truly valuable for its juſtice,</hi> how can they overlook theſe barbarous deaths of the unhappy Africans without trial, or due proof of their being guilty, of crimes adequate to their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? Why are thoſe maſters of veſſels (who are often not the moſt tender and conſiderate of men) thus ſuffered to be the ſovereign arbiters of the lives
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010240_0021_0F7E08EA88F601A0"/>of the miſerable Negroes; and allowed, with impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thus to deſtroy, may I not ſay, murder their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatures, and that by means ſo cruel as cannot be even related but with ſhame and horror.</p>
            <p>When the veſſels arrive at their deſtined port in the Colonies, the poor Negroes are to be diſpoſed of to the planters, and here they are again expoſed naked, without any diſtinction of ſexes, to the brutal exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their purchaſers; and this, it may well be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is to many of them another occaſion of deep diſtreſs, eſpecially to the females: Add to this, that near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections muſt now again be ſeparated, to go with their ſeveral purchaſers: In this melancholy ſcene mothers are ſeen hanging over their daughters, bedewing their naked breaſts with tears, and daughters clinging to their parents; not knowing what new ſtage of diſtreſs muſt follow their ſeparation; or if ever they ſhall meet again; and here what ſympathy, what commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are they to expect; why indeed, if they will not ſeparate as readily as their owners think proper, the whipper is called for, and the laſh exerciſed upon their naked bodies, till obliged to part.</p>
            <p>Can any human heart, that retains a fellow-feeling for the ſufferings of mankind, be unconcerned at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of ſuch grievous affliction, to which this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed part of our ſpecies are ſubjected: God gave to man dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the fowls of the air, and over the cattle, &amp;c. but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed no involuntary ſubjection of one man to another.</p>
            <p>The truth of this poſition, has of late been clearly ſet forth by perſons of reputation and ability, particularly George Wallis, in his Syſtem of the Laws of Scotland, whoſe ſentiments are ſo worthy the notice of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate perſons, that I ſhall here repeat a part of what
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010240_0022_0F7E08EB633D0AB8"/>he has not long ſince publiſhed, concerning the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Trade, viz. <q>If this trade admits of a moral or a rational juſtification, every crime, even the moſt atrocious, may be juſtified: Government was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the good of mankind. Kings, Princes, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors are not proprietors of thoſe who are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to their authority, they have not a right to make them miſerable. On the contrary, their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is veſted in them, that they may by the juſt exerciſe of it, promote the happineſs of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Of courſe, they have not a right to diſpoſe of their Liberty, and to ſell them for ſlaves: Beſides, no man has a right to acquire or to purchaſe them; men and their Liberty are not either ſaleable or purchaſable, one therefore has no body but himſelf to blame, in caſe he ſhall find himſelf deprived of a man, whom he thought he had, by buying for a price, made his own; for he dealt in a trade which was illicit, and was prohibited by the moſt obvious dictates of humanity. For theſe reaſons, every one of thoſe unfortunate men, who are pretended to be ſlaves, has a right to be declared to be free, for he never loſt his Liberty, he could not loſe it; his Prince had no power to diſpoſe of him: of courſe the ſale was void. This right he carries about with him, and is entitled every where to get it declared. As ſoon, therefore, as he comes into a country, in which the judges are not forgetful of their own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, it is their duty to remember that he is a man, and to declare him to be free.—This is the law of nature, which is obligatory on all men, at all times, and in all places.—Would not any of us, who ſhould be ſnatched by pirates from his native land, think himſelf cruelly abuſed, and at all times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010240_0023_0F7E08EBCE026530"/>to be free? Have not theſe unfortunate Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, who meet with the ſame cruel fate, the ſame right? Are not they men as well as we, and have they not the ſame ſenſibility? Let us not, therefore, defend or ſupport a uſage, which is contrary to all the laws of humanity?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Francis Hutchiſon, alſo in his Syſtem of Moral Philoſophy, ſpeaking on the ſubject of Slavery, ſays, <q>He who detains another by force in ſlavery, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bound to prove his title. The ſlave ſold or carried away into a diſtant country, muſt not be obliged to prove a negative, That he never forfeited his Liberty. The violent poſſeſſor muſt, in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſhew his title, eſpecially where the old proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is well known. In this caſe each man is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal proprietor of his own Liberty: The proof of his loſing it muſt be incumbent on thoſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of it by force. Strange, (ſays the ſame author) that in any nation, where a ſenſe of Liberty prevails, where the Chriſtian religion is profeſſed, cuſtom and high proſpect of gain can ſo ſtupify the conſciences of men, and all ſenſe of natural juſtice, that they can hear ſuch computation made about the value of their fellow-men and their liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out out abhorence and indignation?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The noted Baron Monteſquieu gives it, as his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in his <hi>Spirit of Law,</hi> page 348, <q>That nothing more aſſimilates a man to a beaſt than living amongſt freemen, himſelf a ſlave, ſuch people as theſe are the natural enemies of ſociety, and their number muſt always be dangerous.</q>

            <p>The author of a pamphlet, lately printed in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, entituled, <hi>An Eſſay in Vindication of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental Colonies of America,</hi> writes, <q>That the bondage
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010240_0024_0F7E08EC73D276D8"/>we have impoſed on the Africans, is abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to juſtice. That it is highly inconſiſtent with civil policy: Firſt, as it tends to ſuppreſs all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in arts and ſciences; without which it is morally impoſſible that any nation ſhould be happy or powerful. Secondly, as it may deprave the minds of the freemen; ſteeling their hearts againſt the laudable feelings of virtue and humanity. And, laſtly, as it endangers the community by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive effects of civil commotions, need I add to theſe, (ſays that author) what every heart, which is not callous to all tender feelings, will readily ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt; that it is ſhocking to humanity, violative of every generous ſentiment, abhorrent utterly from the Chriſtian religion; for as Monteſquieu very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves, <hi>We muſt ſuppoſe them not to be men, or a ſuſpicion would follow that we ourſelves are not Chriſtians.</hi> — There cannot be a more dangerous maxim, than that neceſſity is a plea for injuſtice. For who ſhall ſix the degree of this neceſſity? What villain ſo atrocious, who may not urge this excuſe; or, as Milton has happly expreſſed it,
<l>
                     <hi>— And with neceſſity</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>The tyrant's plea, excuſe his dev'liſh deed?</hi>
                  </l> That our Colonies want people, is a very weak argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſo inhuman a violation of juſtice. — Shall a civilized, a Chriſtian nation encourage ſlavery; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the barbarous, ſavage, lawleſs African hath done it? Monſtrous thought! To what end do we profeſs a religion whoſe dictates we ſo flagrantly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late? Wherefore have we that pattern of goodneſs and humanity, if we refuſe to follow it? How long ſhall we continue a practice, which policy rejects, juſtice condemns, and piety diſſuades? Shall the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010240_0025_0F7E08F0A163E5B8"/>Americans perſiſt in a conduct, which cannot be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; or perſevere in oppreſſion from which their hearts muſt recoil? If the barbarous Africans ſhall continue to enſlave each other let the daemon ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remain among them, that their crime may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude its own puniſhment. Let not Chriſtians, by adminiſtring to their wickedneſs, confeſs their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be a uſeleſs refinement, their profeſſion vain, and themſelves as inhuman as the ſavages they deteſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>James Foſter, in <hi>his Diſcourſes on Natural Religion and Social Virtue,</hi> alſo ſhews his juſt indignation at this wicked practice, which he declares to be <hi>a criminal and outrageous violation of the natural right of mankind.</hi> At page 156, 2 vol. he ſays, <q>Should we have read concerning the Greeks or Romans of old, that they traded, with view to make ſlaves of their own ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, whom they certainly knew that this would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve in ſchemes of blood and murder, of deſtroying or enſlaving each other, that they even fomented wars, and engaged whole nations and tribes in open hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, for their own private advantage; that they had no deteſtation of the violence and cruelty; but only feared the ill ſucceſs of their inhuman enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes; that they carried men like themſelves, their brethren, and the off-ſpring of the ſame common parent, to be ſold like beaſts of prey, or beaſts of burden, and put them to the ſame reproachful trial, of their ſoundneſs, ſtrength and capacity for greater bodily ſervice; that quite forgetting and renounce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the original dignity of human nature, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to all, they treated them with more ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ruder diſcipline, than even the ox or the aſs, who are void of underſtanding,—ſhould we not, if this had been the caſe, have naturally been led to
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010240_0026_0F7E08F10FE61568"/>deſpiſe all their <hi>pretended refinements of morality;</hi> and to have concluded, that as they were not nations deſtitute of politeneſs, they muſt have been <hi>entire ſtrangers to virtue and benevolence.</hi>
                  <p>But, notwithſtanding this, we ourſelves (who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be Chriſtians, and boaſt of the peculiar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage we enjoy, by means of an expreſs revelation of our duty from heaven) are in effect, theſe very untaught and rude heathen countries. With all our ſuperior light, we inſtil into thoſe, whom we call ſavage and barbarous, the moſt deſpicable opinion of human nature. We, to the utmoſt of our power, weaken and diſſolve the univerſal tie, that binds and unites mankind. We practice what we ſhould exclaim againſt, as the utmoſt exceſs of cruelty and tyranny, if nations of the world, differing in colour, and form of government from ourſelves, were ſo poſſeſſed of empire, as to be able to reduce us to a ſtate of unmerited and brutiſh ſervitude. Of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, we ſacrifice our reaſon, our humanity, our Chriſtianity, to an unnatural ſordid gain. We teach other nations to deſpiſe and trample under foot, all the obligations of ſocial virtue. We take the moſt effectual method to prevent the propagation of the goſpel by repreſenting it as a ſcheme of power and barbarous oppreſſion, and an enemy to the natural privileges and rights of men.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps all, that I have now offered, may be of very little weight to reſtrain this enormity, this ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated iniquity. However, I ſhall ſtill have the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistaction, of having entered my private proteſt againſt a practice which, in my opinion, bids that God, who is the God and Father of the gentiles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted to Chriſtianity, moſt daring and bold
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010240_0027_0F7E08F219BB1CC8"/>defiance, and ſpurns at all the principles, both of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and revealed religion?</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>How the Britiſh nation firſt came to be concerned in a practice, by which the rights and liberties of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are ſo violently infringed, and which is ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the apprehenſions Engliſhmen have always had of what natural juſtice requires, is indeed ſurpriſing. It was about the year 1563, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, that the Engliſh firſt engaged in the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea Trade; when it appears, from an account in Hill's Naval Hiſtory, page 293, That when Captain Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins returned from his firſt voyage to Africa, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous ſpirited Princeſs, attentive to the intereſt of her ſubjects, ſent for the Commander, to whom ſhe expreſſed her concern leſt any of the African Negroes ſhould be carried off without their free conſent, <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it would be deteſtable, and call down the vengeance of heaven upon the undertakers.</hi> Captain Hawkins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to comply with the Queen's injunction: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, we find in the account, given in the ſame Hiſtory, of Hawkins' ſecond voyage, the author uſing theſe remarkable words, <hi>Here began the horrid practice of forcing the Africans into ſlavery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Labut, a Roman Miſſionary, in his account of the Iſles of America, at page 114, of the 4th vol. mentions, that Lewis the 13th, father to the preſent French King's grand-father, was extremely uneaſy at a law by which all the Negroes of his Colonies were to be made ſlaves; but it being ſtrongly urged to him, as the readieſt means for their converſion to Chriſtianity, he acquieſced therewith.</p>
            <p>And altho' we have not many accounts of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which this piratical invaſion of the rights of mankind, gave to ſerious minded people, when firſt
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010240_0028_0F7E08F27A87DB30"/>engaged in; yet it did not eſcape the notice of ſome, who might be eſteemed in a peculiar manner as watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in their day to the different ſocieties of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, whereunto they belonged. Richard Baxter, an eminent preacher amongſt the Nonconformiſts, in the laſt century, well known and particularly eſteemed by moſt of the ſerious Preſbyterians and Independents, in his Chriſtian Directory moſtly, wrote about an hundred years ago, fully ſhews his deteſtation of this practice in the following words, <q>Do you not mark how God hath followed you with plagues, and may not conſcience tell you, that it is for your inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the ſouls and bodies of men.—To go as pirates and catch up poor Negroes, or people of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other land that never forfeited life or liberty, and to make them ſlaves, and ſell them, is one of the worſt kind of thievery in the world, and ſuch perſons are to be taken for the common enemies of mankind; and they that buy them, and uſe them as beaſts, for their meer commodity, and betray, or deſtroy, or neglect their ſouls, are fitter to be called devils than Chriſtians. It is an heinous ſin to buy them, unleſs it be in charity to deliver them.—Undoubtedly they are preſently bound to deliver them; becauſe by right the man is his own; therefore no man elſe can have a juſt title to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We alſo find George Fox, a man of exemplary piety, who was the principal inſtrument in gathering the religious ſociety of people, called Quakers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his concernand fellow-feeling for the bondage of the Negroes: In a diſcourſe taken from his mouth, in Barbados, in the year 1671, ſays, <q>Conſider with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if you were in the ſame condition as the Blacks are,—who came ſtrangers to you, and were ſold to you
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010240_0029_0F7E08F34A806290"/>as ſlaves. I ſay, if this ſhould be the condition of you or yours, you would think it hard meaſure. Yea, and very great bondage and cruelty. And, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conſider ſeriously of this, and do you for and to them, as you would willingly have them, or any other, to do unto you, were you in the like ſlaviſh condition; and bring them to know the Lord Chriſt.</q> And in his journal, page 431, ſpeaking of the advice he gave his friends at Barbados, he ſays, <q>I deſired alſo, that they would cauſe their overſeers to deal mildly and gently with their Negroes, and not to uſe cruelty towards them, as the manner of ſome had been, and that after certain years of ſervitude they ſhould make them free.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In a book printed in Liverpool, called <hi>The Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool Memorandum-book,</hi> which contains, among other things, an account of the trade of that port, there is an exact liſt of the veſſels employed in the Guinea trade, and of the number of Slaves imported in each veſſel, by which it appears, that in the year 1753, the number imported to America, by veſſels belonging to that port, amounted to upwards of thirty thouſand; and from the number of veſſels employed by the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Company in London and Briſtol; we may, with ſome degree of certainty, conclude, there is, at leaſt, One Hundred Thouſand Negoes purchaſed and brought on board our ſhips yearly from the coaſt of Africa, on their account. This is confirmed in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon's Hiſtory of Trade and Commerce, printed the year before laſt, where it is ſaid, at page 68 of the Appendix, <q>
                  <hi>That England ſupplies her American Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies with Negro-ſlaves, amounting in number to above One Hundred Thouſand every year.</hi>
               </q> When the veſſels are full freighted with ſlaves, they ſet out for
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010240_0030_0F7E08F3F3D36CF0"/>our plantations in America, and may be two orthree months on the voyage, during which time, from the filth and ſtench that is among them, diſtempers fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently break out, which carry off a great many, a fifth, a fourth, yea ſometimes a third of them; ſo that taking all the ſlaves together that are brought on board our ſhips yearly, one may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that at leaſt ten thouſand of them die on the voyage. And in a printed account of the State of the Negroes in our plantations, it is ſuppoſed that a fourth part, more or leſs, die at the different Iſlands, in what is called the ſeaſoning. Hence it may be preſumed, that, at a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate computation of the ſlaves, who are purchaſed by our African merchants in a year, near thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands die upon the voyage and in the ſeaſoning. Add to this, the prodigious number who are killed in the incurſions and inteſtine wars, by which the Negroes procure the number of ſlaves wanted to load the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: How dreadful then is this Slave-Trade, whereby ſo many thouſands of our fellow-creatures, free by nature, endued with the ſame rational faculties, and called to be heirs of the ſame ſalvation with us, loſe their lives, and are truly, and properly ſpeaking, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered every year. For it is not neceſſary, in order to convict a man of murder, to make it appear, that he had an intention to commit murder. Whoever does, by unjuſt force or violence, deprive another of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and, while he has him in his power, reduces him, by cruel treatment, to ſuch a condition as evidently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers his life; and the event occaſions his death, is actually guilty of murder. It is no leſs ſhocking to read the accounts given by Sir Hans Sloan, and others, of the inhuman and unmerciful treatment thoſe Blacks meet with, who ſurvive the ſeaſoning in the Iſtands,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010240_0031_0F7E08F4C2F7BC30"/>often for tranſgreſſions, to which the puniſhment they receive bears no proportion. <q>And the horrid execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are frequently made there upon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the plots laid by the blacks, for the recovery of their liberty; of ſome they break the bones, whilſt alive, on a wheel; others they burn or rather roaſt to death; others they ſtarve to death, with a loaf hanging before their mouths.</q> Thus they are brought to expire, with frightful agonies, in the moſt horrid tortures. For negligence only they are unmercifully whipped, till their backs are raw, and than pepper and ſalt is ſcattered on the wounds to heighten the pain and prevent mortification. Is it not a cauſe of much ſorrow and lamentation, that ſo many poor creatures ſhould be thus rack'd with excruciating tortures, for crimes which often their tormentors have occaſioned: Muſt not even the common feelings of human nature have ſuffered ſome grievous change in thoſe men, to be capable of ſuch horrid cruelty, towards their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men? If they deſerve death, ought not their judges, in the death decreed them, always to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that theſe their hapleſs fellow-creatures are men, and themſelves profeſſing Chriſtians. The Moſaic law teaches us our duty in theſe caſes, in the merciful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion it made in the puniſhment of tranſgreſſors, Deuter. xxv. 2. <hi>And it ſhall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge ſhall cauſe him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number, Forty ſtripes he may give him and not exceed.</hi> And the reaſon rendered is out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to human nature, viz. <hi>Leſt if he ſhould exceed, and beat him above theſe, with many ſtripes, then thy brother ſhould ſeem vile unto thee.</hi> Britons boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be a generous, humane people, who have a true
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010240_0032_0F7E08F577A61BE8"/>ſenſe of the importance of Liberty; but is this a true character, whilſt that barbarous, ſavage Slave-Trade, with all its attendant horrors, receives countenance and protection from the Legiſlature, whereby ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand lives are yearly ſacrificed. Do we indeed believe the truths declared in the goſpel? Are we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the threatnings, as well as the promiſes therein contained, will have their accompliſhment? If indeed we do, muſt we not tremble to think what a load of guilt lies upon our Nation generally and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſo far as we in any degree abet or countenance this aggravated iniquity.</p>
            <p>We have a memorable inſtance in hiſtory, which may be fruitful of inſtruction, if timely and properly applied; it is a quotation made by Sir John Temple, in his hiſtory of the Iriſh rebellion, being an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation out of Giraldus Cambrenſis, a noted author, who lived about ſix hundred years ago, concerning the cauſes of the proſperity of the Engliſh undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Ireland, when they conquered that Iſland, he ſaith, <q>That a ſynod, or council of the Clergy, being then aſſembled at Armagh, and that point fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, it was unanimously agreed, that the ſins of the people were the occaſion of that heavy judgment then fallen upon their nation; and that eſpecially their buying of Engliſhmen from merchants and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and detaining them under a moſt miſerable hard bondage, had cauſed the Lord, by way of juſt retaliation, to leave them to be reduced, by the Engliſh, to the ſame ſtate of ſlavery. Whereupon they made a public act in that council, that all the Engliſh, held in captivity throughout the whole land, ſhould be preſently reſtored to their former Liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:010240_0033_0F7E08F7243030D0"/>
I ſhall now conclude with an extract from an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of a late author to the merchants, and others, who are concerned in carrying on the Guinea Trade: Which alſo, in a great meaſure, is applicable to others, who, for the love of gain, are in any way concerned in promoting or maintaining the captivity of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes.</p>
            <q>
               <p>As the buſineſs, you are publicly carrying on before the world, has a bad aſpect, and you are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible moſt men make objection againſt it, you ought to juſtify it to the world, upon principles of reaſon, equity and humanity; to make it appear, that it is no unjuſt invaſion of the perſons, or encroachments on the rights of men; or for ever to lay it aſide.— But laving aſide the reſentment of men, which is but of little or no moment in compariſon with that of the Almighty, think of a future reckoning: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how you ſhall come off in the great and awful day of accompt: You now heap up riches and live in pleaſure; but, oh! what will you do in the end thereof? and that is not far off: what, if death ſhould ſeize upon you, and hurry you out of this world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all that load of blood-guiltineſs, that now lies upon your ſouls? The goſpel expreſsly declares, that thieves and murderers ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God. Conſider, that at the ſame time, and by the ſame means, you now treaſure up worldly riches, you are treaſuring up to yourſelves wrath, againſt the day of wrath, and vengeance that ſhall come upon the workers of iniquity, unleſs prevented by a timely repentance.</p>
               <p>And what greater iniquity, what crime that is more heinous, that carries in it more complicated guilt, can you name than that, in the habitual, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:010240_0034_0F7E08F7B41FEEE0"/>practice of which you now live? How can you lift up your guilty eyes to heaven? How can you pray for mercy to him that made you, or hope for any favour from him that formed you, while you go on thus groſsly and openly to diſhonour him, in debaſing and deſtroying the nobleſt workmanſhip of his hands in this lower world? He is the father of men; and do you think he will not reſent ſuch treatment of his offspring, whom he hath ſo loved, as to give his only begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, might not periſh, but have everlaſting life? This love of God to man, revealed in the goſpel, is a great aggravation of your guilt; for if God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another. You remember the fate of the ſervant, who took hold of his fellow-ſervant, who was in his debt, by the throat, and caſt him into priſon: Think then, and tremble to think, what will be your fate, who take your fellow-ſervants by the throat, that owe you not a penny, and make them priſoners for life.</p>
               <p>Give yourſelves leave to reflect impartially upon, and conſider the nature of, this Man-Trade, which, if you do, your hearts muſt needs relent, if you have not loſt all ſenſe of humanity, all pity and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards thoſe of your own kind, to think what calamities, what havock and deſtruction among them, you have been the authors of, for filthy lucre's ſake. God grant you may be ſenſible of your guilt, and repent in time.</p>
