            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>SCARCELY had the Abbey-bell tolled for five minutes, and already was the church of the Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins thronged with auditors. Do not encourage the idea, that the crowd was aſſembled either from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of piety, or thirſt of information. But very few were influenced with thoſe reaſons; and in a city where ſuperſtition reigns with ſuch deſpotic ſway as in Madrid, to ſeek for true devotion would be a fruitleſs attempt. The audience now aſſembled in the Capuchin church was collected by various cauſes, but all of them were foreign to the oſtenſible motive. The women came to ſhow themſelves, the men to ſee the women: ſome were attracted by curioſity to hear an orator ſo celebrated; ſome came, becauſe they had no better means of employing their time till the play began; ſome, from being aſſured that it would be impoſſible to find places in the church; and one half of Madrid was brought thither by expecting
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035729_0008_100657EA2F5E5BA8"/>
to meet the other half. The only perſons truly anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to hear the preacher, were a few antiquated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votees, and half a dozen rival orators, determined to find fault with and ridicule the diſcourſe. As to the remainder of the audience, the ſermon might have been omitted altogether, certainly without their being diſappointed, and very probably without their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the omiſſion.</p>
                     <p>Whatever was the occaſion, it is at leaſt certain, that the Capuchin church had never witneſſed a more numerous aſſembly. Every corner was filled, every ſeat was occupied. The very ſtatues which ornamented the long aiſles were preſſed into the ſervice. Boys ſuſpended themſelves upon the wings of Cherubims; St. Francis and St. Mark bore each a ſpectator on his ſhoulders; and St. Agatha found herſelf under the neceſſity of carrying double. The conſequence was, that, in ſpite of all their hurry and expedition, our two new comers, on entering the church, looked round in vain for places.</p>
                     <p>However, the old woman continued to move for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. In vain were exclamations of diſpleaſure vented againſt her from all ſides: in vain was ſhe addreſſed with, "I aſſure you Segnora, there are no places here." "I beg, Segnora, that you will not crowd me ſo intolerably!" "Segnora, you cannot paſs this way. Bleſs me! How can people be ſo troubleſome!" The old woman was obſtinate, and on ſhe went. By dint of perſeverance and two brawny arms, ſhe made a paſſage through the crowd, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged to buſtle herſelf into the very body of the church, at no great diſtance from the pulpit. Her compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035729_0009_100657AB16F51EF8"/>
had followed her with timidity and in ſilence, profiting by the exertions of her conductreſs.</p>
                     <p>"Holy Virgin!" exclaimed the old woman in a tone of diſappointment, while ſhe threw a glance of inquiry round her; "Holy Virgin! what heat! what a crowd! I wonder what can be the meaning of all this. I believe we muſt return: there is no ſuch thing as a ſeat to be had, and nobody ſeems kind enough to accommodate us with theirs."</p>
                     <p>This broad hint attracted the notice of two cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, who occupied ſtools on the right hand, and were leaning their backs againſt the ſeventh column from the pulpit. Both were young, and richly habited. Hearing this appeal to their politeneſs pronounced in a female voice, they interrupted their converſation to look at the ſpeaker. She had thrown up her veil in order to take a clearer look round the cathedral. Her hair was red, and ſhe ſquinted. The cavaliers turned round and renewed their converſation.</p>
                     <p>"By all means," replied the old woman's compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; "by all means, Leonella, let us return home immediately: the heat is exceſſive, and I am terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſuch a crowd."</p>
                     <p>Theſe words were pronounced in a tone of unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled ſweetneſs. The cavaliers again broke off their diſcourſe: but for this time they were not contented with looking up, but ſtarted involuntarily from their ſeats, and turned themſelves towards the ſpeaker.</p>
                     <p>The voice came from a female, the delicacy and elegance of whoſe figure inſpired the youths with the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035729_0010_100657EBB61A0578"/>
moſt lively curioſity to view the face to which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed. This ſatisfaction was denied them. Her features were hidden by a thick veil; but ſtruggling through the crowd had deranged it ſufficiently to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a neck which for ſymmetry and beauty might have vied with the Medicean Venus. It was of the moſt dazzling whiteneſs, and received additional charms from being ſhaded by the treſſes of her long fair hair, which deſcended in ringlets to her waiſt. Her figure was rather below than above the middle ſize: it was light and airy as that of an Hamadryad. Her boſom was carefully veiled. Her dreſs was white; it was faſtened by a blue ſaſh, and juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to peep out from under it a little foot of the moſt delicate proportions. A chaplet of large grains hung upon her arm, and her face was covered with a veil of thick black gauze. Such was the female, to whom the youngeſt of the cavaliers now offered his ſeat, while the other thought it neceſſary to pay the ſame attention to her companion.</p>
                     <p>The old lady with many expreſſions of gratitude, but without much difficulty, accepted the offer, and ſeated herſelf: the young one followed her example, but made no other compliment than a ſimple and graceful reverence. Don Lorenzo (ſuch was the cav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alier's name whoſe ſeat ſhe had accepted) placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf near her; but firſt he whiſpered a few words in his friend's ear, who immediately took the hint, and endeavoured to draw off the old woman's attention from her lovely charge.</p>
                     <p>"You are doubtleſs lately arrived at Madrid?" ſaid Lorenzo to his fair neighbour: "It is impoſſible that ſuch charms ſhould have long remained unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035729_0011_100657AD4CA06430"/>
and had not this been your firſt public appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the envy of the women and adoration of the men would have rendered you already ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable."</p>
                     <p>He pauſed in expectation of an anſwer. As his ſpeech did not abſolutely require one, the lady did not open her lips. After a few moments he reſumed his diſcourſe:</p>
                     <p>"Am I wrong in ſuppoſing you to be a ſtranger to Madrid?"</p>
                     <p>The lady heſitated; and at laſt, in ſo low a voice as to be ſcarcely intelligible, ſhe made ſhift to anſwer, "No, Segnor."</p>
                     <p>"Do you intend making a ſtay of any length?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Segnor."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhould eſteem myſelf fortunate, were it in my power to contribute to making your abode agreeable. I am well known at Madrid, and my family has ſome intereſt at court. If I can be of any ſervice, you cannot honor or oblige me more than by permitting me to be of uſe to you." "Surely," ſaid he to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, "ſhe cannot anſwer that by a monoſyllable; now ſhe muſt ſay ſomething to me."</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo was deceived, for the lady anſwered only by a bow.</p>
                     <p>By this time he had diſcovered, that his neighbour was not very converſible; but whether her ſilence proceeded from pride, diſcretion, timidity, or idiot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, he was ſtill unable to decide.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035729_0012_100657ED824803D0"/>
After a pauſe of ſome minutes, "It is certainly from your being a ſtranger," ſaid he, "and as yet unacquainted with our cuſtoms, that you continue to wear your veil. Permit me to remove it."</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time he advanced his hand towards the gauze; the lady raiſed hers to prevent him.</p>
                     <p>"I never unveil in public, Segnor."</p>
                     <p>"And where is the harm, I pray you?" interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her companion ſomewhat ſharply. "Do not you ſee, that the other ladies have all laid their veils aſide, to do honor, no doubt, to the holy place in which we are? I have taken off mine already; and ſurely, if I expoſe my features to general obſervation, you have no cauſe to put yourſelf in ſuch a wonderful alarm! Bleſſed Maria! Here is a fuſs and a buſtle about a chit's face! Come, come, child! Uncover it! I warrant you that nobody will run away with it from you—"</p>
                     <p>"Dear aunt, it is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he cuſtom in Murcia—"</p>
                     <p>"Murcia, indeed! Holy St. Barbara! what does that ſignify? You are always putting me in mind of that villainous province. If it is the cuſtom in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, that is all that we ought to mind; and therefore I deſire you to take off your veil immediately. Obey me this moment, Antonia, for you know that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear contradiction."</p>
                     <p>Her niece was ſilent, but made no further oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Don Lorenzo's efforts, who, armed with the aunt's ſanction, haſtened to remove the gauze. What a ſeraph's head preſented itſelf to his admiration!
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035729_0013_100657AFA32709E8"/>
Yet it was rather bewitching than beautiful; it was not ſo lovely from regularity of features as from ſweetneſs and ſenſibility of countenance. The ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral parts of her face conſidered ſeparately, many of them were far from handſome; but, when examined together, the whole was adorable. Her ſkin, though fair, was not entirely without freckles; her eyes were not very large, nor their laſhes particularly long. But then her lips were of the moſt roſy freſhneſs; her fair and undulating hair, confined by a ſimple rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and, poured itſelf below her waiſt in a profuſion of ringlets; her neck was full and beautiful in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme; her hand and arm were formed with the moſt perfect ſymmetry; her mild blue eyes ſeemed an heaven of ſweetneſs, and the cryſtal in which they moved ſparkled with all the brilliance of diamonds. She appeared to be ſcarcely fifteen; an arch ſmile playing round her mouth, declared her to be poſſeſſed of livelineſs, which exceſs of timidity at preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. She looked round her with a baſhful glance; and whenever her eyes accidentally met Lorenzo's, ſhe dropped them haſtily upon her roſary; her cheek was immediately ſuffuſed with bluſhes, and ſhe began to tell her beads; though her manner evidently ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe knew not what ſhe was about.</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo gazed upon her with mingled ſurpriſe and admiration; but the aunt thought it neceſſary to apologize for Antonia's <hi>mauvaiſe honte.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"'Tis a young creature," ſaid ſhe, "who is totally ignorant of the world. She has been brought up in an old caſtle in Murcia, with no other ſociety than her mother's, who, God help her! has no more ſenſe, good ſoul, than is neceſſary to carry her ſoup to her

mouth. Yet ſhe is my own ſiſter, both by father and mother."</p>
                     <p>"And has ſo little ſenſe?" ſaid Don Chriſtoval with feigned aſtoniſhment, "How very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary!"</p>
                     <p>"Very true, Segnor. Is it not ſtrange? However, ſuch is the fact; and yet only to ſee the luck of ſome people! A young nobleman, of the very firſt quality, took it into his head that Elvira had ſome pretenſions to beauty. As to pretenſions, in truth ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enough of <hi>them;</hi> but as to beauty! If I had only taken half the pains to ſet myſelf off which ſhe did! But this is neither here nor there. As I was ſaying, Segnor, a young nobleman fell in love with her, and married her unknown to his father. Their union remained a ſecret near three years; but at laſt it came to the ears of the old marquis, who, as you may well ſuppoſe, was not much pleaſed with the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Away he poſted in all haſte to Cordova, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſeize Elvira, and ſend her away to ſome place or other, where ſhe would never be heard of more. Holy St. Paul! How he ſtormed on finding that ſhe had eſcaped him, had joined her huſband, and that they had embarked together for the Indies! He ſwore at us all, as if the evil ſpirit had poſſeſſed him; he threw my father into priſon—as honeſt a pains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking ſhoe-maker as any in Cordova; and when he went away, he had the cruelty to take from us my ſiſter's little boy, then ſcarcely two years old, and whom in the abruptneſs of her flight ſhe had been obliged to leave behind her. I ſuppoſe that the poor little wretch met with bitter bad treatment from him, for in a few month<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> after we received intelligence of his death."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="unknown:035729_0015_100657B2A1883A80"/>
"Why, this was a terrible old fellow, Segnora!"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! ſhocking! and a man ſo totally devoid of taſte! Why, would you believe it, Segnor? when I attempted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"Ridiculous!" cried Don Chriſtoval. "Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the count would have thought himſelf fortunate, had he been permitted to exchange the one ſiſter for the other."</p>
                     <p>"O! Chriſt! Segnor, you are really too polite. However, I am heartily glad that the condé was of a different way of thinking. A mighty pretty piece of buſineſs, to be ſure, Elvira has made of it! After broiling and ſtewing in the Indies for thirteen long years, her huſband dies, and ſhe returns to Spain, without a houſe to hide her head, or money to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her one! This Antonia was then but an infant, and her only remaining child. She found that her father-in-law had married again, that he was irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable to the condé, and that his ſecond wife had produ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The old marquis refuſed to ſee my ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or her child; but ſent her word that, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of never hearing any more of her, he would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign her a ſmall penſion, and ſhe might live in an old caſtle which he poſſeſſed in Murcia. This had been the favourite habitation of his eldeſt ſon; but, ſince his flight from Spain, the old marquis could not bear the place, but let it fall to ruin and confuſion: My ſiſter accepted the propoſal; ſhe retired to Murcia, and has remained there till within the laſt month."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="unknown:035729_0016_100657F2D2456DE0"/>
"And what brings her now to Madrid?" inquired Don Lorenzo, whom admiration of the young Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia compelled to take a lively intereſt in the talkative old woman's narration.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! Segnor, her father-in-law being lately dead, the ſteward of his Murcian eſtates has refuſed to pay her penſion any longer. With the deſign of ſupplicating his ſon to renew it, ſhe is now come to Madrid; but I doubt that ſhe might have ſaved her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the trouble. You young noblemen have always enough to do with your money, and are not very often diſpoſed to throw it away upon old women. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed my ſiſter to ſend Antonia with her petition; but ſhe would not hear of ſuch a thing. She is ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate! Well! ſhe will find herſelf the worſe for not following my counſels: the girl has a good pretty face, and poſſibly might have done much."</p>
                     <p>"Ah, Segnora!" interrupted Don Chriſtoval, counterfeiting a paſſionate air; "if a pretty face will do the buſineſs, why has not your ſiſter recourſe to you?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Jeſus! my lord, I ſwear you quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power me with your gallantry! But I promiſe you that I am too well aware of the danger of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions to truſt myſelf in a young nobleman's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er! No, no; I have as yet preſerved my reputation without blemiſh or reproach, and I always knew how to keep the men at a proper diſtance."</p>
                     <p>"Of that, Segnora, I have not the leaſt doubt. But permit me to aſk you, Have you then any aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Matrimony?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="unknown:035729_0017_100657B43A4FB818"/>
"That is an home queſtion. I cannot but confeſs, that if an amiable cavalier were to preſent himſelf—"</p>
                     <p>Here ſhe intended to throw a tender and ſignificant look upon Don Chriſtoval; but, as ſhe unluckily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to ſquint moſt abominably, the glance fell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly upon his companion. Lorenzo took the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to himſelf, and anſwered it by a profound bow.</p>
                     <p>"May I inquire," ſaid he, "the name of the marquis?"</p>
                     <p>"The marquis de las Ciſternas."</p>
                     <p>"I know him intimately well. He is not at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in Madrid, but is expected here daily.

                     <p>Antonia raiſed her blue eyes, and ſilently thanked him for the offer by a ſmile of inexpreſſible ſweetneſs. Leonella's ſatisfaction was much more loud and audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Indeed, as her niece was generally ſilent in company, ſhe thought it incumbent upon her to talk enough for both: this ſhe managed without difficulty, for ſhe very ſeldom found herſelf deficient in words.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, Segnor!" ſhe cried; "you will lay our whole family under the moſt ſignal obligations! I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your offer with all poſſible gratitude, and return you a thouſand thanks for the generoſity of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. Antonia, why do you not ſpeak, child? While the cavalier ſays all ſorts of civil things to you, you ſit like a ſtatue, and never utter a ſyllable of thanks, either bad, good, or indifferent!"</p>

"My dear aunt, I am very ſenſible that—"</p>
                     <p>"Fye, niece! How often have I told you, that you never ſhould interrupt a perſon who is ſpeaking! When did you ever know me do ſuch a thing? Are theſe your Murcian manners? Mercy on me! I ſhall never be able to make this girl any thing like a perſon of good breeding. But pray, Segnor," ſhe continued, addreſſing herſelf to Don Chriſtoval, "in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me, why ſuch a crowd is aſſembled to-day in this cathedral."</p>
                     <p>"Can you poſſibly be ignorant, that Ambroſio, abbot of this monaſtery, pronounces a ſermon in this church every Thurſday? All Madrid rings with his praiſes. As yet he has preached but thrice; but all who have heard him are ſo delighted with his eloquence, that it is as difficult to obtain a place at church, as at the firſt repreſentation of a new comedy. His fame certainly muſt have reached your ears?"</p>
                     <p>"Alas! Segnor, till yeſterday I never had the good fortune to ſee Madrid; and at Cordova we are ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle informed of what is paſſing in the reſt of the world, that the name of Ambroſio has never been mentioned in its precincts."</p>
                     <p>"You will find it in every one's mouth at Madrid. He ſeems to have faſcinated the inhabitants; and, not having attended his ſermons myſelf, I am aſtoniſhed at the enthuſiaſm which he has excited. The adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paid him both by young and old, by man and woman, is unexampled. The grandees load him with preſents; their wives refuſe to have any other confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; and he is known through all the city by the name of the Man of Holineſs."</p>
                     <p>

"Undoubtedly, Segnor, he is of noble origin?"</p>
                     <p>"That point ſtill remains undecided. The late ſuperior of the Capuchins found him while yet an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant at the abbey-door. All attempts to diſcover who had left him there were vain, and the child himſelf could give no account of his parents. He was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the monaſtery, where he has remained ever ſince. He early ſhowed a ſtrong inclination for ſtudy and retirement; and as ſoon as he was of a proper age, he pronounced his vows. No one has ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to claim him, or clear up the myſtery which conceals his birth; and the monks, who find their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the favor which is ſhown to their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from reſpect to him, have not heſitated to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, that he is a preſent to them from the Virgin. In truth, the ſingular auſterity of his life gives ſome countenance to the report. He is now thirty years old, every hour of which period has been paſſed in ſtudy, total ſecluſion from the world, and mortification of the fleſh. Till theſe laſt three weeks, when he was choſen ſuperior of the ſociety to which he belongs, he had never been on the outſide of the abbey-walls. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now he never quits them except on Thurſdays, when he delivers a diſcourſe in this cathedral, which all Madrid aſſembles to hear. His knowledge is ſaid to be the moſt profound, his eloquence the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive. In the whole courſe of his life he has never been known to tranſgreſs a ſingle rule of his order; the ſmalleſt ſtain is not to be diſcovered upon his character: and the common people eſteem him to be a ſaint."</p>
                     <p>Here Don Chriſtoval was interrupted by an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal murmur, which ran through the church; it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035729_0020_100657F615B70178"/>
the preacher's arrival. Donna Leonella roſe from her ſeat to take a better view of him, and Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia followed her example.</p>
                     <p>He was a man of noble port and commanding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. His ſtature was lofty, and his features uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly handſome. His noſe was aquiline, his eyes large, black and ſparkling, and his dark brows almoſt joined together. His complexion was of a deep but clear brown; ſtudy and watching had entirely depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his cheek of color. Tranquillity reigned upon his ſmooth unwrinkled forehead; and content, expreſſed upon every feature, ſeemed to announce the man equally unacquainted with cares and crimes. He bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf with humility to the audience. Still there was a certain ſeverity in his look and manner that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired univerſal awe, and few could ſuſtain the glance of his eye, at once fiery and penetrating. Such was Ambroſio, abbot of the Capuchins, and ſurnamed "The Man of Holineſs."</p>
                     <p>Antonia, while ſhe gazed upon him eagerly, felt a pleaſure fluttering in her boſom which till then had been unknown to her, and for which ſhe in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o account. She waited with impatience till the ſermon ſhould begin; and when at length the friar ſpoke, the ſound of his voice ſeemed to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into her very ſoul. Though no other of the ſpectators felt ſuch violent ſenſations as did the young Antonia, yet every one liſtened with intereſt and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They who were inſenſible to religion's merits, were ſtill enchanted with Ambroſio's oratory. All found their attention irreſiſtibly attracted while he ſpoke, and the moſt profound ſilence reigned through
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035729_0021_100657B89A43FFC0"/>
the crouded aiſles. Even Lorenzo could not reſiſt the charm; he forgot that Antonia was ſeated near him, and liſtened to the preacher with undivided attention.</p>
                     <p>In language nervous, clear and ſimple, the monk expatiated on the beauties of religion. He explained ſome abſtruſe parts of the ſacred writings in a ſtyle that carried with it univerſal conviction. His voice at once diſtinct and deep, was fraught with all the terrors of the tempeſt, while he inveighed againſt the vices of humanity, and deſcribed the puniſhments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for them in a future ſtate. Every hearer look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back upon his paſt offences, and trembled: the thunder ſeemed to roll, whoſe bolt was deſtined to cruſh him, and the abyſs of eternal deſtruction to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en before his feet! But when Ambroſio, changing his theme, ſpoke of the excellence of an unſullied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, of the glorious proſpect which eternity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the ſoul untainted with reproach, and of the recompence which awaited it in the regions of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory, his auditors felt their ſcattered ſpirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly return. They threw themſelves with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the mercy of their Judge; they hung with delight upon the conſoling words of the preacher; and while his full voice ſwelled into melody, they were tranſported to thoſe happy regions which he painted to their imaginations in colors ſo brilliant and glowing.</p>
                     <p>The diſcourſe was of conſiderable length; yet, when it concluded, the audience grieved that it had not laſted longer. Though the monk had ceaſed to ſpeak, enthuſiaſtic ſilence ſtill prevailed through the church. At length the charm gradually diſſolving,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035729_0022_100657F79FE1CDE0"/>
the general admiration was expreſſed in audible terms. As Ambroſio deſcended from the pulpit, his auditors crowded round him, loaded him with bleſſings, threw themſelves at his feet, and kiſſed the hem of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He paſſed on ſlowly, with his hands croſſed devoutly upon his boſom, to the door opening into the abbey-chapel, at which his monks waited to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him. He aſcended the ſteps, and then, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards his followers, addreſſed to them a few words of gratitude and exhortation. While he ſpoke, his roſary, compoſed of large grains of amber, fell from his hand, and dropped among the ſurrounding multitude. It was ſeized eagerly, and immediately divided amongſt the ſpectators. Whoever became poſſeſſor of a bead, preſerved it as a ſacred rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The abbot, ſmiling at their eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pronounced his benediction and quitted the church, while humility dwelt upon every feature. Dwelt ſhe alſo in his heart?</p>
                     <p>Antonia's eyes followed him with anxiety. As the door cloſed after him, it ſeemed to her as ſhe had loſt ſome one, eſſential to her happineſs. A tear ſtole in ſilence down her cheek.</p>
                     <p>"He is ſeparated from the world!" ſaid ſhe to herſelf; "perhaps, I ſhall never ſee him more!"</p>
                     <p>As ſhe wiped away the tear, Lorenzo obſerved her action.</p>
                     <p>"Are you ſatisfied with our orator?" ſaid he; "or do you think that Madrid overrates his talents?"</p>

                     <p>"Oh! he far exceeds all my expectations," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe; "till this moment I had no idea of the powers of eloquence. But when he ſpoke, his voice inſpired me with ſuch intereſt, ſuch eſteem, I might almoſt ſay ſuch affection for him, that I am myſelf aſtoniſhed at the acuteneſs of my feelings."</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo ſmiled at the ſtrength of her expreſſions.</p>
                     <p>"You are young, and juſt entering into life," ſaid he: "your heart, new to the world, and full of warmth and ſenſibility, receives its firſt impreſſions with eagerneſs. Artleſs yourſelf, you ſuſpect not others of deceit; and viewing the world through the medium of your own truth and innocence, you fancy all who ſurround you to deſerve your confidence and eſteem. What pity, that theſe gay viſions muſt ſoon be diſſipated! What pity, that you muſt ſoon diſcover the baſeneſs of mankind, and guard againſt your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures as againſt your foes!"</p>
                     <p>"Alas! Segnor," replied Antonia, "the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of my parents have already placed before me but too many ſad examples of the perfidy of the world! Yet ſurely in the preſent inſtance the warmth of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy cannot have deceived me."</p>
                     <p>"In the preſent inſtance, I allow that it has not. Ambroſio's character is perfectly without reproach; and a man who has paſſed the whole of his life within

the walls of a convent, cannot have found the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be guilty, even were he poſſeſſed of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. But now, when obliged by the duties of his ſituation, he muſt enter occaſionally into the world, and be thrown into the way of temptation, it is now that it behoves him to ſhow the brilliance of his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The trial is dangerous; he is juſt at that period of life when the paſſions are moſt vigorous, unbridled, and deſpotic; his eſtabliſhed reputation will mark him out to ſeduction as an illuſtrious victim; novelty will give additional charms to the allurements of pleaſure; and even the talents with which nature has endowed him will contribute to his ruin, by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitating the means of obtaining his object. Very few would return victorious from a conteſt ſo ſevere."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! ſurely Ambroſio will be one of thoſe few."</p>
                     <p>"Of that I have myſelf no doubt: by all accounts he is an exception to mankind in general, and envy would ſeek in vain for a blot upon his character."</p>
                     <p>"Segnor, you delight me by this aſſurance! It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages me to indulge my prepoſſeſſion in his favor; and you know not with what pain I ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the ſentiment! Ah! deareſt aunt, entreat my mother to chooſe him for our confeſſor."</p>
                     <p>"I entreat her!" replied Leonella: "I promiſe you that I ſhall do no ſuch thing. I do not like this ſame Ambroſio in the leaſt; he has a look of ſeverity about him that made me tremble from head to foot. Were he my confeſſor, I ſhould never have the courage to avow one half of my peccadilloes, and then I ſhould be in a rare condition! I never ſaw ſuch a ſtern looking mortal, and hope that I never

ſhall ſee ſuch another. His deſcription of the devil, God bleſs us! almoſt terrified me out of my wits, and when he ſpoke about ſinners he ſeemed as if he was ready to eat them."</p>
                     <p>"You are right, Segnora," anſwered Don Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toval. "Too great ſeverity is ſaid to be Ambroſio's only fault. Exempted himſelf from human failings, he is not ſufficiently indulgent to thoſe of others; and though ſtrictly juſt and diſintereſted in his deciſions, his government of the monks has already ſhown ſome proofs of his inflexibility. But the crowd is nearly diſſipated; will you permit us to attend you home?"</p>
                     <p>"O Chriſt! Segnor," exclaimed Leonella, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bluſh; "I would not ſuffer ſuch a thing for the univerſe! If I came home attended by ſo gallant a cav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alier, my ſiſter is ſo ſcrupulous that ſhe would read me an hour's lecture, and I ſhould never hear the laſt of it.

"My friend's," replied Lorenzo, "is the Condé d'Oſſorio, and mine Lorenzo de Medina."</p>
                     <p>"'Tis ſufficient. Well, Don Lorenzo, I ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint my ſiſter with your obliging offer, and let you know the reſult with all expedition. Where may I ſend to you?"</p>
                     <p>"I am always to be found at the Medina palace."</p>
                     <p>"You may depend upon hearing from me. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, cavaliers. Segnor Condé, let me entreat you to moderate the exceſſive ardor of your paſſion. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to prove that I am not diſpleaſed with you, and prevent your abandoning yourſelf to deſpair, receive this mark of my affection, and ſometimes beſtow a thought upon the abſent Leonella."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſaid this, ſhe extended a lean and wrinkled hand; which her ſuppoſed admirer kiſſed with ſuch ſorry grace and conſtraint ſo evident, that Lorenzo with difficulty repreſſed his inclination to laugh. Leonella then haſtened to quit the church: the lovely Antonia followed her in ſilence; but when ſhe reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the porch, ſhe turned involuntarily, and caſt back her eyes towards Lorenzo. He bowed to her, as bidding her farewell; ſhe returned the compliment, and haſtily withdrew.</p>
                     <p>"So, Lorenzo!" ſaid Don Chriſtoval, as ſoon as they were alone, "you have procured me an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able intrigue! To favor your deſigns upon Antonia, I obligingly made a few civil ſpeeches which mean nothing to the aunt, and at the end of an hour I find myſelf upon the brink of matrimony!

Moderate that inflammable diſpoſition, and remember, that whenever it is neceſſary to make love to yonder harridan, you may reckon upon my ſervices."</p>
                     <p>He ſaid, and darted out of the cathedral. "How wild-brained!" ſaid Lorenzo, "With ſo excellent a heart, what pity that he poſſeſſes ſo little ſolidity of judgment!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="unknown:035729_0030_100657FE9F9F2760"/>
The night was now faſt advancing. The lamps were not yet lighted. The faint beams of the riſing moon ſcarcely could pierce through the gothic ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of the church. Lorenzo found himſelf unable to quit the ſpot. The void left in his boſom by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia's abſence, and his ſiſter's ſacrifice which Don Chriſtoval had juſt recalled to his imagination, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated that melancholy of mind which accorded but too well with the religious gloom ſurrounding him. He was ſtill leaning againſt the ſeventh column from the pulpit. A ſoft and cooling air breathed along the ſolitary aiſles; the moon beams darting into the church through painted windows, tinged the fretted roofs and maſſy pillars with a thouſand various ſhades of light and colors. Univerſal ſilence prevailed around, only interrupted by the occaſional cloſing of doors in the adjoining abbey.</p>
                     <p>The calm of the hour and ſolitude of the place contributed to nouriſh Lorenzo's diſpoſition to mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy. He threw himſelf upon a ſeat which ſtood near him, and abandoned himſelf to the deluſions of his fancy. He thought of his union with Antonia; he thought of the obſtacles which might oppoſe his wiſhes; and a thouſand changing viſions floated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fancy, ſad 'tis true, but not unpleaſing. Sleep inſenſibly ſtole over him, and the tranquil ſolemnity of his mind when awake, for a while continued to influence his ſlumbers.</p>
                     <p>He ſtill fancied himſelf to be in the church of the Capuchins; but it was no longer dark and ſolitary. Multitudes of ſilver lamps ſhed ſplendor from the vaulted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035729_0031_100657C9A5827678"/>
through the church; the altar ſeemed decorated as for ſome diſtinguiſhed feaſt; it was ſurrounded by a brilliant company; and near it ſtood Antonia array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in bridal white, and bluſhing with all the charms of virgin modeſty.</p>
                     <p>Half hoping, half fearing, Lorenzo gazed upon the ſcene before him. Suddenly, the door leading to the abbey uncloſed; and he ſaw, attended by a long trai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of monks, the preacher advance to whom he had juſt liſtened with ſo much admiration. He drew near Antonia.</p>
                     <p>"And where is the bridegroom?" ſaid the imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inary friar.</p>
                     <p>Antonia ſeemed to look round the church with anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety. Involuntarily the youth advanced a few ſteps from his concealment. She ſaw him; the bluſh of pleaſure glowed upon her cheek; with a graceful motion of her hand ſhe beckoned to him to advance. He diſobeyed not the command; he flew towards her, and threw himſelf at her feet.</p>
                     <p>She retreated for a moment; then gazing upon him with evident delight, "Yes," ſhe exclaimed, "my bridegroom! my deſtined bridegroom!"</p>
                     <p>She ſaid, and haſtened to throw herſelf into his arms; but before he had time to receive her, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ruſhed between them: his form was gigantic; his complexion was ſwarthy, his eyes fierce and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; his mouth breathed out volumes of fire, and on his forehead was written in legible characters—"Pride! Inhumanity!"</p>
                     <p>Antonia ſhrieked. The monſter claſped her in his arms, and, ſpringing with her upon the altar, tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035729_0032_1006580157A0DFB8"/>
her with his odious careſſes. She endeavoured in vain to eſcape from his embrace. Lorenzo flew to her ſuccour; but ere he had time to reach her, a loud burſt of thunder was heard. Inſtantly the cathedral ſeemed crumbling into pieces; the monks betook themſelves to flight, ſhrieking fearfully; the lamps were extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, the altar ſunk down, and in its place appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an abyſs vomiting forth clouds of flame. Utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a loud and terrible cry, the monſter plunged into the gulph, and in his fall attempted to drag Antonia with him. He ſtrove in vain. Animated by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural powers, ſhe diſengaged herſelf from his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces; but her white robe was left in his poſſeſſion. Inſtantly, a wing of brilliant ſplendor ſpread itſelf from either of Antonia's arms. She darted upwards, and while aſcending, cried to Lorenzo, "Friend! we ſhall meet above<note n="*" place="bottom">Lovelace dreams, that Clariſſa left her robe in his graſp.</note>!"</p>
                     <p>At the ſame moment the roof of the cathedral op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; harmonious voices pealed along the vaults; and the glory into which Antonia was received, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of rays of ſuch dazzling brightneſs, that Lorenzo was unable to ſuſtain the gaze. His ſight failed, and he ſunk upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>When he awoke, he found himſelf extended upon the pavement of the church: it was illuminated, and the chaunt of hymns ſounded from a diſtance. For a while, Lorenzo could not perſuade himſelf that what he had juſt witneſſed had been a dream, ſo ſtrong an impreſſion had it made upon his fancy. A little recollection convinced him of its fallacy: the lamps had been lighted during his ſleep, and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic which he heard was occaſioned by the monks,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035729_0033_100657CB48454388"/>
who were celebrating their veſpers in the abbey-chapel.</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo roſe, and prepared to bend his ſteps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſiſter's convent, his mind fully occupied by the ſingularity of his dream. He already drew near the porch, when his attention was attracted by perceiving a ſhadow moving upon the oppoſite wall. He looked curiouſly round, and ſoon deſcried a man wrapped up in his cloak, who ſeemed carefully exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining whether his actions were obſerved. Very few people are exempt from the influence of curioſity. The unknown ſeemed anxious to conceal his buſineſs in the cathedral; and it was this very circumſtance which made Lorenzo wiſh to diſcover what he was about.</p>
                     <p>Our hero was conſcious that he had no right to pry into the ſecrets of this unknown cavalier.</p>
                     <p>"I will go," ſaid Lorenzo. And Lorenzo ſtayed where he was.</p>
                     <p>The ſhadow thrown by the column effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed him from the ſtranger, who continued to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance with caution.</p>
                     <p>At length he drew a letter from beneath his cloak, and haſtily placed it beneath a coloſſal ſtatue of Saint Francis. Then retiring with precipitation, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himſelf in a part of the church at a conſiderable diſtance from that in which the image ſtood.</p>
                     <p>"So!" ſaid Lorenzo to himſelf; "this is only ſome fooliſh love affair. I believe, I may as well be gone, for I can do no good in it."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:035729_0034_10065804021BA858"/>
In truth, till that moment it never came into his head that he could do any good in it; but he thought it neceſſary to make ſome little excuſe to himſelf for having indulged his curioſity. He now made a ſecond attempt to retire from the church. For this time he gained the porch without meeting with any impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it was deſtined that he ſhould pay it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other viſit that night. As he deſcended the ſteps lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ſtreet, a cavalier ruſhed againſt him with ſuch violence, that both were nearly overturned by the concuſſion. Lorenzo put his hand to his ſword.</p>
                     <p>"How now, Segnor?" ſaid he; "what mean you by this rudeneſs?"</p>
                     <p>"Ha! is it you, Medina?" replied the new comer, whom Lorenzo by his voice now recogniſed for Don Chriſtoval. "You are the luckieſt fellow in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, not to have left the church before my return. In, in! my dear lad! they will be here immediately!"</p>
                     <p>"Who will be here?"</p>
                     <p>"The old hen and all her pretty little chickens. In, I ſay; and then you ſhall know the whole hiſtory."</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo followed him into the cathedral, and they concealed themſelves behind the ſtatue of St. Francis.</p>
                     <p>"And now," ſaid our hero, "may I take the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of aſking what is the meaning of all this haſte and rapture?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Lorenzo, we ſhall ſee ſuch a glorious ſight! The prioreſs of St. Clare and her whole train of nuns are coming hither. You are to know that the pious father Ambroſio (the Lord reward him for it!) will
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035729_0035_100657CF4B8B0078"/>
upon no account move out of his own precincts. It being abſolutely neceſſary for every faſhionable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent to have him for its confeſſor, the nuns are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence obliged to viſit him at the abbey; ſince, when the mountain will not come to Mahomet, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet muſt needs go to the mountain. Now the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oreſs of St. Clare, the better to eſcape the gaze of ſuch impure eyes as belong to yourſelf and your humble ſervant, thinks proper to bring her holy flock to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in the duſk: ſhe is to be admitted into the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey-chapel by yon private door. The portereſs of St. Clare, who is a worthy old ſoul and a particular friend of mine, has juſt aſſured me of their being here in a few moments. There is news for you, you rogue! We ſhall ſee ſome of the prettieſt faces in Madrid!"</p>
                     <p>"In truth, Chriſtoval, we ſhall do no ſuch thing. The nuns are always veiled."</p>
                     <p>"No, no! I know better. On entering a place of worſhip, they ever take off their veils, from reſpect to the ſaint to whom 'tis dedicated. But hark, they are coming! Silence! ſilence! obſerve and be convinced."</p>
                     <p>"Good!" ſaid Lorenzo to himſelf; "I may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diſcover to whom the vows are addreſſed of this myſterious ſtranger."</p>
                     <p>Scarcely had Don Chriſtoval ceaſed to ſpeak, when the domina of St. Clare appeared, followed by a long proceſſion of nuns. Each upon entering the church took off her veil. The prioreſs croſſed her hands upon her boſom, and made a profound reverence as ſhe paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtatue of St. Francis, the patron of this cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral. The nuns followed her example, and ſeveral moved onwards without having ſatisfied Lorenzo's cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035729_0036_100658058A22CD88"/>
He almoſt began to deſpair of ſeeing the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery cleared up, when, in paying her reſpects to St. Francis, one of the nuns happened to drop her roſary. As ſhe ſtooped to pick it up, the light flaſhed full in her face. At the ſame moment ſhe dexterouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the letter from beneath the image, placed it in her boſom, and haſtened to reſume her rank in the proceſſion.</p>
                     <p>"Ha!" ſaid Chriſtoval in a low voice, "here we have ſome little intrigue, no doubt."</p>
                     <p>"Agnes, by heaven!" cried Lorenzo.</p>
                     <p>"What, your ſiſter? Diavolo! Then ſome body, I ſuppoſe, will have to pay for our peeping."</p>
                     <p>"And ſhall pay for it without delay," replied the incenſed brother.</p>
                     <p>The pious proceſſion had now entered the abbey; the door was already cloſed upon it. The unknown immediately quitted his concealment, and haſtened to leave the church: ere he could effect his intention, he deſcried Medina ſtationed in his paſſage. The ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger haſtily retreated, and drew his hat over his eyes.</p>
                     <p>"Attempt not to fly me?" exclaimed Lorenzo; "I will know who you are, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Of that letter?" repeated the unknown. "And by what title do you aſk the queſtion?"</p>
                     <p>"By a title of which I am now aſhamed; but it becomes not you to queſtion me. Either reply circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially to my demands, or anſwer me with your ſword."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="unknown:035729_0037_100657D225BF4CB0"/>
"The latter method will be the ſhorteſt," rejoined the other, drawing his rapier;" "come on, Segnor Bravo! I am ready."</p>
                     <p>Burning with rage, Lorenzo haſtened to the attack: the antagoniſts had already exchanged ſeveral paſſes, before Chriſtoval, who at that moment had more ſenſe than either of them, could throw himſelf between their weapons.</p>
                     <p>"Hold! hold! Medina!" he exclaimed; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the conſequences of ſhedding blood on conſecrated ground!"</p>
                     <p>The ſtranger immediately dropped his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Medina?" he cried. "Great God, is it poſſible! Lorenzo, have you quite forgotten Raymond de las Ciſternas?"</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo's aſtoniſhment increaſed with every ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding moment. Raymond advanced towards him; but with a look of ſuſpicion he drew back his hand, which the other was preparing to take.</p>
                     <p>"You here, marquis? what is the meaning of all this? you engaged in a clandeſtine correſpondence with my ſiſter, whoſe affections—"</p>

                     <p>"One whom I believe you have ſeen before," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Don Chriſtoval, "though probably not at church."</p>
                     <p>"The condé d'Oſſorio?"</p>
                     <p>"Exactly ſo, marquis."</p>

"I have no objection to entruſting you with my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, for I am ſure that I may depend upon your ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence."</p>
                     <p>"Then your opinion of me is better than my own, and therefore I muſt beg leave to decline your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Do you go your own way, and I ſhall go mine. Marquis, where are you to be found?"</p>
                     <p>"As uſual, at the hotel de las Ciſternas; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I am incognito, and that, if you wiſh to ſee me, you muſt aſk for Alphonſo d'Alvarada."</p>
                     <p>"Good! good! Farewell cavaliers!" ſaid Don Chriſtoval, and inſtantly departed.</p>
                     <p>"You, marquis," ſaid Lorenzo in the accent of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; "You, Alphonſo d'Alvarada!"</p>
                     <p>"Even ſo, Lorenzo: but unleſs you have already heard my ſtory from your ſiſter, I have much to relate that will aſtoniſh you. Follow me, therefore, to my hotel without delay."</p>

politeneſs; ſo gallant! ſo well-bred! ſo ſenſible, and ſo pathetic! Well! if ever man can prevail upon me to break my vow never to marry, it will be that Don Chriſtoval. You ſee, niece, that every thing turns out exactly as I told you: the very moment that I produced myſelf in Madrid, I knew that I ſhould be ſurrounded by admirers. When I took off my veil, did you ſee. Antonia, what an effect the action had upon the Condé? And when I preſented him my hand did you obſerve the air of paſſion with which he kiſſed it?

                     <p>Now Antonia had obſerved the air with which Don Chriſtoval had kiſſed this ſame hand; but as ſhe drew concluſions from it ſomewhat different from her aunt's, ſhe was wiſe enough to hold her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Her dreſs was compoſed of ſhreds of various-coloured ſilks and linens fantaſtically arranged, yet not entirely without taſte. Her head was covered with a kind of turban ornamented with vine-leaves and wild flowers. She ſeemed much ſun-burnt, and

her complexion was of a deep olive; her eyes looked fiery and ſtrange; and in her hand ſhe bore a long black rod, with which ſhe at intervals traced a variety of ſingular figures upon the ground, round about which ſhe danced in all the eccentric attitudes of folly and delirium. Suddenly ſhe broke off her dance, whirled herſelf round thrice with rapidity, and after a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's pauſe ſhe ſung the following ballad:</p>

"Dear aunt!" ſaid Antonia when the ſtranger had finiſhed, "is ſhe not mad?"</p>
                     <p>"Mad? Not ſhe, child; ſhe is only wicked.

                     <p>THE monks having attended their abbot to the door of his cell, he diſmiſſed them with an air of conſcious ſuperiority, in which humility's ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance combated with the reality of pride.</p>
                     <p>He was no ſooner alone, than he gave free looſe to the indulgence of his vanity. When he remembered the enthuſiaſm which his diſcourſe had excited, his heart ſwelled with rapture, and his imagination pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with ſplendid viſions of aggrandizement. He looked round him with exultation; and pride told him loudly, that he was ſuperior to the reſt of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures.</p>
                     <p>"Who," thought he, "who but myſelf has paſſed the ordeal of youth, yet ſees no ſingle ſtain upon his conſcience? Who elſe has ſubdued the violence of ſtrong paſſions and an impetuous temperament, and ſubmitted even from the dawn of life to voluntary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement? I ſeek for ſuch a man in vain. I ſee no one but myſelf poſſeſſed of ſuch reſolution. Religion cannot boaſt Ambroſto's equal! How powerful an effect did my diſcourſe produce upon its auditors!
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035729_0045_100657DE98A87830"/>

How they crouded round me! How they loaded me with benedictions, and pronounced me the ſole un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted pillar of the church! What then now is left for me to do? Nothing, but to watch as carefully over the conduct of my brethren, as I have hitherto watched over my own. Yet hold! May I not be tempted from thoſe paths, which till now I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued without one moment's wandering? Am I not a man, whoſe nature is frail and prone to error? I muſt now abandon the ſolitude of my retreat; the faireſt and nobleſt dames of Madrid continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves at the abbey, and will uſe no other confeſſor. I muſt accuſtom my eyes to objects of temptation, and expoſe myſelf to the ſeduction of luxury and deſire. Should I meet, in that world which I am conſtrained to enter, ſome lovely female—lovely as yon Madona—!"</p>
                     <p>As he ſaid this, he fixed his eyes upon a picture of the virgin, which was ſuſpended oppoſite to him: this for two years had been the object of his increaſing wonder and adoration. He pauſed, and gazed upon it with delight.</p>
                     <p>"What beauty in that countenance!" he continued, after a ſilence of ſome minutes; "how graceful is the turn of that head! what ſweetneſs, yet what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in her divine eyes! how ſoftly her cheek reclines upon her hand! Can the roſe vie with the bluſh of that cheek? can the lily rival the whiteneſs of that hand? Oh! if ſuch a creature exiſted, and exiſted but for me! were I permitted to twine round my fingers thoſe golden ringlets, and preſs to my lips that hand of ſnow! gracious God, ſhould I then reſiſt the

temptation? Should I not barter for a ſingle em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the reward of my ſufferings for thirty years? Should I not abandon—Fool that I am! Whither do I ſuffer my admiration of this picture to hurry me? Away, impure ideas! Let me remember, that wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is for ever loſt to me. Never was mortal form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo perfect as this picture. But even did ſuch exiſt, the trial might be too mighty for common virtue: but Ambroſio's is proof againſt temptation. Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, did I ſay? To me it would be none. What charms me when ideal, and conſidered as a ſuperior being, would diſguſt me, becoming a woman and tainted with all the failings of mortality.

They ſhall know you for what you are!"</p>
                     <p>Here his reverie was interrupted by three ſoft knocks at the door of his cell. With difficulty did the abbot awake from his delirium. The knocking was repeated.</p>
                     <p>"Who is there?" ſaid Ambroſio at length.</p>
                     <p>"It is only Roſario," replied a gentle voice.</p>
                     <p>"Enter! enter, my ſon!"</p>
                     <p>The door was immediately opened, and Roſario appeared with a ſmall baſket in his hand.</p>
                     <p>

Roſario was a young novice belonging to the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtery, who in three months intended to make it his profeſſion. A ſort of myſtery enveloped this youth, which rendered him at once an object of intereſt and curioſity. His hatred of ſociety, his profound melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, his rigid obſervance of the duties of his order, and his voluntary ſecluſion from the world, at his age ſo unuſual, attracted the notice of the whole frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. He ſeemed fearful of being recogniſed, and no one had ever ſeen his face. His head was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> up in his cowl; yet ſuch of his features as accident diſcovered, appeared the moſt beautiful and noble. Roſario was the only name by which he was known in the monaſtery. No one knew from whence he came, and when queſtioned on the ſubject, he preſerved a profound ſilence. A ſtranger, whoſe rich habit and magnificent equipage declared him to be of diſtinguiſhed rank, had engaged the monks to receive a novice, and had depoſited the neceſſary ſums. The next day he returned with Roſario, and from that time no more had been heard of him.</p>
                     <p>The youth had carefully avoided the company of the monks: he anſwered their civilities with ſweetneſs, but reſerve, and evidently ſhowed that his inclination led him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>olitude. To this general rule the ſuperior was the only exception. To him he looked up with a reſpect approaching idolatry: he ſought his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the moſt attentive aſſiduity, and eagerly feized every means to ingratiate himſelf in his favour. In the abbot's ſociety his heart ſeemed to be at eaſe, and an air of gaiety pervaded his whole manners and diſcourſe.

lay aſide his habitual ſeverity. When he ſpoke to him, he inſenſibly aſſumed a tone milder than was uſual to him; and no voice ſounded ſo ſweet to him as did Roſario's. He repaid the youth's attentions by inſtructing him in various ſciences; the novice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his leſſons with docility; Ambroſio was every day more charmed with the vivacity of his genius, the ſimplicity of his manners, and the rectitude of his heart: in ſhort, he loved him with all the affection of a father. He could not help ſometimes ſecretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging a deſire to ſee the face of his pupil; but his rule of ſelf-denial extended even to curioſity, and prevented him from communicating his wiſhes to the youth.</p>
                     <p>"Pardon my intruſion, father," ſaid Roſario, while he placed his baſket upon the table; "I come to you a ſuppliant. Hearing that a dear friend is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ill, I entreat your prayers for his recovery. If ſupplications can prevail upon heaven to ſpare him, ſurely yours muſt be efficacious."</p>
                     <p>"Whatever depends upon me, my ſon, you know that you may command. What is your friend's name?"</p>
                     <p>"Vicentio della Ronda."</p>
                     <p>"'Tis ſufficient. I will not forget him in my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and may our thrice-bleſſed St. Francis deign to liſten to my interceſſion!—What have you in your baſket, Roſario?"</p>
                     <p>"A few of thoſe flowers, reverend father, which I have obſerved to be moſt acceptable to you. Will you permit my arranging them in your chamber?"</p>
                     <p>"Your attentions charm me, my ſon."</p>
                     <p>

While Roſario diſpoſed the contents of his baſket in ſmall vaſes, placed for that purpoſe in various parts of the room, the abbot thus continued the converſation:</p>
                     <p>"I ſaw you not in the church this evening, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſario."</p>
                     <p>"Yet I was preſent, father. I am too grateful for your protection to loſe any opportunity of witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your triumph."</p>
                     <p>"Alas! Roſario, I have but little cauſe to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph: the ſaint ſpoke by my mouth; to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs all the merit. It ſeems then you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with my diſcourſe?"</p>
                     <p>"Contented, ſay you? Oh! you ſurpaſſed your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! Never did I hear ſuch eloquence—ſave once!"</p>
                     <p>Here the novice heaved an involuntary ſigh.</p>
                     <p>"When was that once?" demanded the abbot.</p>
                     <p>"When you preached upon the ſudden Indiſpoſition of our la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I remember it: that is more than two years ago. And were you preſent? I knew you not at that time, Roſario."</p>
                     <p>"'Tis true, father; and would to God I had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired ere I beheld that day! What ſufferings, what ſorrows ſhould I have eſcaped!"</p>
                     <p>"Sufferings at your age, Roſario?"</p>
                     <p>"Aye, father; ſufferings, which, if known to you, would equally raiſe your anger and compaſſion! ſufferings, which form at once the torment and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure

of my exiſtence! Yet in this retreat my boſom would feel tranquil, were it not for the tortures of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion! Oh God! oh God! how cruel is a life of fear!—Father, I have given up all; I have aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the world and its delights for ever: nothing now remains, nothing now has charms for me, but your friendſhip, but your affection. If I loſe that, father! oh! if I loſe that, tremble at the effects of my deſpair!"</p>
                     <p>"You apprehend the loſs of my friendſhip? how has my conduct juſtified this fear? know me better, Roſario, and think me worthy of your confidence. What are your ſufferings? Reveal them to me, and believe, that if 'tis in my power to relieve them—"</p>
                     <p>"Ah! 'tis in no one's power but your's. Yet I muſt not let you know them. You would hate me for my avowal! you would drive me from your preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with ſcorn and ignominy."</p>
                     <p>"My ſon, I conjure you! I entreat you—"</p>
                     <p>"For pity's ſake, inquire no further! I muſt not—I dare not—Hark! the bell rings for veſpers! Father, your benediction, and I leave you."</p>
                     <p>As he ſaid this, he threw himſelf upon his knees, and received the bleſſing which he demanded. Then preſſing the abbot's hand to his lips, he ſtarted from the ground, and haſtily quitted the apartment. Soon after Ambroſio deſcended to veſpers (which were cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebrated in a ſmall chapel belonging to the abbey) fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſurpriſe at the ſingularity of the youth's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="unknown:035729_0051_10083519A7DA7FD8"/>
Veſpers being over, the monks retired to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective cells. The abbot alone remained in the chapel, to receive the nuns of St. Clare. He had not been long ſeated in the confeſſional chair, before the prioreſs made her appearance. Each of the nuns was heard in her turn, while the others waited with the domina in the adjoining veſtry. Ambroſio liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to the confeſſions with attention, made many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enjoined penance proportioned to each of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and for ſome time every thing went on as uſual, till one of the nuns, conſpicuous from the nobleneſs of her air and elegance of her figure, careleſsly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a letter to fall from her boſom. She was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring unconſcious of her loſs. Ambroſio ſuppoſed it to have been written by ſome one of her relations, and took it up, intending to reſtore it to her."</p>
                     <p>"Stay, daughter," ſaid he; "you have let fall—"</p>
                     <p>At this moment, the paper being already open, his eye involuntarily read the firſt words. He ſtarted back with ſurpriſe. The nun had turned round on hearing his voice: ſhe perceived her letter in his hand, and uttering a ſhriek of terror, flew haſtily to regain it.</p>
                     <p>"Hold!" ſaid the friar, in a tone of ſeverity; "daughter, I muſt read this letter."</p>
                     <p>"Then I am loſt!" ſhe exclaimed, claſping her hands together wildly.</p>
                     <p>All colour inſtantly faded from her face; ſhe trembled with agitation, and was obliged to fold her arms round a pillar of the chapel to ſave herſelf from ſinking upon the floor. In the mean while the abbot read the following lines:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="unknown:035729_0052_100658152EFA5630"/>
"All is ready for your eſcape, my deareſt Agnes! At twelve to-morrow night I ſhall expect to find you at the garden-door: I have obtained the key, and a few hours will ſuffice to place you in a ſecure aſylum. Let no miſtaken ſcruples induce you to reject the certain means of preſerving yourſelf and the innocent creature whom you nouriſh in your boſom. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that you had promiſed to be mine, long ere you engaged yourſelf to the church; that your ſituation will ſoon be evident to the prying eyes of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; and that flight is the only means of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the effects of their malevolent reſentment.

                     <p>"As ſoon as he had finiſhed, Ambroſio bent an eye ſtern and angry upon the imprudent nun.</p>
                     <p>"This letter muſt to the prioreſs," ſaid he, and paſſed her.</p>
                     <p>His words ſounded like thunder to her ears: ſhe awoke from her torpidity only to be ſenſible of the dangers of her ſituation. She followed him haſtily, and detained him by his garment.</p>
                     <p>"Stay! oh! ſtay!" ſhe cried in the accents of deſpair, while ſhe threw herſelf at the friar's feet, and bathed them with her tears.

                     <p>"Hold! father, hold! Hear me but for one moment! Tax me not with impurity, nor think that I have erred from the warmth of temperament. Long before I took the veil, Raymond was maſter of my heart: he inſpired me with the pureſt, the moſt irreproachable paſſion, and was on the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming my lawful huſband. An horrible adventure, and the treachery of a relation ſeparated us from each other. I believed him for ever loſt to me and threw myſelf into a convent from motives of deſpair.

If you diſcover my imprudence to the domina both of us are loſt. The puniſhment which the laws of St. Clare aſſign to unfortunates like myſelf, is moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and cruel.

towards thoſe leſs able to withſtand temptation! Let not mercy be the only virtue of which your heart is unſuſceptible! Pity me, moſt reverend! Reſtore my letter, nor doom me to inevitable deſtruction!"</p>
                     <p>Your boldneſs confounds me. Shall <hi>I</hi> conceal your crime—<hi>I</hi> whom you have deceived by your feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed confeſſion?—No, daughter, no.

                     <p>Father! by all that is ſacred, by all that is moſt dear to you, I ſupplicate, I entreat—"</p>
                     <p>"Releaſe me. I will not hear you. Where is the domina? Mother St. Agatha, where are you?"</p>
                     <p>The door of the veſtry opened, and the prioreſs entered the chapel, followed by her nuns.</p>
                     <p>"Cruel, cruel!" exclaimed Agnes, relinquiſhing her hold.</p>
                     <p>Wild and deſperate, ſhe threw herſelf upon the ground, beating her boſom, and rending her veil, in all the delirium of deſpair. The nuns gazed with aſtoniſhment upon the ſcene before them. The friar now preſented the fatal paper to the prioreſs, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her of the manner in which he had found it, and added, that it was her buſineſs to decide what penance the delinquent merited.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe peruſed the letter, the domina's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance grew inflamed with paſſion. What! ſuch a

crime committed in her convent, and made known to Ambroſio, to the idol of Madrid, to the man whom ſhe was moſt anxious to impreſs with an opinion of the ſtrictneſs and regularity of her houſe! Words were inadequate to expreſs her fury. She was ſilent; and darted upon the proſtrate nun looks of menace and malignity.</p>
                     <p>"Away with her to the convent!" ſaid ſhe at length, to ſome of her attendants.</p>
                     <p>Two of the oldeſt nuns now approaching Agnes, raiſed her forcibly from the ground, and prepared to conduct her from the chapel.</p>
                     <p>"What!" ſhe exclaimed ſuddenly, ſhaking off their hold with diſtracted geſtures, "is all hope then loſt? Already do you drag me to puniſhment? where are you, Raymond? Oh! ſave me! ſave me!"—Then caſting upon the abbot a frantic look,</p>
                     <p>"Hear me!" ſhe continued, "man of an hard heart! Hear me, proud, ſtern, and cruel! You could have ſaved me; you could have reſtored me to happineſs and virtue, but would not: you are the deſtroyer of my ſoul; you are my murderer, and on you fall the curſe of my death and my unborn infant's! Inſolent in your yet unſhaken virtue, you diſdained the prayers of a penitent, but God will ſhew mercy, though you ſhew none. And where is the merit of your boaſted virtue? What temptations have you vanquiſhed? Coward! you have fled from it, not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſeduction. But the day of trial will arrive. Oh! then when you yield to impetuous paſſions; when you feel that man is weak and born to err; when, ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you look back upon your crimes, and ſolicit, with

terror, the mercy of your God, oh! in that fearful moment think upon me! think upon your cruelty! think upon Agnes, and deſpair of pardon."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe uttered theſe laſt words, her ſtrength was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; and ſhe ſunk inanimate upon the boſom of a nun who ſtood near her. She was immediately convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the chapel, and her companions followed her.</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio had not liſtened to her reproaches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out emotion. A ſecret pang at his heart made him feel that he had treated this unfortunate with too great ſeverity. He therefore detained the prioreſs, and ventured to pronounce ſome words in favour of the delinquent.</p>
                     <p>"The violence of her deſpair," ſaid he, "proves that at leaſt vice is not become familiar to her. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, by treating her with ſomewhat leſs rigour than is generally practiſed, and mitigating in ſome degree the accuſtomed penance—"</p>
                     <p>"Mitigate it, father?" interrupted the lady prior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs: "Not I, believe me.

                     <p>Thus ſaying, ſhe haſtened out of the chapel.</p>

It was laid out with the moſt exquiſite taſte; the choiceſt flowers adorned it in the height of luxuriance, and, though artfully arranged, ſeemed only planted by the hand of Nature. Fountains, ſpringing from ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of white marble, cooled the air with perpetual ſhowers; and the walls were entirely covered by jeſſamines, vines, and honey ſuckles. The hour now added to the beauty of the ſcene. The full moon, ranging through a blue and cloudleſs ſky, ſhed upon the trees a trembling luſtre, and the waters of the fountains ſparkled in the ſilver beam; a gentle breeze breathed the fragrance of orange bloſſoms along the alleys, and the nightingale poured forth her melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous murmur from the ſhelter of an artificial wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thither the abbot bent his ſteps.</p>

                     <p>He reached the hermitage, and was entering to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf, when he ſtopped on perceiving it to be already occupied. Extended upon one of the banks, lay a man in a melancholy poſture. His head was ſupported upon his arm, and he ſeemed loſt in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

he watched him in ſilence, and entered not the hermitage. After ſome minutes the youth raiſed his eyes, and fixed them mournfully upon the oppoſite wall.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſaid he, with a deep and plaintive ſigh, "I feel all the happineſs of thy ſituation, all the miſery of my own. Happy were I could I think like thee!

Oh! what a bleſſing would miſanthropy be to me!"</p>
                     <p>"That is a ſingular thought, Roſario," ſaid the abbot, entering the grotto.</p>

                     <p>At the ſame time ſtarting from the moſſy couch in confuſion, he drew his cowl haſtily over his face. Ambroſio placed himſelf upon the bank, and obliged the youth to be ſeated by him.</p>

                     <p>"Were it poſſible," ſaid the friar, "for man to be ſo totally wrapped up in himſelf as to live in abſolute ſecluſion from human nature, and could yet feel the contented tranquillity which theſe lines expreſs, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the ſituation would be more deſirable, than to live in a world ſo pregnant with every vice and every folly. But this never can be the caſe. This inſcription was merely placed here for the ornament of the grotto, and the ſentiments and the hermit are equally imaginary. Man was born for ſociety. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever little he may be attached to the world, he never can wholly forget it, or bear to be wholly forgotten by it. Diſguſted at the guilt or abſurdity of mankind, the miſanthrope flies from it; he reſolves to become an hermit, and buries himſelf in the cavern of ſome gloomy rock. While hate inflames his boſom, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he may feel contented with his ſituation: but when his paſſions begin to cool; when Time has

mellowed his ſorrows, and healed thoſe wounds which he bore with him to his ſolitude, think you that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent becomes his companion? Ah! no, Roſario. No longer ſuſtained by the violence of his paſſions, he feels all the monotony of his way of living, and his heart becomes the prey of ennui and wearineſs. He looks round, and finds himſelf alone in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe: the love of ſociety revives in his boſom, and he pants to return to that world which he has aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Nature loſes all her charms in his eyes: no one is near him to point out her beauties, or ſhare in his admiration of her excellence and variety. Prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon the fragment of ſome rock, he gazes upon the tumbling water fall with a vacant eye; he views without emotion the glory of the ſetting ſun. Slowly he returns to his cell at evening, for no one there is anxious for his arrival: he has no comfort in his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary, un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"You amaze me, father! Suppoſe that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances condemned you to ſolitude; would not the duties of religion, and the conſciouſneſs of a life well ſpent, communicate to your heart that calm which—"</p>

in this particular that I place the principal merit of a monaſtic inſtitution. It ſecludes man from the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of vice; it procures that leiſure neceſſary for the proper ſervice of the Supreme; it ſpares him the mortification of witneſſing the crimes of the worldly, and yet permits him to enjoy the bleſſings of ſociety. And do you, Roſario, do you envy an hermit's life? Can you be thus blind to the happineſs of your ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Reflect upon it for a moment. This abbey is become your aſylum: your regularity, your gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, your talents have rendered you the object of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal eſteem: you are ſecluded from the world which you profeſs to hate; yet you remain in poſſeſſion of the benefits of ſociety, and that a ſociety compoſed of the moſt eſtimable of mankind."</p>

                     <p>"How, Roſario? When we laſt converſed, you ſpoke in a different tone. Is my friendſhip then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of ſuch little conſequence? Had you never ſeen theſe abbey walls, you never had ſeen me. Can that really be your wiſh?"</p>
                     <p>"Had never ſeen you? repeated the novice, ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the bank, and graſping the friar's hand with a frantic air—"You! You! Would to heaven that lightning had blaſted them before you ever met my

                     <p>With theſe words he flew haſtily from the grotto. Ambroſio remained in his former attitude, reflecting on the youth's unaccountable behaviour. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſuſpect the derangement of his ſenſes: yet the general tenor of his conduct, the connection of his ideas, and calmneſs of his demeanor till the moment of his quitting the grotto, ſeemed to diſcountenance this conjecture. After a few minutes Roſario re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. He again ſeated himſelf upon the bank: he reclined his cheek upon one hand, and with the other wiped away the tears which trickled from his eyes at intervals.</p>
                     <p>The monk looked upon him with compaſſion, and forbore to interrupt his meditations. Both obſerved for ſome time a profound ſilence. The nightingale had now taken her ſtation upon an orange tree front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hermitage, and poured forth a ſtrain the moſt melancholy and melodious. Roſario raiſed his head, and liſtened to her with attention.</p>
                     <p>"It was thus," ſaid he, with a deep drawn ſigh, "it was thus that, during the laſt month of her unhappy life, my ſiſter uſed to ſit liſtening to the nightingale. Poor Matilda! ſhe ſleeps in the grave, and her broken heart throbs no more with paſſion."</p>

                     <p>"Father, before he knew her, Julian had already plighted his vows to a bride moſt fair, moſt heavenly! Yet ſtill my ſiſter loved, and for the huſband's ſake ſhe doted upon the wife. One morning ſhe found means to eſcape from our father's houſe: arrayed in humble weeds ſhe offered herſelf as a domeſtic to the conſort of her beloved, and was accepted.

                     <p>"And did not your parents ſeek for her? did they ſubmit tamely to their loſs, nor attempt to recover their wandering daughter?"</p>
                     <p>"Ere they could find her, ſhe diſcovered herſelf. Her love grew too violent for concealment; yet ſhe wiſhed not for Julian's perſon, ſhe ambitioned but a ſhare of his heart. In an unguarded moment ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed

her affection. What was the return?

                     <p>The friar ſtarted; when, after a moment's pauſe, Roſario added with a faltering voice, "for my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are ſtill greater.

while my guardian laboured to enlarge the ſphere of my knowledge; he carefully inculcated every moral precept: he relieved me from the ſhackles of vulgar prejudice: he pointed out the beauty of religion: he taught me to look with adoration upon the pure and virtuous; and, wo is me!

                     <p>"With ſuch diſpoſitions, judge whether I could obſerve with any other ſentiment than diſguſt, the vice, diſſipation, and ignorance which diſgrace our Spaniſh youth.

I retired from the church, glowing with admiration. From that moment you became the idol of my heart; the never changing object of my meditations. I inquired reſpecting you. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which were made me of your mode of life, of your knowledge, piety, and ſelf denial, riveted the chains impoſed on me by your eloquence. I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that there was no longer a void in my heart; that I had found the man whom I had ſought till then in vain. In expectation of hearing you again, every day I viſited your cathedral: you remained ſecluded within the abbey walls, and I always withdrew,

The night was more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to me, for then you ſtood before me in my dreams; you vowed to me eternal friendſhip; you led me through the paths of virtue, and aſſiſted me to ſupport the vexations of life.

She ceaſed.—While ſhe ſpoke, a thouſand oppoſing ſentiments combated in Ambroſio's boſom. Surpriſe at the ſingularity of this adventure; confuſion at her abrupt declaration; reſentment at her boldneſs in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the monaſtery; and conſciouſneſs of the auſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity with which it behoved him to reply; ſuch were the ſentiments of which he was aware: but there were others alſo which did not obtain his notice. He perceived not that his vanity was flattered by the praiſes beſt wed upon his eloquence and virtue; that he felt a ſecret pleaſure in reflecting that a young and ſeemingly lovely woman had for his ſake abandoned the world, and ſacrificed every other paſſion to that which he had inſpired: ſtill leſs did he perceive, that his heart throbbed with deſire, while his hand was preſſed gently by Matilda's ivory fingers.</p>
                     <p>By degrees he recovered from his confuſion: his ideas became leſs bewildered: he was immediately ſenſible of the extreme impropriety, ſhould Matilda be permitted to remain in the abbey after this avowal of her ſex. He aſſumed an air of ſeverity, and drew away his hand.</p>
                     <p>"How, lady!" ſaid he, "can you really hope for my permiſſion to remain amongſt us? Even were I to grant your requeſt, what good could you derive from it? think you, that I ever can reply to an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which—"</p>

"But reflect, lady! reflect, only for a moment on the impropriety of my harbouring a woman in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and that too a woman who confeſſes that ſhe loves me. It muſt not be.

You will miſconſtrue my every word and action; you will ſeize every circumſtance with avidity which encourages you to hope the return of your affection; inſenſibly, your paſſions will gain a ſuperiority over your reaſon; and, far from being repreſſed by my preſence, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we paſs together will only ſerve to irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and excite them.

                     <p>"To-morrow, Ambroſio? to-morrow? Oh! ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you cannot mean it! you cannot reſolve on driving me to deſpair! you cannot have the cruelty—"</p>

You muſt from hence. I pity you, but can do no more."</p>
                     <p>He pronounced theſe words in a faint and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling voice; then riſing from his ſeat, he would have

                     <p>"Stay yet one moment, Ambroſio! hear me yet ſpeak one word!"</p>
                     <p>"I dare not liſten. Releaſe me: you know my reſolution."</p>
                     <p>"But one word! but one laſt word, and I have done!"</p>
                     <p>"Leave me. Your entreaties are in vain: you muſt from hence to-morrow."</p>
                     <p>"Go then, barbarian! But this reſource is ſtill left me."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſaid this, ſhe ſuddenly drew a poignard. She rent open her garment, and placed the weapon's point againſt her boſom.</p>
                     <p>"Father, I will never quit theſe walls alive."</p>
                     <p>"Hold! hold, Matilda! what would you do?"</p>
                     <p>"You are determined, ſo am I: the moment that you leave me, I plunge this ſteel in my heart."</p>
                     <p>"Holy St. Francis! Matilda, have you your ſenſes? Do you know the conſequences of your action? that ſuicide is the greateſt of crimes? that you deſtroy your ſoul? that you loſe your claim to ſalvation? that you prepare for yourſelf everlaſting torments?"</p>
                     <p>"I care not, I care not!" ſhe replied paſſionately: "either your hand guides me to paradiſe, or my own dooms me to perdition! Speak to me, Ambroſio! Tell me that you will conceal my ſtory; that I ſhall

                     <p>As ſhe uttered theſe laſt words, ſhe lifted her arm, and made a motion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>read the courſe of the dagger, and ſaw that its point already reſted upon her boſom.</p>
                     <p>"Hold!" he cried, in an hurried, faltering voice; "I can reſiſt no longer! Stay then, enchantreſs! ſtay, for my deſtruction!"</p>
                     <p>He ſaid: and, ruſhing from the place, haſtened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the monaſtery; he regained his cell, and threw himſelf upon his couch, diſtracted, irreſolute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.</p>
                     <p>He found it impoſſible for ſome time to arrange his ideas. The ſcene in which he had been engaged, had excited ſuch a variety of ſentiments in his boſom, that he was incapable of deciding which was predominant. He was irreſolute what conduct he ought to hold with the diſturber of his repoſe; he was conſcious that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, religion, and propriety, neceſſitated his obliging her to quit the abbey: but, on the other hand, ſuch powerful reaſons authorized her ſtay, that he was but too much inclined to conſent to her remaining. He could not avoid being flattered by Matilda's declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and at reflecting that he had unconſciouſly van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed an heart which had reſiſted the attacks of Spain's nobleſt cavaliers. The manner in which he had gained her affections was alſo the moſt ſatisfactory to his vanity: he remembered the many happy hours which he had paſſed in Roſario's ſociety; and dreaded that void in his heart which parting with him would occaſion. Beſides all this, he conſidered, that, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035729_0076_1006582E2E038698"/>
was wealthy, her favour might be of eſſential ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit to the abbey.</p>
                     <p>"And what do I riſk," ſaid he to himſelf, "by authorizing her ſtay? may I not ſafely credit her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions? will it not be eaſy for me to forget her ſex, and ſtill conſider her as my friend, and my diſciple? Surely her love is as pure as ſhe deſcribes: had it been the offspring of mere licentiouſneſs, would ſhe ſo long have concealed it in her own boſom? would ſhe not have employed ſome means to procure its grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification? ſhe has done quite the contrary: ſhe ſtrove to keep me in ignorance of her ſex; and nothing but the fear of detection, and my inſtances, would have compelled her to reveal the ſecret: ſhe has obſerved the duties of religion not leſs ſtrictly than myſelf: ſhe has made no attempt to rouſe my ſlumbering paſſions, nor has ſhe ever converſed with me till this night on the ſubject of love. Had ſhe been deſirous to gain my affections, not my eſteem, ſhe would not have concealed from me her charms ſo carefully: at this very moment I have never ſeen her face; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that face muſt be lovely, and her perſon beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to judge by what I have ſeen."</p>
                     <p>As this laſt idea paſſed through his imagination, a bluſh ſpread itſelf over his cheek. Alarmed at the ſentiments which he was indulging, he betook himſelf to prayer: he ſtarted from his couch, knelt before the beautiful Madona, and entreated her aſſiſtance in ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling ſuch culpable emotions: he then returned to his bed, and reſigned himſelf to ſlumber.</p>
                     <p>He awoke heated and unrefreſhed; and ſtarted from his couch, heartily aſhamed when he reflected on
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035729_0077_10065861F51297F8"/>
his reaſons of the former night, which induced him to authorize Matilda's ſtay. The cloud was now diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated which had obſcured his judgment; he ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when he beheld his arguments blazoned in their proper colours, and found that he had been a ſlave to flattery, to avarice and ſelf love. If in one hour's converſation Matilda had produced a change ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in his ſentiments, what had he not to dread from her remaining in the abbey? Become ſenſible of his danger, awakened from his dream of confidence, he reſolved to inſiſt on her departing without delay: he began to feel that he was not proof againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and that, however Matilda might reſtrain herſelf within the bounds of modeſty, he was unable to contend with thoſe paſſions from which he falſely thought himſelf exempted.</p>
                     <p>"Agnes! Agnes!" he exclaimed, while reflecting on his embarraſſments, "I already feel thy curſe!"</p>
                     <p>He quitted his cell, determined upon diſmiſſing the feigned Roſario. He appeared at matins; but his thoughts were abſent, and he paid them but little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: his heart and brain were both of them filled with worldly objects, and he prayed without devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſervice over, he deſcended into the garden; he bent his ſteps towards the ſame ſpot where on the preceding night he had made this embarraſſing diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery: he doubted not that Matilda would ſeek him there. He was not deceived: ſhe ſoon entered the hermitage, and approached the monk with a timid air. After a few minutes, during which both were ſilent, ſhe appeared as if on the point of ſpeaking; but the abbot, who during this time had been ſummoning up
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035729_0078_10065830D5630960"/>
all his reſolution, haſtily interrupted her. Though ſtill unconſcious how extenſive was its influence, he dreaded the melodious ſeduction of her voice.</p>
                     <p>"Seat yourſelf by my ſide, Matilda," ſaid he, aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a look of firmneſs, though carefully avoiding the leaſt mixture of ſeverity; "liſten to me patiently, and believe that, in what I ſhall ſay, I am not more influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by my own intereſt than by yours; believe that I feel for you the warmeſt friendſhip, the trueſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and that you cannot feel more grieved than I do, when I declare to you that we muſt never meet again."</p>
                     <p>"Ambroſio!" ſhe cried, in a voice at once expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive both of ſurpriſe and of ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>"Be calm, my friend! my Roſario! ſtill let me call you by that name ſo dear to me: our ſeparation is unavoidable; I bluſh to own how ſenſibly it affects me,—But yet it muſt be ſo; I feel myſelf incapable of treating you with indifference; and that very convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obliges me to inſiſt upon your departure.

                     <p>"Oh! where ſhall I now ſeek for probity? diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted with a perfidious world, in what happy region does Truth conceal herſelf? Father, I hoped that ſhe reſided here; I thought that your boſom had been her favourite ſhrine. And you too prove falſe? Oh God! and you too can betray me?"</p>
                     <p>"Matilda!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, father, yes; 'tis with juſtice that I reproach you. Oh! where are your promiſes? My noviciate

Reflect upon the danger of a diſcovery; upon the opprobrium in which ſuch an event would plunge me: reflect, that my honor and reputation are at ſtake; and that my peace of mind depends on your compliance. As yet, my heart is free; I ſhall ſeparate from you with regret, but not with deſpair.

                     <p>"Cruel! cruel!" ſhe exclaimed, wringing her hands in agony: "you know too well that you offer me no choice: you know too well that I can have no will but yours."</p>
                     <p>"I was not then deceived. Matilda's generoſity equals my expectations."</p>
                     <p>"Yes: I will prove the truth of my affection by ſubmitting to a decree which cuts me to the very heart. Take back your promiſe. I will quit the monaſtery this very day.

Suddenly he uttered a pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cry, ſtarted back haſtily, and let the flower, which he already held, fall from his hand. Matilda heard the ſhriek, and flew anxiouſly towards him.</p>
                     <p>"What is the matter?" ſhe cried. "Anſwer me, for God's ſake! What has happened?"</p>
                     <p>"I have received my death," he replied in a faint voice: "concealed among the roſes—a ſerpent—"</p>
                     <p>Here the pain of his wound became ſo exquiſite, that nature was unable to bear it: his ſenſes aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him, and he ſunk inanimate into Matilda's arms.</p>
                     <p>Her diſtreſs was beyond the power of deſcription. She rent her hair, beat her boſom, and, not daring to quit Ambroſio, endeavoured, by loud cries, to ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the monks to her aſſiſtance. She at length ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. Alarmed by her ſhrieks, ſeveral of the broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers haſtened to the ſpot, and the ſuperior was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed back to the abbey. He was immediately put to bed, and the monk who officiated as ſurgeon to the fraternity prepared to examine the wound. By this time Ambroſio's hand had ſwelled to an extraordinary ſize: the remedies which had been adminiſtered to him, 'tis true, reſtored him to life, but not to his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: he raved in all the horrors of delirium, foamed
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035729_0082_10065834044FB2E0"/>
at the mouth, and four of the ſtrongeſt monks were ſcarcely able to hold him in his bed.</p>
                     <p>Father Pablos (ſuch was the ſurgeon's name) haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to examine the wounded hand. The monks ſurrounded the bed, anxiouſly waiting for the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: among theſe the feigned Roſario appeared not the moſt inſenſible to the friar's calamity; he gazed upon the ſufferer with inexpreſſible anguiſh; and his groans, which every moment eſcaped from his boſom, ſufficiently betrayed the violence of his affliction.</p>
                     <p>Father Pablos probed the wound. As he drew out his inſtrument, its point was tinged with a greeniſh hue. He ſhook his head mournfully, and quitted the bed-ſide.</p>
                     <p>"'Tis as I feared," ſaid he; "there is no hope."</p>
                     <p>"No hope!" exclaimed the monks with one voice; "ſay you, no hope?"</p>
                     <p>"From the ſudden effects, I ſuſpected that the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot was ſtung by a cientipedoro:<note n="*" place="bottom">The cientipedoro is ſuppoſed to be a native of Cuba, and to have been brought into Spain, from that iſland, in the veſſel of Columbus.</note> the venom which you ſee upon my inſtrument confirms my idea. He cannot live three days."</p>
                     <p>"And can no poſſible remedy be found?" inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Roſario.</p>
                     <p>"Without extracting the poiſon, he cannot recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and how to extract it, is to me ſtill a ſecret. All that I can do is to apply ſuch herbs to the wound as
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035729_0083_10065867CA271730"/>
will relieve the anguiſh: the patient will be reſtored to his ſenſes; but the venom will corrupt the whole maſs of his blood, and in three days he will exiſt no longer."</p>
                     <p>Exceſſive was the univerſal grief at hearing this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. Pablos, as he had promiſed, dreſſed the wound, and then retired, followed by his companions. Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio alone remained in the cell; the abbot, at his ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent entreaty, having been committed to his care. Ambroſio's ſtrength worn out by the violence of his exertions, he had by this time fallen into a profound ſleep. So totally was he overcome by wearineſs, that he ſcarcely gave any ſigns of life. He was ſtill in this ſituation, when the monks returned to inquire whether any change had taken place. Pablos looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the bandage which concealed the wound, more from a principle of curioſity, than from indulging the hope of diſcovering any favourable ſymptoms. What was his aſtoniſhment at finding that the inflammation had totally ſubſided! He probed the hand; his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtument came out pure and unſullied; no traces of the venom were perceptible; and had not the orifice ſtill been viſible, Pablos might have doubted that there had ever been a wound.</p>
                     <p>He communicated this intelligence to his brethren: their delight was only equalled by their ſurpriſe. From the latter ſentiment, however, they were ſoon releaſed, by explaining the circumſtance according to their own ideas. They were perfectly convinced that their ſuperior was a ſaint, and thought that noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could be more natural than for St. Francis to have operated a miracle in his favour. This opinion
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035729_0084_10065836F53A6F30"/>
was adopted unanimouſly. They declared it ſo loudly, and vociferated "A miracle! a miracle!" with ſuch fervour, that they ſoon interrupted Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio's ſlumbers.</p>
                     <p>The monks immediately crowded round his bed, and expreſſed their ſatisfaction at his wonderful recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery. He was perfectly in his ſenſes, and free from every complaint, except feeling weak and languid. Pablos gave him a ſtrengthening medicine, and adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his keeping his bed for the two ſucceeding days: he then retired, having deſired his patient not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt himſelf by converſation, but rather to endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at taking ſome repoſe. The other monks fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his example, and the abbot and Roſario were left without obſervers.</p>
                     <p>For ſome minutes Ambroſio regarded his attendant with a look of mingled pleaſure and apprehenſion. She was ſeated upon the ſide of the bed, her head bending down, and, as uſual, enveloped in the cowl of her habit.</p>
                     <p>"And you are ſtill here, Matilda?" ſaid the friar at length; "are you not ſatisfied with having ſo nearly effected my deſtruction, that nothing but a miracle could have ſaved me from the grave? Ah! ſurely heaven ſent that ſerpent to puniſh—"</p>
                     <p>Matilda interrupted him by putting her hand before his lips with an air of gaiety.</p>
                     <p>"Huſh; father, huſh! you muſt not talk."</p>
                     <p>"He who impoſed that order, knew not how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting are the ſubjects on which I wiſh to ſpeak."</p>
                     <p>

"But I know it, and yet iſſue the ſame poſitive command. I am appointed your nurſe, and you muſt not diſobey my orders."</p>
                     <p>"You are in ſpirits, Matilda."</p>
                     <p>"Well may I be ſo: I have juſt received a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure unexampled through my whole life."</p>
                     <p>"What was that pleaſure?"</p>
                     <p>"What I muſt conceal from all, but moſt from you."</p>
                     <p>"But moſt from me? Nay then, I entreat you, Matilda—"</p>
                     <p>"Huſh! father, huſh! you muſt not talk. But as you do not ſeem inclined to ſleep, ſhall I endeavour to amuſe you with my harp?"</p>
                     <p>"How! I knew not that you underſtood muſic."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! I am a ſorry performer! Yet as ſilence is preſcribed you for eight and forty hours, I may poſſibly entertain you when wearied of your own reflections. I go to fetch my harp."</p>
                     <p>She ſoon returned with it.</p>
                     <p>"Now, father, what ſhall I ſing? Will you hear the ballad which treats of the gallant Durandarte, who died in the famous battle of Roncevalles?"</p>
                     <p>"What you pleaſe, Matilda."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! call me not Matilda! call me Roſario, call me your friend. Thoſe are the names which I love to hear from your lips. Now liſten."</p>

She then tuned her harp, and afterwards preluded for ſome moments with ſuch exquiſite taſte as to prove her a perfect miſtreſs of the inſtrument. The air which ſhe played was ſoft and plaintive. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſio, while he liſtened, felt his uneaſineſs ſubſide, and a pleaſing melancholy ſpread itſelf into his boſom. Suddenly Matilda changed the ſtrain: with an hand bold and rapid, ſhe ſtruck a few loud martial chords, and then chanted the following ballad to an air at once ſimple and melodious:</p>

Her habit's long ſleeve would have ſwept along the chords of the inſtrument: to prevent this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience ſhe had drawn it above her elbow; and by this means an arm was diſcovered, formed in the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſymmetry, the delicacy of whoſe ſkin might have contended with ſnow in whiteneſs.

Every beauty which he had ſeen appeared embelliſhed; and thoſe ſtill concealed fancy repreſented to him in glowing colours. Still, however, his vows, and the neceſſity of keeping to them, were preſent to his memory. He ſtruggled with deſire, and ſhuddered when he beheld how deep was the precipice before him.</p>
                     <p>Matilda ceaſed to ſing. Dreading the influence of her charms, Ambroſio remained with his eyes cloſed, and offered up his prayers to St. Francis to aſſiſt him in this dangerous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"He ſleeps!" ſaid ſhe at length in a low voice, but whoſe accents the abbot diſtinguiſhed perfectly: "now then I may gaze upon him without offence; I may mix my breath with his; I may dote upon his features, and he cannot ſuſpect me of impurity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. He fears my ſeducing him to the violation of his vows. Oh! the unjuſt!

looks on me with ſuſpicion; he bids me leave him, leave him for ever. Oh! you, my ſaint, my idol! You! holding the next place to God in my breaſt, yet two days, and my heart will be unveiled to you. Could you know my feelings, when I beheld your agony! Could you know how much your ſufferings have endeared you to me! But the time will come, when you will be convinced that my paſſion is pure and diſintereſted. Then you will pity me, and feel the whole weight of theſe ſorrows."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſaid this, her voice was choked by weeping. While ſhe bent over Ambroſio, a tear fell upon his cheek.</p>
                     <p>Ah! I have diſturbed him," cried Matilda, and retreated haſtily.</p>
                     <p>Her alarm was ungrounded. None ſleep ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly as thoſe who are determined not to wake. The fria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"What affection! what purity!" ſaid he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. "Ah! ſince my boſom is thus ſenſible of pity, what would it be if agitated by love?"</p>
                     <p>Matilda again quitted her ſeat, and retired to ſome diſtance from the bed. Ambroſio ventured to open his eyes, and to caſt them upon her fearfully. Her face was turned from him. She reſted her head in a melancholy poſture upon her harp, and gazed on the picture which hung oppoſite to the bed.</p>

"Happy, happy image!" Thus did ſhe addreſs the beautiful Madona; "'tis to thee that he offers his prayers; 'tis on thee that he gazes with admiration. I thought thou wouldſt have lightened my ſorrows; but thou haſt only ſerved to increaſe their weight; thou haſt made me feel, that, had I known him ere his vows were pronounced, Ambroſio and happineſs might have been mine. With what pleaſure he views this picture! With what fervour he addreſſes his prayers to the inſenſible image! Ah! may not his ſentiments be inſpired by ſome kind and ſecret genius, friend to my affection? May it not be man's natural inſtinct which informs him—? Be ſilent! idle hopes! let me not encourage an idea, which takes from the brilliance of Ambroſio's virtue. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, not beauty, which attracts his admiration; 'tis not to the woman, but the divinity, that he kneels. Would he but addreſs to me the leaſt tender expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which he pours forth to this Madona! Would he but ſay, that, were he not already affianced to the church, he would not have deſpiſed Matilda! Oh! let me nouriſh that fond idea. Perhaps he may yet acknowledge that he feels for me more than pity, and that affection like mine might well have deſerved a return. Perhaps he may own thus much when I lie on my death bed. He then need not fear to infringe his vows, and the confeſſion of his regard will ſoften the pangs of dying. Would I were ſure of this! oh! how earneſtly ſhould I ſigh for the moment of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution!"</p>
                     <p>Of this diſcourſe the abbot loſt not a ſyllable! and the tone in which ſhe pronounced theſe laſt words
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035729_0092_10065840911949F0"/>
pierced to his heart. Involuntarily he raiſed himſelf from his pillow.</p>
                     <p>"Matilda!" he ſaid in a troubled voice; "Oh! my Matilda!"</p>
                     <p>She ſtarted at the ſound, and turned towards him haſtily. The ſuddenneſs of her movement made her cowl fall back from her head; her features became viſible to the monk's inquiring eye. What was his amazement at beholding the exact reſemblance of his admired Madona! The ſame exquiſite propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of features, the ſame profuſion of golden hair, the ſame roſy lips, heavenly eyes, and majeſty of countenance adorned Matilda! Uttering an exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſurpriſe, Ambroſio ſunk back upon his pillow, and doubted whether the object before him was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal or divine.</p>
                     <p>Matilda ſeemed penetrated with confuſion. She remained motionleſs in her place, and ſupported her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon her inſtrument. Her eyes were bent upon the earth, and her fair cheeks overſpread with bluſhes. On recovering herſelf, her firſt action was to conceal her features. She then, in an unſteady and troubled voice, ventured to addreſs theſe words to the friar:</p>
                     <p>"Accident has made you maſter of a ſecret which I never would have revealed but on the bed of death: yes, Ambroſio, in Matilda de Villanegas you ſee the original of your beloved Madona. Soon after I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my unfortunate paſſion, I formed the project of conveying to you my picture. Crowds of admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had perſuaded me that I poſſeſſed ſome beauty, and I was anxious to know what effect it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce upon you. I cauſed my portrait to be drawn by
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035729_0093_100658707010A830"/>
Martin Galuppi, a celebrated Venetian, at that time reſident in Madrid. The reſemblance was ſtriking: I ſent it to the Capuchin abbey as if for ſale; and the Jew from whom you bought it was one of my emiſſaries. You purchaſed it. Judge of my rapture, when informed that you had gazed upon it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, or rather with adoration; that you had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended it in your cell, and that you addreſſed your ſupplications to no other ſaint! Will this diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery make me ſtill more regarded as an object of ſuſpicion? Rather ſhould it convince you how pure is my affection, and engage you to ſuffer me in your ſociety and eſteem. I heard you daily choral the praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of my portrait. I was an eye witneſs of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which its beauty excited in you: yet I forebore to uſe againſt your virtue thoſe arms with which yourſelf had furniſhed me. I concealed thoſe features from your fight, which you loved unconſciouſly. I ſtrove not to excite deſire by diſplaying my charms, or to make myſelf miſtreſs of your heart through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of your ſenſes. To attract your notice by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly attending to religious duties, to endear myſelf to you by convincing you that my mind was virtuous, and my attachment ſincere, ſuch was my only aim. I ſucceeded; I became your companion and your friend. I concealed my ſex from your knowledge; and, had you not preſſed me to reveal my ſecret, had I not been tormented by the fear of a diſcovery, never had you known me for any other than Roſario. And ſtill are you reſolved to drive me from you? The few hours of life which yet remain for me, may I not paſs them in your preſence? Oh! ſpeak, Ambroſio, and tell me that I may ſtay."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:035729_0094_1006584218E6B9B0"/>
This ſpeech gave the abbot an opportunity of recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting himſelf. He was conſcious that, in the preſent diſpoſition of his mind, avoiding her ſociety was his only refuge from the power of this enchanting woman.</p>
                     <p>"Your declaration has ſo much aſtoniſhed me," ſaid he, "that I am at preſent incapable of anſwering you. Do not inſiſt upon a reply, Matilda; leave me to myſelf, I have need to be alone."</p>
                     <p>"I obey you; but, before I go, promiſe not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon my quitting the abbey immediately."</p>
                     <p>"Matilda, reflect upon your ſituation; reflect upon the conſequences of your ſtay: our ſeparation is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable, and we muſt part."</p>
                     <p>"But not to-day, father! Oh! in pity, not to-day!"</p>
                     <p>"You preſs me too hard; but I cannot reſiſt that tone of ſupplication. Since you inſiſt upon it, I yield to your prayer; I conſent to your remaining here a ſufficient time to prepare, in ſome meaſure, the brethren for your departure: ſtay yet two days; but on the third"—(He ſighed involuntarily)—"remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that on the third we muſt part for ever!"</p>
                     <p>She caught his hand eagerly, and preſſed it to her lips.</p>
                     <p>"On the third!" ſhe exclaimed with an air of wild ſolemnity: "You are right, father, you are right! On the third we muſt part for ever!"</p>
                     <p>There was a dreadful expreſſion in her eyes as ſhe uttered theſe words, which penetrated the friar's ſoul
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035729_0095_1006587447319550"/>
with horror. Again ſhe kiſſed his hand, and then fled with rapidity from the chamber.</p>
                     <p>Anxious to authorize the preſence of his dangerous gueſt, yet conſcious that her ſtay was infringing the laws of his order, Ambroſio's boſom became the theatre of a thouſand contending paſſions. At length his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the feigned Roſario ſeemed likely to obtain the victory: the ſucceſs was aſſured, when that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption which formed the ground work of his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter came to Matilda's aſſiſtance. The monk re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, that to vanquiſh temptation was an infinitely greater merit than to avoid it; he thought that he ought rather to rejoice in the opportunity given him of proving the firmneſs of his virtue. St. Anthony had withſtood all ſeductions, then why ſhould not he? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, St. Anthony was tempted by Satan, who put every art into practice to excite his paſſions; whereas Ambroſio's danger proceeded from a mere mortal woman, fearful and modeſt, whoſe apprehenſions of his yielding were not leſs violent than his own.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſaid he, "the unfortunate ſhall ſtay; I have nothing to fear from her preſence: even ſhould my own prove too weak to reſiſt the temptation, I am ſecured from danger by the innocence of Matilda."</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio was yet to learn, that, to an heart unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, vice is ever moſt dangerous when lurking behind the maſk of virtue.</p>
                     <p>He found himſelf ſo perfectly recovered, that when father Pablos viſited him again at night, he entreated permiſſion to quit his chamber on the day following. His requeſt was granted. Matilda appeared no more
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035729_0096_10065843C6E61918"/>
that evening, except in company with the monks when they came in a body to inquire after the abbot's health. She ſeemed fearful of converſing with him in private, and ſtaid but a few minutes in his room. The friar ſlept well.</p>
                     <p>The morning dawned, but he was not diſpoſed to quit his bed: he excuſed himſelf from appearing at matins: it was the firſt morning in his life that he had ever miſſed them. He roſe late: during the whole of the day he had no opportunity of ſpeaking to Matilda without witneſſes; his cell was thronged by the monks, anxious to expreſs their concern at his illneſs; and he was ſtill occupied in receiving their compliments on his recovery, when the bell ſummoned them to the refectory.</p>
                     <p>After dinner, the monks ſeparated, and diſperſed themſelves in various parts of the garden, where the ſhade of trees, or retirement of ſome grotto, preſented the moſt agreeable means of enjoying the ſieſta. The abbot bent his ſteps towards the hermitage; a glance of his eye invited Matilda to accompany him: ſhe obeyed, and followed him thither in ſilence; they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the grotto, and ſeated themſelves: both ſeemed unwilling to begin the converſation, and to labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of mutual embarraſſment. At length the abbot ſpoke: he converſed only on indifferent topics, and Matilda anſwered him in the ſame tone; ſhe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anxious to make him forget that the perſon who ſat by him was any other than Roſario. Neither of them dared, or indeed wiſhed, to make an alluſion to the ſubject which was moſt at the heart of both.</p>
                     <p>Matilda's efforts to appear gay were evidently forced;
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035729_0097_10065875CDC25AA8"/>
her ſpirits were oppreſſed by the weight of anxiety; and when ſhe ſpoke, her voice was low and feeble; ſhe ſeemed deſirous of finiſhing a converſation which embarraſſed her; and, complaining that ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, ſhe requeſted Ambroſio's permiſſion to return to the abbey. He accompanied her to the door of her cell; and, when arrived there, he ſtopped her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his conſent to her continuing the partner of his ſolitude, ſo long as ſhould be agreeable to herſelf.</p>
                     <p>She diſcovered no marks of pleaſure at receiving this intelligence, though on the preceding day ſhe had be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n ſo anxious to obtain the permiſſion.</p>
                     <p>"Alas, father," ſhe ſaid, waving her head mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, "your kindneſs comes too late; my doom is fixed; we muſt ſeparate for ever: yet believe that I am grateful for your generoſity, for your compaſſion of an unfortunate who is but too little deſerving of it."</p>
                     <p>She put her handkerchief to her eyes; her cowl was only half drawn over her face. Ambroſio obſerved that ſhe was pale, and her eyes ſunk and heavy.</p>
                     <p>"Good God!" he cried, "you are very ill, Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da; I ſhall ſend father Pablos to you inſtantly."</p>
                     <p>"No, do not: I am ill 'tis true, but he cannot cure my malady. Farewell, father! Remember me in your prayers to-morrow, while I ſhall remember you in heaven."</p>
                     <p>She entered her cell and cloſed the door.</p>
                     <p>The abbot diſpatched to her the phyſician without loſing a moment, and waited his report impatiently; but father Pablos ſoon returned, and declared that his
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035729_0098_100658B3A8105CE8"/>
errand had been fruitleſs. Roſario refuſed to admit him, and had poſitively rejected his offers of aſſiſtance. The uneaſineſs which this account gave Ambroſio was not trifling; yet he determined that Matilda ſhould have her own way for that night, but that if her ſituation did not mend by the morning, he would inſiſt upon her taking the advice of father Pablos.</p>
                     <p>He did not find himſelf inclined to ſleep; he opened his caſement, and gazed upon the moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams as they played upon the ſmall ſtream whoſe waters bathed the walls of the monaſtery. The cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the night breeze, and tranquillity of the hour, inſpired the friar's mind with ſadneſs; he thought upon Matilda's beauty and affection; upon the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures which he might have ſhared with her, had he not been reſtrained by monaſtic fetters. He reflected that, unſuſtained by hope, her love for him could not long exiſt; that doubtleſs ſhe would ſucceed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing her paſſion, and ſeek for happineſs in the arms of one more fortunate. He ſhuddered at the void which her abſence would leave in his boſom; he looked with diſguſt on the monotony of a convent, and breathed a ſigh towards that world from which he was for ever ſeparated. Such were the reflections which a loud knocking at his door interrupted. The bell of the church had already ſtruck two. The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot haſtened to inquire the cauſe of this diſturbance. He opened the door of his cell, and a lay brother en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, whoſe looks declared his hurry and confuſion.</p>
                     <p>"Haſten, reverend father!" ſaid he, "haſten to the young Roſario: he earneſtly requeſts to ſee you; he lies at the point of death."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="101" facs="unknown:035729_0099_1006593E58602490"/>
"Gracious God! where is father Pablos? Why is he not with him? Oh! I fear, I fear—"</p>
                     <p>"Father Pablos has ſeen him, but his art can do noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He ſays that he ſuſpects the youth to be poiſoned."</p>
                     <p>"Poiſoned? Oh! the unfortunate! It is then as I ſuſpected! But let me not loſe a moment; perhaps it may yet be time to ſave her."</p>
                     <p>He ſaid, and flew towards the cell of the novice. Several monks were already in the chamber; father Pablos was one of them, and held a medicine in his hand, which he was endeavouring to perſuade Roſario to ſwallow. The others were employed in admiring the patient's divine countenance, which they now ſaw for the firſt time. She looked lovelier than ever; ſhe was no longer pale or languid; a bright glow had ſpread itſelf over he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> cheeks; her eyes ſparkled with a ſerene delight, and her countenance was expreſſive of confidence and reſignation.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! torment me no more!" was ſhe ſaying to Pablos, when the terrified abbot ruſhed haſtily into the cell; "my diſeaſe is far beyond the reach of your ſkill, and I wiſh not to be cured of it." Then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civing Ambroſio—"Ah, 'tis he!" ſhe cried; "I ſee him once again before we part for ever! Leave me my brethren; much have I to tell this holy man in private."</p>
                     <p>The monks retired immediately, and Matilda and the abbot remained together.</p>
                     <p>"What have you done, imprudent woman?" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the latter, as ſoon as they were left alone: "tell me, are my ſuſpicions juſt? Am I indeed to

loſe you? Has your own hand been the inſtrument of your deſtruction?"</p>
                     <p>She ſmiled, and graſped his hand.</p>
                     <p>"In what have I been imprudent, father? I have ſacrificed a pebble, and ſaved a diamond. My death preſerves a life valuable to the world, and more dear to me than my own. Yes, father, I am poiſoned; but know that the poiſon once circulated in your veins."</p>
                     <p>"Matilda!"</p>
                     <p>"What I tell you I reſolved never to diſcover to you but on the bed of death; that moment is now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. You cannot have forgotten the day when your life was endangered by the bite of a cientipedoro. The phyſician gave you over, declaring himſelf igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how to extract the venom. I knew but of one means, and heſitated not a moment to employ it. I was left alone with you; you ſlept; I looſened the bandage from your hand; I kiſſed the wound, and drew out the poiſon with my lips. The effect has been more ſudden than I expected. I feel death at my heart; yet an hour and I ſhall be in a better world."</p>
                     <p>"Almighty God!" exclaimed the abbot and ſunk almoſt lifeleſs upon the bed.</p>

'tis a cold unfeeling word: my boſom burns with love, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable love, and love muſt be its return. Tremble then, Ambroſio, tremble to ſucceed in your prayers. If I live, your truth, your reputation, your reward of a life paſſed in ſufferings, all that you value, is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievably loſt.

                     <p>THE marquis and Lorenzo proceeded to the hotel in ſilence. The former employed himſelf in call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every circumſtance to his mind, which related, might give Lorenzo's the moſt favourable idea of his connection with Agnes. The latter, juſtly alarmed for the honor of his family, felt embarraſſed by the preſence of the marquis: the adventure which he had juſt witneſſed forbade his treating him as a friend; and Antonia's intereſt being entruſted to his mediation, he ſaw the impolicy of treating him as a foe. He concluded from theſe reflections, that profound ſilence would be the wiſeſt plan, and waited with impatience for Don Raymond's explanation.</p>
                     <p>They arrived at the hotel de las Ciſternas. The marquis immediately conducted him to his apartment, and began to expreſs his ſatisfaction at finding him at Madrid. Lorenzo interrupted him.</p>
                     <p>"Excuſe me, my lord," ſaid he with a diſtant air, "if I reply ſomewhat coldly to your expreſſions of regard. A ſiſter's honor is involved in this affair: till that is eſtabliſhed, and the purport of your correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with Agnes cleared up, I cannot conſider you as my friend. I am anxious to hear the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your conduct; and hope that you will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the promiſed explanation."</p>

                        <pb n="106" facs="unknown:035729_0104_100658B910D5D850"/>
"Firſt give me your word, that you will liſten with patience and indulgence."</p>
                     <p>"I love my ſiſter too well to judge her harſhly; and, till this moment, I poſſeſſed no friend ſo dear to me as yourſelf. I will alſo confeſs, that your having it in your power to oblige me in a buſineſs which I have much at heart, makes me very anxious to find you ſtill deſerving my eſteem."</p>
                     <p>"Lorenzo, you tranſport me No greater pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure can be given me, than an opportunity of ſerving the brother of Agnes."</p>
                     <p>"Convince me that I can accept your favours without diſhonor, and there is no man in the world to whom I am more willing to be obliged."</p>
                     <p>"Probably you have already heard your ſiſter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the name of Alphonſo d'Alvarada?"</p>
                     <p>"Never. Though I feel for Agnes an affection truly fraternal, circumſtances have prevented us from being much together. While yet a child, ſhe was conſigned to the care of her aunt, who had married a German nobleman. At his caſtle ſhe remained till two years ſince, when ſhe returned to Spain, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon ſecluding herſelf from the world."</p>
                     <p>"Good God! Lorenzo, you knew of her intention, and yet ſtrove not to make her change it?"</p>
                     <p>"Marquis you wrong me: the intelligence, which I received at Naples, ſhocked me extremely, and I haſtened my return to Madrid for the expreſs purpoſe of preventing the ſacrifice. The moment that I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, I flew to the convent of St. Clare, in which
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035729_0105_1006588023483A00"/>
Agnes had choſen to perform her noviciate. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to ſee my ſiſter. Conceive my ſurpriſe, when ſhe ſent me a refuſal: ſhe declared poſitively that, apprehending my influence over her mind, ſhe would not truſt herſelf in my ſociety till the day before that on which ſhe was to receive the veil. I ſupplicated the nuns; I inſiſted upon ſeeing Agnes; and heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itated not to avow my ſuſpicions, that her being kept from me was againſt her own inclinations. To free herſelf from the imputation of violence, the prioreſs brought me a few lines, written in my ſiſter's well known hand, repeating the meſſage already delivered. All future attempts to obtain a moment's converſation with her, were as fruitleſs as the firſt. She was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, and I was not permitted to ſee her till the day preceding that on which ſhe entered the cloiſter, never to quit it more. This interview took place in the preſence of our principal relations. It was for the firſt time ſince her childhood that I ſaw her, and the ſcene was moſt affecting: ſhe threw herſelf upon my boſom, kiſſed me, and wept bitterly. By every poſſible argument, by tears, by prayers, by kneeling, I ſtrove to make her abandon her intention. I rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſented to her all the hardſhips of a religious life; I painted to her imagination all the pleaſures which ſhe was going to quit; and beſought her to diſcloſe to me what occaſioned her diſguſt to the world. At this laſt queſtion ſhe turned pale, and her tears flowed yet faſter. She entreated me not to preſs her on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; that it ſufficed me to know that her reſolution was taken, and that a convent was the only place where ſhe could now hope for tranquillity. She per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered in her deſign, and made her profeſſion. I
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035729_0106_100658BA9841BB68"/>
viſited her frequently at the grate; and every moment that I paſſed with her made me feel more affliction at her loſs. I was ſhortly after obliged to quit Madrid; I returned but yeſterday evening, and, ſince then, have not had time to call at St. Clare's convent."</p>
                     <p>"Then, till I mentioned it, you never heard the name of Alphonſo d'Alvarada?"</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me: my aunt wrote me word, that an adventurer so called had found means to get introduced into the caſtle of Lindenberg; that he had inſinuated himſelf into my ſiſter's good graces: and that ſhe had even conſented to elope with him. However, before the plan could be executed, the cavalier diſcovered, that the eſtates which he believed Agnes to poſſeſs in Hiſpaniola, in reality belonged to me. This intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence made him change his intention; he diſappeared on the day that the elopement was to have taken place; and Agnes, in deſpair at his perfidy and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had reſolved upon ſecluſion in a convent. She added, that as this adventurer had given himſelf out to be a friend of mine, ſhe wiſhed to know whether I had any knowledge of him. I replied in the negative. I had then very little idea, that Alphonſo d'Alvarada and the marquis de las Ciſternas were one and the ſame perſon: the deſcription given me of the firſt, by no means tallied with what I knew of the latter."</p>

Forgive me, Lorenzo, if I ſeem tedious in my nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: the cloſe connection which now exiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, makes me anxious that you ſhould know every particular reſpecting me; and in my fear of omitting the leaſt circumſtance which may induce you to think favourably of your ſiſter and myſelf, I may poſſibly relate many which you may think unintereſting.</p>
                        <p>I followed the duke's advice: I was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of its wiſdom. I quitted Spain, calling my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the aſſumed title of Don Alphonſo d'Alvarada, and attended by a ſingle domeſtic of approved fidelity. Paris was my firſt ſtation. For ſome time I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted with it, as indeed muſt be every man who is young, rich, and fond of pleaſure. Yet, among all its gaieties, I felt that ſomething was wanting to my heart: I grew ſick of diſſipation; I diſcovered that the people among whom I lived, and whoſe exterior was ſo poliſhed and ſeducing, were at bottom frivolous, unfeeling, and inſincere. I turned from the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Paris with diſguſt, and quitted that theatre of luxury without heaving one ſigh of regret.</p>
                        <p>I now bent my courſe towards Germany, intending to viſit moſt of the principal courts. Prior to this expedition, I meant to make ſome little ſtay at Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg. On quitting my chaiſe at Luneville, to take ſome refreſhment, I obſerved a ſplendid equipage, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by four domeſtics in rich liveries, waiting at the door of the Silver Lion. Soon after, as I looked out of the window, I ſaw a lady of noble preſence, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by two female attendants, ſtep into the carriage, which drove off immediately.</p>
                        <p>I inquired of the hoſt who the lady was that had juſt departed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="112" facs="unknown:035729_0110_100658BDA66C51A8"/>
"A German baroneſs, monſieur, of great rank and fortune; ſhe has been upon a viſit to the ducheſs of Longueville, as her ſervants informed me. She is going to Straſbourg, where ſhe will find her huſband, and then both return to their caſtle in Germany."</p>
                        <p>I reſumed my journey, intending to reach Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg that night. My hopes, however, were fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by the breaking down of my chaiſe: the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident happened in the middle of a thick foreſt, and I was not a little embarraſſed as to the means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. It was the depth of winter: the night was already cloſing round us; and Straſbourg, which was the neareſt town, was ſtill diſtant from us ſeveral leagues. It ſeemed to me that my only alternative to paſſing the night in the foreſt, was to take my ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's horſe and ride on to Straſbourg; an undertaking at that ſeaſon very far from agreeable. However, ſeeing no other reſource, I was obliged to make up my mind to it; accordingly, I communicated my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to the poſtillion, telling him that I would ſend people to aſſiſt him as ſoon as I reached Straſbourg. I had not much confidence in his honeſty; but Steph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano being well armed, and the driver, to all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, conſiderably advanced in years, I believed I ran no riſk of loſing my baggage.</p>
                        <p>Luckily, as I then thought, an opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf of paſſing the night more agreeably than I expected. On mentioning my deſign of proceeding by myſelf to Straſbourg, the poſtillion ſhook his head in diſapprobation.</p>
                        <p>"It is a long way," ſaid he; "you will find it a difficult matter to arrive there without a guide: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,

                        <p>"Paſſing the night in the foreſt!" he replied. "Oh, by St. Denis! we are not in quite ſo bad a plight as that comes to yet.

                        <p>"Abſurd! Come, come; ſay no more, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us without delay to the woodman's cottage."</p>
                        <p>He obeyed, and we moved onwards: the horſes contrived, with ſome difficulty, to drag the ſhattered vehicle after us. My ſervant was become almoſt ſpeechleſs, and I began to feel the effects of the cold
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:035729_0112_100658C175D55388"/>
myſelf before we reached the wiſhed for cottage. It was a ſmall but neat building: as we drew near it I rejoiced at obſerving through the window the blaze of a comfortable fire. Our conductor knocked at the door: it was ſome time before any one anſwered; the people within ſeemed in doubt whether we ſhould be admitted.</p>
                        <p>"Come, come, friend Baptiſte!" cried the driver with impatience, "what are you about? Are you aſleep? Or will you refuſe a night's lodging to a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whoſe chaiſe has juſt broken down in the foreſt?"</p>
                        <p>"Ah! is it you, honeſt Claude?" replied a man's voice from within: "wait a moment, and the door ſhall be opened."</p>
                        <p>Soon after the bolts were drawn back; the door was uncloſed, and a man preſented himſelf to us with a lamp in his hand: he gave the guide an hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and then addreſſed himſelf to me:</p>
                        <p>"Walk in, monſieur; walk in, and welcome. Excuſe me for not admitting you at firſt; but there are ſo many rogues about this place, that ſaving your preſence, I ſuſpected you to be one."</p>
                        <p>Thus ſaying, he uſhered me into the room where I had obſerved the fire. I was immediately placed in an eaſy chair, which ſtood cloſe to the hearth. A female, whom I ſuppoſed to be the wife of my hoſt, roſe from her ſeat upon my entrance, and received me with a ſlight and diſtant reverence. She made no anſwer to my compliment, but, immediately reſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf, continued the work on which ſhe had
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:035729_0113_10065888B2B22A28"/>
been employed. Her huſband's manners were as friendly as hers were harſh and repulſive.</p>
                        <p>"I wiſh I could lodge you more conveniently, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur," ſaid he, "but we cannot boaſt of much ſpare room in this hovel. However, a chamber for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and another for your ſervant, I think, we can make ſhift to ſupply. You muſt content yourſelf with ſorry fare; but to what we have, believe me, you are heartily welcome."—Then turning to his wife—"Why how you ſit there, Marguerite, with as much tranquillity as if you had nothing better to do! ſtir about, dame! ſtir about! Get ſome ſupper; look out ſome ſheets. Here, here! throw ſome logs upon the fire for the gentleman ſeems periſhed with cold."</p>
                        <p>The wife threw her work haſtily upon the table, and proceeded to execute his commands with every mark of unwillingneſs. Her countenance had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed me on the firſt moment of my examining it: yet upon the whole, her features were handſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably; but her ſkin was ſallow, and her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thin and meagre a lowering gloom overſpread her countenance, and it bore ſuch viſible marks of rancour and ill will, as could not eſcape being noticed by the moſt inattentive obſerver; her every look and action expreſſed diſcontent and impatience; and the anſwers which ſhe gave Baptiſte, when he reproached her good-humouredly for her diſſatisfied air, were tart, ſhort, and cutting. In fine, I conceived at firſt ſight equal diſguſt for her, and prepoſſeſſion in favour of her huſband, whoſe appearance was calculated to inſpire eſteem and confidence. His countenance was open,
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035729_0114_100658C301DAC6F8"/>
ſincere, and friendly; his manners had all the peaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's honeſty, unaccompanied by his rudeneſs: his cheeks were broad, full and ruddy; and in the ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of his perſon he ſeemed to offer an ample apology for the leanneſs of his wife's. From the wrinkles on his brow, I judged him to be turned of ſixty; but he bore his years well, and ſeemed ſtill hearty and ſtrong. The wife could not be more than thirty, but in ſpirits and vivacity ſhe was infinitely older than the huſband.</p>
                        <p>However, in ſpite of her unwillingneſs, Margue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite began to prepare the ſupper, while the woodman converſed gaily on different ſubjects. The poſtillion, who had been furniſhed with a bottle of ſpirits, was now ready to ſet out for Straſbourg, and inquired whether I had any further commands.</p>
                        <p>"For Straſbourg?" interrupted Baptiſte; "you are not going thither to-night?"</p>
                        <p>"I beg your pardon: if I do not fetch workmen to mend the chaiſe, how is monſieur to proceed to-morrow?"</p>
                        <p>"That is true, as you ſay, I had forgot the chaiſe. Well, but, Claude, you may at leaſt eat your ſupper here? That can make you loſe very little time; and monſieur looks too kind hearted to ſend you out with an empty ſtomach on ſuch a bitter cold night as this is."</p>
                        <p>To this I readily aſſented, telling the poſtillion that my reaching Straſbourg the next day an hour or two later would be perfectly immaterial. He thanked me, and then, leaving the cottage with Stephano, put up
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035729_0115_1006588A39C96D30"/>
his horſes in the woodman's ſtable. Baptiſte followed them to the door, and looked out with anxiety.</p>
                        <p>"'Tis a ſharp, biting wind," ſaid he: "I wonder what detains my boys ſo long! Monſieur, I ſhall ſhew you two of the fineſt la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

Would they were back again! I begin to feel uneaſy about them."</p>
                        <p>Marguerite was at this time employed in laying the cloth.</p>
                        <p>"And are you equally anxious for the return of your ſons?" ſaid I to her.</p>
                        <p>"Not I," ſhe replied peeviſhly; "they are no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of mine."</p>
                        <p>"Come, come, Marguerite!" ſaid the huſband, "do not be out of humour with the gentleman for aſking a ſimple queſtion: had you not looked ſo croſs, he would never have thought you old enough to have a ſon of three and twenty; but you ſee how many years ill temper adds to you!—Excuſe my wife's rudeneſs, monſieur; a little thing puts her out; and ſhe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diſpleaſed at your not thinking her under thirty. That is the truth, is it not, Marguerite? You know, monſieur, that age is always a tickliſh ſubject with a woman. Come, come, Marguerite! clear up a little. If you have not ſons as old, you will ſome twenty years hence; and I hope that we ſhall live to ſee them juſt ſuch lads as Jacques and Robert."</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="118" facs="unknown:035729_0116_100658CA4A8F1060"/>
Marguerite claſped her hands together paſſionately.</p>
                        <p>"God forbid!" ſaid ſhe, "God forbid! If I thought it, I would ſtrangle them with my own hands."</p>
                        <p>She quitted the room haſtily, and went up ſtairs.</p>
                        <p>I could not help expreſſing to the woodman how much I pitied him for being chained for life to a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſuch ill humour.</p>
                        <p>"Ah, Lord! monſieur, every one has his ſhare of grievances, and Marguerite has fallen to mine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, after all, ſhe is only croſs, and not malicious: the worſt is, that her affection for two children by a former huſband makes her play the ſtep mother with my two ſons; ſhe cannot bear the ſight of them; and, by her good will, they would never ſet a foot within my door. But on this point I always ſtand firm, and never will conſent to abandon the poor lads to the world's mercy, as ſhe has often ſolicited me to do. In every thing elſe I let her have her own way; and truly ſhe manages a family rarely, that I muſt ſay for her."</p>
                        <p>We were converſing in this manner, when our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was interrupted by a loud halloo, which rang through the foreſt.</p>
                        <p>"My ſons, I hope!" exclaimed the woodman, and ran to open the door.</p>
                        <p>The halloo was repeated. We now diſtinguiſhed the trampling of horſes; and, ſoon after, a carriage attended by ſeveral cavaliers ſtopped at the cottage door. One of the horſemen inquired how far they were ſtill from Straſbourg. As he addreſſed himſelf
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:035729_0117_1006588E1837D828"/>
to me, I anſwered in the number of miles which Claude had told me; upon which a volley of curſes was vented againſt the drivers for having loſt their way. The perſons in the coach were now informed of the diſtance of Straſbourg; and alſo that the horſes were ſo fatigued as to be incapable of proceeding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A lady who appeared to be the principal, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed much chagrin at this intelligence; but as there was no remedy, one of the attendants aſked the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whether he could furniſh them with lodging for the night.</p>
                        <p>He ſeemed much embarraſſed, and replied in the negative; adding, that a Spaniſh gentleman and his ſervant were already in poſſeſſion of the only ſpare apartments in his houſe. On hearing this, the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry of my nation would not permit me to retain thoſe accommodations of which a female was in want. I inſtantly ſignified to the woodman that I transferred my right to the lady: he made ſome objections, but I overruled them, and haſtening to the carriage, opened the door, and aſſiſted the lady to deſcend. I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately recogniſed her for the ſame perſon whom I had ſeen at the inn at Luneville. I took an opportunity of aſking one of her attendants what was her name?</p>
                        <p>"The baroneſs Lindenberg," was the anſwer.</p>
                        <p>I could not but remark how different a reception our hoſt had given theſe new comers and myſelf. His reluctance to admit them was viſibly expreſſed on his countenance; and he prevailed on himſelf with difficulty to tell the lady that ſhe was welcome. I conducted her into the houſe, and placed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="120" facs="unknown:035729_0118_100658C4C7AE0C98"/>
me very graciouſly, and made a thouſand apologies for putting me to an inconvenience. Suddenly the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's countenance cleared up.</p>
                        <p>"A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"I can lodge you and your ſuite, madam, and you will not be under the neceſſity of making this gentleman ſuffer for his politeneſs. We have two ſpare chambers, one for the lady, the other, monſieur, for you: my wife ſhall give up hers to the two waiting women: as for the men ſervants, they muſt content themſelves with paſſing the night in and ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>After ſeveral expreſſions of gratitude on the lady's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, and oppoſition on mine to Marguerite's giving up her bed, this arrangement was agreed to. As the room was ſmall, the baroneſs immediately diſmiſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> male domeſtics. Baptiſte was on the point of conducting them to the barn which he had mentioned, when two young men appeared at the door of the cottage.</p>
                        <p>"Hell and furies!" exclaimed the firſt, ſtarting back, "Robert the houſe is filled with ſtrangers!"</p>
                        <p>"Ha! there are my ſons!" cried our hoſt. "Why, Jacques! Robert! whither are you running boys? There is room enough ſtill for you."</p>
                        <p>Upon this aſſurance the youths returned. The father preſented them to the baroneſs and myſelf; after which he withdrew with our domeſtics, while, at the requeſt of the two waiting women, Margue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035729_0119_1006588F9F426D18"/>
conducted them to the room deſigned for their miſtreſs.</p>
                        <p>The two new comers were tall, ſtout, well made young men, hard featured, and very much ſun burnt. They paid their compliments to us in few words, and acknowledged Claude, who now entered the room, as an old acquaintance. They then threw aſide their cloaks in which they were wrapped up, took off a leathern belt, to which a large cutlaſs was ſuſpended, and each drawing a brace of piſtols from his girdle laid them upon a ſhelf.</p>
                        <p>"You travel well armed," ſaid I.</p>
                        <p>"True, monſieur," replied Robert. "We left Straſbourg late this evening, and 'tis neceſſary to take precautions at paſſing through this foreſt after dark; it does not bear a good repute, I promiſe you."</p>
                        <p>"How?" ſaid the baroneſs, "are there robbers hereabout?"</p>
                        <p>"So it is ſaid, madame: for my own part, I have travelled through the wood at all hours, and never met with one of them."</p>
                        <p>Here Marguerite returned. Her ſtep ſons drew her to the other end of the room, and whiſpered her for ſome minutes. By the looks which they caſt towards us at intervals, I conjectured them to be inquiring our buſineſs in the cottage.</p>
                        <p>In the mean while, the baroneſs expreſſed her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions that her huſband would be ſuffering much anxiety upon her account. She had intended to ſend on one of her ſervants to inform the baron of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay;
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:035729_0120_100658C64E4A37E8"/>
but the account which the young men gave of the foreſt rendered this plan impracticable. Claude relieved her from her embarraſſment: he informed her, that he was under the neceſſity of reaching Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg that night; and that, would ſhe truſt him with a letter, ſhe might depend upon its being ſafely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</p>
                        <p>"And how comes it," ſaid I, "that you are under no apprehenſion of meeting theſe robbers?"</p>
                        <p>"Alas! monſieur, a poor man with a large family muſt not loſe certain profit becauſe 'tis attended with a little danger; and perhaps my lord the baron may give me a trifle for my pains; beſides, I have noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to loſe except my life, and that will not be worth the robbers taking."</p>
                        <p>I thought his arguments bad, and adviſed his waiting till the morning; but, as the baroneſs did not ſecond me, I was obliged to give up the point. The baroneſs Lindenberg, as I found afterwards, had long been accuſtomed to ſacrifice the intereſts of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to her own, and her wiſh to ſend Claude to Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg blinded her to the danger of the undertaking. Accordingly, it was reſolved that he ſhould ſet out without delay. The baroneſs wrote her letter to her huſband; and I ſent a few lines to my banker, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing him that I ſhould not be at Straſbourg till the next day. Claude took our letters, and left the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                        <p>The lady declared herſelf much fatigued by her journey: beſides having come from ſome diſtance, the drivers had contrived to loſe their way in the foreſt. She now addreſſed herſelf to Marguerite, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:035729_0121_1006589127814030"/>
to be ſhewn to her chamber, and permitted to take half an hour's repoſe. One of the waiting women was immediately ſummoned; ſhe appeared with a light, and the baroneſs followed her up ſtairs. The cloth was ſpreading in the chamber where I was, and Marguerite ſoon gave me to underſtand that I was in her way. Her hints were too broad to be eaſily miſtaken; I therefore deſired one of the young men to conduct me to the chamber where I was to ſleep, and where I could remain till ſupper was ready.</p>
                        <p>"Which chamber is it, mother?" ſaid Robert.</p>
                        <p>"The one with green hangings," ſhe replied. "I have juſt been at the trouble of getting it ready, and have put freſh ſheets upon the bed: if the gentleman chooſes to lollop and lounge upon it, he may make it again himſelf, for me."</p>
                        <p>"You are out of humour, mother; but that is no novelty. Have the goodneſs to follow me, monſieur."</p>
                        <p>He opened the door, and advanced towards a narrow ſtaircaſe.</p>
                        <p>"You have got no light," ſaid Marguerite; "is it your own neck, or the gentleman's that you have a mind to break?"</p>
                        <p>She croſſed by me, and put a candle into Robert's hand; having received which, he began to aſcend the ſtaircaſe. Jacques was employed in laying the cloth, and his back was turned towards me. Marguerite ſeized the moment when we were unobſerved: ſhe caught my hand, and preſſed it ſtrongly.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="124" facs="unknown:035729_0122_1006589813C45D20"/>
"Look at the ſheets!" ſaid ſhe as ſhe paſſed me, and immediately reſumed her former occupation.</p>
                        <p>Startled by the abruptneſs of her action, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained as if petrified. Robert's voice deſiring me to follow him recalled me to myſelf. I aſcended the ſtaircaiſe. My conductor uſhered me into a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where an excellent wood fire was blazing upon the hearth. He placed the light upon the table, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired whether I had any further commands, and, on my replying in the negative, left me to myſelf. You may be certain, that the moment when I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone was that on which I complied with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerite's injunction. I took the candle haſtily, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the bed, and turned down the coverture. What was my aſtoniſhment, my horror, at finding the ſheets crimſoned with blood!</p>
                        <p>At that moment a thouſand confuſed ideas paſſed before my imagination. The robbers who infeſted the wood, Marguerite's exclamation reſpecting her children, the arms and appearance of the two young men, and the various anecdotes which I had heard related reſpecting the ſecret correſpondence which frequently exiſts between banditti and poſtillions; all theſe circumſtances flaſhed upon my mind, and inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with doubt and apprehenſion. I ruminated on the moſt probable means of aſcertaining the truth of my conjectures. Suddenly I was aware of ſome one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, pacing haſtily backwards and forwards. Every thing now appeared to me an object of ſuſpicion. With precaution I drew near the window, which, as the room had been long ſhut up, was left open in ſpite of the cold. I ventured to look out.
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035729_0123_10065892B37A4C88"/>
The beams of the moon permitted me to diſtinguiſh a man, whom I had no difficulty to recogniſe for my hoſt. I watched his movements. He walked ſwiftly, then ſtopped and ſeemed to liſten: he ſtamped upon the ground, and beat his ſtomach with his arms, as if to guard himſelf from the inclemency of the ſeaſon: at the leaſt noiſe, if a voice was heard in the lower part of the houſe, if a bat flitted paſt him, or the wind rattled amidſt the leafleſs boughs, he ſtarted, and looked round with anxiety.</p>
                        <p>"Plague take him!" ſaid he at length with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme impatience; "what can he be about?"</p>
                        <p>He ſpoke in a low voice; but as he was juſt below my window, I had no difficulty to diſtinguiſh his words.</p>
                        <p>I now heard the ſteps of one approaching. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſte went towards the ſound; he joined a man, whom his low ſtature and the horn ſuſpended from his neck declared to be no other than my faithful Claude, whom I had ſuppoſed to be already on his way to Straſbourg. Expecting their diſcourſe to throw ſome light upon my ſituation, I haſtened to put myſelf in a condition to hear it with ſafety. For this purpoſe I extinguiſhed the candle, which ſtood upon a table near the bed: the flame of the fire was not ſtrong enough to betray me, and I immediately reſumed my place at the window.</p>
                        <p>The objects of my curioſity had ſtationed themſelves directly under it. I ſuppoſe that, during my momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary abſence, the woodman had been blaming Claude for tardineſs, ſince when I returned to the window the latter was endeavouring to excuſe his fault.</p>
                        <p>

"However," added he, "my diligence at preſent ſhall make up for my paſt delay."</p>
                        <p>"On that condition," anſwered Baptiſte, "I ſhall readily forgive you: but in truth, as you ſhare equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us in our prizes, your own intereſt will make you uſe all poſſible diligence. 'Twould be a ſhame to let ſuch a noble booty eſcape us. You ſay that this Spaniard is rich?"</p>
                        <p>"His ſervant boaſted at the inn, that the effects in his chaiſe were worth above two thouſand piſtoles."</p>
                        <p>Oh! how I curſed Stephano's imprudent vanity!</p>
                        <p>"And I have been told," continued the poſtillion, "that this baroneſs carries about her a caſket of jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of immenſe value."</p>
                        <p>"May be ſo, but I had rather ſhe had ſtayed away. The Spaniard was a ſecure prey; the boys and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could eaſily have maſtered him and his ſervant, and then the two thouſand piſtoles would have been ſhared between us four. Now we muſt let in the band for a ſhare, and perhaps the whole covey may eſcape us. Should our friends have betaken themſelves to their different poſts before you reach the cavern, all will be loſt. The lady's attendants are too numerous for us to overpower them. Unleſs our aſſociates arrive in time, we muſt needs let theſe travellers ſet out to-morrow without damage or hurt.</p>
                        <p>"'Tis plaguy unlucky that my comrades who drove the coach ſhould be thoſe unacquainted with our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy! But never fear, friend Baptiſte: an hour will bring me to the cavern; it is now but ten

o'clock, and by twelve you may expect the arrival of the band. By the bye, take care of your wife; you know how ſtrong is her repugnance to our mode of life, and ſhe may find means to give information to the lady's ſervants of our deſign."</p>
                        <p>"Oh! I am ſecure of her ſilence; ſhe is too much afraid of me, and fond of her children, to dare to betray my ſecret. Beſides, Jacques and Robert keep a ſtrict eye over her, and ſhe is not permitted to ſet a foot out of the cottage. The ſervants are ſafely lodged in the barn. I ſhall endeavour to keep all quiet till the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of our friends.

                        <p>"And ſuppoſe either of the travellers ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover your deſign?"</p>
                        <p>"Then we muſt poignard thoſe in our power, and take our chance about maſtering the reſt. However, to avoid running ſuch a riſk, haſten to the cavern; the banditti never leave it before eleven, and if you uſe diligence you may reach it in time to ſtop them."</p>
                        <p>"Tell Robert that I have taken his horſe; my own has broken his bridle, and eſcaped into the wood. What is the watch word?"</p>
                        <p>"The reward of courage."</p>
                        <p>"'Tis ſufficient. I haſten to the cavern."</p>
                        <p>"And I to rejoin my gueſts, leſt my abſence ſhould create ſuſpicion. Farewell, and be diligent."</p>

Theſe worthy aſſociates now ſeparated; the one bent his courſe towards the ſtable, while the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the houſe.</p>
                        <p>You may judge what muſt have been my feelings during this converſation, of which I loſt not a ſingle ſyllable. I dared not truſt myſelf to my reflections, nor did any means preſent itſelf to eſcape the dangers which threatened me. Reſiſtance I knew to be vain; I was unarmed, and a ſingle man againſt three. However, I reſolved at leaſt to ſell my life as dearly as I could. Dreading leſt Baptiſte ſhould perceive my abſence, and ſuſpect me to have overheard the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage with which Claude was diſpatched, I haſtily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted my candle and quitted the chamber. On de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, I found the table ſpread for ſix perſons. The baroneſs ſat by the fire ſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>; Marguerite was employed in dreſſing a ſallad, and her ſtep ſons were whiſpering together at the further end of the room. Baptiſte, having the round of the garden to make ere he could reach the cottage door, was not yet arrived. I ſeated myſelf quietly oppoſite to the baroneſs.</p>
                        <p>A glance upon Marguerite told her that her hint had not been thrown away upon me. How different did ſhe now appear to me! What before ſeemed gloom and ſullenneſs, I now found to be diſguſt at her aſſociates and compaſſion for my danger. I looked up to her as to my only reſource; yet knowing her to be watched by her huſband with a ſuſpicious eye, I could place but little reliance on the exertions of her good will.</p>
                        <p>In ſpite of all my endeavours to conceal it, my agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was but too viſibly expreſſed upon my counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:035729_0127_10065899B6960F60"/>
I was pale, and both my words and actions were diſordered and embarraſſed. The young men obſerved this, and inquired the cauſe. I attributed it to exceſs of fatigue, and the violent effect produced on me by the ſeverity of the ſeaſon. Whether they believed me or not, I will not pretend to ſay; they at leaſt ceaſed to embarraſs me with their queſtions. I ſtrove to divert my attention from the perils which ſurrounded me, by converſing on different ſubjects with the baroneſs. I talked of Germany, declaring my intention of viſiting it immediately: God knows that I little thought at that moment of ever ſeeing it! She replied to me with great eaſe and politeneſs, profeſſed that the pleaſure of making my acquaintance amply compenſated for the delay in her journey, and gave me a preſſing invitation to make ſome ſtay at the caſtle of Lindenberg. As ſhe ſpoke thus, the youths exchanged a malicious ſmile, which declared that ſhe would be fortunate if ſhe ever reached that caſtle her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This action did not eſcape me; but I conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the emotion which it excited in my breaſt. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to converſe with the lady; but my diſcourſe was ſo frequently incoherent that, as ſhe has ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, ſhe began to doubt whether I was in my right ſenſes. The fact was, that while my converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion turned upon one ſubject, my thoughts were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely occupied by another. I meditated upon the means of quitting the cottage, finding my way to the barn, and giving the domeſtics information of our hoſt's deſigns. I was ſoon convinced how imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable was the attempt. Jacques and Robert watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my every movement with an attentive eye, and I was obliged to abandon the idea. All my hopes now
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:035729_0128_100658D2AADBF450"/>
reſted upon Claude's not finding the banditti. In that caſe, according to what I had overheard, we ſhould be permitted to depart unhurt.</p>
                        <p>I ſhuddered involuntarily as Baptiſte entered the room. He made many apologies for his long abſence, "but he had been detained by affairs impoſſible to be delayed." He then entreated permiſſion for his family to ſup at the ſame table with us, without which, reſpect would not authorize his taking ſuch a liberty. Oh! how in my heart I curſed the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite! how I loathed his preſence, who was on the point of depriving me of an exiſtence, at that time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely dear! I had every reaſon to be ſatisfied with life; I had youth, wealth, rank, and education, and the faireſt proſpects preſented themſelves before me. I ſaw thoſe proſpects on the point of cloſing in the moſt horrible manner: yet was I obliged to diſſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulate, and to receive with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>The permiſſion which our hoſt demanded was eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained. We ſeated ourſelves at table. The baroneſs and myſelf occupied one ſide; the ſons were oppoſite to us, with their backs to the door. Baptiſte took his ſeat by the baroneſs, at the upper end; and the place next to him was left for his wife. She ſoon entered the room, and placed before us a plain but comfortable peaſant's repaſt. Our hoſt thought it neceſſary to apologize for the poorneſs of the ſupper: "he had not been apprized of our coming; he could only offer us ſuch fare as had been intended for his own family."</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="131" facs="unknown:035729_0129_1006589B44791C70"/>
"But," added he, "ſhould any accident detain my noble gueſts longer than they at preſent intend, I hope to give them better treatment."</p>
                        <p>The villain! I well knew the accident to which he alluded. I ſhuddered at the treatment which he taught us to expect.</p>
                        <p>My companion in danger ſeemed entirely to have got rid of her chagrin at being delayed. She laughed, and converſed with the family with infinite gaiety. I ſtrove, but in vain, to follow her example. My ſpirits were evidently forced, and the conſtraint which I put upon myſelf eſcaped not Baptiſte's obſervation.</p>
                        <p>"Come, come, monſieur, cheer up!" ſaid he, "you ſeem not quite recovered from your fatigue. To raiſe your ſpirits, what ſay you to a glaſs of excellent old wine which was left me by my father? God reſt his ſoul, he is in a better world! I ſeldom produce this wine; but as I am not honoured with ſuch gueſts every day, this is an occaſion which deſerves a bottle."</p>
                        <p>He then gave his wife a key, and inſtructed her where to find the wine of which he ſpoke. She ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by no means pleaſed with the commiſſion; ſhe took the key with an embarraſſed air, and heſitated to quit the table.</p>
                        <p>"Did you hear me?" ſaid Baptiſte, in an angry tone.</p>
                        <p>Marguerite darted upon him a look of mingled an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and fear, and left the chamber. His eyes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſuſpiciouſly till ſhe had cloſed the door.</p>
                        <p>She ſoon returned with a bottle ſealed with yellow wax. She placed it upon the table, and gave the key
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035729_0130_100658D00436FEA8"/>
back to her huſband. I ſuſpected that this liquor was not preſented to us without deſign, and I watched Marguerite's movements with inquietude. She was employed in rinſing ſome ſmall horn goblets. As ſhe placed them before Baptiſte, ſhe ſaw that my eye was fixed upon her; and at the moment when ſhe thought herſelf unobſerved by the banditti, ſhe motioned to me with her head not to taſte the liquor. She then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed her place.</p>
                        <p>In he mean while our hoſt had drawn the cork, and filling two of the goblets offered them to the lady and myſelf. She at firſt made ſome objections; but the inſtances of Baptiſte were ſo urgent, that ſhe was obliged to comply. Fearing to excite ſuſpicion, I heſitated not to take the goblet preſented to me. By its ſmell and colour, I gueſſed it to be champaign; but ſome grains of powder floating upon the top con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me that it was not unadulterated. However, I dared not expreſs my repugnance to drinking it; I lifted it to my lips, and ſeemed to be ſwallowing it: ſuddenly ſtarting from my chair, I made the beſt of my way towards a vaſe of water at ſome diſtance, in which Marguerite had been rinſing the goblets. I pretended to ſpit out the wine with diſguſt, and took an opportunity, unperceived, of emptying the liquor into the vaſe.</p>
                        <p>The banditti ſeemed alarmed at my action. Jac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques half roſe from his chair, put his hand into his boſom, and I diſcovered the haft of a dagger. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to my ſeat with tranquillity, and affected not to have obſerved their confuſion.</p>
                        <p>"You have not ſuited my taſte, honeſt friend,"
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:035729_0131_1006589F255017F0"/>
ſaid I, addreſſing myſelf to Baptiſte: "I never can drink champaign without its producing a violent ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I ſwallowed a few mouthfuls ere I was aware of its quality, and fear that I ſhall ſuffer for my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence."</p>
                        <p>Baptiſte and Jacques exchanged looks of diſtruſt.</p>
                        <p>"Perhaps," ſaid Robert, "the ſmell may be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to you?"</p>
                        <p>He quitted his chair and removed the goblet. I obſerved that he examined whether it was nearly empty.</p>
                        <p>"He muſt have drank ſufficient," ſaid he to his brother in a low voice, while he reſeated himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Marguerite looked apprehenſive that I had taſted the liquor. A glance from my eye reaſſured her.</p>
                        <p>I waited with anxiety for the effects which the beverage would produce upon the lady. I doubted not but the grains which I had obſerved were poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and lamented that it had been impoſſible for me to warn her of the danger. But a few minutes had elapſed, before I perceived her eyes grow heavy: her head ſunk upon her ſhoulder, and ſhe fell into a deep ſleep. I affected not to attend to this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and continued my converſation with Baptiſte, with all the outward gaiety in my power to aſſume. But he no longer anſwered me without conſtraint. He eyed me with diſtruſt and aſtoniſhment, and I ſaw that the banditti were frequently whiſpering among themſelves. My ſituation became every moment more painful: I ſuſtained the character of confidence with
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:035729_0132_100658D43237DD90"/>
a worſe grace than ever. Equally afraid of the arrival of their accomplices, and of their ſuſpecting my knowledge of their deſigns, I knew not how to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the diſtruſt which the banditti evidently entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me. In this new dilemma the friendly Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerite again aſſiſted me. She paſſed behind the chairs of her ſtep ſons, ſtopped for a moment oppoſite to me, cloſed her eyes, and reclined her head upon her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This hint immediately diſpelled my incertitude. It told me, that I ought to imitate the baroneſs, and pretend that the liquor had taken its full effect upon me. I did ſo, and in a few minutes ſeemed perfectly overcome with ſlumber.</p>
                        <p>"So!" cried Baptiſte, as I fell back in my chair, "at laſt he ſleeps! I began to think that he had ſcent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our deſign, and that we ſhould have been forced to diſpatch him at all events."</p>
                        <p>"And why not diſpatch him at all events?" inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ferocious Jacques, "why leave him the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of betraying our ſecret? Marguerite give me one of my piſtols: a ſingle touch of the trigger will finiſh him at once."</p>
                        <p>"And ſuppoſing," rejoined the father, "ſuppoſing that our friends ſhould not arrive to-night, a pretty figure we ſhould make when the ſervants inquire for him in the morning! No, no, Jacques; we muſt wait for our aſſociates. If they join us, we are ſtrong enough to diſpatch the domeſtic as well as their maſters, and the booty is our own. If Claude does not find the troop, we muſt take patience, and ſuffer the prey to ſlip through our fingers. Ah! boys, boys, had you arrived but five minutes ſooner, the Spaniard
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:035729_0133_100658A0AB0BCE50"/>
would have been done for, and two thouſand piſtoles our own. But you are always out of the way when you are moſt wanted. You are the moſt unlucky rogues—"</p>
                        <p>"Well, well, father!" anſwered Jacques; "had you been of my mind, all would have been over by this time. You, Robert, Claude, and myſelf—why the ſtrangers were but double the number, and I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you we might have maſtered them. However, Claude is gone; 'tis too late to think of it now. We muſt wait patiently for the arrival of the gang; and, if the travellers eſcape us to-night, we muſt take care to waylay them to-morrow."</p>
                        <p>"True! true!" ſaid Baptiſte, "Marguerite, have you given the ſleeping draught to the waiting women?"</p>
                        <p>She replied in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>"All then is ſafe. Come, come, boys; whatever falls out, we have no reaſon to complain of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. We run no danger, may gain much, and can loſe nothing."</p>
                        <p>At this moment I heard a trampling of horſes. Oh! how dreadful was the ſound to my ears! A cold ſweat flowed down my forehead, and I felt all the terrors of impending death. I was by no means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſured by hearing the compaſſionate Marguerite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, in the accents of deſpair, "Almighty God! they are loſt."</p>
                        <p>Luckily the woodman and his ſons were too much occupied by the arrival of their aſſociates to attend to
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:035729_0134_100658D5BA449488"/>
me, or the violence of my agitation would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them my ſleep was feigned.</p>
                        <p>"Open! open!" exclaimed ſeveral voices on the outſide of the cottage.</p>
                        <p>"Yes! yes!" cried Baptiſte joyfully; "they are our friends, ſure enough. Now then our booty is certain. Away! lads, away! Lead them to the barn; you know what is to be done there."</p>
                        <p>Robert haſtened to open the door of the cottage.</p>
                        <p>"But firſt," ſaid Jacques, taking up his arms, firſt let me diſpatch theſe ſleepers."</p>
                        <p>"No, no, no!" replied his father: "Go you to the barn, where your preſence is wanted. Leave me to take care of theſe and the women above."</p>
                        <p>Jacques obeyed, and followed his brother. They ſeemed to converſe with the new comers for a few minutes; after which I heard the robbers diſmount, and, as I conjectured, bend their courſe towards the barn.</p>
                        <p>"So! that is wiſely done!" muttered Baptiſte; "they have quitted their horſes, that they may fall upon the ſtrangers by ſurpriſe. Good! good! and now to buſineſs."</p>
                        <p>I heard him approach a ſmall cupboard which was fixed up in a diſtant part of the room, and unlock it. At this moment I felt myſelf ſhaken gently.</p>
                        <p>"Now! now!" whiſpered Marguerite. I opened my eyes. Baptiſte ſtood with his back towards me.
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:035729_0135_100658A3F303EFC0"/>
No one elſe was in the room ſave Marguerite and the ſleeping lady. The villain had taken a dagger from the cupboard, and ſeemed examining whether it was ſufficiently ſharp. I had neglected to furniſh myſelf with arms; but I perceived this to be my only chance of eſcaping, and reſolved not to loſe the opportunity. I ſprang from my ſeat, darted ſuddenly upon Baptiſte, and, claſping my hands round his throat, preſſed it ſo forcibly as to prevent his uttering a ſingle cry. You may remember that I was remarkable at Salamanca for the power of my arm. It now rendered me an eſſential ſervice. Surpriſed, terrified, and breathleſs, the villain was by no means an equal antagoniſt. I threw him upon the ground; I graſped him ſtill tighter; I fixed him without motion upon the floor, Marguerite, wreſting the dagger from his hand, plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it repeatedly in his heart till he expired.</p>
                        <p>No ſooner was this horrible but neceſſary act per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated, than Marguerite called on me to follow her.</p>
                        <p>"Flight is our only refuge," ſaid ſhe; "quick! quick! away!"</p>
                        <p>I heſitated not to obey her; but unwilling to leave the baroneſs a victim to the vengeance of the robbers, I raiſed her in my arms ſtill ſleeping, and haſtened after Marguerite. The horſes of the banditti were faſtened near the door. My conductreſs ſprang upon one of them. I followed her example, placed the baroneſs before me, and ſpurred on my horſe. Our only hope was to reach Straſbourg, which was much nearer than the perfidious Claude had aſſured me. Marguerite was well acquainted with the road, and gallopped on before me. We were obliged to paſs by the barn,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:035729_0136_100658A26B264F78"/>
where the robbers were ſlaughtering our domeſtics. The door was open: we diſtinguiſhed the ſhrieks of the dying, and imprecations of the murderers. What I felt at that moment language is unable to deſcribe.</p>
                        <p>Jacques heard the trampling of our horſes, as we ruſhed by the barn. He flew to the door with a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torch in his hand, and eaſily recogniſed the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
                        <p>"Betrayed! betrayed!" he ſhouted to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
                        <p>Inſtantly they left their bloody work, and haſtened to regain their horſes. We heard no more. I buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſpurs in the ſides of my courſer, and Marguerite goaded on hers with the poignard which had already rendered us ſuch good ſervice. We flew like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and gained the open plains. Already was Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg's ſteeple in ſight, when we heard the robbers purſuing us. Marguerite looked back, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed our followers deſcending a ſmall hill at no great diſtance. It was in vain that we urged on our horſes, the noiſe approached nearer with every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>"We are loſt!" ſhe exclaimed; "the villains gain upon us!"</p>
                        <p>"On, on!" replied I; "I hear the trampling of horſes coming from the town."</p>
                        <p>We redoubled our exertions, and were ſoon aware of a numerous band of cavaliers, who came towards us at full ſpeed. They were on the point of paſſing us.</p>

"Stay! ſtay! ſhrieked Marguerite; "ſave us! for God's ſake, ſave us!"</p>
                        <p>The foremoſt, who ſeemed to act as guide, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reined in his ſteed.</p>
                        <p>"'Tis ſhe! 'tis ſhe!" exclaimed he, ſpringing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground: "ſtop, my lord, ſtop! they are ſafe! 'tis my mother!"</p>
                        <p>At the ſame moment Marguerite threw herſelf from her horſe, claſped him in her arms, and covered him with kiſſes. The other cavaliers ſtopped at the exclamation.</p>
                        <p>"The baroneſs Lindenberg?" cried another of the ſtrangers eagerly: "Where is ſhe? Is ſhe not with you?"</p>
                        <p>He ſtopped on beholding her lying ſenſeleſs in my arms. Haſtily he caught her from me. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſleep in which ſhe was plunged, made him at firſt tremble for her life; but the beating of her heart ſoon reaſſured him.</p>
                        <p>"God be thanked!" ſaid he, "ſhe has eſcaped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt."</p>
                        <p>I interrupted his joy by pointing out the brigands, who continued to approach. No ſooner had I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned them, than the greateſt part of the company, which appeared to be chiefly compoſed of ſoldiers, haſtened forward to meet them. The villains ſtaid not to receive their attack. Perceiving their danger, they turned the heads of their horſes, and fled into the wood, whither they were followed by our preſervers. In the mean while the ſtranger, whom I gueſſed to be

                        <p>This was at the Auſtrian Eagle, where my banker, whom before my quitting Paris I had apprized of my intention to viſit Straſbourg, had prepared lodgings for me. I rejoiced at this circumſtance. It gave me an opportunity of cultivating the baron's acquaintance, which I foreſaw would be of uſe to me in Germany. Immediately upon our arrival, the lady was conveyed to bed. A phyſician was ſent for, who preſcribed a medicine likely to counteract the effects of the ſleepy potion; and after it had been poured down her throat, ſhe was committed to the care of the hoſteſs. The baron then addreſſed himſelf to me, and entreated me to recount the particulars of this adventure. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with his requeſt inſtantaneouſly; for, in pain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Stephano's fate, whom I had been compelled to abandon to the cruelty of the banditti, I found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to repoſe till I had ſome news of him. I received but too ſoon the intelligence that my truſty ſervant had periſhed. The ſoldiers who had purſued the brigands, returned while I was employed in relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my adventure to the baron. By their account, I found that the robbers had been overtaken.

the reſt of the gang might be ſeized, and, in ſhort, had betrayed every mark of cowardice and baſeneſs. By this means the whole of the band, conſiſting of near ſixty perſons, had been made priſoners, bound, and conducted to Straſbourg. Some of the ſoldiers haſtened to the cottage, one of the banditti ſerving them as guide. Their firſt viſit was to the fatal barn, where they were fortunate enough to find two of the baron's ſervants ſtill alive, though deſperately wounded. The reſt had expired beneath the ſwords of the robbers, and of theſe my unhappy Stephano was one.</p>
                        <p>Alarmed at our eſcape, the robbers, in their haſte to overtake us, had neglected to viſit the cottage; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, the ſoldiers found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>When the firſt burſt of maternal tenderneſs was over, I beſought her to declare by what means ſhe had been united to a man whoſe principles ſeemed ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diſcordant with her own.

                        <p>"Gentlemen 'ſaid ſhe, after a ſilence of ſome min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes, "I would requeſt a favour of you. You have
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:035729_0140_100658DB312F4B18"/>
a right to know on whom you confer an obligation; I will not, therefore, ſtifle a confeſſion which covers me with ſhame; but permit me to compriſe it in as few words as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>"I was born in Straſbourg, of reſpectable parents; their names I muſt at preſent conceal. My father ſtill lives, and deſerves not to be involved in my infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. If you grant my requeſt, you ſhall be informed of my family name. A villain made himſelf maſter of my affections, and to follow him I quitted my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's houſe. Yet, though my paſſions overpowered my virtue, I ſunk not into that degeneracy of vice but too commonly the lot of women who make the firſt falſe ſtep. I loved my ſeducer, dearly loved him! I was true to his bed: this baby, and the youth who warned you, my lord baron, of your lady's danger, are the pledges of our affection. Even at this moment I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his loſs, though 'tis to him that I owe all the miſeries of my exiſtence.</p>
                        <p>"He was of noble birth, but he had ſquandered away his paternal inheritance. His relations conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered him as a diſgrace to their name, and utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded him. His exceſſes drew upon him the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the police. He was obliged to fly from Straſbourg; and ſaw no other reſource from beggary than an union with the banditti who infeſted the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring foreſt, and whoſe troop was chiefly compoſed of young men of family in the ſame predicament with himſelf. I was determined not to forſake him. I followed him to the cavern of the brigands, and ſhared with him the miſery inſeparable from a life of pillage. But though I was aware that our exiſtence was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:035729_0141_100658AB14A3E3C8"/>
by plunder, I knew not all the horrible circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attached to my lover's profeſſion: theſe he concealed from me with the utmoſt care. He was conſcious that my ſentiments were not ſufficiently depraved to look without horror upon aſſaſſination. He ſuppoſed, and with juſtice, that I ſhould fly with deteſtation from the embraces of a murderer. Eight years of poſſeſſion had not abated his love for me: and he cautiouſly removed from my knowledge every circumſtance which might lead me to ſuſpect the crimes in which he but too often participated. He ſucceeded perfectly. It was not till after my ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer's death that I diſcovered his hands to have been ſtained with the blood of innocence.</p>
                        <p>"One fatal night he was brought back to the cav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, covered with wounds: he received them in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking an Engliſh traveller, whom his companions immediately ſacrificed to their reſentment. He had only time to entreat my pardon for all the ſorrows which he had cauſed me: he preſſed my hand to his lips, and expired. My grief was inexpreſſible. As ſoon as its violence abated, I reſolved to return to Straſbourg, to throw myſelf, with my two children, at my father's feet, and implore his forgiveneſs, though I little hoped to obtain it. What was my conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when informed, that no one entruſted with the ſecret of their retreat was ever permitted to quit the troop of the banditti; that I muſt give up all hopes of ever rejoining ſociety, and conſent inſtantly to accept one of their band for my huſband! My prayers and remonſtrances were vain. They caſt lots to decide to whoſe poſſeſſion I ſhould fall. I became the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the infamous Baptiſte. A robber, who had
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:035729_0142_100658DCB7BD12D0"/>
once been a monk, pronounced over us a burleſque rather than a religious ceremony: I and my children were delivered into the hands of my new huſband, and he conveyed us immediately to his home.</p>
                        <p>"He aſſured me that he had long entertained for me the moſt ardent regard; but that friendſhip for my deceaſed lover had obliged him to ſtifle his deſires. He endeavoured to reconcile me to my fate, and for ſome time treated me with reſpect and gentleneſs. At length, finding that my averſion rather increaſed than diminiſhed, he obtained thoſe favours by violence which I perſiſted to refuſe him. No reſource re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for me but to bear my ſorrows with patience: I was conſcious that I deſerved them but too well. Flight was forbidden. My children were in the power of Baptiſte; and he had ſworn, that if I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to eſcape, their lives ſhould pay for it. I had had too many opportunities of witneſſing the barbarity of his nature, to doubt his fulfilling his oath to the very letter. Sad experience had convinced me of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of my ſituation. My firſt lover had carefully concealed them from me; Baptiſte rather rejoiced in opening my eyes to the cruelties of his profeſſion, and ſtrove to familiarize me with blood and ſlaughter.</p>
                        <p>"My nature was licentious and warm, but not cruel: my conduct had been imprudent, but my heart was not unprincipled. Judge, then, what I muſt have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Judge how I muſt have griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at being united to a man, who received the unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting gueſt with an air of openneſs and hoſpitality, at the very moment that he meditated his deſtruction!
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:035729_0143_100658ACC7F3FED8"/>
Chagrin and diſcontent preyed upon my conſtitution; the few charms beſtowed on me by nature withered away, and the dejection of my countenance denoted the ſufferings of my heart. I was tempted a thouſand times to put an end to my exiſtence; but the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my children held my hand. I trembled to leave my dear boys in my tyrant's power, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled yet more for their virtue than their lives. The ſecond was ſtill too young to benefit by my inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but in the heart of my eldeſt I laboured unceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to plant thoſe principles which might enable him to avoid the crimes of his parents. He liſtened to me with docility, or rather with eagerneſs. Even at is early age, he ſhewed that he was not calculated for the ſociety of villains; and the only comfort which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed among my ſorrows, was to witneſs the dawning virtues of my Theodore.</p>
                        <p>"Such was my ſituation when the perfidy of Don Alphonſo's poſtillion conducted him to the cottage. His youth, air, and manners intereſted me moſt forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in his behalf. The abſence of my huſband's ſons gave me an opportunity which I had long wiſhed to find, and I reſolved to riſk every thing to preſerve the ſtranger. The vigilance of Baptiſte prevented me from warning Don Alphonſo of his danger. I knew that my betraying the ſecret would be immediately puniſhed with death; and however embittered was my life by calamities, I wanted courage to ſacrifice it for the ſake of preſerving that of another perſon. My only hope reſted upon procuring ſuccour from Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg. At this I reſolved to try; and ſhould an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offer of warning Don Alphonſo of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger unobſerved, I was determined to ſeize it with
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035729_0144_100658DE5EBD2400"/>
avidity. By Baptiſte's orders I went up ſtairs to make the ſtranger's bed: I ſpread upon it ſheets in which a traveller had been murdered but a few nights before, and which ſtill were ſtained with blood. I hoped that theſe marks would not eſcape the vigilance of our gueſt, and that he would collect from them the deſigns of my perfidious huſband. Neither was this the only ſtep which I took to preſerve the ſtranger. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore was confined to his bed by illneſs. I ſtole into his room unobſerved by my tyrant, communicated to him my project, and he entered into it with eagerneſs. He roſe in ſpite of his malady, and dreſſed himſelf with all ſpeed. I faſtened one of the ſheets round his arms, and lowered him from the window. He flew to the ſtable, took Claude's horſe, and haſtened to Straſbourg. Had he been accoſted by the banditti, he was to have declared himſelf ſent upon a meſſage by Baptiſte; but fortunately he reached the town with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting any obſtacle. Immediately upon his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at Straſbourg, he entreated aſſiſtance from the magiſtrate: his ſtory paſſed from mouth to mouth, and at length came to the knowledge of my lord the baron. Anxious for the ſafety of his lady, who he knew would be upon the road that evening, it ſtruck him that ſhe might have fallen into the power of the robbers. He accompanied Theodore, who guided the ſoldiers towards the cottage, and arrived juſt in time to ſave us from falling once more into the hands of our enemies."</p>
                        <p>Here I interrupted Marguerite to inquire why the ſleepy potion had been preſented to me. She ſaid that Baptiſte ſuppoſed me to have arms about me, and wiſhed to incapacitate me from making reſiſtance: it
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:035729_0145_100658B0989D29A8"/>
was a precaution which he always took, ſince, as the travellers had no hopes of eſcaping, deſpair would have incited them to ſell their lives dearly.</p>
                        <p>The Baron then deſired Marguerite to inform him what were her preſent plans. I joined him in declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my readineſs to ſhow my gratitude to her for the preſervation of my life.</p>
                        <p>"Diſguſted with the world," ſhe replied, "in which I have met nothing but misfortunes, my only wiſh is to retire into a convent. But firſt I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for my children. I find that my mother is no more—probably driven to an untimely grave by my deſertion. My father is ſtill living. He is not an hard man. Perhaps, gentlemen, in ſpite of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and imprudence, your interceſſions may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to forgive me, and to take charge of his unfortunate grand-ſons. If you obtain this boon for me, you will repay my ſervices a thouſand fold."</p>
                        <p>Both the baron and myſelf aſſured Marguerite, that we would ſpare no pains to obtain her pardon; and that, even ſhould her father be inflexible, ſhe need be under no apprehenſions reſpecting the fate of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. I engaged myſelf to provide for Theodore, and the baron promiſed to take the youngeſt under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. The grateful mother thanked us with tears for what ſhe called generoſity, but which in fact was no more than a proper ſenſe of our obligations to her. She then left the room to put her little boy to bed, whom fatigue and ſleep had completely overpowered.</p>
                        <p>The baroneſs, on recovering, and being informed from what dangers I had reſcued her, ſet no bounds
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:035729_0146_100658DFEB81AA30"/>
to the expreſſions of her gratitude. She was joined ſo warmly by her huſband in preſſing me to accompany them to their caſtle in Bavaria, that I found it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt their entreaties. During a week which we paſſed at Straſbourg, the intereſts of Marguerite were not forgotten. In our application to her father we ſucceeded as amply as we could wiſh. The good old man had loſt his wife. He had no children but this unfortunate daughter, of whom he had received no news for almoſt fourteen years. He was ſurrounded by diſtant relations, who waited with impatience for his deceaſe, in order to get poſſeſſion of his money. When therefore Marguerite appeared again ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly, he conſidered her as a gift from Heaven. He received her and her children with open arms, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon their eſtabliſhing themſelves in his houſe without delay. The diſappointed couſins were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give place. The old man would not hear of his daughter's retiring into a convent. He ſaid, that ſhe was too neceſſary to his happineſs, and ſhe was eaſily perſuaded to relinquiſh her deſigns. But no perſuaſions could induce Theodore to give up the plan which I had at firſt marked out for him. He had attached himſelf to me moſt ſincerely during my ſtay at Straſbourg; and when I was on the point of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he beſought me with tears to take him into my ſervice. He ſet forth all his little talents in the moſt favourable colours, and tried to convince me that I ſhould find him of infinite uſe to me upon the road. I was unwilling to charge myſelf with a lad ſcarcely turned of thirteen, who I knew could only be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to me: however, I could not reſiſt the entreaties of this affectionate youth, who in fact poſſeſſed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:035729_0147_100658B2211ACAE0"/>
eſtimable qualities. With ſome difficulty he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded his relations to let him follow me; and that permiſſion once obtained, he was dubbed with the title of my page. Having paſſed a week at Straſbourg, Theodore and myſelf ſet out for Bavaria, in company with the baron and his lady. Theſe latter, as well as myſelf, had forced Marguerite to accept ſeveral preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of value, both for herſelf and her youngeſt ſon. On leaving her, I promiſed his mother faithfully, that I would reſtore Theodore to her within the year.</p>
                        <p>I have related this adventure at length, Lorenzo, that you might underſtand the means by which "the adventurer Alphonſo d'Alvarada got introduced into the caſtle of Lindenberg."

                     <head>CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY OF DON RAYMOND.</head>
                     <p>MY journey was uncommonly agreeable. I found the baron a man of ſome ſenſe, but little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the world. He had paſſed a great part of his life without ſtirring beyond the precincts of his own domains, and conſequently his manners were far from being the moſt poliſhed; but he was hearty, good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, and friendly. His attention to me was all that I could wiſh, and I had every reaſon to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his behaviour. His ruling paſſion was hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he had brought himſelf to conſider as a ſerious occupation; and, when talking over ſome remarkable chace, he treated the ſubject with as much gravity as if it had been a battle on which the fate of two kingdoms was depending. I happened to be a tolerable ſportſman: ſoon after my arrival at Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denberg, I gave ſome proofs of my dexterity. The baron immediately marked me down for a man of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, and vowed to me an eternal friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>That friendſhip was become to me by no means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. At the caſtle of Lindenberg, I beheld for the firſt time your ſiſter, the lovely Agnes. For me, whoſe heart was unoccupied, and who grieved at the void, to ſee her and to love her were the ſame. I found
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:035729_0149_10065918F69918B8"/>
in Agnes all that was requiſite to ſecure my affection. She was then ſcarcely ſixteen; her perſon, light and elegant, was already formed; ſhe poſſeſſed ſeveral tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in perfection, particularly thoſe of muſic and drawing: her character was gay, open, and good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured; and the graceful ſimplicity of her dreſs and manners formed an advantageous contraſt to the art and ſtudied coquetry of the Pariſian dames, whom I had juſt quitted. From the moment that I beheld her, I felt the moſt lively intereſt in her fate. I made many inquiries reſpecting her of the baroneſs.</p>
                     <p>"She is my niece," replied that lady. "You are ſtill ignorant, Don Alphonſo, that I am your country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman. I am ſiſter to the duke of Medina Celi. Agnes is the daughter of my ſecond brother, Don Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton: ſhe has been deſtined to the convent from her cradle, and will ſoon make her profeſſion at Madrid."</p>
                     <p>[Here Lorenzo interrupted the marquis by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of ſurpriſe—</p>
                     <p>"Intended for the convent from her cradle!" ſaid he: "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>, this is the firſt word that I ever heard of ſuch a deſign."</p>
                     <p>"I believe it, my dear Lorenzo," anſwered Don Raymond; "but you muſt liſten to me with patience. You will not be leſs ſurpriſed, when I relate ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of your family ſtill unknown to you, and which I have learned from the mouth of Agnes herſelf."</p>
                     <p>He then reſumed his narrative as follows:]</p>
                     <p>You cannot but be aware, that your parents were unfortunately ſlaves to the groſſeſt ſuperſtition: when
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:035729_0150_100658E5678704C0"/>
this foible was called into play, their every other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, their every other paſſion, yielded to its irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible ſtrength. While ſhe was big with Agnes, your mother was ſeized by a dangerous illneſs, and given over by her phyſicians. In this ſituation Donna In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſilla vowed, that if ſhe recovered from her malady, the child then living in her boſom, if a girl, ſhould be dedicated to St. Clare; if a boy, to St. Benedict. Her prayers were heard: ſhe got rid of her complaint; Agnes entered the world alive, and was immediately deſtined to the ſervice of St. Clare.</p>
                     <p>Don Gaſton readily chimed in with his lady's wiſhes; but knowing the ſentiments of the duke, his brother, reſpecting a monaſtic life, it was determined that your ſiſter's deſtination ſhould be carefully concealed from him. The better to guard the ſecret, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that Agnes ſhould accompany her aunt, Donna Rodolpha, into Germany, whither that lady was on the point of following her new married huſband, baron Lindenberg. On her arrival at that eſtate, the young Agnes was put into a convent, ſituated but a few miles from the caſtle. The nuns, to whom her education was confided, performed their charge with exactitude: they made her a perfect miſtreſs of many accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſtrove to infuſe into her mind a taſte for the retirement and tranquil pleaſures of a convent. But a ſecret inſtinct made the young recluſe ſenſible that ſhe was not born for ſolitude: in all the freedom of youth and gaiety, ſhe ſcrupled not to treat as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous many ceremonies which the nuns regarded with awe: and ſhe was never more happy than when her lively imagination inſpired her with ſome ſcheme to plague the ſtiff lady abbeſs, or the ugly ill tempered
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:035729_0151_1006591A82884508"/>
old portereſs. She looked with diſguſt upon the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect before her: however, no alternative was offered to her, and ſhe ſubmitted to the decree of her parents, though not without ſecret repining.</p>
                     <p>That repugnance ſhe had not art enough to conceal long: Don Gaſton was informed of it. Alarmed, Lorenzo, leſt your affection for her ſhould oppoſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his projects, and leſt you ſhould poſitively object to your ſiſter's miſery, he reſolved to keep the whole affair from <hi>your</hi> knowledge as well as the duke's, till the ſacrifice ſhould be conſummated. The ſeaſon for her taking the veil was fixed for the time when you ſhould be upon your travels: in the mean while, no hint was dropped of Donna Ineſilla's fatal vow. Your ſiſter was never permitted to know your direction. All your letters were read before ſhe received them, and thoſe parts effaced which were likely to nouriſh her inclination for the world: her anſwers were dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated either by her aunt, or by dame Cunegonda, her governeſs. Theſe particulars I learnt partly from Agnes, partly from the baroneſs herſelf.</p>
                     <p>I immediately determined upon reſcuing this lovely girl from a fate ſo contrary to her inclinations, and ill ſuited to her merit. I endeavoured to ingratiate my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into her favour: I boaſted of my friendſhip and intimacy with you. She liſtened to me with avidity; ſhe ſeemed to devour my words while I ſpoke in your praiſe, and her eyes thanked me for my affection to her brother. My conſtant and unremitted attention at length gained me her heart, and with difficulty I oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to confeſs that ſhe loved me. When, however, I propoſed her quitting the caſtle of Lindenberg, ſhe rejected the idea in poſitive terms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="unknown:035729_0152_100658E6F010A060"/>
"Be generous, Alphonſo," ſhe ſaid; "you poſſeſs my heart, but uſe not the gift ignobly. Employ not your aſcendancy over me in perſuading me to take a ſtep at which I ſhould hereafter have to bluſh. I am young and deſerted: my brother, my only friend, is ſeparated from me, and my other relations act with me as my enemies. Take pity on my unprotected ſituation. Inſtead of ſeducing me to an action which would cover me with ſhame, ſtrive rather to gain the affections of thoſe who govern me. The baron eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teems you. My aunt, to others ever harſh, proud, and contemptuous, remembers that you reſcued her from the hands of murderers, and wears with you alone the appearance of kindneſs and benignity. Try then your influence over my guardians. If they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our union, my hand is yours. From your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my brother, I cannot doubt your obtaining his approbation; and when they find the impoſſibility of executing their deſign, I truſt that my parents will excuſe my diſobedience, and expiate by ſome other ſacrifice my mother's fatal vow."</p>
                     <p>From the firſt moment that I beheld Agnes, I had endeavoured to conciliate the favour of her relations. Authorized by the confeſſion of her regard, I redoubled my exertions. My principal battery was directed againſt the baroneſs. It was eaſy to diſcover that her word was law in the caſtle: her huſband paid her the moſt abſolute ſubmiſſion, and conſidered her as a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior being. She was about forty. In her youth ſhe had been a beauty; but her charms had been upon that large ſcale which can but ill ſuſtain the ſhock of years: however, ſhe ſtill poſſeſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

when not obſcured by prejudice, which unluckily was but ſeldom the caſe. Her paſſions were violent: ſhe ſpared no pains to gratify them, and purſued with unremitting vengeance thoſe who oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to her wiſhes. The warmeſt of friends, the moſt inveterate of enemies, ſuch was the baroneſs Lindenberg.</p>
                     <p>I laboured inceſſantly to pleaſe her: unluckily I ſucceeded but too well. She ſeemed gratified by my attention, and treated me with a diſtinction accorded by her to no one elſe. One of my daily occupations was reading to her for ſeveral hours: thoſe hours I ſhould much rather have paſſed with Agnes; but as I was conſcious that complaiſance for her aunt would advance our union, I ſubmitted with a good grace to the penance impoſed upon me. Donna Rodolpha's library was principally compoſed of old Spaniſh ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances: theſe were her favourite ſtudies, and once a day one of theſe unmerciful volumes was put regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly into my hands. I read the weariſome adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of "<hi>Perceforeſt," "Tirante the White," "Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin of England,"</hi> and "<hi>The Knight of the Sun,</hi>" till the book was on the point of falling from my hands through ennui. However, the increaſing pleaſure which the baroneſs ſeemed to take in my ſociety en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged me to perſevere; and latterly ſhe ſhowed for me a partiality ſo marked, that Agnes adviſed me to ſeize the firſt opportunity of declaring our mutual paſſion to her aunt.</p>
                     <p>One evening I was alone with Donna Rodolpha, in her own apartment. As our readings generally treated of love, Agnes was never permitted to aſſiſt at
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:035729_0154_100658EC70DA9F50"/>
them. I was juſt congratulating myſelf on having finiſhed <hi>The Loves of Triſtan and the Queen Iſeult</hi>—"</p>
                     <p>"Ah! the unfortunates!" cried the baroneſs: "How ſay you, Segnor? Do you think it poſſible for man to feel an attachment ſo diſintereſted and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere?"</p>
                     <p>"I cannot doubt it," replied I; "my own heart furniſhes me with the certainty. Ah! Donna Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolpha, might I but hope for your approbation of my love! might I but confeſs the name of my miſtreſs, without incurring your reſentment!"</p>
                     <p>She interrupted me—</p>
                     <p>"Suppoſe I were to ſpare you that confeſſion? Suppoſe I were to acknowledge that the object of your deſires is not unknown to me? Suppoſe I were to ſay, that ſhe returns your affection, and laments not leſs ſincerely than yourſelf the unhappy vows which ſeparate her from you?"</p>
                     <p>"Ah! Donna Rodolpha!" I exclaimed, throwing myſelf upon my knees before her, and preſſing her hand to my lips, "you have diſcovered my ſecret! What is your deciſion? Muſt I deſpair, or may I reckon upon your favour?"</p>
                     <p>She withdrew not the hand which I held; but ſhe turned from me, and covered her face with the other.</p>
                     <p>"How can I refuſe it you?" ſhe replied: "Ah! Don Alphonſo, I have long perceived to whom your attentions were directed, but till now I perceived not the impreſſion which they had made upon my heart. At length I can no longer hide my weakneſs either
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:035729_0155_100658E8A2C36DE8"/>
from myſelf or from you. I yield to the violence of my paſſion, and own that I adore you! For three long months I ſtifled my deſires; but growing ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by reſiſtance, I ſubmit to their impetuoſity. Pride, fear, and honor, reſpect for myſelf, and my engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the baron, all are vanquiſhed. I ſacrifice them to my love for you, and it ſtill ſeems to me that I pay too mean a price for your poſſeſſion."</p>
                     <p>"She pauſed for an anſwer.—Judge, my Lorenzo, what muſt have been my confuſion at this diſcovery. I at once ſaw all the magnitude of this obſtacle, which I had myſelf raiſed to my happineſs. The baroneſs had placed thoſe attentions to her own account, which I had merely paid her for the ſake of Agnes: and the ſtrength of her expreſſions, the looks which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them, and my knowledge of her revengeful diſpoſition, made me tremble for myſelf and my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. I was ſilent for ſome minutes. I knew not how to reply to her declaration: I could only reſolve to clear up the miſtake without delay, and for the preſent to conceal from her knowledge the name of my miſtreſs. No ſooner had ſhe avowed her paſſion, than the tranſports which before were evident in my features gave place to conſternation and conſtraint. I dropped her hand, and roſe from my knees. The change in my countenance did not eſcape her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                     <p>"What means this ſilence?" ſaid ſhe in a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling voice: Where is that joy which you led me to expect?"</p>
                     <p>"Forgive me, Segnora," I anſwered, "if what neceſſity forces from me ſhould ſeem harſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful.

grateful. To encourage you in an error, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it may flatter myſelf, muſt prove to you the ſource of diſappointment, would make me appear criminal in every eye. Honor obliges me to inform you, that you have miſtaken for the ſolicitude of love what was only the attention of friendſhip. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſentiment is that which I wiſhed to excite in your boſom: to entertain a warmer, reſpect for you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids me, and gratitude for the baron's generous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Perhaps theſe reaſons would not be ſufficient to ſhield me from your attractions, were it not that my affections are already beſtowed upon another. You have charms, Segnora, which might captivate the moſt inſenſible; no heart unoccupied could reſiſt them. Happy is it for me, that mine is no longer in my poſſeſſion, or I ſhould have to reproach myſelf for ever, with having violated the laws of hoſpitality, Recollect yourſelf, noble lady! recollect what is owed by you to honor, by me to the baron, and replace by eſteem and friendſhip thoſe ſentiments which I never can return."</p>
                     <p>The baroneſs turned pale at this unexpected and poſitive declaration; ſhe doubted whether ſhe ſlept or woke. At length recovering from her ſurpriſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation gave place to rage, and the blood ruſhed back in her cheeks with violence.</p>
                     <p>"Villain!" ſhe cried; "Monſter of deceit! Thus is the avowal of my love received? Is it thus that—but, no, no! it cannot, it ſhall not be!

                     <p>I endeavoured to lift her from her knees.</p>
                     <p>"For God's ſake, Segnora, reſtrain theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; they diſgrace yourſelf and me. Your exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be heard, and your ſecret divulged to your attendants. I ſee that my preſence only irritates you; permit me to retire."</p>
                     <p>I prepared to quit the apartment: the baroneſs caught me ſuddenly by the arm.</p>
                     <p>"And who is this happy rival?" ſaid ſhe in a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acing tone; "I will know her name, and <hi>when</hi> I know it!—She is ſome one in my power; you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated my favour, my protection! Let me but find her, let me but know who dares to rob me of your heart, and ſhe ſhall ſuffer every torment which jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy and diſappointment can inflict. Who is ſhe? Anſwer me this moment. Hope not to conceal her from my vengeance! Spies ſhall be ſet over you; every ſtep, every look ſhall be watched; your eyes will diſcover my rival; I ſhall know her; and when ſhe is found, tremble, Alphonſo, for her and for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe uttered theſe laſt words, her fury mounted to ſuch a pitch as to ſtop her powers of reſpiration. She panted, groaned, and at length fainted away. As ſhe was falling I caught her in my arms, and placed her upon a ſofa. Then haſtening to the door, I ſummoned her women to her aſſiſtance; I committed her to their care, and ſeized the opportunity of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="160" facs="unknown:035729_0158_100658EF8637F6F8"/>
Agitated and confuſed beyond expreſſion, I bent my ſteps towards the garden. The benignity with which the baroneſs had liſtened to me at firſt, had raiſed my hopes to the higheſt pitch: I imagined her to have perceived my attachment for her niece, and to approve of it. Extreme was my diſappointment at underſtanding the true purport of her diſcourſe. I knew not what courſe to take: the ſuperſtition of the parents of Agnes, aided by her aunt's unfortunate paſſion, ſeemed to oppoſe ſuch obſtacles to our union as were almoſt inſurmountable.</p>
                     <p>As I paſſed by a low parlour, whoſe windows looked into the garden, through the door which ſtood half open I obſerved Agnes ſeated at a table. She was occupied in drawing, and ſeveral unfiniſhed ſketches were ſcattered round her. I entered, ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined whether I ſhould acquaint her with the declaration of the baroneſs.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! is it only you?" ſaid ſhe, raiſing her head: "You are no ſtranger, and I ſhall continue my occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation without ceremony. Take a chair, and ſeat yourſelf by me."</p>
                     <p>I obeyed, and placed myſelf near the table. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious what I was doing, and totally occupied by the ſcene which had juſt paſſed, I took up ſome of the drawings, and caſt my eyes over them. One of the ſubjects ſtruck me from its ſingularity. It repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the great hall of the caſtle of Lindenberg. A door conducting to a narrow ſtaircaſe ſtood half open. In the foreground appeared a group of figures, placed in the moſt groteſque attitudes; terror was expreſſed upon every countenance. Here was one upon his
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:035729_0159_1006592159B223E8"/>
knees, with his eyes caſt up to heaven, and praying moſt devoutly; there, another was creeping away upon all fours. Some hid their faces in their cloaks, or the laps of their companions. Some had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed themſelves beneath a table, on which the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of a feaſt were viſible; while others, with gap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mouths and eyes wide ſtretched, pointed to a fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure ſuppoſed to have created this diſturbance. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented a female of more than human ſtature, cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the habit of ſome religious order. Her face was veiled; on her arm hung a chaplet of beads; her dreſs was in ſeveral places ſtained with the blood which trickled from a wound upon her boſom. In one hand ſhe held a lamp, in the other a large knife, and ſhe ſeemed advancing towards the iron gates of the hall.</p>
                     <p>"What does this mean, Agnes?" ſaid I: "Is this ſome invention of your own?"</p>
                     <p>She caſt her eyes upon the drawing.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! no," ſhe replied: "'tis the invention of much wiſer heads than mine. But can you poſſibly have lived at Lindenberg for three whole months with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing of the bleeding nun?"</p>
                     <p>"You are the firſt who ever mentioned the name to me. Pray, who may the lady be?"</p>
                     <p>"That is more than I can pretend to tell you.

                     <p>I anſwered, that ſhe would oblige me much by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating it: ſhe reſumed her drawing, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded as follows in a tone of burleſqued gravity:</p>
                     <p>"It is ſurpriſing that in all the chronicles of paſt times this remarkable perſonage is never once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Fain would I recount to you her life; but unluckily till after her death ſhe was never known to have exiſted. Then firſt did ſhe think it neceſſary to make ſome noiſe in the world, and with that intention ſhe made bold to ſeize upon the caſtle of Lindenberg. Having a good taſte, ſhe took up her abode in the beſt room of the houſe; and once eſtabliſhed there, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to amuſe herſelf by knocking about the tables and chairs in the middle of the night. Perhaps ſhe was a bad ſleeper, but this I have never been able to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. According to the tradition, this entertainment commenced about a century ago. It was accompan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied with ſhrieking, howling, groaning, ſwearing, and many other agreeable noiſes of the ſame kind. But though one particular room was more eſpecially hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured with her viſits, ſhe did not entirely confine her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to it. She occaſionally ventured into the old gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, paced up and down the ſpacious halls; or, ſometimes ſtopping at the doors of the chambers, ſhe wept and wailed there to the univerſal terror of the inhabitants. In theſe nocturnal excurſions ſhe was ſeen by different people, who all deſcribe her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as you behold it here traced by the hand of her unworthy hiſtorian."</p>

The ſingularity of this account inſenſibly engaged my attention.</p>
                     <p>"Did ſhe never ſpeak to thoſe who met her?" ſaid I.</p>
                     <p>"Not ſhe. The ſpecimens indeed which ſhe gave nightly of her talents for converſation were by no means inviting. Sometimes the caſtle rung with oaths and execrations: a moment after ſhe repeated her <hi>Paternoſter:</hi> now ſhe howled out the moſt horrible blaſphemies, and then chanted <hi>De profundis</hi> as orderly as if ſtill in the choir. In ſhort, ſhe ſeemed a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty capricious being: but whether ſhe prayed or curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether ſhe was impious or devout, ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways contrived to terrify her auditors out of their ſenſes. The caſtle became ſcarcely habitable; and its lord was ſo frightened by theſe midnight revels, that one fine morning he was ſound dead in his bed. This ſucceſs ſeemed to pleaſe the nun mightily, for now ſhe made more noiſe than ever. But the next baron proved too cunning for her. He made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance with a celebrated exorciſer in his hand, who feared not to ſhut himſelf up for a night in the haunted chamber. There it ſeems that he had a hard battle with the ghoſt before ſhe would promiſe to be quiet. She was obſtinate, but he was more ſo; and at length ſhe conſented to let the inhabitants of the caſtle take a good night's reſt. For ſome time after no news was heard of her. But at the end of five years the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſer died, and then the nun ventured to peep abroad again. However, ſhe was now grown much more tractable and well behaved. She walked about in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and never made her appearance above once in five years. This cuſtom, if you will believe the baron,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:035729_0162_100658F4FB27DC20"/>
ſhe ſtill continues. He is fully perſuaded, that on the fifth of May of every fifth year, as ſoon as the clock ſtrikes one, the door of the haunted chamber opens. [Obſerve, that this room has been ſhut up for near a century.] Then out walks the ghoſtly nun with her lamp and dagger: ſhe deſcends the ſtaircaſe of the eaſtern tower, and croſſes the great hall. On that night the porter always leaves the gates of the caſtle open, out of reſpect to the apparition: not that this is thought by any means neceſſary, ſince ſhe could eaſily whip through the keyhole if ſhe choſe it: but merely out of politeneſs, and to prevent her from making her exit in a way ſo derogatory to the dignity of her ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip."</p>
                     <p>"And whither does ſhe go on quitting the caſtle?"</p>
                     <p>"To heaven, I hope; but if ſhe does, the place certainly is not to her taſte, for ſhe always returns after an hour's abſence. The lady then retires to her chamber, and is quiet for another five years."</p>
                     <p>"And you, believe this, Agnes?"</p>
                     <p>"How can you aſk ſuch a queſtion? No, no, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo! I have too much reaſon to lament ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's influence to be its victim myſelf. However, I muſt not avow my incredulity to the baroneſs: ſhe entertains not a doubt of the truth of this hiſtory. As to dame Cunegonda, my governeſs, ſhe proteſts that fifteen years ago ſhe ſaw the ſpectre with her own eyes. She related to me one evening, how ſhe and ſeveral other domeſtics had been terrified while at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by the appearance of the bleeding nun, as the ghoſt is called in the caſtle: 'tis from her account that I drew this ſketch, and you may be certain that
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:035729_0163_10065924B4D1C638"/>
Cunegonda was not omitted. There ſhe is! I ſhall never forget what a paſſion ſhe was in, and how ugly ſhe looked while ſhe ſcolded me for having made her picture ſo like herſelf!"</p>
                     <p>Here ſhe pointed to a burleſque figure of an old woman in an attitude of terror.</p>
                     <p>In ſpite of the melancholy which oppreſſed me, I could not help ſmiling at the playful imagination of Agnes: ſhe had perfectly preſerved dame Cunegonda's reſemblance, but had ſo much exaggerated every fault, and rendered every feature ſo irreſiſtably laughable, that I could eaſily conceive the duenna's anger.</p>
                     <p>"The figure is admirable, my dear Agnes! I knew not that you poſſeſſed ſuch talents for the ridic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulous."</p>
                     <p>"Stay a moment," ſhe replied: "I will ſhew you a figure ſtill more ridiculous than dame Cunegonda's. If it pleaſes you, you may diſpoſe of it as ſeems beſt to yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>She roſe, and went to a cabinet at ſome little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: unlocking a drawer, ſhe took out a ſmall caſe, which ſhe opened, and preſented to me.</p>
                     <p>"Do you know the reſemblance?" ſaid ſhe, ſmiling.</p>
                     <p>It was her own.</p>
                     <p>Tranſported at the gift, I preſſed the portrait to my lips with paſſion: I threw myſelf at her feet, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my gratitude in the warmeſt and moſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate terms. She liſtened to me with complaiſance,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:035729_0164_100658F68562D860"/>
and aſſured me that ſhe ſhared my ſentiments; when ſuddenly ſhe uttered a loud ſhriek, diſengaged the hand which I held, and flew from the room by a door which opened to the garden. Amazed at this abrupt departure, I roſe haſtily from my knees. I beheld with confuſion the baroneſs ſtanding near me, glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with jealouſy, and almoſt choaked with rage. On recovering from her ſwoon, ſhe had tortured her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination to diſcover her concealed rival. No one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to deſerve her ſuſpicions more than Agnes. She immediately haſtened to find her niece, tax her with encouraging my addreſſes, and aſſure herſelf whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her conjectures were well grounded. Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſhe had already ſeen enough to need no other confirmation. She arrived at the door of the room, at the preciſe moment when Agnes gave me her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait. She heard me profeſs an everlaſting attachment to her rival, and ſaw me kneeling at her feet. She advanced to ſeparate us; we were too much occupied by each other to perceive her approach, and were not aware of it till Agnes beheld her ſtanding by my ſide.</p>
                     <p>Rage on the part of Donna Rodolpha, embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on mine, for ſome time kept us both ſilent. The lady recovered herſelf firſt.</p>
                     <p>"My ſuſpicions then were juſt," ſaid ſhe; "the coquetry of my niece has triumphed, and 'tis to her that I am ſacrificed. In one reſpect, however, I am fortunate; I ſhall not be the only one who laments a diſappointed paſſion. You, too, ſhall know what it is to love without hope! I daily expect orders for reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Agnes to her parents. Immediately upon her arrival in Spain, ſhe will take the veil, and place an
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:035729_0165_100659287A546B38"/>
inſuperable barrier to your union. You may ſpare your ſupplications," ſhe continued, perceiving me on the point of ſpeaking—"my reſolution is fixed and immoveable. Your miſtreſs ſhall remain a cloſe priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner in her chamber, till ſhe exchanges this caſtle for the cloiſter. Solitude will perhaps recal her to a ſenſe of her duty: but to prevent your oppoſing that wiſhed event, I muſt inform you, Don Alphonſo, that your preſence here is no longer agreeable either to the baron or myſelf. It was not to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> to my niece, that your relations ſent you to Germany; your buſineſs was to travel, and I ſhould be ſorry to impede any longer ſo excellent a deſign. Farewell, Segnor; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that to-morrow morning we meet for the laſt time."</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, ſhe darted upon me a look of pride, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ntempt, and malice, and quitted the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I alſo retired to mine, and conſumed the night in planning the means of reſcuing Agnes from the power of her tyrannical aunt.</p>
                     <p>After the poſitive declaration of its miſtreſs, it was impoſſible for me to make a longer ſtay at the caſtle of Lindenberg. Accordingly, I the next day announced my immediate departure. The baron declared that it gave him ſincere pain; and he expreſſed himſelf in my favour ſo warmly, that I endeavoured to win him over to my intereſt. Scarcely had I mentioned the name of Agnes when he ſtopped me ſhort, and ſaid, that it was totally out of his power to interfere in the buſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs. I ſaw that it was in vain to argue; the baron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs governed her huſband with deſpotic ſway, and I eaſily perceived that ſhe had prejudiced him againſt the

                        </gap>ner, but my prayer was rejected. I was obliged to depart without ſeeing her.</p>
                     <p>At quitting him, the baron ſhook my hand affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and aſſured me, that, as ſoon as his niece was gone, I might conſider his houſe as my own.</p>
                     <p>"Farewell, Don Alphonſo!" ſaid the baroneſs, and ſtretched out her hand to me.</p>
                     <p>I took it, and offered to carry it to my lips. She prevented me. Her huſband was at the other end of the room, and out of hearing.</p>
                     <p>"Take care of yourſelf," ſhe continued; "my love is become hatred, and my wounded pride ſhall not be unatoned. Go where you will, my vengeance ſhall follow you!"</p>
                     <p>She accompanied theſe words with a look ſufficient to make me tremble. I anſwered not, but haſtened to quit the caſtle.</p>
                     <p>As my chaiſe drove out of the court, I looked up to the windows of your ſiſter's chamber: nobody was to be ſeeen there. I threw myſelf back deſpondent in my carriage. I was attended by no other ſervants than a Frenchman, whom I had hired at Straſbourg in Stephano's room, and my little page, whom I before mentioned to you. The fidelity, intelligence, and good temper of Theodore had already made him dear to me; but he now prepared to lay an obligation on me, which made me look upon him as a guardian ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. Scarcely had we proceeded half a mile from the caſtle, when he rode up to the chaiſe door.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="169" facs="unknown:035729_0167_1006592A0526DCE8"/>
"Take courage, Segnor!" ſaid he in Spaniſh, which he had already learnt to ſpeak with fluency and correctneſs: "While you were with the baron I watched the moment when dame Cunegonda was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſtairs, and mounted into the chamber over that of Donna Agnes. I ſang, as loud as I could, a little German air, well known to her, hoping that ſhe would recollect my voice. I was not diſappointed, for I ſoon heard her window open. I haſtened to let down a ſtring with which I had provided myſelf. Upon hearing the caſement cloſed again, I drew up the ſtring, and faſtened to it, I found this ſcrap of paper."</p>
                     <p>He then preſented me with a ſmall no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, addreſſed to me. I opened it with impatience. It contained the following words, written in pencil:</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <p>Conceal yourſelf for the next fortnight in ſome neighbouring village. My aunt will believe you to have quitted Lindenberg, and I ſhall be reſtored to liberty." I will be in the weſt pavilion at twelve on the night of the thirtieth. Fail not to be there, and we ſhall have an opportunity of concerting our future plans.</p>
                           <closer>
                              <signed>Adieu. AGNES.</signed>

                        </body>
                     </floatingText>
                     <p>At peruſing theſe lines my tranſports exceeded all bounds; neither did I ſet any to the expreſſions of gratitude which I heaped upon Theodore. In fact, his addreſs and attention merited my warmeſt praiſe. You will readily believe that I had not entruſted him with my paſſion for Agnes; but the arch youth had too much diſcernment not to diſcover my ſecret, and too much diſcretion not to conceal his knowledge of it.
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:035729_0168_100658F80B56ADF0"/>
He obſerved in ſilence what was going on, nor ſtrove to make himſelf an agent in the buſineſs till my intereſts required his interference. I equally admired his judgment, his penetration, his addreſs, and his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. This was not the firſt occaſion in which I had found him of infinite uſe, and I was every day more convinced of his quickneſs and capacity. During my ſhort ſtay at Straſbourg, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ad applied himſelf dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to learn the rudiments of Spaniſh. He continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtudy it, and with ſo much ſucceſs, that he ſpoke it with the ſame facility as his native language. He paſſed the greateſt part of his time in reading. He had acquired much information for his age; and united the advantages of a lively countenance and prepoſſeſſing figure to an excellent underſtanding and the very beſt of hearts. He is now fifteen. He is ſtill in my ſervice; and, when you ſee him, I am ſure that he will pleaſe you. But excuſe this digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; I return to the ſubject which I quitted.</p>
                     <p>I obeyed the inſtructions of Agnes. I proceeded to Munich: there I left my chaiſe under the care of Lucas, my French ſervant, and then returned on horſeback to a ſmall village about four miles diſtant from the caſtle of Lindenberg. Upon arriving there, a ſtory was related to the hoſt at whoſe inn I alighted, which prevented his wondering at my making ſo long a ſtay in his houſe. The old man fortunately, was credulous and incurious: he believed all I ſaid, and ſought to know no more than what I thought proper to tell him. Nobody was with me but Theodore: both were diſguiſed; and as we kept ourſelves cloſe, we were not ſuſpected to be other than what we ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>emed. In this manner the fortnight paſſed away.
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:035729_0169_1006592B8BA29788"/>
During that time I had the pleaſing conviction that Agnes was once more at liberty. She paſſed through the village with dame Cunegonda: ſhe ſeemed in good health and ſpirits, and talked to her companion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any appearance of conſtraint.</p>
                     <p>"Who are thoſe ladies?" ſaid I to my hoſt as the carriage paſſed.</p>
                     <p>"Baron Lindenberg's niece, with her governeſs," he replied: "ſhe goes regularly every Friday to the convent of St. Catherine, in which ſhe was brought up, and which is ſituated about a mile from hence."</p>
                     <p>You may be certain that I waited with impatience for the enſuing Friday. I again beheld my lovely miſtreſs. She caſt her eyes upon me as ſhe paſſed the inn door. A bluſh which overſpread her cheek told me, that in ſpite of my diſguiſe I had been recogniſed. I bowed profoundly. She returned the compliment by a ſlight inclination of the head, as if made to one inferior, and looked another way till the carriage was out of ſight.</p>
                     <p>The long expected, long wiſhed for night arrived. It was calm, and the moon was at the full. As ſoon as the clock ſtruck eleven I haſtened to my appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, determined not to be too late. Theodore had provided a ladder; I aſcended the garden wall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty. The page followed me and drew the ladder after us. I poſted myſelf in the weſt pavilion, and waited impatiently for the approach of Agnes. Every breeze that whiſpered, every leaf that fell, I believed to be her footſtep, and haſtened to meet her. Thus was I obliged to paſs a full hour, every minute
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:035729_0170_100658F9A20AC478"/>
of which appeared to me an age. The caſtle bell at length tolled twelve, and ſcarcely could I believe the night to be no further advanced. Another quarter of an hour elapſed, and I heard the light foot of my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs approaching the pavilion with precaution. I flew to receive her, and conducted her to a feat. I threw myſelf at her feet, and was expreſſing my joy at ſeeing her, when ſhe thus interrupted me:</p>
                     <p>"We have no time to loſe, Alphonſo; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are precious; for, though no more a priſoner, Cunegonda watches my every ſtep. An expreſs is arrived from my father; I muſt depart immediately for Madrid, and 'tis with difficulty that I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a week's delay. The ſuperſtition of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſupported by the repreſentations of my cruel aunt, leaves me no hope of ſoftening them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. In this dilemma, I have reſolved to commit myſelf to your honor. God grant that you may never give me cauſe to repent my reſolution! Flight is my only reſource from the horrors of a convent; and my imprudence muſt be excuſed by the urgency of the danger. Now liſten to the plan by which I hope to effect my eſcape.</p>
                     <p>"We are now at the thirtieth of April. On the fifth day from this the viſionary nun is expected to appear. In my laſt viſit to the convent I provided myſelf with a dreſs proper for the character. A friend whom I have left there, and to whom I made no ſcruple to confide my ſecret, readily conſented to ſupply me with a religious habit. Provide a carriage, and be with it at a little diſtance from the great gate of the caſtle. As ſoon as the clock ſtrikes 'one,' I
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:035729_0171_1006592D1331BA10"/>
ſhall quit my chamber, dreſſed in the ſame apparel as the ghoſt is ſuppoſed to wear. Whoever meets me will be too much terrified to oppoſe my eſcape: I ſhall eaſily reach the door, and throw myſelf under your protection. Thus far ſucceſs is certain: but, oh! Alphonſo, ſhould you deceive me; ſhould you deſpiſe my imprudence, and reward it with ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the world will not hold a being more wretched than myſelf! I feel all the dangers to which I ſhall be expoſed. I feel that I am giving you a right to treat me with levity; but I rely upon your love, upon your honor! The ſtep which I am on the point of taking will incenſe my relations againſt me; ſhould you deſert me; ſhould you betray the truſt repoſed in you, I ſhall have no friend to puniſh your inſult, or ſupport my cauſe. On yourſelf alone reſts all my hope; and if your own heart does not plead in my behalf, I am undone for ever!"</p>
                     <p>The tone in which ſhe pronounced theſe words was ſo touching that, in ſpite of my joy at receiving her promiſe to follow me, I could not help being affected. I alſo repined in ſecret at not having taken the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution to provide a carriage at the village; in which caſe, I might have carried off Agnes that very night. Such an attempt was now impracticable; neither carriage nor horſes were to be procured nearer than Munich, which was diſtant from Lindenberg two good day's journey. I was therefore obliged to chime in with her plan, which, in truth, ſeemed well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged. Her diſguiſe would ſecure her from being ſtopped in quitting the caſtle, and would enable her to ſtep into the carriage at the very gate, without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty or loſing time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="unknown:035729_0172_100658FC4AE14B28"/>
Agnes reclined her head mournfully upon my ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and, by the light of the moon, I ſaw tears flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down her cheek. I ſtrove to diſſipate her melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and encouraged her to look forward to the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of happineſs. I proteſted in the moſt ſolemn terms that her virtue and innocence would be ſafe in my keeping; and that, till the church had made her my lawful wife, her honor ſhould be held by me as ſacred as a ſiſter's. I told her that my firſt care ſhould be to find you out, Lorenzo, and reconcile you to our union; and I was continuing to ſpeak in the ſame ſtrain, when a noiſe without alarmed me. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the door of the pavilion was thrown open, and Cunegonda ſtood before us. She had heard Agnes ſteal out of her chamber, followed her into the garden, and perceived her entering the pavilion. Favoured by the trees which ſhaded it, and unperceived by Theodore, who waited at a little diſtance, ſhe had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached in ſilence, and overheard our whole conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                     <p>"Admirable!" cried Cunegonda, in a voice ſhrill with paſſion, while Agnes uttered a loud ſhriek. "By St. Barbara, young lady, you have an excellent inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! You muſt perſonate the bleeding nun, truly! What impiety! What incredulity! Marry, I have a good mind to let you purſue your plan. When the real ghoſt met you, I warrant you would be in a pretty condition! Don Alphonſo, you ought to be aſhamed of yourſelf for ſeducing a young, ignorant creature to leave her family and friends. However, for this time, at leaſt, I ſhall mar your wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. The noble lady ſhall be informed of the whole affair, and Agnes muſt defer playing the ſpectre till a
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:035729_0173_10065930E244A8C8"/>
better opportunity. Farewell, Segnor.—Donna Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, let me have the honor of conducting your ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip back to your apartment."</p>
                     <p>She approached the ſofa on which her trembling pupil was ſeated, took her by the hand, and prepared to lead her from the pavilion.</p>
                     <p>I detained her, and ſtrove by entreaties, ſoothing promiſes, and flattery, to win her to my party; but, finding all that I could ſay of no avail, I abandoned the vain attempt.</p>
                     <p>"Your obſtinacy muſt be its own puniſhment," ſaid I; "but one reſource remains to ſave Agnes and myſelf, and I ſhall not heſitate to employ it."</p>
                     <p>Terrified at this menace, ſhe again endeavoured to quit the pavilion; but I ſeized her by the wriſt, and detained her forcibly. At the ſame moment Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, who had followed her into the room, cloſed the door, and prevented her eſcape. I took the veil of Agnes; I threw it round the duenna's head, who ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſuch piercing ſhrieks, that, in ſpite of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the caſtle, I dreaded their being heard. At length I ſucceeded in gagging her ſo completely that ſhe could not produce a ſingle ſound. Theodore and myſelf, with ſome difficulty, next contrived to bind her hands and feet with our handkerchiefs; and I adviſed Agnes to regain her chamber with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. I promiſed that no harm ſhould happen to Cunegonda; bade her remember that, on the fifth of May, I ſhould be in waiting at the great gate of the caſtle, and took of her an affectionate farewell. Trembling and uneaſy, ſhe had ſcarce power enough
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:035729_0174_100658FEF540A8F0"/>
to ſignify her conſent to my plans, and fled back to her apartment in diſorder and confuſion.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while Theodore aſſiſted me in carrying off my antiquated prize. She was hoiſted over the wall, placed before me upon my horſe, like a port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manteau, and I galloped away with her from the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Lindenberg. The unlucky duenna never had made a more diſagreeable journey in her life. She was jolted and ſhaken till ſhe was become little more than an animated mummy; not to mention her fright, when we waded through a ſmall river, through which it was neceſſary to paſs in order to regain the village. Before we reached the inn, I had already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined how to diſpoſe of the troubleſome Cunegon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. We entered the ſtreet in which the inn ſtood; and while the page knocked, I waited at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The landlord opened the door with a lamp in his hand.</p>
                     <p>"Give me the light," ſaid Theodore, "my maſter is coming."</p>
                     <p>He ſnatched the lamp haſtily, and purpoſely let it fall upon the ground. The landlord returned to the kitchen to relight the lamp, leaving the door open. I profited by the obſcurity, ſprang from my horſe with Cunegonda in my arms, darted up ſtairs, reached my chamber unperceived, and, unlocking the door of a ſpacious cloſet, ſtowed her within it, and then turned the key. The landlord and Theodore ſoon after ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with lights: the former expreſſed himſelf ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at my returning ſo late, but aſked no impertinent queſtions. He ſoon quitted the room, and left me to exult in the ſucceſs of my undertaking.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="177" facs="unknown:035729_0175_100659326A77DF38"/>
I immediately paid a viſit to my priſoner. I ſtrove to perſuade her to ſubmit with patience to her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary confinement. My attempt was unſucceſsful. Unable to ſpeak or move, ſhe expreſſe her fury by her looks; and, except at meals, I n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>er dared to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind her, or releaſe her from the gag. At ſuch times I ſtood over her with a drawn ſword, and proteſted that, if ſhe uttered a ſingle cry, I would plunge it in her boſom. As ſoon as ſhe had done eating, the gag was replaced. I was conſcious that this proceeding was cruel, and could only be juſtified by the urgency of circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>As to Theodore, he had no ſcruples upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Cunegonda's captivity entertained him beyond meaſure. During his abode in the caſtle, a continual warfare had been carried on between him and the duenna; and, now that he found his enemy ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in his power, he triumphed without mercy: he ſeemed to think of nothing but how to find out new means of plaguing her. Sometimes he affected to pity her misfortune, then laughed at, abuſed, and mimicked her: he played her a thouſand tricks, each more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking than the other; and amuſed himſelf by telling her, that her elopement muſt have occaſioned much ſurpriſe at the baron's. This was in fact the caſe. No one, except Agnes, could imagine what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of dame Cunegonda. Every hole and corner was ſearched for her, the ponds were dragged, and the woods underwent a thorough examination. Still no dame Cunegonda made her appearance. Agnes kept the ſecret, and I kept the duenna: the baroneſs, therefore, remained in total ignorance reſpecting the old woman's fate, but ſuſpected her to have periſhed
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:035729_0176_10065900ABF92420"/>
by ſuicide. Thus paſſed away five days, during which I had prepared every thing neceſſary for my enterpriſe. On quitting Agnes, I had made it my firſt buſineſs to diſpatch a peaſant with a letter to Lucas, at Munich, ordering him to take care that a coach and four ſhould arrive about ten o'clock on the fifth of May at the village of Roſenwald. He obeyed my inſtructions punctually; the equipage arrived at the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As the period of her lady's elopement drew nearer, Cunegonda's rage increaſed. I verily believe, that ſpite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> paſſion would have killed her, had I not luckily diſcovered her prepoſſeſſion in favour of cherry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandy. With this favourite liquor ſhe was plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupplied, and, Theodore always remaining to guard her, the gag was occaſionally removed. The liquor ſeemed to have a wonderful effect in ſoftening the acrimony of her nature; and her confinement not admitting of any other amuſement, ſhe got drunk regularly once a day, juſt by way of paſſing the time.</p>
                     <p>The fifth of May arrived, a period by me never to be forgotten! Before the clock ſtruck twelve, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took myſelf to the ſcene of action. Theodore follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me on horſeback. I concealed the carriage in a ſpacious cavern of the hill on whoſe brow the caſtle was ſituated. This cavern was of conſiderable depth, and, among the peaſants, was known by the name of Lindenberg Hole. The night was calm and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: the moon beams fell upon the ancient towers of the caſtle, and ſhed upon their ſummits a ſilver light. All was ſtill around me; nothing was to be heard except the night breeze ſighing among the leaves, the diſtant barking of village dogs, or the owl who had eſtabliſhed herſelf in a nook of the deſerted eaſtern
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:035729_0177_100659342ABA6E48"/>
turret. I heard her melancholy ſhriek, and looked upwards; ſhe ſat upon the ridge of a window, which I recogniſed to be that of the haunted room. This brought to my remembrance the ſtory of the bleeding nun, and I ſighed while I reflected on the influence of ſuperſtition, and weakneſs of human reaſon. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly I heard a faint chorus ſteal upon the ſilence of the night.</p>
                     <p>"What can occaſion that noiſe, Theodore?"</p>
                     <p>"A ſtranger of diſtinction," replied he, "paſſed through the village to-day in his way to the caſtle: he is reported to be the father of Donna Agnes. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the baron has given an entertainment to celebrate his arrival."</p>
                     <p>The caſtle bell announced the hour of midnight. This was the uſual ſignal for the family to retire to bed. Soon after I perceived lights in the caſtle, mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backwards and forwards in different directions. I conjectured the company to be ſeparating. I could hear the heavy doors grate as they opened with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; and as they cloſed again, the rotten caſements rattled in their frames. The chamber of Agnes was on the other ſide of the caſtle. I trembled leſt ſhe ſhould have failed in obtaining the key of the haunted room. Through this it was neceſſary for her to paſs, in order to reach the narrow ſtaircaſe by which the ghoſt was ſuppoſed to deſcend into the great hall. Agitated by this apprehenſion, I kept my eyes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fixed upon the window, where I hoped to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the friendly glare of a lamp borne by Agnes. I now heard the maſſy gates unbarred. By the candle in his hand, I diſtinguiſhed old Conrad, the porter.
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:035729_0178_100659023762D158"/>
He ſet the portal doors wide open, and retired. The lights in the caſtle gradually diſappeared, and at length the whole building was wrapped in darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>While I ſat upon a broken ridge of the hill, the ſtillneſs of the ſcene inſpired me with melancholy ideas not altogether unpleaſing. The caſtle, which ſtood full in my ſight, formed an object equally awful and pictureſque. Its ponderous walls, tinged by the moon with ſolemn brightneſs; its old and partly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined towers, lifting themſelves into the clouds, and ſeeming to frown on the plains around them; its lofty battlements, overgrown with ivy, and folding gates, expanding in honor of the viſionary inhabitant, made me ſenſible of a ſad and reverential horror. Yet did not theſe ſenſations occupy me ſo fully as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent me from witneſſing with impatience the ſlow progreſs of time. I approached the caſtle, and ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to walk round it. A few rays of light ſtill glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the chamber of Agnes. I obſerved them with joy. I was ſtill gazing upon them, when I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a figure draw near the window, and the curtain was carefully cloſed to conceal the lamp which burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there. Convinced by this obſervation that Agnes had not abandoned our plan, I returned with a light heart to my former ſtation.</p>
                     <p>The half hour ſtruck! The three quarters ſtruck! My boſom beat high with hope and expectation. At length, the wiſhed for ſound was heard. The bell tolled 'one,' and the manſion echoed with the noiſe loud and ſolemn. I looked up to the caſement of the haunted chamber. Scarcely had five minutes elapſed when the expected light appeared. I was now cloſe
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:035729_0179_10065935B1BB5A90"/>
to the tower. The window was not ſo far from the ground, but that I fancied I perceived a female figure with a lamp in her hand moving ſlowly along the apartment. The light ſoon faded away, and all was again dark and gloomy.</p>
                     <p>Occaſional gleams of brightneſs darted from the ſtaircaſe windows as the lovely ghoſt paſſed by them. I traced the light through the hall: it reached the portal, and at length I beheld Agnes paſs through the folding gates. She was habited exactly as ſhe had deſcribed the ſpectre. A chaplet of beads hung upon her arm; her head was enveloped in a long white veil; her nun's dreſs was ſtained with blood; and ſhe had taken care to provide herſelf with a lamp and dagger. She advanced towards the ſpot where I ſtood. I flew to meet her; and claſping her in my arms, I exclaimed,</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>"Agnes! Agnes! thou art mine!</l>
                        <l>"Agnes! Agnes! I am thine!</l>
                        <l>"Faireſt! Deareſt! Thou art mine!</l>
                        <l>"Faireſt! Deareſt! I am thine!</l>
                        <l>"Leave thee will I never!</l>
                        <l>"Thou art mine!</l>
                        <l>"I am thine!</l>
                        <l>"Body and ſoul for ever!"</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>Terrified and breathleſs, ſhe was unable to ſpeak. She dropped her lamp and dagger, and ſunk upon my boſom in ſilence. I raiſed her in my arms, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed her to the carriage. Theodore remained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in order to releaſe dame Cunegonda. I alſo charged him with a letter to the baroneſs, explaining the whole affair, and entreating her good offices in reconciling Don Gaſton to my union with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:035729_0180_1006590625F2C860"/>
I diſcovered to her my real name. I proved to her that my birth and expectations juſtified my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to her niece; and aſſured her, though it was out of my power to return her love, that I would ſtrive unceaſingly to obtain her eſteem and friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>I ſtepped into the carriage, where Agnes was already ſeated. Theodore cloſed the door, and the poſtillions drove away. At firſt I was delighted with the rapidity of our progreſs; but as ſoon as we were in no danger of purſuit, I called to the drivers, and bade them to moderate their pace. They ſtrove in vain to obey me; the horſes refuſed to anſwer the rein, and continued to ruſh on with aſtoniſhing ſwiftneſs. The poſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions redoubled their efforts to ſtop them; but, by kicking and plunging, the beaſts ſoon releaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from this reſtraint. Uttering a loud ſhriek, the drivers were hurled upon the ground. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately thick clouds obſcured the ſky: the winds howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed around us, the lightning flaſhed, and the thunder roared tremendouſly. Never did I behold ſo frightful a tempeſt! Terrified by the jar of contending ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the horſes ſeemed every moment to increaſe their ſpeed. Nothing could interrupt their career; they dragged the carriage through hedges and ditches, daſhed down the moſt dangerous precipices, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to vie in ſwiftneſs with the rapidity of the winds.</p>
                     <p>All this while my companion lay motionleſs in my arms. Truly alarmed by the magnitude of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I was in vain attempting to recal her to her ſenſes, when a loud craſh announced that a ſtop was put to our progreſs in the moſt diſagreeable manner. The carriage was ſhattered to pieces. In falling, I ſtruck
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:035729_0181_100659397A883120"/>
my temple againſt a flint. The pain of the wound, the violence of the ſhock, and apprehenſion for the ſafety of Agnes, combined to overpower me ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely, that my ſenſes forſook me, and I lay without animation on the ground.</p>
                     <p>I probably remained for ſome time in this ſituation, ſince, when I opened my eyes, it was broad daylight. Several peaſants were ſtanding round me, and ſeemed diſputing whether my recovery was poſſible. I ſpoke German tolerably well. As ſoon as I could utter an articulate ſound, I inquired after Agnes. What was my ſurpriſe and diſtreſs, when aſſured by the peaſants that nobody had been ſeen anſwering the deſcription which I gave of her! They told me, that in going to their daily labour they had been alarmed by obſerving the fragments of my carriage, and by hearing the groans of an horſe, the only one of the four which remained alive: the other three lay dead by my ſide. Nobody was near me when they came up, and much time had been loſt before they ſucceeded in recovering me. Uneaſy beyond expreſſion reſpecting the fate of my companion, I beſought the peaſants to diſperſe themſelves in ſearch of her. I deſcribed her dreſs, and promiſed immenſe rewards to whoever brought me any intelligence. As for myſelf, it was impoſſible for me to join in the purſuit: I had broken two of my ribs in the fall; my arm being diſlocated hung uſeleſs by my ſide; and my left leg was ſhattered ſo terribly, that I never expected to recover its uſe.</p>
                     <p>The peaſants complied with my requeſt; all left me except four, who made a litter of boughs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to convey me to the neighbouring town. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired its name; it proved to be Ratiſbon, and I could
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:035729_0182_10065907AC874AC0"/>
ſcarcely perſuade myſelf that I had travelled to ſuch a diſtance in a ſingle night. I told the countrymen, that at one o'clock that morning I had paſſed through the village of Roſenwald. They ſhook their heads wiſtfully, and made ſigns to each other that I muſt certainly be delirious. I was conveyed to a decent inn, and immediately put to bed. A phyſician was ſent for, who ſet my arm with ſucceſs: he then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined my other hurts, and told me that I need be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no apprehenſion of the conſequences of any of them, but ordered me to keep myſelf quiet, and be prepared for a tedious and painful cure. I anſwered him, that if he hoped to keep me quiet, he muſt firſt endeavour to procure me ſome news of a lady who had quitted Roſenwald in my company the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and had been with me at the moment when the coach broke down. He ſmiled, and only replied by adviſing me to make myſelf eaſy, for that all proper care ſhould be taken of me. As he quitted me, the hoſteſs met him at the door of the room.</p>
                     <p>"The gentleman is not quite in his right ſenſes," I heard him ſay to her in a low voice; "'tis the natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conſequence of his fall, but that will ſoon be over."</p>
                     <p>One after another the peaſants returned to the inn, and informed me that no traces had been diſcovered of my unfortunate miſtreſs. Uneaſineſs now became deſpair. I entreated them to renew their ſearch in the moſt urgent terms, doubling the promiſes which I had already made them. My wild and frantic manner confirmed the by-ſtanders in the idea of my being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirious. No ſigns of the lady having appeared, they believed her to be a creature fabricated by my over heated brain, and paid no attention to my entreaties.
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:035729_0183_1006593B051BA5D0"/>
However, the hoſteſs aſſured me, that a freſh inquiry ſhould be made; but I found afterwards that her promiſe was only given to quiet me. No further ſteps were taken in the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>Though my baggage was left at Munich under the care of my French ſervant, having prepared myſelf for a long journey, my purſe was amply furniſhed: beſides, my equipage proved me to be of diſtinction, and in conſequence all poſſible attention was paid me at the inn. The day paſſed away: ſtill no news ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived of Agnes. The anxiety of fear now gave place to deſpondency. I ceaſed to rave about her, and was plunged in the depth of melancholy reflections. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving me to be ſilent and tranquil, my attendants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved my delirium to have abated, and that my mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had taken a favourable turn. According to the phyſician's order, I ſwallowed a compoſing medicine; and as ſoon as the night ſhut in, my attendants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and left me to repoſe.</p>
                     <p>That repoſe I wooed in vain. The agitation of my boſom chaſed away ſleep. Reſtleſs in my mind, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpite of the fatigue of my body, I continued to toſs about from ſide to ſide, till the clock in a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteeple ſtruck 'one.' As I liſtened to the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hollow ſound, and heard it die away in the wind, I felt a ſudden chiilneſs ſpread itſelf over my body. I ſhuddered without knowing wherefore; cold dews poured down my forehead, and my hair ſtood briſtling with alarm. Suddenly I heard ſlow and heavy ſteps aſcending the ſtaircaſe. By an involuntary movement I ſtarted up in my bed, and drew back the curtain. A ſingle ruſhlight, which glimmered upon the hearth,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:035729_0184_100659096C9B2C98"/>
ſhed a faint gleam through the apartment, which was hung with tapeſtry. The door was thrown open with violence. A figure entered, and drew near my bed with ſolemn meaſured ſteps. With trembling appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion I examined this midnight viſitor. God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty! it was the bleeding nun! It was my loſt companion! Her face was ſtill veiled, but ſhe no longer held her lamp and dagger. She lifted up her veil ſlowly. What a ſight preſented itſelf to my ſtartled eyes! I beheld before me an animated corſe. Her countenance was long and haggard; her cheeks and lips were bloodleſs; the paleneſs of death was ſpread over her features; and her eyeballs, fixed ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly upon me, were luſtreleſs and hollow.</p>
                     <p>I gazed upon the ſpectre with horror too great to be deſcribed. My blood was frozen in my veins. I would have called for aid, but the ſound expired ere it could paſs my lips. My nerves were bound up in impotence, and I remained in the ſame attitude inan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate as a ſtatue.</p>
                     <p>The viſionary nun looked upon me for ſome min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes in ſilence: there was ſomething petrifying in her regard. At length, in a low ſepulchral voice, ſhe pronounced the following words:</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>"Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine!</l>
                        <l>"Raymond! Raymond! I am thine!</l>
                        <l>"Leave thee will I never!</l>
                        <l>"I am thine!</l>
                        <l>"Thou art mine,</l>
                        <l>"Body and ſoul for ever!"</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>Breathleſs with fear, I liſtened while ſhe repeated my own expreſſions. The apparition ſeated herſelf
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:035729_0185_1006593CA4D71F30"/>
oppoſite to me at the foot of the bed, and was ſilent. Her eyes were fixed earneſtly upon mine; they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed endowed with the property of the rattleſnake's, for I ſtrove in vain to look off her. My eyes were faſcinated, and I had not the power of withdrawing them from the ſpectre's.</p>
                     <p>In this attitude ſhe remained for a whole long hour without ſpeaking or moving; nor was I able to do either. At length the clock ſtruck 'two.' The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition roſe from her ſeat, and approached the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of the bed. She graſped with her icy fingers my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> which hung lifeleſs upon the coverture, and, prſſing her cold lips to mine, again repeated,</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>"Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </l>
                        <l>"Raymond! Raymond! I am thine!" <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     </lg>
                     <p>She then dropped my hand, quitted the chamber with ſlow ſteps, and the door cloſed after her. Till that moment the faculties of my body had been all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended; thoſe of my mind had alone been waking. The charm now ceaſed to operate; the blood which had been frozen in my veins ruſhed back to my heart with violence; I uttered a deep groan, and ſunk life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon my pillow.</p>
                     <p>The adjoining room was only ſeparated from mine by a thin partition; it was occupied by the hoſt and his wife; the former was rouſed by my groan, and immediately haſtened to my chamber; the hoſteſs ſoon followed him. With ſome difficulty they ſucceeded in reſtoring me to my ſenſes, and immediately ſent for the phyſician, who arrived in all diligence. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my fever to be very much increaſed, and that,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:035729_0186_1006590AF2BD4DB8"/>
if I continued to ſuffer ſuch violent agitation, he would not take upon him to inſure my life. Some medicines which he gave me, in ſome degree tranquillized my ſpirits. I fell into a ſort of ſlumber towards day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, but fearful dreams prevented me from deriving any benefit from my repoſe. Agnes and the bleeding nun preſented themſelves by turns to my fancy, and combined to harraſs and torment me. I awoke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued and unrefreſhed. My fever ſeemed rather aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented than diminiſhed; the agitation of my mind impeded my fractured bones from knitting: I had frequent fainting fits, and during the whole day the phyſician judged it expedient not to quit me for two hours together.</p>
                     <p>The ſingularity of my adventure made me deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to conceal it from every one, ſince I could not expect that a circumſtance ſo ſtrange ſhould gain cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it. I was very uneaſy about Agnes. I knew not what ſhe would think at not finding me at the rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and dreaded her entertaining ſuſpicions of my fidelity. However, I depended upon Theodore's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and truſted that my letter to the baroneſs would convince her of the rectitude of my intentions. Theſe conſiderations ſomewhat lightened my inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude upon her account; but the impreſſion left upon my mind by my nocturnal viſitor grew ſtronger with every ſucceeding moment. The night drew near; I dreaded its arrival; yet I ſtrove to perſuade myſelf that the ghoſt would appear no more, and at all events I deſired that a ſervant might ſit up in my chamber.</p>
                     <p>The fatigue of my body, from not having ſlept on
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:035729_0187_10063CAB93594AF8"/>
the former night, co-operating with the ſtrong opiates adminiſtered to me in profuſion, at length procured me that repoſe of which I was ſo much in need. I ſunk into a profound and tranquil ſlumber, and had already ſlept for ſome hours, when the neighbouring clock rouſed me by ſtriking "one" its ſound brought with it to my memory all the horrors of the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The ſame cold ſhivering ſeized me. I ſtarted up in my bed, and perceived the ſervant faſt aſleep in an armchair near me. I called him by his name; he made no anſwer. I ſhook him forcibly by the arm, and ſtrove in vain to wake him: he was perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to my efforts. I now heard the heavy ſteps aſcending the ſtaircaſe; the door was thrown open, and again the bleeding nun ſtood before me. Once more my limbs were chained in ſecond infancy: once more I heard thoſe fatal words repeated:</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>" Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine!</l>
                        <l>" Raymond! Raymond! I am thine!" &amp;c.—</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>The ſcene which had ſhocked me ſo ſenſibly on the former night, was again preſented. The ſpectre again preſſed her lips to mine, again touched me with her rotting fingers, and, as on her firſt appearance, quitted the chamber as ſoon as the clock told "two."</p>
                     <p>Every night was this repeated. Far from growing accuſtomed to the ghoſt, every ſucceeding viſit inſpired me with greater horror. Her idea purſued me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and I became the prey of habitual melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. The conſtant agitation of my mind naturally retarded the re-eſtabliſhment of my health. Several months elapſed before I was able to quit my bed; and when, at length, I was moved to a ſofa, I was ſo faint,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:035729_0188_1006590EB935A528"/>
ſpiritleſs, and emaciated, that I could not croſs the room without aſſiſtance. The looks of my attendants ſufficiently denoted the little hope which they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of my recovery. The profound ſadneſs which oppreſſed me without remiſſion, made the phyſician conſider me to be an hypochondriac. The cauſe of my diſtreſs I carefully concealed in my own boſom, for I knew that no one could give me relief. The ghoſt was not even viſible to any eye but mine. I had frequently cauſed attendants to ſit up in my room; but the moment that the clock ſtruck "one," irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible ſlumber ſeized them, nor left them till the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>You may be ſurpriſed that during this time I made no inquiries after your ſiſter. Theodore, who with difficulty had diſcovered my abode, had quieted my apprehenſions for her ſafety; at the ſame time he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me, that all attempts to releaſe her from captiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity muſt be fruitleſs, till I ſhould be in a condition to return to Spain. The particulars of her adventure, which I ſhall now relate to you, were partly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to me by Theodore, and partly by Agnes her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>On the fatal night when her elopement was to have taken place, accident had not permitted her to quit her chamber at the appointed time. At length ſhe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured into the haunted room, deſcended the ſtaircaſe leading into the hall, found the gates open as ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and leſt the caſtle unobſerved. What was her ſurpriſe at not finding me ready to receive her! She examined the cavern, ranged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ough every alley of the neighbouring wood, and paſſed two full hours
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:035729_0189_1006594236DFDDE8"/>
in this fruitleſs inquiry. She could diſcover no traces either of me or of the carriage. Alarmed and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, her only reſource was to return to the caſtle before the baroneſs miſſed her; but here ſhe found herſelf in a freſh embarraſſment. The bell had already tolled "two," the ghoſtly hour was paſt, and the careful porter had locked the folding gates. After much ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolution, ſhe ventured to knock ſoftly. Luckily for her, Conrad was ſtill awake: he heard the noiſe and roſe, murmuring at being called up a ſecond time. No ſooner had he opened one of the doors, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the ſuppoſed apparition waiting there for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, than he uttered a loud cry, and dropped upon his knees. Agnes profited by his terror: ſhe glided by him, flew to her own apartment, and, having thrown off her ſpectre's trappings, retired to bed, endeavouring in vain to account for my diſappearing.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, Theodore, having ſeen my car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage drive off with the falſe Agnes, returned joyfully to the village. The next morning he releaſed Cune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonda from her confinement, and accompanied her to the caſtle. There he found the baron, his lady, and Don Gaſton, diſputing together upon the porter's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. All of them agreed in believing the exiſtence of ſpectres; but the latter contended, that for a ghoſt to knock for admittance was a proceeding till then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſed, and totally incompatible with the immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial nature of a ſpirit. They were ſtill diſcuſſing the ſubject, when the page appeared with Cunegonda, and cleared up the myſtery. On hearing his depoſition, it was agreed unanimouſly, that the Agnes whom Theodore had ſeen ſtep into my carriage muſt have been the bleeding nun, and that the ghoſt who had
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035729_0190_1006591045434658"/>
terrified Conrad was no other than Don Gaſton's daughter.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſurpriſe which this diſcovery occaſioned being over, the baroneſs reſolved to make it of uſe in perſuading her niece to take the veil. Fearing leſt ſo advantageous an eſtabliſhment for his daughter ſhould induce Don Gaſton to renounce his reſolution, ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed my letter, and continued to repreſent me as a needy unknown adventurer. A childiſh vanity had led me to conceal my real name even from my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; I wiſhed to be loved for myſelf, not for being the ſon and heir of the marquis de las Ciſternas. The conſequence was, that my rank was known to no one in the caſtle except the baroneſs, and ſhe took good care to confine the knowledge to her own breaſt. Don Gaſton having approved his ſiſter's deſign, Agnes was ſummoned to appear before them. She was taxed with having meditated an elopement, obliged to make a full confeſſion, and was amazed at the gentleneſs with which it was received: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> what was her afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when informed that the failure of her project muſt be attributed to me! Cunegonda, tutored by the baroneſs, told her, that when I releaſed her I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her to inform her lady that our connection was at an end, that the whole affair was occaſioned by a falſe report, and that it by no means ſuited my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to marry a woman without fortune or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.</p>
                     <p>To this account, my ſudden diſappearing gave but too great an air of probability. Theodore, who could have contradicted the ſtory, by Donna Rodolpha's order was kept out of her ſight. What proved a ſtill greater
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:035729_0191_10065943C3374DA0"/>
confirmation of my being an impoſtor, was the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of a letter from yourſelf, declaring that you had no ſort of acquaintance with Alphonſo d'Alvarada.—Theſe ſeeming proofs of my perfidy, aided by the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſinuations of her aunt, by Cunegonda's flattery, and her father's threats and anger, entirely conquered your ſiſter's repugnance to a convent. Incenſed at my behaviour, and diſguſted with the world in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſhe conſented to receive the veil. She paſſed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other month at the caſtle of Lindenberg, during which, my non-appearance confirmed her in her reſolution, and then accompanied Don Gaſton into Spain. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore was now ſet at liberty. He haſtened to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich, where I had promiſed to let him hear from me; but finding from Lucas that I never arrived there, he purſued his ſearch with indefatigable perſeverance, and at length ſucceeded in rejoining me at Ratiſbon.</p>
                     <p>So much was I altered, that ſcarcely could he recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect my features: the diſtreſs viſible upon his, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teſtified how lively was the intereſt which he felt for me. The ſociety of this amiable boy, whom I had always conſidered rather as a companion that a ſervant, was now my only comfort. His converſation was gay, yet ſenſible, and his obſervations ſhrewd and entertaining. He had picked up much more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than is uſual at his age; but what rendered him moſt agreeable to me, was his having a delightful voice, and no mean ſkill in muſic. He had alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſome taſte in poetry, and even ventured occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to write verſes himſelf. He frequently compoſed little ballads in Spaniſh. His compoſitions were but indifferent, I muſt confeſs, yet they were pleaſing to me from their novelty; and hearing him ſing them to
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:035729_0192_10065911EE7BA0B0"/>
his guitar was the only amuſement which I was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving. Theodore perceived well enough that ſomething preyed upon my mind; but as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the cauſe of my grief even from him, reſpect would not permit him to pry into my ſecrets.</p>
                     <p>One evening I was lying upon my ſofa, plunged in reflections very far from agreeable: Theodore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed himſelf by obſerving from the window a battle between two poſtillions, who were quarrelling in the inn yard.</p>
                     <p>"Ha! ha!" cried he ſuddenly, "yonder is the Great Mogul."</p>
                     <p>"Who?" ſaid I.</p>
                     <p>"Only a man who made me a ſtrange ſpeech at Munich."</p>
                     <p>"What was the purport of it?"</p>
                     <p>"Now you put me in mind of it, Segnor, it was a kind of meſſage to you, but truly it was not worth delivering. I believe the fellow to be mad, for my part. When I came to Munich in ſearch of you, I found him living at 'the King of the Romans,' and the hoſt gave me an odd account of him. By his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent he is ſuppoſed to be a foreigner, but of what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try nobody <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>n tell. He ſeemed to have no acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the town, ſpoke very ſeldom, and never was ſeen to ſmile. He had neither ſervants nor baggage; but his purſe ſeemed well furniſhed, and he did much good in the town. Some ſuppoſed him to be an Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian aſtrologer, others to be a travelling mountebank, and many declared that he was Doctor Fauſtus, whom
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:035729_0193_100659454CA92278"/>
the devil had ſent back to Germany. The landlord, however, told me, that he had the beſt reaſons to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be the Great Mogul incognito."</p>
                     <p>"But the ſtrange ſpeech Theodore—"</p>
                     <p>"True, I had almoſt forgotten the ſpeech: indeed, for that matter, it would not have been a great loſs if I had forgotten it altogether. You are to know, Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that while I was inquiring about you of the landlord, this ſtranger paſſed by. He ſtopped, and looked at me earneſtly—"Youth," ſaid he, in a ſolemn voice, "he whom you ſeek, has found that which he would fain loſe. My hand alone can dry up the blood. Bid your maſter wiſh for me when the clock ſtrikes "one."</p>
                     <p>"How?" cried I, ſtarting from my ſofa. [The words which Theodore had repeated, ſeemed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ſtranger's knowledge of my ſecret] "Fly to him, my boy! entreat him to grant me one moment's converſation."</p>
                     <p>Theodore was ſurpriſed at the vivacity of my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: however, he aſked no queſtions, but haſtened to obey me. I waited his return impatiently. But a ſhort ſpace of time had elapſed when he again appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and uſhered the expected gueſt into my chamber. He was a man of majeſtic preſence; his countenance was ſtrongly marked, and his eyes were large, black, and ſparkling: yet there was a ſomething in his look, which, the moment that I ſaw him, inſpired me with a ſecret awe, not to ſay horror. He was dreſſed plainly, his hair hung wildly upon his brow, and a band of black velvet, which encircled his forehead,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:035729_0194_100659139E9EA368"/>
ſpread over his features an additional gloom. His countenance wore the marks of profound melancholy, his ſtep was ſlow, and his manner grave, ſtately, and ſolemn.</p>
                     <p>He ſaluted me with politeneſs; and having replied to the uſual compliments of introduction, he motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Theodore to quit the chamber. The page in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly withdrew.</p>
                     <p>"I know your buſineſs," ſaid he, without giving me time to ſpeak. "I have the power of releaſing you from your nightly viſitor; but this cannot be done before Sunday. On the hour when the Sabbath morning breaks, ſpirits of darkneſs have leaſt influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over mortals. After Saturday the nun ſhall viſit you no more."</p>
                     <p>"May I not inquire," ſaid I, "by what means you are in poſſeſſion of a ſecret which I have carefully concealed from the knowledge of every one."</p>
                     <p>"How can I be ignorant of your diſtreſſes when their cauſe at this moment ſtands beſide you?"</p>
                     <p>I ſtarted. The ſtranger continued.</p>
                     <p>"Though to you only viſible for one hour in the twenty-four, neither day nor night does ſhe ever quit you; nor will ſhe ever quit you till you have granted her requeſt."</p>
                     <p>"And what is that requeſt?"</p>
                     <p>"That ſhe muſt herſelf explain: it lies not in my knowledge. Wait with patience for the night of Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urday: all ſhall be then cleared up."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="197" facs="unknown:035729_0195_10065946D76CBC10"/>
I dared not preſs him further. He ſoon after changed the converſation, and talked of various mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. He named people who had ceaſed to exiſt for many centuries, and yet with whom he appeared to have been perſonally acquainted. I could not mention a country, however diſtant, which he had not viſited, nor could I ſufficiently admire the extent and variety of his information. I remarked to him, that having travelled, ſeen and known ſo much, muſt have given him infinite pleaſure. He ſhook his head mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                     <p>"No one," he replied, "is adequate to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the miſery of my lot! Fate obliges me to be conſtantly in movement; I am not permitted to paſs more than a fortnight in the ſame place. I have no friend in the world, and, from the reſtleſſneſs of my deſtiny, I can never acquire one. Fain would I lay down my miſerable life, for I envy thoſe who enjoy the quiet of the grave; but death eludes me, and flies from my embrace. In vain do I throw myſelf in the way of danger. I plunge into the ocean, the waves throw me back with abhorrence upon the ſhore: I ruſh into fire; the flames recoil at my approach: I oppoſe myſelf to the fury of banditts; their ſwords become blunted, and break againſt my breaſt. The hungry tiger ſhudders at my approach, and the alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator flies from a monſter more horrible than itſelf. God has ſet his ſeal upon me, and all his creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect this fatal mark."</p>
                     <p>He put his hand to the velvet which was bound round his forehead. There was in his eyes an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fury, deſpair, and malevolence, that ſtruck hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:035729_0196_100659176EBBE9B8"/>
to my very ſoul. An involuntary convulſion made me ſhudder. The ſtranger perceived it.</p>
                     <p>"Such is the curſe impoſed on me," he continued: "I am doomed to inſpire all who look on me with terror and deteſtation. You already feel the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the charm, and with every ſucceeding mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will feel it more. I will not add to your ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by my preſence. Farewell till Saturday. As ſoon as the clock ſtrikes twelve, expect me at your chamber door."</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this he departed, leaving me in aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment at the myſterious turn of his manner and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. His aſſurances that I ſhould ſoon be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from the apparition's viſits, produced a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon my conſtitution. Theodore, whom I rather treated as an adopted child than a domeſtic, was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at his return to obſerve the amendment in my looks. He congratulated me on this ſymptom of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning health, and declared himſelf delighted at my having received ſo much benefit from my conference with the Great Mogul. Upon inquiry I found that the ſtranger had already paſſed eight days in Ratiſbon. According to his own account, therefore, he was only to remain there ſix days longer. Saturday was ſtill at the diſtance of three. Oh! with what impatience did I expect its arrival! In the interim the bleeding nun continued her nocturnal viſits; but hoping ſoon to be releaſed from them altogether, the effects which they produced on me became leſs violent than before.</p>
                     <p>The wiſhed for night arrived. To avoid creating ſuſpicion, I retired to bed at my uſual hour. But as ſoon as my attendants had left me, I dreſſed myſelf
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:035729_0197_1006594AA049AFA0"/>
again, and prepared for the ſtranger's reception. He entered my room upon the turn of midnight. A ſmall cheſt was in his hand, which he placed near the ſtove. He ſaluted me without ſpeaking; I returned the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment, obſerving an equal ſilence. He then opened his cheſt. The firſt thing which he produced was a ſmall wooden crucifix: he knelt down and gazed upon it mournfully, and caſt his eyes towards heaven. He ſeemed to be praying devoutly. At length he bowed his head reſpectfully kiſſed the crucifix thrice, and quitted his kneeling poſture. He next drew from the cheſt a covered goblet; with the liquor which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and which appeared to be blood, he ſprinkled the floor; and then dipping in it one end of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix, he deſcribed a circle in the middle of the room. Round about this he placed various reliques, ſculls, thigh bones, &amp;c. I obſerved that he diſpoſed them all in the forms of croſſes. Laſtly, he took out a large Bible, and beckoned me to follow him into the circle. I obeyed him.</p>
                     <p>"Be cautious not to utter a ſyllable!" whiſpered the ſtranger; "ſtep not out of the circle, and, as you love yourſelf, dare not to look upon my face!"</p>
                     <p>Holding the crucifix in one hand, the Bible in the other, he ſeemed to read with profound attention. The clock ſtruck one! As uſual I heard the ſpectre's ſteps upon the ſtaircaſe; but I was not ſeized with the accuſtomed ſhivering. I waited her approach with confidence. She entered the room, drew near the circle, and ſtopped. The ſtranger muttered ſome words, to me, unintelligible. Then raiſing his head from the book, and extending the crucifix towards the
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:035729_0198_1006597F978F6EE0"/>
ghoſt, he pronounced in a voice diſtinct and ſolemn,</p>
                     <p>"Beatrice! Beatrice! Beatrice!"</p>
                     <p>"What wouldſt thou?" replied the apparition in a hollow faltering tone.</p>
                     <p>"What diſturbs thy ſleep? Why doſt thou afflict and torture this youth? How can reſt be reſtored to thy unquiet ſpirit?"</p>
                     <p>"I dare not tell! I muſt not tell! Fain would I repoſe in my grave, but ſtern commands force me to prolong my puniſhment!"</p>
                     <p>"Knoweſt thou this blood? Knoweſt thou in whoſe veins it flowed? Beatrice! Beatrice! In his name, I charge thee to anſwer me."</p>
                     <p>"I dare not diſobey my taſkers."</p>
                     <p>"Dareſt thou diſobey me?"</p>
                     <p>He ſpoke in a commanding tone, and drew the ſable band from his forehead. In ſpite of his injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the contrary, curioſity would not ſuffer me to keep my eyes off his face; I raiſed them, and beheld a burning croſs impreſſed upon his brow. For the horror with which this object inſpired me I cannot account, but I never felt its equal. My ſenſes left me for ſome moments: a myſterious dread overcame my courage; and had not the exorciſer caught my hand, I ſhould have fallen out of the circle.</p>
                     <p>When I recovered myſelf, I perceived that the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing croſs had produced an effect no leſs violent upon the ſpectre. Her countenance expreſſed reverence
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:035729_0199_10065A0BD00DF858"/>
and horror, and her viſionary limbs were ſhaken by fear.</p>
                     <p>"Yes!" ſhe ſaid at length, "I tremble at that mark! I reſpect it! I obey you! Know then, that my bones lie ſtill unburied: they rot in the obſcurity of Lindenberg Hole. None but this youth has the right of conſigning them to the grave. His own lips have made over to me his body and his ſoul: never will I give back his promiſe, never ſhall he know a night devoid of terror, unleſs he engages to collect my mouldering bones, and depoſit them in the family vault of his Andaluſian caſtle. Then let thirty maſſes be ſaid for the repoſe of my ſpirit, and I trouble this world no more. Now let me depart. Thoſe flames are ſcorching!"</p>
                     <p>He let the hand drop ſlowly which held the crucifix, and which till then he had pointed towards her. The apparition bowed her head, and her form melted into air. The exorciſer led me out of the circle.

                     <p>"Don Raymond, you have heard the conditions on which repoſe is promiſed you. Be it your buſineſs to fulfil them to the letter. For me, nothing more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains than to clear up the darkneſs ſtill ſpread over the ſpectre's hiſtory, and inform you, that, when liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Beatrice bore the name of las Ciſternas. She was the great aunt of your grandfather. In quality of your relation, her aſhes demand reſpect from you, though the enormity of her crimes muſt excite your abhorrence. The nature of thoſe crimes no one is

more capable of explaining to you than myſelf. I was perſonally acquainted with the holy man who proſcribed her nocturnal riots in the caſtle of Linden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, and I hold this narrative from his own lips.</p>
                     <p>"Beatrice de las Ciſternas took the veil at an early age, not by her own choice, but at the expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of her parents. She was then too young to regret the pleaſure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of which her profeſſion deprived her: but no ſooner did her warm and voluptuous character begin to be developed, than ſhe abandoned herſelf freely to the impulſe of her paſſions, and ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firſt opportunity to procure their gratification. This opportunity was at length preſented, after many obſtacles which only added new force to her deſires. She contrived to elope from the convent, and fled to Germany with the baron Lindenberg. She lived at his caſtle ſeveral months as his acknowledged miſtreſs. All Bavaria was ſcandalized by her impudent and abandoned conduct. Her feaſts vied in luxury with Cleopatra's, and Lindenberg became the theatre of the moſt unbridled debauchery. Not ſatisfied with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing the incontinence of a proſtitute, ſhe profeſſed herſelf an atheiſt; ſhe took every opportunity to ſcoff at her monaſtic vows, and loaded with ridicule the moſt ſacred ceremonies of religion.</p>
                     <p>"Poſſeſſed of a character ſo depraved, ſhe did not long confine her affections to one object. Soon after her arrival at the caſtle, the baron's younger brother attracted her notice by his ſtrong marked features, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic ſtature, and herculean limbs. She was not of an humour to keep her inclination long unknown: but ſhe found in Otto von Lindenberg her equal in depravity. He returned her paſſion juſt ſufficiently to
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:035729_0201_1006594C259F12B0"/>
increaſe it; and when he had worked it up to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired pitch, he fixed the price of his love at his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's murder. The wretch conſented to this horrible agreement. A night was pitched upon for perpetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deed. Otto, who reſided on a ſmall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> a few miles diſtant from the caſtle, promiſed that, at one in the morning, he would be waiting for her at Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denberg Hole; that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e would bring with him a party of choſen friends, by whoſe aid he doubted not being able to make himſelf maſter of the caſtle; and that his next ſtep ſhould be the uniting her hand to his. It was this laſt promiſe which overruled every ſcruple of Beatrice; ſince, in ſpite of his affection for her, the baron had declared poſitively, that he never would make her his wife.</p>
                     <p>"The fatal night arrived. The baron ſlept in the arms of his perfidious miſtreſs when the caſtle bell ſtruck 'one.' Immediately Beatrice drew a dagger from underneath her pillow, and plunged it in her paramour's heart. The baron uttered a ſingle dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful groan, and expired. The murdereſs quitted her bed haſtily, took a lamp in one hand, in the other the bloody dagger, and bent her courſe towards the cavern. The porter dared not to refuſe opening the gates to one more dreaded in the caſtle than its maſter. Beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice reached Lindenberg Hole unoppoſed, where, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promiſe, ſhe found Otto waiting for her. He received, and liſtened to her narrative with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: but ere ſhe had time to aſk why he came unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, he convinced her that he wiſhed for no witneſſes to their interview. Anxious to conceal his ſhare in the murder, and to free himſelf from a woman whoſe violent and atrocious character made

him tremble with reaſon for his own ſafety, he had reſolved on the deſtruction of his wretched agent. Ruſhing upon her ſuddenly, he wreſted the dagger from her hand. He plunged it, ſtill reeking with his brother's blood, in her boſom, and put an end to her exiſtence by repeated blows.</p>
                     <p>"Otto now ſucceeded to the barony of Lindenberg. The murder was attributed ſolely to the fugitive nun, and no one ſuſpected him to have perſuaded her to the action. But though his crime was unpuniſhed by man, God's juſtice permitted him not to enjoy in peace his blood ſtained honors. Her bones lying ſtill unburied in the cave, the reſtleſs ſoul of Beatrice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to inhabit the caſtle. Dreſſed in her religious habit, in memory of her vows broken to Heaven, furniſhed with the dagger which had drank the blood of her paramour, and holding the lamp which had guided her flying ſteps, every night did ſhe ſtand before the bed of Otto. The moſt dreadful confuſion reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the caſtle. The vaulted chambers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded with ſhrieks and groans; and the ſpectre, as ſhe ranged along the antique galleries, uttered an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent mixture of prayers and blaſphemies. Otto was unable to withſtand the ſhock which he felt at this fearful viſion: its horrors increaſed with every ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding appearance.

But terrified by the accounts given him of the bleeding nun (ſo was the ſpectre called by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) the new baron called to his aſſiſtance a celebrated exorciſer. This holy man ſucceeded in obliging her to temporary repoſe: but though ſhe diſcovered to him her hiſtory, he was not permitted to reveal it to others, or cauſe her ſkeleton to be removed to hallowed ground. That office was reſerved for you; and till your coming her ghoſt was doomed to wander about the caſtle, and lament the crime which ſhe had there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. However, the exorciſer obliged her to ſilence during his lifetime. So long as he exiſted, the haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chamber was ſhut up, and the ſpectre was inviſible. At his death, which happened in five years after, ſhe again appeared, but only once on every fifth year, on the ſame day and at the ſame hour when ſhe plunged her knife in the heart of her ſleeping lover: ſhe then viſited the cavern which held her mouldering ſkeleton, returned to the caſtle as ſoon as the clock ſtruck 'two,' and was ſeen no more till the next five years had elapſed.</p>
                     <p>"She was doomed to ſuffer during the ſpace of a century. That period is paſt. Nothing now remains but to conſign to the grave the aſhes of Beatrice. I have been the means of releaſing you from your viſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary tormentor; and amidſt all the ſorrows which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs me, to think that I have been of uſe to you, is ſome conſolation.

"Stay yet one moment!" ſaid I; "you have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my curioſity with regard to the ſpectre, but you leave me a prey to yet greater reſpecting yourſelf. Deign to inform me to whom I am under ſuch real obligations. You mention circumſtances long paſt, and people long dead: you were perſonally acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the exorciſer, who, by your own account, has been deceaſed near a century. How am I to account for this? What means that burning croſs upon your forehead, and why did the ſight of it ſtrike ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to my ſoul?"</p>
                     <p>On theſe points he for ſome time refuſed to ſatisfy me. At length, overcome by my entreaties, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to clear up the whole, on condition that I would defer his explanation till the next day. With this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt I was obliged to comply, and he left me. In the morning my firſt care was to inquire after the myſterious ſtranger. Conceive my diſappointment, when informed that he had quitted Ratiſbon. I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched meſſengers in purſuit of him, but in vain. No traces of the fugitive were diſcovered. Since that moment I have never heard any more of him, and 'tis moſt probable that I never ſhall."</p>

                     <p>"Pardon me," replied the marquis: "when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated this adventure to my uncle, the cardinal duke, he told me, that he had no doubt of this ſingular man's being the celebrated character known univerſally by the name of <hi>The Wandering Jew.</hi> His not being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to paſs more than fourteen days on the ſame

The cardinal is fully perſuaded of it; and for my own part I am inclined to adopt the only ſolution which offers itſelf to this riddle<note n="*" place="bottom">I imagined the tradition of the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But, as many people have expreſſed to me their ignorance on the ſubject, it may be as well to ſtate, that the Wandering Jew is ſaid to have inſulted our Saviour, while leading to the Croſs, ſaying "Go, go, Thou King of the Jews!" on which Chriſt, looking at him, anſwered "Yea, I will go; but thou ſhalt tarry till I come again!"</note>" I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the narrative from which I have digreſſed.]</p>
                     <p>From this period I recovered my health ſo rapidly as to aſtoniſh my phyſicians. The bleeding nun ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no more, and I was ſoon able to ſet out for Lindenberg. The baron received me with open arms. I confided to him the ſequel of my adventure; and he was not a little pleaſed to find that his manſion would be no longer troubled with the phantom's quinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial viſits. I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>orry to perceive, that abſence had not weakened Donna Rodolpha's imprudent paſſion. In a private converſation which I had with her during my ſhort ſtay at the caſtle, ſhe renewed her attempts to perſuade me to return her affection. Regarding her as the primary cauſe of all my ſufferings, I entertained for her no other ſentiment than diſguſt. The ſkele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of Beatrice was found in the place which ſhe had mentioned. This being all that I ſought at Linden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, I haſtened to quit the baron's domains, equally anxious to perform the obſequies of the murdered nun, and eſcape the importunity of a woman whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted. I departed, followed by Donna Rodolpha's menaces that my contempt ſhould not be long unpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed.</p>

                        <pb n="208" facs="unknown:035729_0206_100659880FED3D70"/>
I now bent my courſe towards Spain with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Lucas with my baggage had joined me dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my abode at Lindenberg. I arrived in my native country without any accident, and immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to my father's caſtle in Andaluſia. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Beatrice were depoſited in the family vault, all due ceremonies performed, and the number of maſſes ſaid which ſhe had required. Nothing now hindered me from employing all my endeavours to diſcover the retreat of Agnes. The baroneſs had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me that her niece had already taken the veil; this intelligence I ſuſpected to have been forged by jealouſy, and hoped to find my miſtreſs ſtill at liberty to accept my hand. I inquired after her family; I found that before her daughter could reach Madrid, Donna Ineſilla was no more: you, my dear Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo, were ſaid to be abroad, but where I could not diſcover: your father was in a diſtant province, on a viſit to the duke de Medina; and as to Agnes, no one could or would inform me what was become of her. Theodore, according to promiſe, had returned to Straſbourg, where he found his grandfather dead, and Marguerite in poſſeſſion of his fortune. All her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions to remain with her were fruitleſs: he quitted her a ſecond time, and followed me to Madrid. He exerted himſelf to the utmoſt in forwarding my ſearch: but our united endeavours were unattended by ſucceſs. The retreat which concealed Agnes remained an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable myſtery; and I began to abandon all hopes of recovering her.</p>
                     <p>About eight months ago, I was returning to my hotel in a melancholy humour, having paſſed the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the playhouſe. The night was dark, and I
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:035729_0207_100659531D459760"/>
was unaccompanied. Plunged in reflections which were far from being agreeable, I perceived not that three men had followed me from the theatre, till on turning into an unfrequented ſtreet, they all attacked me at the ſame time with the utmoſt fury. I ſprang back a few paces, drew my ſword, and threw my cloak over my left arm. The obſcurity of the night was in my favour. For the moſt part the blows of the aſſaſſins, being aimed at random, failed to touch me. I at length was fortunate enough to lay one of my adverſaries at my feet; but before this I had already received ſo many wounds, and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> warmly preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that my deſtruction would have been inevitable, had not the claſhing of ſwords called a cavalier to my aſſiſtance. He ran towards me with his ſword drawn: ſeveral domeſtics followed him with torches. His ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival made the combat equal: yet would not the bravos abandon their deſign, till the ſervants were on the point of joining us. They then fled away, and we loſt them in the obſcurity.</p>
                     <p>The ſtranger now addreſſed himſelf to me with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, and inquired whether I was wounded. Faint with the loſs of blood, I could ſcarcely thank him for his ſeaſonable aid, and entreat him to let ſome of his ſervants convey me to the hotel de las Ciſternas. I no ſooner mentioned the name than he profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an acquaintance of my father's, and declared that he would not permit my being tranſported to ſuch a diſtance before my wounds had been examined. He added, that his houſe was hard by, and begged me to accompany him thither. His manner was ſo earneſt, that I could not reject his offer; and, leaning upon his arm, a few minutes brought me to the porch of a magnificent hotel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="210" facs="unknown:035729_0208_10065989AFAF7D30"/>

On entering the houſe, an old greyheaded domeſtic came to welcome my conductor: he inquired when the duke, his maſter, meant to quit the country, and was anſwered, that he would remain there yet ſome months. My deliverer then deſired the family ſurgeon to be ſummoned without delay: his orders were obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I was ſeated upon a ſofa in a noble apartment; and my wounds being examined, they were declared to be very ſlight. The ſurgeon, however, adviſed me not to expoſe myſelf to the night air; and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger preſſed me ſo earneſtly to take a bed in his houſe, that I conſented to remain where I was for the preſent.</p>
                     <p>Being now left alone with my deliverer, I took the opportunity of thanking him in more expreſs terms than I had done hitherto; but he begged me to be ſilent on that ſubject.</p>
                     <p>"I eſteem myſelf happy," ſaid he, "in having had it in my power to render you this little ſervice; and I ſhall think myſelf eternally obliged to my daughter for detaining me ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The high eſteem in which I have ever held the marquis de las Ciſternas, though accident has not permitted our being ſo intimate as I could wiſh, makes me rejoice in the opportunity of making his ſon's acquaintance. I am certain that my brother, in whoſe houſe you now are, will lament his not being at Madrid to receive you himſelf: but, in the duke's abſence, I am maſter of the family, and may aſſure you, in his name, that every thing in the hotel de Medina is perfectly at your diſpoſal."</p>

<pb n="211" facs="unknown:035729_0209_10065954A2CCC0A0"/>
It was only to be equalled by my ſecret ſatisfaction at the aſſurance, that Agnes inhabited the convent of St. Clare. This latter ſenſation was not a little weakened, when, in anſwer to my ſeemingly indifferent queſtions, he told me that his daughter had really taken the veil. I ſuffered not my grief at this circumſtance to take root in my mind: I flattered myſelf with the idea, that my uncle's credit at the court of Rome would remove this obſtacle, and that, without difficulty, I ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for my miſtreſs a diſpenſation from her vows. Buoyed up with this hope, I calmed the uneaſineſs of my boſom; and I redoubled my endeavours to appear grateful for the attention, and pleaſed with the ſociety, of Don Gaſton.</p>
                     <p>A domeſtic now entered the room, and informed me that the bravo whom I had wounded diſcovered ſome ſigns of life. I deſired that he might be carried to my father's hotel, and ſaid that, as ſoon as he recovered his voice, I would examine him reſpecting his reaſons for attempting my life. I was anſwered, that he was already able to ſpeak, though with difficulty. Don Gaſton's curioſity made him preſs me to interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the aſſaſſin in his preſence; but this curioſity I was by no means inclined to gratify. One reaſon was, that, ſuſpecting from whence the blow came, I was unwilling to place before Don Gaſton's eyes the guilt of a ſiſter. Another was, that I feared to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſed for Alphonſo d'Alvarada, and precautions taken in conſequence, to keep me from the ſight of Agnes. To avow my paſſion for his daughter, and endeavour to make him enter into my ſchemes, what I knew of Don Gaſton's character convinced me would be an imprudent ſtep; and conſidering it to be
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:035729_0210_1006598B6B4911E8"/>
eſſential that he ſhould know me for no other than the Conde de las Ciſternas, I was determined not to let him hear the bravo's confeſſion. I inſinuated to him, that as I ſuſpected a lady to be concerned in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whoſe name might accidentally eſcape from the aſſaſſin, it was neceſſary for me to examine the man in private. Don Gaſton's delicacy would not permit his urging the point any longer, and, in conſequence, the bravo was conveyed to my hotel.</p>
                     <p>The next morning I took leave of my hoſt, who was to return to the duke on the ſame day. My wounds had been ſo trifling, that, except being obliged to wear my arm in a ſling for a ſhort time, I felt no inconvenience from the night's adventure. The ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon who examined the bravo's wound declared it to be mortal: he had juſt time to confeſs that he had been inſtigated to murder me by the revengeful Donna Rodolpha, and expired in a few minutes after.</p>
                     <p>All my thoughts were now bent upon getting to the ſpeech of my lovely nun. Theodore ſet himſelf to work, and, for this time, with better ſucceſs. He attacked the gardener of St. Clare ſo forcibly with bribes and promiſes, that the old man was entirely gained over to my intereſts; and it was ſettled that I ſhould be introduced into the convent in the character of his aſſiſtant. The plan was put into execution without delay. Diſguiſed in a common habit, and a black patch covering one of my eyes, I was preſented to the lady prioreſs, who condeſcended to approve of the gardener's choice. I immediately entered upon my employment. Botany having been a favourite ſtudy with me, I was by no means at a loſs in my new
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:035729_0211_10065956298EE698"/>
ſtation. For ſome days I continued to work in the convent garden without meeting the object of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe. On the fourth morning I was more ſucceſsful. I heard the voice of Agnes, and was ſpeeding towards the ſound, when the ſight of the domina ſtopped me. I drew back with caution, and concealed myſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a thick clump of trees.</p>
                     <p>The prioreſs advanced, and ſeated herſelf with Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes on a bench at no great diſtance. I heard her, in an angry tone, blame her companion's continual mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy. She told her, that to weep the loſs of any lover, in her ſituation, was a crime; but that to weep the loſs of a faithleſs one was folly and abſurdity in the extreme. Agnes replied in ſo low a voice that I could not diſtinguiſh her words, but I perceived that ſhe uſed terms of gentleneſs and ſubmiſſion. The converſation was interrupted by the arrival of a young penſioner, who informed the domina that ſhe was waited for in the parlour. The old lady roſe, kiſſed the cheek of Agnes, and retired. The new comer remained. Agnes ſpoke much to her in praiſe of ſomebody whom I could not make out; but her audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſeemed highly delighted and intereſted by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. The nun ſhewed her ſeveral letters: the other peruſed them with evident pleaſure, obtained permiſſion to copy them, and withdrew for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to my great ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner was ſhe out of ſight, than I quitted my concealment. Fearing to alarm my lovely miſtreſs, I drew near her gently, intending to diſcover myſelf by degrees. But who for a moment can deceive the eyes of love? She raiſed her head at my approach,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:035729_0212_1006598F33898AE0"/>
and recogniſed me, at a ſingle glance. She roſe haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily from her ſeat with an exclamation of ſurpriſe, and attempted to retire: but I followed her, detained her, and entreated to be heard. Perſuaded of my falſehood, ſhe refuſed to liſten to me, and ordered me poſitively to quit the garden. It was now my turn to refuſe. I proteſted that, however dangerous might be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, I would not leave her till ſhe had heard my juſtification. I aſſured her, that ſhe had been deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the artifices of her relations; that I could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince her, beyond the power of doubt, that my paſſion had been pure and diſintereſted; and I aſked her what ſhould induce me to ſeek her in the convent, were I influenced by the ſelfiſh motives which my enemies had aſcribed to me.</p>
                     <p>My prayers, my arguments, and vows not to quit her till ſhe had promiſed to liſten to me, united to her fears leſt the nuns ſhould ſee me with her, to her nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural curioſity, and to the affection which ſhe ſtill felt for me, in ſpite of my ſuppoſed deſertion, at length prevailed. She told me that to grant my requeſt at that moment was impoſſible; but ſhe engaged to be in the ſame ſpot at eleven that night, and to converſe with me for the laſt time. Having obtained this promiſe, I releaſed her hand, and ſhe fled back with rapidity towards the convent.</p>
                     <p>I communicated my ſucceſs to my ally, the old gardener: he pointed out an hiding place, where I might ſhelter myſelf till night without fear of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. Thither I betook myſelf at the hour when I ought to have retired with my ſuppoſed maſter, and waited impatiently for the appointed time. The
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:035729_0213_10065958F4955D60"/>
chillneſs of the night was in my favour, ſince it kept the other nuns confined to their cells. Agnes alone was inſenſible of the inclemency of the air, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eleven, joined me at the ſpot which had witneſſed our former interview. Secure from interruption, I related to her the true cauſe of my diſappearing on the fatal fifth of May. She was evidently much affected by my narrative. When it was concluded, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the injuſtice of her ſuſpicio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, and blamed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for having taken the veil through deſpair at my ingratitude.</p>
                     <p>"But now it is too late to repine!" ſhe added; "the die is thrown: I have pronounced my vows, and dedicated myſelf to the ſervice of Heaven. I am ſenſible how ill I am calculated for a convent. My diſguſt at a monaſtic life increaſes daily: ennui and diſcontent are my conſtant companions; and I will not conceal from you, that the paſſion which I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felt for one ſo near being my huſband, is not yet extinguiſhed in my boſom: but we muſt part! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable barriers divide us from each other, and on this ſide the grave we muſt never meet again!"</p>
                     <p>I now exerted myſelf to prove, that our union was not ſo impoſſible as ſhe ſeemed to think it. I vaunted to her the cardinal duke of Lerma's influence at the court of Rome. I aſſured her, that I ſhould eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a diſpenſation from her vows; and I doubted not but Don Gaſton would coincide with my views, when informed of my real name and long attachment. Agnes replied, that ſince I encouraged ſuch an hope, I could know but little of her father. Liberal and kind in every other reſpect, ſuperſtition formed the only

ſtain upon his character. Upon this head he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible: he ſacrificed his deareſt intereſts to his ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and would conſider it an inſult to ſuppoſe him capable of authorizing his daughter to break her vows to Heaven.</p>
                     <p>"But ſuppoſe," ſaid I, interrupting her, "ſuppoſe that he ſhould diſapprove of our union: let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ignorant of my proceedings till I have reſcued you from the priſon in which you are now confined. Once my wife, you are free from his authority. I need from him no pecuniary aſſiſtance; and when he ſees his reſentment to be unavailing, he will doubtleſs reſtore you to his favour. But, let the worſt happen; ſhould Don Gaſton be irreconcileable, my relations will vie with each other in making you forget his loſs; and you will find in my father a ſubſtitute for the parent of whom I ſhall deprive you."</p>
                     <p>"Don Raymond," replied Agnes, in a firm and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olute voice, "I love my father: he has treated me harſhly in this one inſtance; but I have received from him, in every other, ſo many proofs of love, that his affection is become neceſſary to my exiſtence. Were I to quit the convent, he never would forgive me; nor can I think that, on his death bed, he would leave me his curſe, without ſhuddering at the very idea. Beſides, I am conſcious myſelf, that my vows are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Then baniſh from your mind the idea of our being ever unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

I ſtrove to overrule theſe ill grounded ſcruples. We were ſtill diſputing upon the ſubject, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent bell ſummoned the nuns to matins. Agnes was obliged to attend the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> but ſhe left me not till I had compelled her to promiſe, that on the following night ſhe would be at the ſame place at the ſame hour. Theſe meetings continued for ſeveral weeks uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted: and 'tis now, Lorenzo, that I muſt implore your indulgence. Reflect upon our ſituation, our youth, our long attachment. Weigh all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which attended our aſſignations, and you will confeſs the temptation to have been irreſiſtible; you will even pardon me when I acknowledge that, in an unguarded moment, the honor of Agnes was ſacrificed to my paſſion."</p>
                     <p>[Lorenzo's eyes ſparkled with fury; a deep crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſpread itſelf over his face: he ſtarted from his ſeat, and attempted to draw his ſword. The marquis was aware of his movement, and caught his hand: he preſſed it affectionately:</p>
                     <p>"My friend! my brother! hear me to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! Till then reſtrain your paſſion; and be at leaſt convinced, that if what I have related is criminal, the blame muſt fall upon me, and not upon your ſiſter."</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo ſuffered himſelf to be prevailed upon by Don Raymond's entreaties: he reſumed his place, and liſtened to the reſt of the narrative with a gloomy and impatient countenance. The marquis thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued:]</p>

Aſhamed of my impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I with difficulty found words to excuſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I endeavoured to conſole her: I threw myſelf at her feet, and entreated her forgiveneſs. She forced her hand from me, which I had taken and would have preſſed to my lips.</p>
                     <p>"To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I looked upon you as my friend, my protector; I truſted myſelf in your hands with confidence, and, relying upon your honor, thought that mine ran no riſk: and 'tis by you, whom I adored, that I am covered with infamy! 'Tis by you that I have been ſeduced into breaking my vows to God, that I am reduced to a level with the baſeſt of my ſex! Shame upon you, villain, you ſhall never ſee me more!"</p>
                     <p>She ſtarted from the bank on which ſhe was ſeated. I endeavoured to detain her; but ſhe diſengaged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from me with violence, and took refuge in the convent.</p>
                     <p>I retired, filled with confuſion and inquietude. The next morning I failed not, as uſual, to appear in the garden; but Agnes was no where to be ſeen. At night I waited for her at the place where we generally met. I found no better ſucceſs. Several days and nights paſſed away in the ſame manner. At length I ſaw my offended miſtreſs croſs the walk, on whoſe borders I was working: ſhe was accompanied by the ſame young penſioner, on whoſe arm ſhe ſeemed, from
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:035729_0217_1006595D277C2398"/>
weakneſs, obliged to ſupport herſelf. She looked upon me for a moment, but inſtantly turned her head away. I waited her return; but ſhe paſſed on to the convent without paying any attention to me, or the penitent looks with which I implored her forgiveneſs.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the nuns were retired, the old gardener joined me with a ſorrowful air.</p>
                     <p>"Segnor," ſaid he, "it grieves me to ſay, that I can be no longer of uſe to you; the lady whom you uſed to meet has juſt aſſured me, that if I admitted you again into the garden, ſhe would diſcover the whole buſineſs to the lady prioreſs. She bade me tell you alſo, that your preſence was an inſult, and that, if you ſtill poſſeſs the leaſt reſpect for her, you will never attempt to ſee her more. Excuſe me then for informing you, that I can favour your diſguiſe no longer. Should the prioreſs be acquainted with my conduct, ſhe might not be contented with diſmiſſing me her ſervice: out of revenge, ſhe might accuſe me of having profaned the convent, and cauſe me to be thrown into the priſons of the Inquiſition."</p>
                     <p>Fruitleſs were my attempts to conquer his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He denied me all future entrance into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and Agnes perſevered in neither letting me ſee or hear from her. In about a fortnight after, a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent illneſs which had ſeized my father obliged me to ſet out for Andaluſia. I haſtened thither, and, as I imagined, found the marquis at the point of death. Though, on its firſt appearance, his complaint was declared mortal, he lingered out ſeveral months; dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, my attendance upon him in his malady, and the occupation of ſettling his affairs after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe,

                     <p>[Here the marquis unlocked a drawer of a cabinet; he took out a folded paper, which he preſented to his auditor. Lorenzo opened it, and recogniſed his ſiſter's hand. The contents were as follows:</p>

                           <p>INTO what an abyſs of miſery have you plunged me! Raymond, you force me to become as crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as yourſelf. I had reſolved never to ſee you more; if poſſible, to forget you; if not, only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you with hate. A being, for whom I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready feel a mother's tenderneſs, ſolicits me to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my ſeducer, and apply to his love for the means of preſervation. Raymond, your child lives in my boſom. I tremble at the vengeance of the prioreſs. I tremble much for myſelf, yet more for the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent creature whoſe exiſtence depends upon mine. Both of us are loſt, ſhould my ſituation be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Adviſe me, then, what ſteps to take, but ſeek not to ſee me. The gardener, who undertakes to deliver this, is diſmiſſed, and we have nothing to hope from that quarter. The man engaged in his place is of incorruptible fidelity. The beſt means of conveying to me your anſwer, is by concealing it under the great ſtatue of St. Francis, which ſtands in the Capuchin cathedral; thither I go every Thurſday to confeſſion, and ſhall eaſily have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſecuring your letter. I hear that you are now abſent from Madrid. Need I entreat you to write the very moment of your return? I will not think it. Ah! Raymond! mine is a cruel ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation!

Deceived by my neareſt relations, compelled to embrace a profeſſion the duties of which I am ill calculated to perform, conſcious of the ſanctity of thoſe duties, and ſeduced into violating them by one whom I leaſt ſuſpected of perfidy, I am now oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by circumſtances, to chooſe between death and perjury. Woman's timidity, and maternal affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, permit me not to balance in the choice. I feel all the guilt into which I plunge myſelf when I yield to the plan which you before propoſed to me. My poor father's death, which has taken place ſince we met, has removed one obſtacle. He ſleeps in his grave, and I no longer dread his anger. But from the anger of God, oh! Raymond! who ſhall ſhield me? Who can protect me againſt my conſcience, againſt myſelf? I dare not dwell upon theſe thoughts; they will drive me mad. I have taken my reſolution. Procure a diſpenſation from my vows. I am ready to fly with you. Write to me, my huſband! Tell me that abſence has not abated your love! Tell me that you will reſcue from death your unborn child, and its unhappy mother. I live in all the agonies of terror. Every eye which is fixed upon me, ſeems to read my ſecret and my ſhame. And you are the cauſe of thoſe agonies! Oh! when my heart firſt loved you, how little did it ſuſpect you of making it feel ſuch pangs!</p>

                        </gap>oon arranged. When Don Gaſton diſcovered to me his daughter's retreat, I entertained no doubt of her readineſs to quit the convent: I had, therefore, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted the cardinal duke of Lerma with the whole affair, who immediately buſied himſelf in obtaining the neceſſary bull. Fortunately, I had afterwards neglected to ſtop his proceedings. Not long ſince I received a letter from him, ſtating that he expected daily to receive the order from the court of Rome. Upon this I would willingly have relied; but the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal wrote me word, that I muſt find ſome means of conveying Agnes out of the convent, unknown to the prioreſs. He doubted not but this latter would be much incenſed by looſing a perſon of ſuch high rank from her ſociety, and conſider the renunciation of Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as an inſult to her houſe. He repreſented her as a woman of a violent and revengeful character, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of proceeding to the greateſt extremities. It was therefore to be feared leſt, by confining Agnes in the convent, ſhe ſhould fruſtrate my hopes, and render the pope's mandate unavailing. Influenced by this conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, I reſolved to carry off my miſtreſs, and conceal her in the cardinal duke's eſtate till the arrival of the expected bull. He approved of my deſign, and profeſſed himſelf ready to give a ſhelter to the fugitive. I next cauſed the new gardener of St. Clare to be ſeized pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and confined in my hotel. By this means I became maſter of the key to the garden door, and I had now nothing more to do than prepare Agnes for the elopement. This was done by the letter which you ſaw me deliver this evening. I told her in it, that I ſhould be ready to receive her at twelve to-morrow

                     <p>You have now, Lorenzo, heard the whole of my long narrative. I have nothing to ſay in my excuſe, ſave that my intentions towards your ſiſter have been ever the moſt honourable; that it has always been, and ſtill is, my deſign to make her my wife; and that I truſt, when you conſider theſe circumſtances, our youth, and our attachment, you will not only forgive our momentary lapſe from virtue, but will aid me in repairing my faults to Agnes, and ſecuring a lawful title to her perſon and her heart.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>HERE the marquis concluded his adventures. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo, before he could determine on his reply, paſſed ſome moments in reflection. At length he broke ſilence.</p>
                     <p>"Raymond," ſaid he, taking his hand, "ſtrict hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or would oblige me to waſh off in your blood the ſtain thrown upon my family, but the circumſtances of your caſe forbid me to conſider you as an enemy. The temptation was too great to be reſiſted. 'Tis the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of my relations which has occaſioned theſe misfortunes, and they are more the offenders than yourſelf and Agnes. What has paſſed between you cannot be recalled, but may yet be repaired by uniting you to my ſiſter. You have ever been, you ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be, my deareſt, and indeed, my only friend. I feel for Agnes the trueſt affection, and there is no one on whom I would beſtow her more willingly than on yourſelf. Purſue, then, your deſign. I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company you to-morrow night, and conduct her my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the houſe of the cardinal. My preſence will be a ſanction for her conduct, and prevent her incurr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blame by her flight from the convent."</p>
                     <p>The marquis thanked him in terms by no means deficient in gratitude. Lorenzo then informed him
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:035729_0223_100659644B40D048"/>
that he had nothing more to apprehend from Donna Rodolpha's enmity. Five months had already elapſed ſince, in an exceſs of paſſion, ſhe broke a blood veſſel, and expired in the courſe of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ew hours. He then proceeded to mention the intereſts of Antonia. The marquis was much ſurpriſed at hearing of this new relation. His father had carried his hatred of Elvira to the grave, and had never given the leaſt hint that he knew what was become of his eldeſt ſon's widow. Don Raymond aſſured his friend, that he was not miſtaken in ſuppoſing him ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his ſiſter-in-law, and her amiable daughter. The preparations for the elopement would not permit his viſiting them the next day; but in the mean while, he deſired Lorenzo to aſſure them of his friendſhip, and to ſupply Elvira, upon his account, with any ſums which ſhe might want. This the youth promiſed to do, as ſoon as her abode ſhould be known to him. He then took leave of his future brother, and returned to the palace de Medina.</p>
                     <p>The day was already on the point of breaking when the marquis retired to his chamber. Conſcious that his narrative would take up ſome hours, and wiſhing to ſecure himſelf from interruption, on returning to the hotel he ordered his attendants not to fit up for him; conſequently, he was ſomewhat ſurpriſed, on entering his anti-room, to find Theodore eſtabliſhed there. The page ſat near a table, with a pen in his hand, and was ſo totally occupied by his employment, that he perceived not his lord's approach. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis ſtopped to obſerve him. Theodore wrote a few lines, then pauſed and ſcratched out a part of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; then wrote again, ſmiled, and ſeemed highly

                     <p>"There it is!" cried he aloud: "now they are charming!"</p>
                     <p>His tranſports were interrupted by a laugh from the marquis, who ſuſpected the nature of his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>"What is ſo charming, Theodore?"</p>
                     <p>The youth ſtarted, and looked round: he bluſhed, ran to the table, ſeized the paper on which he had been writing, and concealed it in confuſion.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my lord, I knew not that you were ſo near me. Can I be of uſe to you? Lucas is already gone to bed."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall follow his example when I have given my opinion of your verſes."</p>

                     <p>Theodore's cheeks glowed with ſtill deeper crimſon: he longed to ſhew his poetry, but firſt choſe to be preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it.</p>

thing. I am no judge of verſes, and for my own part never compoſed more than ſix lines in my life: thoſe ſix produced ſo unlucky an effect, that I am fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to compoſe another. But I wander from my ſubject. I was going to ſay that you cannot em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your time worſe than in making verſes. An author, whether good or bad, or between both, is an animal whom every body is privileged to attack: for though all are not able to write books, all conceive themſelves able to judge them. A bad compoſition carries with it its own puniſhment—contempt and ridicule. A good one excites envy, and entails upon its author a thouſand mortifications: he finds himſelf aſſailed by partial and ill humoured criticiſm: one man finds fault with the plan, another with the ſtyle, a third with the precept which it ſtrives to inculcate; and they who cannot ſucceed in finding fault with the book, employ themſelves in ſtigmatizing its author. They maliciouſly rake out from obſcurity every little circumſtance which may throw ridicule upon his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate character or conduct, and aim at wounding the man ſince they cannot hurt the writer. In ſhort, to enter the liſts of literature is wilfully to expoſe your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the arrows of neglect, ridicule, envy, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment. Whether you write well or ill, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that you will not eſcape from blame. Indeed this circumſtance contains a young author's chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation: he remembers that Lope de Vega and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derona had unjuſt and envious critics, and he modeſtly conceives himſelf to be exactly in their predicament. But I am conſcious that all theſe ſage obſervations are thrown away upon you. Authorſhip is a mania, to conquer which, no reaſons are ſufficiently ſtrong; and you might as eaſily perſuade me not to love, as I
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:035729_0230_100659A1B8CB8D00"/>
perſuade you not to write. However, if you cannot help being occaſionally ſeized with a poetical par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oxyſm, take at leaſt the precaution of communicating your verſes to none but thoſe whoſe partiality for you ſecures their approbation."</p>
                     <p>"Then, my lord, you do not think theſe lines tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable?" ſaid Theodore, with an humble and dejected air.</p>
                     <p>"You miſtake my meaning. As I ſaid before, they have pleaſed me much: but my regard for you makes me partial, and others might judge them leſs favourably. I muſt ſtill remark, that even my preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in your favour does not blind me ſo much as to prevent my obſerving ſeveral faults. For inſtance, you make a terrible confuſion of metaphors; you are too apt to make the ſtrength of your lines conſiſt more in the words than ſenſe; ſome of the verſes ſeem intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced only in order to rhyme with others; and moſt of the beſt ideas are borrowed from other poets, though poſſibly you are unconſcious of the theft yourſelf. Theſe faults may occaſionally be excuſed in a work of length; but a ſhort poem muſt be correct and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect."</p>
                     <p>"All this is true, Segnor; but you ſhould conſider that I only write for pleaſure."</p>
                     <p>"Your defects are the leſs excuſeable. Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>correctneſs may be forgiven, who work for money, who are obliged to complete a given taſk in a given time, and are paid according to the bulk, not value, of their productions. But in thoſe whom no neceſſity forces to turn author, who merely write for fame, and
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:035729_0231_1006596CED64C210"/>
have full leiſure to poliſh their compoſitions, faults are unpardonable, and merit the ſharpeſt arrows of criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm."</p>
                     <p>The marquis roſe from the ſofa; the page looked diſcouraged and melancholy; and this did not eſcape his maſter's obſervation.</p>
                     <p>"However," added he ſmiling, "I think that theſe lines do you no diſcredit. Your ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of your little poem upon the whole gave me much pleaſure; and if it is not aſking too great a favour, I ſhall be highly obliged to you for a copy."</p>
                     <p>The youth's countenance immediately cleared up. He perceived not the ſmile, half approving, half iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical, which accompanied the requeſt, and he promiſed the copy with great readineſs. The marquis with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to his chamber, much amuſed by the inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous effect produced upon Theodore's vanity by the concluſion of his criticiſm. He threw himſelf upon his couch, ſleep ſoon ſtole over him, and his dreams preſented him with the moſt flattering pictures of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs with Agnes.</p>
                     <p>On reaching the hotel de Medina, Lorenzo's firſt care was to inquire for letters. He found ſeveral waiting for him; but that which he ſought was not amongſt them. Leonella had found it impoſſible to write that evening. However, her impatience to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Don Chriſtoval's heart, on which ſhe flattered herſelf with having made no ſlight impreſſion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her not to paſs another day without informing him where ſhe was to be found. On her return from
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:035729_0232_100659A35BFCEAC0"/>
the Capuchin church, ſhe had related to her ſiſter, with exultation, how attentive an handſome cavalier had been to her; as alſo how his companion had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to plead Antonia's cauſe with the marquis de las Ciſternas. Elvira received this intelligence with ſenſations very different from thoſe with which it was communicated. She blamed her ſiſter's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence in confiding her hiſtory to an abſolute ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and expreſſed her fears leſt this inconſiderate ſtep ſhould prejudice the marquis againſt her. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of her apprehenſions ſhe concealed in her own breaſt. She had obſerved with inquietude, that at the mention of Lorenzo a deep bluſh ſpread itſelf over her daughter's cheek. The timid Antonia dared not to pronounce his name. Without knowing wherefore, ſhe felt embarraſſed when he was made the ſubject of diſcourſe, and endeavoured to change the converſation to Ambroſio. Elvira perceived the emotions of this young boſom: in conſequence, ſhe inſiſted upon Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella's breaking her promiſe to the cavaliers. A ſigh, which on hearing this order eſcaped from Antonia, confirmed the wary mother in her reſolution.</p>
                     <p>Through this reſolution Leonella was determined to break: ſhe conceived it to be inſpired by envy, and that her ſiſter dreaded her being elevated above her. Without imparting her deſign to any one, ſhe took an opportunity of diſpatching the following note to Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo: it was delivered to him as ſoon as he awoke:</p>

not in what words to inform you, how ſtrange a reception my ſiſter gave your kind wiſh to viſit her. She is an odd woman, with many good points about her; but her jealouſy of me frequently makes her conceive notions quite unaccountable. On hearing that your friend had paid ſome little at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to me, ſhe immediately took the alarm: ſhe blamed my conduct, and has abſolutely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den me to let you know our abode. My ſtrong ſenſe of gratitude for your kind offers of ſervice, and—ſhall I confeſs it? my deſire to behold once more the too amiable Don Chriſtoval, will not permit my obeying her injunctions. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtolen a moment to inform you, that we lodge in the ſtrada di San Jago, four doors from the palace d'Albornos, and nearly oppoſite to the barber's Miguel Coello. Inquire for Donna Elvira Dalfa, ſince, in compliance with her father-in-law's order, my ſiſter continues to be called by her maiden name. At eight this evening you will be ſure of finding us: but let not a word drop, which may raiſe a ſuſpicion of my having written this letter.

                     <p>Lorenzo had no ſooner peruſed this note, than he ſet out in ſearch of Don Chriſtoval. Not being able to find him in the courſe of the day, he proceeded to Donna Elvira's alone, to Leonella's infinite diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:035729_0234_100659A4F8896F38"/>
The domeſtic by whom he ſent up his name having already declared his lady to be at home, ſhe had no excuſe for refuſing his viſit: yet ſhe conſented to receive it with much reluctance. That reluctance was increaſed by the changes which his approach pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Antonia's countenance; nor was it by any means abated, when the youth himſelf appeared. The ſymmetry of his perſon, animation of his features, and natural elegance of his manners and addreſs, convinced Elvira that ſuch a gueſt muſt be dangerous for her daughter. She reſolved to treat him with diſtant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, to decline his ſervices with gratitude for the tender of them, and to make him feel, without offence, that his future viſits would be far from acceptable.</p>
                     <p>On his entrance he found Elvira, who was indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, reclining upon a ſofa; Antonia ſat by her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery frame; and Leonella in a paſtoral dreſs, held <hi>"Montemayor's Diana."</hi> In ſpite of her being the mother of Antonia, Lorenzo could not help expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find in Elvira, Leonella's true ſiſter and the daughter of "as honeſt a pains-taking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> as any in Cordova." A ſingle glance was ſufficient to undeceive him. He beheld a woman whoſe features, though impaired by time and ſorrow, ſtill bore the marks of diſtinguiſhed beauty: a ſerious dignity reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her countenance, but was tempered by a grace and ſweetneſs which rendered her truly enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Lorenzo fancied that ſhe muſt have reſembled her daughter in her youth, and readily excuſed the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence of the late Condé de las Ciſternas. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to be ſeated, and immediately reſumed her place upon the ſofa.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="237" facs="unknown:035729_0235_100659701EB17F88"/>
Antonia received him with a ſimple reverence, and continued her work: her cheeks were ſuffuſed with crimſon, and ſhe ſtrove to conceal her emotion by leaning over her embroidery frame. Her aunt alſo choſe to play off her airs of modeſty: ſhe affected to bluſh and tremble, and waited with her eyes caſt down to receive, as ſhe expected, the compliments of Don Chriſtoval. Finding, after ſome time, that no ſign of his approach was given, ſhe ventured to look round the room, and perceived with vexation that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina was unaccompanied. Impatience would not permit her waiting for an explanation: interrupting Lorenzo, who was delivering Raymond's meſſage, ſhe deſired to know what was become of his friend.</p>
                     <p>He, who thought it neceſſary to maintain himſelf in her good graces, ſtrove to conſole her under her diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment by committing a little violence upon truth.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! Segnora," he replied in a melancholy voice, how grieved will he be at loſing this opportunity of paying you his reſpects! A relation's illneſs has oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to quit Madrid in haſte: but on his return he will doubtleſs ſeize the firſt moment with tranſport to throw himſelf at your feet!</p>
                     <p>As he ſaid this, his eyes met thoſe of Elvira: ſhe puniſhed his falſehood ſufficiently by darting at him a look expreſſive of diſpleaſure and reproach. Neither did the deceit anſwer his intention. Vexed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, Leonella roſe from her ſeat, and retired in dudgeon to her own apartment.</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo haſtened to repair the fault which had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him in Elvira's opinion. He related his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:035729_0236_100659A8E8153EE8"/>
with the marquis reſpecting her: he aſſured her that Raymond was prepared to acknowledge her for his brother's widow; and that, till it was in his power to pay his compliments to her in perſon, Lorenzo was commiſſioned to ſupply his place. This intelligence relieved Elvira from an heavy weight of uneaſineſs: ſhe had now found a protector for the fatherleſs An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia, for whoſe future fortunes ſhe had ſuffered the greateſt apprehenſions. She was not ſparing of her thanks to him who had interfered ſo generouſly in her behalf: but ſtill ſhe gave him no invitation to repeat his viſit. However, when upon riſing to depart he requeſted permiſſion to inquire after her health occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, the polite earneſtneſs of his manner, gratitude for his ſervices, and reſpect for his friend the marquis, would not admit of a refuſal. She conſented reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly to receive him: he promiſed not to abuſe her goodneſs, and quitted the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Antonia was now left alone with her mother: a temporary ſilence enſued. Both wiſhed to ſpeak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ſubject, but neither new how to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it. The one felt a baſhfulneſs which ſealed up her lips, and for which ſhe could not account; the other feared to find her apprehenſions true, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire her daughter with notions to which ſhe might ſtill be a ſtranger. At length Elvira began the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
                     <p>"That is a charming young man, Antonia; I am much pleaſed with him. Was he long near you yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday in the cathedral?"</p>
                     <p>"He quitted me not for a moment while I ſtaid in the church: he gave me his ſeat, and was very oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and attentive."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="239" facs="unknown:035729_0237_10065971C766BEB0"/>
"Indeed? Why then have you never mentioned his name to me? Your aunt launched out in praiſe of his friend, and you vaunted Ambroſio's eloquence: but neither ſaid a word of Don Lorenzo's perſon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments. Had not Leonella ſpoken of his readineſs to undertake our cauſe, I ſhould not have known him to be in exiſtence."</p>
                     <p>She pauſed. Antonia coloured, but was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps you judge him leſs favourably than I do. In my opinion his figure is pleaſing, his converſation ſenſible, and manners engaging. Still he may have ſtruck you differently: you may think him diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and—"</p>
                     <p>"Diſagreeable? Oh! dear mother, how ſhould I poſſibly think him ſo? I ſhould be very ungrateful were I not ſenſible of his kindneſs yeſterday, and very blind if his merits had eſcaped me. His figure is ſo graceful, ſo noble! His manners ſo gentle, yet ſo manly! I never yet ſaw ſo many accompliſhments united in one perſon, and I doubt whether Madrid can produce his equal."</p>
                     <p>"Why then were you ſo ſilent in praiſe of this phoenix of Madrid? Why was it concealed from me, that his ſociety had afforded you pleaſure?"</p>
                     <p>"In truth, I know not; you aſk me a queſtion which I cannot reſolve myſelf. I was on the point of mentioning him a thouſand times; his name was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly on my lips; but when I would have pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, I wanted courage to execute my deſign. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if I did not ſpeak of him, it was not that I thought of him the leſs."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="240" facs="unknown:035729_0238_100659AA6F8CF558"/>
"That I believe. But ſhall I tell you why you wanted courage? It was becauſe, accuſtomed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide to me your moſt ſecret thoughts, you knew not how to conceal, yet feared to acknowledge, that your heart nouriſhed a ſentiment which you were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious I ſhould diſapprove. Come hither to me, my child."</p>
                     <p>Antonia quitted her embroidery frame, threw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon her knees by the ſofa, and hid her face in her mother's lap.</p>
                     <p>"Fear not, my ſweet girl! Conſider me equally as your friend and parent, and apprehend no reproof from me. I have read the emotions of your boſom; you are yet ill ſkilled in concealing them, and they could not eſcape my attentive eye. This Lorenzo is dangerous to your repoſe; he has already made an impreſſion upon your heart. 'Tis true that I perceive eaſily that your affection is returned: but what can be the conſequences of this attachment? You are poor and friendleſs, my Antonia; Lorenzo is the heir of the duke of Medina Celi. Even ſhould himſelf mean honourably, his uncle never will conſent to your union; nor, without that uncle's conſent, will I. By ſad experience I know what ſorrow ſhe muſt endure, who marries into a family unwilling to receive her. Then ſtruggle with your affection: whatever pains it may coſt you, ſtrive to conquer it. Your heart is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſuſceptible: it has already received a ſtrong impreſſion; but when once convinced that you ſhould not encourage ſuch ſentiments, I truſt that you have ſufficient fortitude to drive them from your boſom."</p>

Antonia kiſſed her hand, and promiſed implicit obedience. Elvira then continued—</p>

The ſame reaſon made her reject the idea of arreſting the unknown ſeducer in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: ſuch a proceeding would have created much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance, and the diſgrace of her convent would have been noiſed about Madrid. She contented herſelf with confining Agnes cloſely: as to the lover, ſhe left him at liberty to purſue his deſigns. What ſhe expected was the reſult. The marquis and Lorenzo waited in vain till the break of day; they then retired without noiſe, alarmed at the failure of their plan, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the cauſe of its ill ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>The next morning Lorenzo went to the convent, and requeſted to ſee his ſiſter. The prioreſs appeared at the grate with a melancholy countenance. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him that for ſeveral days Agnes had appeared much agitated; that ſhe had been preſſed by the nuns in vain to reveal the cauſe, and apply to their tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for advice and conſolation; that ſhe had obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately perſiſted in concealing the cauſe of her diſtreſs;
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:035729_0241_10065978A5604C60"/>
but that on Thurſday evening it had produced ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an effect upon her conſtitution, that ſhe had fallen ill, and was actually confined to her bed. Lorenzo did not credit a ſyllable of this account: he inſiſted upon ſeeing his ſiſter; if ſhe was unable to come to the grate, he deſired to be admitted to her cell. The prioreſs croſſed herſelf! ſhe was ſhocked at the very idea of a man's profane eye pervading the interior of her holy manſion, and profeſſed herſelf aſtoniſhed that Lorenzo could think of ſuch a thing. She told him that his requeſt could not be granted; but that, if he returned the next day, ſhe hoped that her beloved daughter would then be ſufficiently recovered to join him at the parlour grate. With this anſwer Lorenzo was obliged to retire, unſatisfied, and trembling for his ſiſter's ſafety.</p>
                     <p>He returned the next morning at an early hour. "Agnes was worſe; the phyſician had pronounce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Lorenzo ſtormed at this anſwer, but there was no reſource. He raved, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, he threatened; no means were left untried to obtain a ſight of Agnes. His endeavours were as fruitleſs as thoſe of the day before, and he returned in deſpair to the marquis. On his ſide, the latter had ſpared no pains to diſcover what had occaſioned his plot to fail. Don Chriſtoval, to whom the affair was now entruſted, endeavoured to worm out the ſecret from the old portereſs of St. Clare, with whom he had formed an acquaintance; but ſhe was too much upon her guard, and he gained from her no intelligence.

the purpoſed elopement muſt have been diſcovered: they doubted not but the malady of Agnes was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but they knew not by what means to reſcue her from the hands of the prioreſs.</p>
                     <p>Regularly every day did Lorenzo viſit the convent: as regularly was he informed that his ſiſter rather grew worſe than better. Certain that her indiſpoſition was feigned, theſe accounts did not alarm him: but his ignorance of her fate, and of the motives which induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the prioreſs to keep her from him, excited the moſt ſerious uneaſineſs. He was ſtill uncertain what ſteps he ought to take, when the marquis received a letter from the cardinal duke of Lerma. It encloſed the pope's expected bull, ordering that Agnes ſhould be releaſed from her vows, and reſtored to her relations. This eſſential paper decided at once the proceedings of her friends; they reſolved that Lorenzo ſhould carry it to the domina without delay, and demand that his ſiſter ſhould be inſtantly given up to him. Againſt this mandate illneſs could not be pleaded: it gave her brother the power of removing her inſtantly to the palace de Medina, and he determined to uſe that power on the following day.</p>
                     <p>His mind relieved from inquietude reſpecting his ſiſter, and his ſpirits raiſed by the hope of ſoon reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to freedom, he now had time to give a few moments to love and to Antonia. At the ſame hour as on his former viſit, he repaired to Donna Elvira's. She had given orders for his admiſſion.

                     <p>"You muſt not think me ungrateful, Don Lorenzo, or forgetful how eſſential are the ſervices which you have rendered me with the marquis. I feel the weight of my obligations: nothing under the ſun ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce my taking the ſtep to which I am now compelled, but the intereſt of my child, of my beloved Antonia. My health is declining; God only knows how ſoon I may be ſummoned before his throne. My daughter will be left without parents, and, ſhould ſhe loſe the protection of the Ciſternas family, without friends. She is young and artleſs, uninſtructed in the world's perfidy, and with charms ſufficient to render her an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſeduction. Judge then how I muſt tremble at the proſpect before her! Judge, how anxious I muſt be to keep her from their ſociety who may excite the yet dormant paſſions of her boſom. You are amiable, Don Lorenzo; Antonia has a ſuſceptible, a loving heart, and is grateful for the favours conferred upon us by your interference with the marquis. Your preſence makes me tremble: I fear leſt it ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire her with ſentiments which may embitter the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of her life, or encourage her to cheriſh hopes in her ſituation unjuſtifiable and futile. Pardon me, when I avow my terrors, and let my frankneſs plead in my excuſe. I cannot forbid you my houſe, for gratitude reſtrains me; I can only throw myſelf upon your generoſity, and entreat you to ſpare the feelings of an anxious, of a doting mother. Believe me when I aſſure you, that I lament the neceſſity of rejecting your

acquaintance; but there is no remedy, and Antonia's intereſt obliges me to beg you to forbear your viſits. By complying with my requeſt, you will increaſe the eſteem which I already feel for you, and of which every thing convinces me that you are truly deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
                     <p>"Your frankneſs charms me," replied Lorenzo: "You ſhall find, that in your favourable opinion of me you were not deceived; yet I hope that the reaſons now in my power to alledge, will perſuade you to withdraw a requeſt which I cannot obey without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite reluctance. I love your daughter, love her moſt ſincerely; I wiſh for no greater happineſs than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire her with the ſame ſentiments, and receive her hand at the altar as her huſband. 'Tis true I am not rich myſelf, my father's death has left me but little in my own poſſeſſion; but my expectations juſtify my pretending to the Condé de las Ciſternas' daughter."</p>
                     <p>He was proceeding, but Elvira interrupted him—</p>

Nay, I have even been neglected by moſt of my own relations, who out of envy affect to doubt the reality of my marriage. My allowance being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued at my father-in-law's death, I was reduced to the very brink of want. In this ſituation I was found by my ſiſter, who, amongſt all her foibles, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes a warm, generous, and affectionate heart. She aided me with the little fortune which my father left

her, perſuaded me to viſit Madrid, and has ſupported my child and myſelf ſince our quitting Murcia. Then, conſider not Antonia as deſcended from the Condé de las Ciſternas; conſider her as a poor and unprotected orphan, as the grandchild of the tradeſman Torribio Dalfa, as the needy penſioner of that tradeſman's daughter. Reflect upon the difference between ſuch a ſituation and that of the nephew and heir of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent duke of Medina. I believe your intentions to be honourable; but as there are no hopes that your uncle will approve the union, I foreſee that the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your attachment muſt be fatal to my child's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe."</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, Segnora; you are miſinformed if you ſuppoſe the duke of Medina to reſemble the generality of men. His ſentiments are liberal and diſintereſted; he loves me well, and I have no reaſon to dread his forbidding the marriage, when he perceives that my happineſs depends upon Antonia. But ſuppoſing him to refuſe his ſanction, what have I ſtill to fear? My parents are no more; my little fortune is in my own poſſeſſion; it will be ſufficient to ſupport Antonia, and I ſhall exchange for her hand Medina's dukedom without one ſigh of regret."</p>
                     <p>"You are young and eager; it is natural for you to entertain ſuch ideas. But experience has taught me to my coſt, that curſes accompany an unequal alliance. I married the Condé de las Ciſternas in oppoſition to the will of his relations; many an heart pang has puniſhed me for the imprudent ſtep. Wherever we bent our courſe, a father's execration purſued Gonzalvo. Poverty overtook us, and no

                        </gap>aſe, ill could my huſband ſupport the tranſition to diſtreſs and indigence. He looked back with repining to the comforts which he once enjoyed. He regretted the ſituation which for my ſake he had quitted; and in moments when deſpair poſſeſſed his mind, has reproached me with having made him the companion of want and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. He has called me his bane! the ſource of his ſorrows, the cauſe of his deſtruction! Ah! God! he little knew how much keener were my own heart's reproaches! He was ignorant that I ſuffered trebly, for myſelf, for my children, and for him! 'Tis true that his anger ſeldom laſted long: his ſincere affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for me ſoon revived in his heart, and then his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the tears which he had made me ſhed, tortured me even more than his reproaches. He would throw himſelf on the ground, implore my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs in the moſt frantic terms, and load himſelf with curſes for being the murderer of my repoſe. Taught by experience, that an union contracted againſt the inclinations of families on either ſide muſt be unfortunate, I will ſave my daughter from thoſe miſeries which I have ſuffered. Without your uncle's conſent, while I live, ſhe never ſhall be yours. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly he will diſapprove of the union; his power is immenſe, and Antonia ſhall not be expoſed to his anger and perſecution.</p>
                     <p>"His perſecution? How eaſy may that be avoided! Let the worſt happen, it is but quitting Spain. My wealth may eaſily be realiſed. The Indian iſlands will offer us a ſecure retreat. I have an eſtate, though

                     <p>"Ah! youth, this is a fond, romantic viſion. Gonzalvo thought the ſame. He fancied that he could leave Spain without regret; but the moment of parting undeceived him. You know not yet what it is to quit your native land: to quit it, never to behold it more! You know not what it is to exchange the ſcenes where you have paſſed your infancy, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known realms and barbarous climates!—to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, utterly, eternally forgotten by the companions of your youth!—to ſee your deareſt friends, the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt objects of your affection periſhing with diſeaſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental to Indian atmoſpheres, and find yourſelf una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to procure for them neceſſary aſſiſtance! I have felt all this! My huſband and two ſweet babes found their graves in Cuba; nothing would have ſaved my young Antonia, but my ſudden return to Spain. Ah! Don Lorenzo, could you conceive what I ſuffered during my abſence! Could you know how ſorely I regretted all that I left behind, and how dear to me was the very name of Spain! I envied the winds which blew towards it: and when the Spaniſh ſailor chanted ſome well known air as he paſſed my win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, tears filled my eyes, while I thought upon my native land.

He wrote theſe verſes on his voyage to Cuba, when his mind was clouded by ſorrow, and he forgot that he had a wife and children. What we are loſing ever ſeems to us the moſt precious. Gonzalvo was quitting Spain for ever, and therefore was Spain dearer to his eyes than all elſe which the world contained. Read them, Don Lorenzo, they will give you ſome idea of the feelings of a baniſhed man."</p>

                     <p>Lorenzo had ſcarcely time to read theſe lines, when Elvira returned to him: the giving a free courſe to her tears had relieved her, and her ſpirits had regained their uſual compoſure.</p>
                     <p>"I have nothing more to ſay, my lord," ſaid ſhe; "you have heard my apprehenſions, and my reaſons for begging you not to repeat your viſits.

                     <p>"I will be open with you, Don Lorenzo: there being little probability of ſuch an union taking place, I fear that it is deſired but too ardently by my daughter. You have made an impreſſion upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He will marry: his lady may look upon Antonia with an eye of diſpleaſure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive her of her only friend. Should the duke, your uncle, give his conſent, you need not doubt obtaining mine and my daughter's; but, without his, hope not for ours. At all events, whatever ſteps you may take, whatever may be the duke's deciſion, till you know it, let me beg your forbearing to ſtrengthen, by your preſence, Antonia's prepoſſeſſion.

                     <p>Lorenzo promiſed reluctantly to conform to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: but he added, that he hoped ſoon to obtain that
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:035729_0252_100659B61C7F22B0"/>
conſent which would give him a claim to the renewal of their acquaintance. He then explained to her why the marquis had not called in perſon; and made no ſcruple of confiding to her his ſiſter's hiſtory. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by ſaying, "that he hoped to ſet Agnes at lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty the next day; and that, as ſoon as Don Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's fears were quieted upon this ſubject, he would loſe no time in aſſuring Donna Elvira of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and protection.</p>
                     <p>The lady ſhook her head.</p>
                     <p>"I tremble for your ſiſter," ſaid ſhe; "I have heard many traits of the domina of St. Clare's char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter from a friend who was educated in the ſame convent with her: ſhe reported her to be haughty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, ſuperſtitious, and revengeful. I have ſince heard, that ſhe is infatuated with the idea of rendering her convent the moſt regular in Madrid, and never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave thoſe whoſe imprudence threw upon it the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtain. Though naturally violent and ſevere, when her intereſts require it, ſhe well knows how to aſſume an appearance of benignity. She leaves no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried to perſuade young women of rank to become members of her community: ſhe is implacable when once incenſed, and has too much intrepidity to ſhrink at taking the moſt rigorous meaſures for puniſhing the offender. Doubtleſs, ſhe will conſider your ſiſter's quitting the convent as a diſgrace thrown upon it: ſhe will uſe every artifice to avoid obeying the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date of his holineſs; and I ſhudder to think that Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Agnes is in the hands of this dangerous woman."</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo now roſe to take leave. Elvira gave him her hand at parting, which he kiſſed reſpectfully;
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:035729_0253_100659E872335D38"/>
and, telling her that he ſoon hoped for the permiſſion to ſalute that of Antonia, he returned to his hotel. The lady was perfectly ſatisfied with the converſation which had paſſed between them: ſhe looked forward with ſatisfaction to the proſpect of his becoming her ſon-in-law; but prudence bade her conceal from her daughter's knowledge the flattering hopes which her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf now ventured to entertain.</p>
                     <p>Scarcely was it day, and already Lorenzo was at the convent of St. Clare, furniſhed with the neceſſary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date. The nuns were at matins. He waited impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for the concluſion of the ſervice; and at length the prioreſs appeared at the parlour grate. Agnes was demanded. The old lady replied with a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly air, that the dear child's ſituation grew hourly more dangerous: that the phyſicians deſpaired of her life; but that they had declared the only chance for her recovery to conſiſt in keeping her quiet, and not to permit thoſe to approach her whoſe preſence was likely to agitate her. Not a word of all this was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by Lorenzo, any more than he credited the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of grief and affection for Agnes with which this account was interlarded. To end the buſineſs, he put the pope's bull into the hands of the domina, and inſiſted that, ill or in health, his ſiſter ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him without delay.</p>
                     <p>The prioreſs received the paper with an air of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; but no ſooner had her eye glanced over the contents than her reſentment baffled all the efforts of hypocriſy. A deep crimſon ſpread itſelf over her face, and ſhe darted upon Lorenzo looks of rage and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="256" facs="unknown:035729_0254_100659B8D3754AF0"/>
"This order is poſitive," ſaid ſhe, in a voice of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which ſhe in vain ſtrove to diſguiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would I obey it, but unfortunately, it is out of my power."</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo interrupted her by an exclamation of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
                     <p>"I repeat it, Segnor, to obey this order is totally out of my power. From tenderneſs to a brother's feelings, I would have communicated the ſad event to you by degrees, and have prepared you to hear it with fortitude. My meaſures are broken through; this order commands me to deliver up to you the ſiſter Agnes without delay; I am, therefore, obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, without circumlocution, that on Friday laſt ſhe expired."</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo ſtarted back with horror, and turned pale. A moment's recollection convinced him that this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be falſe, and it reſtored him to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"You deceive me!" ſaid he, paſſionately: "but five minutes paſt you aſſured me that, though ill, ſhe was ſtill alive. Produce her this inſtant! See her I muſt and will; and every attempt to keep her from me will be unavailing."</p>
                     <p>"You forget yourſelf, Segnor: you owe reſpect to my age as well as my profeſſion. Your ſiſter is no more. If I at firſt concealed her death, it was from dreading leſt an event ſo unexpected ſhould produce on you too violent an effect.

                        </gap>, and think her a diſgrace to the ſiſterhood of St. Clare: but ſhe has forfeited my affection in a manner yet more culpable. Her crimes were great; and when you know the cauſe of her death, you will doubtleſs rejoice, Don Lorenzo, that ſuch a wretch is no longer in exiſtence. She was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ill on Thurſday laſt on returning from confeſſion in the capuchin chapel: her malady ſeemed attended with ſtrange circumſtances; but ſhe perſiſted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing its cauſe. Thanks to the Virgin, we were too ignorant to ſuſpect it! Judge then what muſt have been our conſternation, our horror, when ſhe was delivered the next day of a ſtill born child, whom ſhe immediately followed to the grave. How, Segnor? Is it poſſible that your countenance expreſſes no ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, no indignation? Is it poſſible that your ſiſter's infamy was known to you, and that ſtill ſhe poſſeſſed your affection? In that caſe, you have no need of my compaſſion. I can ſay nothing more; except re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat my inability of obeying the orders of his holineſs. Agnes is no more; and, to convince you that what I ſay is true, I ſwear by our bleſſed Saviour, that three days have paſſed ſince ſhe was buried."</p>
                     <p>Here ſhe kiſſed a ſmall crucifix which hung at her girdle: ſhe then roſe from her chair, and quitted the parlour. As ſhe withdrew, ſhe caſt upon Lorenzo a ſcornful ſmile.</p>
                     <p>"Farewell, Segnor," ſaid ſhe; "I know no remedy for this accident. I fear that even a ſecond bull from the pope will not procure your ſiſter's reſurrection."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="258" facs="unknown:035729_0256_100659BB78BCFE70"/>
Lorenzo alſo retired, penetrated with affliction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Don Raymond's, at the news of this event, amounted to madneſs: he would not be convinced that Agnes was really dead; and continued to inſiſt that the walls of St. Clare ſtill confined her. No argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could make him abandon his hopes of regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. Every day ſome freſh ſcheme was invented for procuring intelligence of her, and all of them were attended with the ſame ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>On his part, Medina gave up the idea of ever ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſiſter more; yet he believed that ſhe had been taken off by unfair means. Under this perſuaſion, he encouraged Don Raymond's reſearches, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould he diſcover the leaſt warrant for his ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, to take a ſevere vengeance upon the unfeeling prioreſs. The loſs of his ſiſter affected him ſincerely: nor was it the leaſt cauſe of his diſtreſs, that propriety obliged him for ſome time to defer mentioning Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia to the duke. In the mean while his emiſſaries conſtantly ſurrounded Elvira's door. He had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of all the movements of his miſtreſs. As ſhe never failed every Thurſday to attend the ſermon in the Capuchin cathedral, he was ſecure of ſeeing her once a week; though, in compliance with his prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe, he carefully ſhunned her obſervation. Thus two long months paſſed away. Still no information was procured of Agnes. All but the marquis credited her death: and now Lorenzo determined to diſcloſe his ſentiments to his uncle: he had already dropped ſome hints of his intention to marry: they had been as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably received as he could expect; and he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured no doubt of the ſucceſs of his application.</p>

Matilda's eloquence and beauty, the power of habit, and the frailty of human nature, gradually diminiſhed the ſenſation, and at length it ſcarce could be ſaid to be felt by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> boſom at all. He no longer reflected with ſhame upon his conduct, or dreaded the vengeance of Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. One fear alone poſſeſſed him. He trembled to loſe Matilda, who ſtill laboured under the influence of poiſon. He therefore preſſed her with earneſtneſs to uſe the means of preſervation which ſhe had before declared to be in her poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="unknown:035729_0259_100659BD2F8511D0"/>
"Yes!" replied Matilda; "ſince you have made me feel that life is valuable, I will reſcue mine at any rate. No dangers ſhall appal me: I will look upon the conſequences of my action boldly, nor ſhudder at the horrors which they preſent: I will think my ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice ſcarcely worthy to purchaſe your poſſeſſion; and remember, that a moment paſſed in your arms in this world o'erpays an age of puniſhment in the next. But before I take this ſtep, Ambroſio, give me your ſolemn oath never to enquire by what means I ſhall preſerve myſelf."</p>
                     <p>He did ſo, in a manner the moſt binding.</p>
                     <p>"I thank you, my beloved. This precaution is neceſſary; for, though you know it not, you are under the command of vulgar prejudices. The buſineſs on which I muſt be employed this night might ſtartle you, from its ſingularity, and lower me in your opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. Tell me, do you poſſeſs the key of the lower door on the weſtern ſide of the garden?"</p>
                     <p>"The door which opens into the burying-ground common to us and the ſiſterhood of St. Clare? I have not the key, but can eaſily procure it."</p>
                     <p>"You have only this to do. Admit me into the burying ground at night. Watch while I deſcend into the vaults of St. Clare, leſt ſome prying eye ſhould obſerve my actions. Leave me there alone for an hour, and that life is ſafe which I dedicate to your pleaſures. To prevent creating ſuſpicion, do not viſit me during the day. Remember the key, and that I expect you before twelve. Hark! I hear ſteps ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching! Leave me; I will pretend to ſleep."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="5" facs="unknown:035729_0260_100659F1639E7C08"/>
The friar obeyed, and left the cell. As he opened the door, father Pablos made his appearance.</p>
                     <p>"I come," ſaid the latter, "to enquire after the health of my young patient."</p>
                     <p>"Huſh!" replied Ambroſio, laying his finger upon his lip; "ſpeak ſoftly; I am juſt come from him: he has fallen into a profound ſlumber, which doubtleſs will be of ſervice to him. Do not diſturb him at preſent, for he wiſhes to repoſe."</p>
                     <p>Father Pablos obeyed, and hearing the bell ring, accompanied the abbot to matins. Ambroſio felt embarraſſed as he entered the chapel. Guilt was new to him, and he fancied that every eye could read the tranſactions of the night upon his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. He ſtrove to pray: his boſom no longer glowed with devotion: his thoughts inſenſibly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to Matilda's charms. But what he wanted in purity of heart, he ſupplied by exterior ſanctity. The better to cloak his tranſgreſſion, he redoubled his pretenſions to the ſemblance of virtue, and never appeared more devoted to Heaven than ſince he had broken through his engagements. Thus did he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſciouſly add hypocriſy to perjury and weakneſs; he had fallen into the latter errors from yielding to ſeduction almoſt, irreſiſtible; but he was now guilty of a voluntary fault, by endeavouring to conceal thoſe into which another had betrayed him.</p>
                     <p>The matins concluded, Ambroſio retired to his cell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His brain was ſtill bewildered, and preſented a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>aos of remorſe, inquietude and fear: he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back with regret to that peace of ſoul, that ſecurity
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035729_0261_100659BEDF6C1CF8"/>
of virtue, which till then had been his portion: he had committed an error, from whoſe very idea but a few hours before he would have recoiled with horror: he ſhuddered at reflecting that a trifling indiſcretion on his part, or on Matilda's, would overturn that fab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric of reputation which it had coſt him thirty years to erect, and render him the abhorrence of that people of whom he was then the idol. Conſcience painted to him in glaring colours his perjury and weakneſs; apprehenſion magnified to him the horrors of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he already fancied himſelf in the priſons of the Inquiſition. To theſe tormenting ideas ſucceeded Matilda's charms and tenderneſs. A ſingle glance thrown upon theſe, reconciled him with himſelf; and he conſidered her poſſeſſion to have been purchaſed at an eaſy price, by the ſacrifice of innocence and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Their very remembrance filled his ſoul with ecſtacy: he curſed his fooliſh vanity, which had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to waſte in obſcurity the bloom of life, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the bleſſings of love and woman: he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, at all events, to continue his commerce with Matilda, and called every argument to his aid which might confirm his reſolution: he aſked himſelf, provided his irregularity was unknown, in what would his fault conſiſt, and what conſequences he had to apprehend? By adhering ſtrictly to every rule of his order ſave chaſtity, he doubted not to retain the eſteem of men, and even the protection of Heaven: he truſted eaſily to be forgiven ſo ſlight and natural a deviation from his vows; but he forgot that, having pronounced thoſe vows, that which is in laymen the moſt venial of errors, became in his perſon the moſt heinous of crimes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="unknown:035729_0262_100659F2ED4C4870"/>
Once decided upon his future conduct, his mind became more eaſy. Obedient to Matilda's order, he viſited not her cell during the day. Father Pablos mentioned in the refectory, that Roſario had at length been prevailed upon to follow his preſcription; but that the medicine had not produced the ſlighteſt effect, and that he believed no mortal ſkill could reſcue him from the grave. With this opinion the abbot agreed, and affected to lament the untimely fate of a youth whoſe talents had appeared ſo promiſing.</p>
                     <p>The night arrived. Ambroſio had taken care to procure from the porter the key of the low door opening into the cemetery. Furniſhed with this, when all was ſilent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the monaſtery, he quitted his cell, and haſtened to Matilda's. She had left her bed, and was dreſſed before his arrival.</p>
                     <p>"I have been expecting you with impatience," ſaid ſhe; "my life depends upon theſe moments. Have you the key?"</p>
                     <p>"I have."</p>
                     <p>"Away then to the garden! We have no time to loſe. Follow me!"</p>
                     <p>She took a ſmall covered baſket from the table. Bearing this in one hand, and the lamp, which was flaming upon the hearth, in the other, ſhe haſtened from the cell. Ambroſio followed her. Both main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a profound ſilence. She moved on with quick but cautious ſteps, paſſed through the cloiſters, and reached the weſtern ſide of the garden: her eyes flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fire and wildneſs which impreſſed the monk at once with awe and horror. A determined deſperate
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035729_0263_100659C1B76916D0"/>
courage reigned upon her brow: ſhe gave the lamp to Ambroſio; then taking from him the key, ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked the low door, and entered the cemetery. It was a vaſt and ſpacious ſquare, planted with yew-trees; half of it belonged to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> abbey, the other half was the property of the ſiſterhood of St. Clare, and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by a roof of ſtone; the diviſion was marked by an iron railing, the wicket of which was generally left unlocked.</p>
                     <p>Thither Matilda bent her courſe; ſhe opened the wicket, and ſought for the door leading to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous vaults, where repoſed the mouldering bodies of the votaries of St. Clare. The night was perfectly dark, neither moon nor ſtars were viſible. Luckily there was not a breath of wind, and the friar bore his lamp in full ſecurity; by the aſſiſtance of its beams the door of the ſepulchre was ſoon diſcovered. It was ſunk within the hollow of a wall, and almoſt concealed by thick feſtoons of ivy hanging over it. Three ſteps of rough hewn ſtone conducted to it, and Matilda was on the point of deſcending them, when ſhe ſuddenly ſtarted back.</p>
                     <p>"There are people in the vaults!" ſhe whiſpered to the monk; "conceal yourſelf till they are paſſed."</p>
                     <p>She took refuge behind a lofty and magnificent tomb, erected in honour of the convent's foundreſs. Ambroſio followed her example, carefully hiding his lamp, leſt its beams ſhould betray them. But a few moments had elapſed, when the door was puſhed open leading to the ſubterraneous caverns. Rays of light proceeded up the ſtair-caſe: they enabled the concealed ſpectators to obſerve two females dreſſed in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035729_0264_100659F6D17AC6F8"/>
religious habits, who ſeemed engaged in earneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. The abbot had no difficulty to recognize the prioreſs of St. Clare in the firſt, and one of the elder nuns in her companion.</p>
                     <p>"Every thing is prepared," ſaid the prioreſs, "her fate ſhall be decided to-morrow; all her tears and ſighs will be unavailing. No! in five and twenty years that I have been ſuperior of this convent, never did I witneſs a tranſaction more infamous!"</p>
                     <p>"You muſt expect much oppoſition to your will;" the other replied in a milder voice; "Agnes has many friends in the convent, and in particular the mother St. Urſula will eſpouſe her cauſe moſt warmly. In truth, ſhe merits to have friends; and I wiſh I could prevail upon you to conſider her youth and her peculiar ſituation. She ſeems ſenſible of her fault; the exceſs of her grief proves her penitence, and I am convinced that her tears flow more from contrition, than fear of puniſhment. Reverend mother, would you be perſuaded to mitigate the ſeverity of your ſentence; would you but deign to overlook this firſt tranſgreſſion, I offer myſelf as the pledge of her future conduct."</p>
                     <p>"Overlook it, ſay you? Mother Camilla you amaze me! What, after diſgracing me in the preſence of Madrid's idol, of the very man on whom I moſt wiſhed to impreſs an idea of the ſtrictneſs of my diſcipline! How deſpicable muſt I have appeared to the reverend abbot! No, mother—no, I never can forgive the inſult. I cannot better convince Ambroſio that I abhor ſuch crimes, than by puniſhing that of Agnes with all the rigour of which our ſevere laws
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035729_0265_100659C462555650"/>
admit. Ceaſe then your ſupplications, they will all be unavailing. My reſolution is taken. To-morrow Agnes ſhall be made a terrible example of my juſtice and reſentment."</p>
                     <p>The mother Camilla ſeemed not to give up the point, but by this time the nuns were out of hearing. The prioreſs unlocked the door which communicated with St. Clare's chapel, and, having entered with her companion, cloſed it again after them.</p>
                     <p>Matilda now aſked, who was this Agnes with whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"I deſign," ſaid he, "to requeſt an audience of the domina to-morrow, and uſe every means to obtain a mitigation of her ſentence."</p>
                     <p>"Beware of what you do," interrupted Matilda; "your ſudden change of ſentiment may naturally cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſurpriſe, and may give birth to ſuſpicions which it is moſt our intereſt to avoid. Rather redouble your outward auſterity, and thunder out menaces againſt the errors of others, the better to conceal your own. Abandon the nun to her fate. Your interfering might be dangerous, and her imprudence merits to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed: ſhe is unworthy to enjoy love's pleaſures, who has not wit enough to conceal them. But in diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this trifling ſubject, I waſte moments which are precious. The night flies apace, and much muſt be done before morning. The nuns are retired; all is ſafe.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035729_0266_100659F85933A900"/>
Give me the lamp, Ambroſio, I muſt deſcend alone into theſe caverns: wait here, and if any one approaches, warn me by your voice; but as you value your exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, preſume not to follow me: your life would fall a victim to your imprudent curioſity."</p>
                     <p>Thus ſaying, ſhe advanced towards the ſepulchre, ſtill holding her lamp in one hand, and her little baſket in the other. She touched the door: it turned ſlowly upon its grating hinges, and a narrow winding ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe of black marble preſented itſelf to her eyes. She deſcended it; Ambroſio remained above, watching the faint beams of the lamp, as they ſtill receded down the ſtairs. They diſappeared, and he found himſelf in total darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>Left to himſelf, he could not reflect without ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe on the ſudden change in Matilda's character and ſentiments. But a few days had paſſed, ſince ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the mildeſt and ſofteſt of her ſex, devoted to his will, and looking up to him as to a ſuperior being. Now ſhe aſſumed a ſort of courage and manlineſs in her manners and diſcourſe, but ill calculated to pleaſe him. She ſpoke no longer to inſinuate, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: he found himſelf unable to cope with her in argument, and was unwillingly obliged to confeſs the ſuperiority of her judgment. Every moment convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of the aſtoniſhing powers of her mind: but what ſhe gained in the opinion of the man, ſhe loſt with intereſt in the affection of the lover. He regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Roſario, the fond, the gentle, and ſubmiſſive; he grieved that Matilda preferred the virtues of his ſex to thoſe of her own; and when he thought of her expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions reſpecting the devoted nun, he could not help blaming them as cruel and unfeminine. Pity is a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035729_0267_100659C5EAFC7888"/>
ſo natural, ſo appropriate to the female char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, that it is ſcarcely a merit for a woman to poſſeſs it; but to be without it is a grievous crime. Ambroſio could not eaſily forgive his miſtreſs for being deficient in this amiable quality. However, though he blamed her inſenſibility, he felt the truth of her obſervations; and though he pitied ſincerely the unfortunate Agnes, he reſolved to drop the idea of interpoſing in her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
                     <p>Near an hour had elapſed ſince Matilda deſcended into the caverns; ſtill ſhe returned not. Ambroſio's curioſity was excited. He drew near the ſtair-caſe—he liſtened—all was ſilent, except that at intervals he caught the ſound of Matilda's voice, as it wound along the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous paſſages, and was re-echoed by the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre's vaulted roofs. She was at too great a diſtance for him to diſtinguiſh her words, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re they reached him, they were deadened in a low murmur. He long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to penetrate into this myſtery. He reſolved to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey her injunctions, and follow her into the cavern. He advanced to the ſtair-caſe; he had already deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome ſteps, when his courage failed him. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered Matilda's menaces if he infringed her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and his boſom was filled with a ſecret unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able awe. He returned up the ſtairs, reſumed his former ſtation, and waited impatiently for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this adventure.</p>
                     <p>Suddenly he was ſenſible of a violent ſhock. An earthquake rocked the ground, the columns which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the roof under which he ſtood, were ſo ſtrongly ſhaken, that every moment menaced him with its fall, and at the ſame moment he heard a loud and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous burſt of thunder: it ceaſed; and his eyes being
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035729_0268_100659F9E0EDF268"/>
fixed upon the ſtair-caſe, he ſaw a bright column of light flaſh along the caverns beneath. It was ſeen but for an inſtant. No ſooner did it diſappear, than all was once more quiet and obſcure. Profound darkneſs again ſurrounded him, and the ſilence of night was only broken by the whirring bat as ſhe flitted ſlowly by him.</p>
                     <p>With every inſtant Ambroſio's amazement increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Another hour elapſed, after which the ſame light again appeared, and was loſt again as ſuddenly. It was accompanied by a ſtrain of ſweet but ſolemn muſic, which, as it ſtole through the vaults below, inſpired the monk with mingled delight and terror. It had not long been huſhed, when he heard Matilda's ſteps upon the ſtair-caſe. She aſcended from the cavern; the moſt lively joy animated her beautiful features.</p>
                     <p>"Did you ſee any thing?" ſhe aſked.</p>
                     <p>"Twice I ſaw a column of light flaſh up the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe."</p>
                     <p>"Nothing elſe?"</p>
                     <p>"Nothing."</p>
                     <p>"The morning is on the point of breaking: let us retire to the abbey, leſt day-light ſhould betray us."</p>
                     <p>With a light ſtep ſhe haſtened from the burying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground. She regained her cell, and the curious abbot ſtill accompanied her. She cloſed the door, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embacraſſed herſelf of her lamp and baſket.</p>
                     <p>"I have ſucceeded!" ſhe cried, throwing herſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his boſom; "ſucceeded beyond my fondeſt hopes! I ſhall live, Ambroſio; ſhall live for you! The ſtep,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035729_0269_100659C7DDA05DA8"/>
which I ſhuddered at taking, proves to me a ſource of joys inexpreſſible! Oh! that I dared communicate thoſe joys to you! Oh! that I were permitted to ſhare with you my power, and raiſe you as high above the level of your ſex, as one bold deed has exalted me above mine!"</p>
                     <p>"And what prevents you, Matilda?" interrupted the friar. "Why is your buſineſs in the cavern made a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret? Do you think me undeſerving of your confidence? Matilda, I muſt doubt the truth of your affection, while you have joys in which I am forbidden to ſhare."</p>
                     <p>"You reproach me with injuſtice; I grieve ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that I am obliged to conceal from you my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but I am not to blame; the fault lies not in me, but in yourſelf, my Ambroſio. You are ſtill too much the monk; your mind is enſlaved by the prejudices of education: and ſuperſtition might make you ſhudder at the idea of that which experience has taught me to prize and value. At preſent you are unfit to be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſecret of ſuch importance; but the ſtrength of your judgment, and the curioſity which I rejoice to ſee ſparkling in your eyes, make me hope that you will one day deſerve my confidence. Till that period arrives, reſtrain your impatience. Remember that you have given me your ſolemn oath never to enquire into this night's adventures. I inſiſt upon your keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this oath; for, though," ſhe added, ſmiling, while ſhe ſealed his lips with a kiſs, "though I forgive your breaking your vows to Heaven, I expect you to keep your vows to me."</p>
                     <p>This the friar heſitated not to promiſe, or Matilda to believe. The monks rejoiced in the feigned Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſario's
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035729_0270_100659FBFB236F50"/>
unexpected recovery, and none of them ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his real ſex. The abbot poſſeſſed his miſtreſs in tranquillity, and, perceiving his frailty unſuſpected, abandoned himſelf to his paſſions in full ſecurity. Shame and remorſe no longer tormented him. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repetitions made him familiar with ſin, and his boſom became proof againſt the ſtings of conſcience. In theſe ſentiments he was encouraged by Matilda; but ſhe ſoon was aware that ſhe had ſatiated her lover by the unbounded freedom of her careſſes. Her charms becoming accuſtomed to him, they ceaſed to excite the ſame emotions which at firſt they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired. The delirium of paſſion being paſt, he had leiſure to obſerve every trifling defect; where none were to be found, ſatiety made him fancy them. A week had ſcarcely elapſed before he was wearied of his conqueſt; and his humour, naturally inconſtant, made him ſigh impatiently for variety.</p>
                     <p>Poſſeſſion, which cloys man, only increaſes the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of women. Matilda with every ſucceeding day grew more attached to the friar. Since ſhe was become his, he was dearer to her than ever; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, as her paſſion grew ardent, Ambroſio's grew cold; the very marks of her fondneſs excited his diſguſt, and its exceſs ſerved to extinguiſh the flame which already burned but feebly in his boſom. Matilda could not but remark that her ſociety ſeemed to him daily leſs agreeable; he was inattentive while ſhe ſpoke; her muſical talents, which ſhe poſſeſſed in perfection, had loſt the power of amuſing him; or, if he deigned to praiſe them, his compliments were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently forced and cold. He no longer gazed upon her with affection, or applauded her ſentiments with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035729_0271_100659CBCEADB890"/>
a lover's partiality. This Matilda well perceived, and redoubled her efforts to revive thoſe ſentiments which he once had felt. She could not but fail, ſince he conſidered as importunities the pains which ſhe took to pleaſe him, and was diſguſted by the very means which ſhe uſed to recall the wanderer. In ſpite of her beauty, he gazed upon every other female with more deſire; but fearing that his hypocriſy ſhould be made public, he confined his inclinations to his own breaſt.</p>
                     <p>It was by no means his nature to be timid: but his education had impreſſed his mind with fear ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that apprehenſion was now become part of his character. Had his youth been paſſed in the world, he would have ſhewn himſelf poſſeſſed of many bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and manly qualities. He was naturally enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, firm, and fearleſs: he had a warrior's heart, and he might have ſhone with ſplendour at the head of an army. There was no want of generoſity in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the wretched never failed to find in him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate auditor. His abilities were quick and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and his judgment vaſt, ſolid and deciſive. With ſuch qualifications, he would have been an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to his country: that he poſſeſſed them he had given proofs in his earlieſt infancy, and his parents had beheld his dawning virtues with the fondeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and admiration. Unfortunately, while yet a child, he was deprived of thoſe parents. He fell into the power of a relation, whoſe only wiſh about him was never to hear of him more: for that purpoſe he gave him in charge to his friend, the former ſuperior of the Capuchins. The abbot, a very monk, uſed all his endeavours to perſuade the boy that happineſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035729_0272_100659FFE7A02A40"/>
not without the walls of a convent. He ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded fully. To deſerve admittance into the order of St. Francis was Ambroſio's higheſt ambition. His inſtructors carefully repreſſed thoſe virtues, whoſe grandeur and diſintereſtedneſs were ill ſuited to the cloiſter. Inſtead of univerſal benevolence, he adopted a ſelfiſh partiality for his own particular eſtabliſhment: he was taught to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> the blackeſt dye: the noble frankneſs of his temper was exchanged for ſervile hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; and in order to break his natural ſpirit, the monks terrified his young mind, by placing before him all the horrors with which ſuperſtition could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them: they painted to him the torments of the damned in colours the moſt dark, terrible and fantaſtic, and threatened him at the ſlighteſt fault with eternal perdition. No wonder that his imagination conſtantly dwelling upon theſe fearful objects ſhould have render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his character timid and apprehenſive. Add to this, that his long abſence from the great world, and total unacquaintance with the common dangers of life, made him form of them an idea far more diſmal than the reality. While the monks were buſied in rooting out his virtues, and narrowing his ſentiments, they allowed every vice which had fallen to his ſhare to arrive at full perfection. He was ſuffered to be proud, vain, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and diſdainful: he was jealous of his equals, and deſpiſed all merit but his own: he was implacable when offended, and cruel in his revenge. Still, in ſpite of the pains taken to pervert them, his natural good qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities would occaſionally break through the gloom caſt over them ſo carefully. At ſuch times, the conteſt for ſuperiority between his real and acquired character was ſtriking and unaccountable to thoſe unacquainted
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035729_0273_100659CD5574C858"/>
with his original diſpoſition. He pronounced the moſt ſevere ſentences upon offenders, which the moment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compaſſion induced him to mitigate: he undertook the moſt daring enterpriſes, which the fear of their conſequences ſoon obliged him to abandon: his inborn genius darted a brilliant light upon ſubjects the moſt obſcure, and almoſt inſtantaneouſly his ſuperſtition replunged them in darkneſs more profound than that from which they had juſt been reſcued. His brother monks regarding him as a ſuperior being, remarked not this contradiction in their idol's conduct. They were perſuaded that what he did muſt be right, and ſuppoſed him to have good reaſons for changing his reſolutions. The fact was, that the different ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with which education and nature had inſpired him, were combating in his boſom: it remained for his paſſions, which as yet no opportunity had called into play, to decide the victory. Unfortunately his paſſions were the very worſt judges to whom he could poſſibly have applied. His monaſtic ſecluſion had till now been in his favour, ſince it gave him no room for diſcovering his bad qualities. The ſuperior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of his talents raiſed him too far above his compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions to permit his being jealous of them: his exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary piety, perſuaſive eloquence, and pleaſing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had ſecured him univerſal eſteem, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had no injuries to revenge: his ambition was juſtified by his acknowledged merit, and his pride con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as no more than proper confidence. He nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſaw, much leſs converſed with, the other ſex; and if he read in the courſe of his ſtudies
<q>"That men were fond, he ſmiled, and wondered how."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>For a time, ſpare diet, frequent watching, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penance cooled and repreſſed the natural warmth
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035729_0274_10065A016F550508"/>
of his conſtitution: but no ſooner did opportunity preſent itſelf, no ſooner did he catch a glimpſe of joys to which he was ſtill a ſtranger, than religion's bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers were too feeble to reſiſt the overwhelming torrent of his deſires. All impediments yielded before the force of his temperament, warm, ſanguine and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in the exceſs. As yet his other paſſions lay dormant; but they only needed to be once awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to diſplay themſelves with violence as great and irreſiſtible.</p>
                     <p>He continued to be the admiration of Madrid. The enthuſiaſm created by his eloquence ſeemed rather to increaſe than diminiſh. Every Thurſday, which was the only day when he appeared in public, the Capuchin cathedral was crowded with auditors, and his diſcourſe was always received with the ſame ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. He was named confeſſor to all the chief families in Madrid; and no one was counted faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able who was enjoined penance by any other than Ambroſio. In his reſolution of never ſtirring out of his convent he ſtill perſiſted. This circumſtance cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a ſtill greater opinion of his ſanctity and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. Above all, the women ſang forth his praiſes loudly, leſs influenced by devotion than by his noble countenance, majeſtic air, and well-turned graceful fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. The abbey door was thronged with carriages from morning to night; and the nobleſt and faireſt dames of Madrid confeſſed to the abbot their ſecret peccadilloes. The friar's eyes devoured their charms. Had his penitents conſulted theſe interpreters, he would have needed no other means of expreſſing his deſires. The climate's heat, 'tis well known, operates with no ſmall influence upon the conſtitutions of the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035729_0275_100659CEDB4815C8"/>
Spaniſh ladies: but the moſt abandoned would have thought it an eaſier taſk to inſpire with paſſion the marble ſtatue of St. Francis than the cold and rigid heart of the immaculate Ambroſio.</p>
                     <p>On his part, the friar was little acquainted with the depravity of the world: he ſuſpected not that but few of his penitents would have rejected his addreſſes. Yet, had he been better inſtructed on this head, the danger attending ſuch an attempt would have ſealed up his lips in ſilence. He knew that it would be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for a woman to keep a ſecret ſo ſtrange and ſo important as his frailty; and he even trembled, leſt Matilda ſhould betray him. Anxious to preſerve a reputation which was infinitely dear to him, he ſaw all the riſk of committing it to the power of ſome vain giddy female; and as the beauties of Madrid affected only his ſenſes without touching his heart, he forgot them as ſoon as they were out of his ſight. The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of diſcovery, the fear of being repulſed, the loſs of reputation; all theſe conſiderations counſelled him to ſtifle his deſires; and though he now felt for her the moſt perfect indifference, he was neceſſitated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine his addreſſes to Matilda.</p>
                     <p>One morning, the confluence of penitents was greater than uſual. He was detained in the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional chair till a late hour. At length the crowd was diſpatched, and he prepared to quit the chapel, when two females entered, and drew near him with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They threw up their veils, and the youngeſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to liſten to her for a few moments. The melody of her voice, of that voice to which no man ever liſtened without intereſt, immediately caught Ambroſio's attention. He ſtopped. The petitioner
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035729_0276_10065A02F70C54B8"/>
ſeemed bowed down with affliction: her cheeks were pale, her eyes dimmed with tears, and her hair fell in diſorder over her face and boſom. Still her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was ſo ſweet, ſo innocent, ſo heavenly, as might have charmed an heart leſs ſuſceptible than that which panted in the abbot's breaſt. With more than uſual ſoftneſs of manner he deſired her to proceed, and heard her ſpeak as follows, with an emotion which increaſed every moment:</p>
                     <p>"Reverend father, you ſee an unfortunate threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the loſs of her deareſt, of almoſt her only friend! My mother, my excellent mother lies upon the bed of ſickneſs. A ſudden and dreadful malady ſeized her laſt night, and ſo rapid has been its prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs that the phyſicians deſpair of her life. Human aid fails me; nothing remains for me but to implore the mercy of Heaven. Father, all Madrid rings with the report of your piety and virtue. Deign to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my mother in your prayers: perhaps they may prevail on the Almighty to ſpare her; and ſhould that be the caſe, I engage myſelf every Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the next three months to illuminate the ſhrine of St. Francis in his honour."</p>
                     <p>"So!" thought the monk; "here we have a ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond Vincentio della Ronda. Roſario's adventure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus; and he wiſhed ſecretly that this might have the ſame concluſion.</p>
                     <p>He acceded to the requeſt. The petitioner return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him thanks with every mark of gratitude, and then continued:</p>
                     <p>"I have yet another favour to aſk. We are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in Madrid: my mother needs a confeſſor, and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035729_0277_100659D089BD4D28"/>
knows not to whom ſhe ſhould apply. We underſtand that you never quit the abbey; and, alas! my poor mother is unable to come hither! If you would have the goodneſs, reverend father, to name a proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe wiſe and pious conſolations may ſoften the agonies of my parent's death-bed, you will confer an everlaſting favour upon hearts not ungrateful."</p>
                     <p>With this petition alſo the monk complied. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, what petition would he have refuſed, if urged in ſuch enchanting accents? The ſuppliant was ſo inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting! Her voice was ſo ſweet, ſo harmonious! Her very tears became her, and her affliction ſeemed to add new luſtre to her charms. He promiſed to ſend to her a confeſſor that ſame evening, and begged her to leave her addreſs. The companion preſented him with a card on which it was written, and then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew with the fair petitioner, who pronounced before her departure a thouſand benedictions on the abbot's goodneſs. His eyes followed her out of the chapel. It was not till ſhe was out of ſight that he examined the card, on which he read the following words:</p>
                     <p>"Donna Elvira Dalfa, ſtrada di San Iago, four doors from the palace d'Albornos."</p>
                     <p>The ſuppliant was no other than Antonia, and Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella was her companion. The latter had not conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without difficulty to accompany her niece to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. Ambroſio had inſpired her with ſuch awe, that ſhe trembled at the very ſight of him. Her fears had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered even her natural loquacity; and while in his preſence ſhe uttered not a ſingle ſyllable.</p>
                     <p>The monk retired to his cell, whither he was purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Antonia's image. He felt a thouſand new emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035729_0278_10065A04DEC4BD50"/>
ſpringing in his boſom, and he trembled to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine into the cauſe which gave them birth. They were totally different from thoſe inſpired by Matilda, when ſhe firſt declared her ſex and her affection. No voluptuous deſires rioted in his boſom. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, what he now felt was a mingled ſentiment of tenderneſs, admiration, and reſpect. A ſoft and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious melancholy infuſed itſelf into his ſoul, and he would not have exchanged it for the moſt lively tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of joy. Society now diſguſted him: he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſolitude, which permitted his indulging the viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of fancy: his thoughts were all gentle, ſad and ſoothing; and the whole wide world preſented him with no other object than Antonia.</p>
                     <p>"Happy man!" he exclaimed in his romantic en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm—"happy man, who is deſtined to poſſeſs the heart of that lovely girl! What delicacy in her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures! What elegance in her form! How enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was the timid innocence of her eyes! and how different from the wanton expreſſion, the wild luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fire, which ſparkles in Matilda's! Oh, ſweeter muſt one kiſs be, ſnatched from the roſy lips of the one, than all the full and glutting favours beſtowed ſo freely by the other. Matilda forces me to her arms, apes the harlot, and glories in what ſhould be her ſhame! Did ſhe know the inexpreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ible charm of mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty, how irreſiſtibly it enthrals the heart of man, how firmly it chains him to the throne of beauty, ſhe never would have thrown it off. What would be too dear a price for this lovely girl's affections? What would I not ſacrifice, could I be releaſed from my vows, and permitted to declare my love in the ſight of earth and heaven? While I ſtrove inſpire her with
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035729_0279_100659D330553310"/>
tenderneſs, with friendſhip and eſteem, how tranquil and undiſturbed would the hours roll away! Gracious God! to ſee her blue downcaſt eyes beam upon mine with timid fondneſs! to ſit for days, for years, liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that gentle voice! to acquire the right of oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, and hear the artleſs expreſſions of her grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude! to watch the emotions of her ſpotleſs heart! to encourage each dawning virtue! to ſhare in her joy when happy, to kiſs away her tears when diſtreſſed, and to ſee her fly to my arms for comfort and ſupport! Yes; if there is perfect bliſs on earth, 'tis his lot alone who becomes that angel's huſband."</p>
                     <p>While his fancy coined theſe ideas, he paced his cell with a diſordered air. His eyes were fixed upon vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; his head reclined upon his ſhoulder: a tear rolled down his cheek, while he reflected that the viſion of happineſs for him could never be realized.</p>
                     <p>"She is loſt to me!" he continued; "by marriage ſhe cannot be mine: and to ſeduce ſuch innocence, to uſe the confidence repoſed in me to work her ruin—Oh! it would be a crime, blacker than yet the world ever witneſſed! Fear not, lovely girl! your virtue runs no riſk from me. Not for Indies would I make that gentle boſom know the tortures of remorſe."</p>
                     <p>Again he paced his chamber haſtily. Then ſtopping, his eye fell upon the picture of his once-admired Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dona. He tore it with indignation from the wall: he threw it on the ground, and ſpurned it from him with his foot.</p>
                     <p>"The proſtitute!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="unknown:035729_0280_10065A08C012FF48"/>
Unfortunate Matilda! her paramour forgot, that for his ſake alone ſhe had forfeited her claim to virtue; and his only reaſon for deſpiſing her was, that ſhe loved him much too well.</p>
                     <p>He threw himſelf into a chair, which ſtood near the table. He ſaw the card with Elvira's addreſs. He took it up, and it brought to his recollection his prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe reſpecting a confeſſor. He paſſed a few minutes in doubt: but Antonia's empire over him was already too much decided to permit his making a long reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the idea which ſtruck him. He reſolved to be the confeſſor himſelf. He could leave the abbey un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved without difficulty: by wrapping up his head in his cowl, he hoped to paſs through the ſtreets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being recognized: by taking theſe precautions, and by recommending ſecrecy to Elvira's family, he doubted not to keep Madrid in ignorance that he had broken his vow never to ſee the outſide of the abbey walls. Matilda was the only perſon whoſe vigilance he dreaded: but, by informing her at the refectory, that during the whole of that day buſineſs would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine him to his cell, he thought himſelf ſecure from her wakeful jealouſy. Accordingly, at the hours when the Spaniards are generally taking their ſieſta, he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to quit the abbey by a private door, the key of which was in his poſſeſſion. The cowl of his habit was thrown over his face; from the heat of the weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the ſtreets were almoſt totally deſerted: the monk met with few people, found the ſtrada di San Iago, and arrived without accident at Donna Elvira's door. He rang, was admitted, and immediately uſhered into an upper apartment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="unknown:035729_0281_100659D5D88B89F0"/>
It was here that he ran the greateſt riſque of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. Had Leonella been at home, ſhe would have recognized him directly. Her communicative diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition would never have permitted her to reſt, till all Madrid was informed that Ambroſio had ventured out of the abbey, and viſited her ſiſter. Fortune here ſtood the monk's friend. On Leonella's return home, ſhe found a letter inſtructing her that a couſin was juſt dead, who had left what little he poſſeſſed between herſelf and Elvira. To ſecure this bequeſt, ſhe was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſet out for Cordova without loſing a moment. Amidſt all her foibles, her heart was truly warm and affectionate, and ſhe was unwilling to quit her ſiſter in ſo dangerous a ſtate. But Elvira inſiſted upon her tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the journey, conſcious that, in her daughter's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn ſituation, no increaſe of fortune, however trifling, ought to be neglected. Accordingly, Leonella left Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, ſincerely grieved at her ſiſter's illneſs, and giving ſome few ſighs to the memory of the amiable but incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Don Chriſtoval. She was fully perſuaded, that at firſt ſhe had made a terrible breach in his heart; but hearing nothing more of him, ſhe ſuppoſed that he had quitted the purſuit, diſguſted by the lowneſs of her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igin, and knowing upon other terms than marriage he had nothing to hope from ſuch a dragon of virtue as ſhe profeſſed herſelf; or elſe, that being naturally ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious and changeable, the remembrance of her charms had been effaced from the conde's heart by thoſe of ſome newer beauty. Whatever was the cauſe of her loſing him, ſhe lamented it ſorely. She ſtrove in vain (as ſhe aſſured every body who was kind enough to liſten to her) to tear his image from her too ſuſceptible heart. She affected the airs of a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick virgin, and carried them all to the moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035729_0282_10065A0A494F02C8"/>
exceſs. She heaved lamentable ſighs, walked with her arms folded, uttered long ſoliloquies, and her diſcourſe generally turned upon ſome forſaken maid who expired of a broken heart! Her fiery locks were always ornamented with a garland of willow. Every evening ſhe was ſeen ſtraying upon the banks of a riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulet by moon-light; and ſhe declared herſelf a violent admirer of murmuring ſtreams and nightingales—</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>"Of lonely haunts, and twilight groves,</l>
                        <l>"Places which pale paſſion loves!"</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>Such was the ſtate of Leonella's mind when obliged to quit Madrid. Elvira was out of patience at all theſe follies, and endeavoured at perſuading her to act like a reaſonable woman. Her advice was thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: Leonella aſſured her, at parting, that nothing could make her forget the perfidious Don Chriſtoval. In this point ſhe was fortunately miſtaken. An honeſt youth of Cordova, journeyman to an apothecary, found that her fortune would be ſufficient to ſet him up in a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel ſhop of his own. In conſequence of this reflection, he avowed himſelf her admirer. Leonella was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible; the ardour of his ſighs melted her heart, and ſhe ſoon conſented to make him the happieſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. She wrote to inform her ſiſter of her marriage; but, for reaſons which will be explained hereafter, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira never anſwered her letter.</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio was conducted into the anti-chamber to that where Elvira was repoſing. The female domeſtic who had admitted him, left him alone, while ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his arrival to her miſtreſs. Antonia, who had been by her mother's bed-ſide, immediately came to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="unknown:035729_0283_100659D75F228908"/>
"Pardon me, father," ſaid ſhe, advancing towards him: when recognizing his features, ſhe ſtopped ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and uttered a cry of joy. "Is it poſſible?" ſhe continued, "do not my eyes deceive me? Has the worthy Ambroſio broken through his reſolution, that he may ſoften the agonies of the beſt of women? What pleaſure will this viſit give my mother! Let me not delay for a moment the comfort which your piety and wiſdom will afford her."</p>
                     <p>Thus ſaying, ſhe opened the chamber-door, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her mother her diſtinguiſhed viſitor, and, having placed an arm-chair by the ſide of the bed, withdrew into another apartment.</p>
                     <p>Elvira was highly gratified by this viſit; her expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations had been raiſed high by general report, but ſhe found them far exceeded. Ambroſio, endowed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with powers of pleaſing, exerted them to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, while converſing with Antonia's mother. With perſuaſive eloquence he calmed every fear, and diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every ſcruple. He bade her reflect on the infinite mercy of her Judge, deſpoiled death of his darts and terrors, and taught her to view without ſhrinking, the abyſs of eternity, on whoſe brink ſhe then ſtood. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira was abſorbed in attention and delight: while ſhe liſtened to his exhortations, confidence and comfort ſtole inſenſibly into her mind. She unboſomed to him without heſitation, her cares and apprehenſions. The latter reſpecting a future life he had already qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, and he now removed the former, which ſhe felt for the concerns of this. She trembled for Antonia; ſhe had none to whoſe care ſhe could recommend her, ſave to the marquis de las Ciſternas and her ſiſter Leonella. The protection of the one was very uncertain; and as
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035729_0284_10063CAFAEFDA5D8"/>
to the other, though fond of her niece, Leonella was ſo thoughtleſs and vain, as to make her an improper perſon to have the ſole direction of a girl ſo young and ignorant of the world. The friar no ſooner learned the cauſe of her alarms, than he begged her to make herſelf eaſy upon that head. He doubted not being able to ſecure for Antonia a ſafe refuge in the houſe of one of his penitents, the marchioneſs of Villa-Franca: this was a lady of acknowledged virtue, remarkable for ſtrict principles and extenſive charity. Should accident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive her of this reſource, he engaged to procure An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia a reception in ſome reſpectable convent, that is to ſay, in quality of boarder; for Elvira had declared herſelf no friend to a monaſtic life, and the monk was either candid or complaiſant enough to allow that her diſapprobation was not unfounded.</p>
                     <p>Theſe proofs of the intereſt which he felt for her, completely won Elvira's heart. In thanking him, ſhe exhauſted every expreſſion which gratitude could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and proteſted, that now ſhe ſhould reſign herſelf with tranquillity to the grave. Ambroſio roſe to take leave; he promiſed to return the next day at the ſame hour, but requeſted that his viſits might be kept ſecret.</p>
                     <p>"I am unwilling," ſaid he, "that my breaking through a rule impoſed by neceſſity ſhould be general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known. Had I not reſolved never to quit my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, except upon circumſtances as urgent as that which has conducted me to your door, I ſhould be frequently ſummoned upon inſignificant occaſions; that time would be engroſſed by the curious, the unoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, and the fanciful, which I now paſs at the bed-ſide of the ſick, in comforting the expiring penite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="unknown:035729_0285_100659D8F08D5A10"/>
Elvira commended equally his prudence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, promiſing to conceal carefully the honour of his viſits. The monk then gave her his benediction, and retired from the chamber.</p>
                     <p>In the anti-room he found Antonia; he could not refuſe himſelf the pleaſure of paſſing a few moments in her ſociety. He bade her take comfort, for that her mother ſeemed compoſed and tranquil, and he hoped that ſhe yet might do well. He enquired who attended her, and engaged to ſend the phyſician of his convent to ſee her, one of the moſt ſkilful in Madrid. He then launched out in Elvira's commendation, praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her purity and fortitude of mind, and declared that ſhe had inſpired him with the higheſt eſteem and rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence. Antonia's innocent heart ſwelled with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; joy danced in her eyes, where a tear ſtill ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The hopes which he gave her of her mother's recovery, the lively intereſt which he ſeemed to feel for her, and the flattering way in which ſhe was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by him, added to the report of his judgment and virtue, and to the impreſſion made upon her by his eloquence, confirmed the favourable opinion with which his firſt appearance had inſpired Antonia. She replied with diffidence, but without reſtraint; ſhe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to relate to him all her little ſorrows, all her little fears and anxieties; and ſhe thanked him for his goodneſs with all the genuine warmth which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours kindle in a young and innocent heart. <hi>Such a one alone knows how to eſtimate benefits at their full value.</hi> They who are conſcious of mankind's perfidy and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, ever receive an obligation with apprehenſion; they ſuſpect that ſome ſecret motive muſt lurk behind it; they expreſs their thanks with reſtraint and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035729_0286_10065A0D6990ABB8"/>
and fear to praiſe a kind action to its full extent, aware that on ſome future day a return may be requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Not ſo Antonia—ſhe thought the world was compoſed of thoſe only who reſembled her: and that vice exiſted, was to her ſtill a ſecret. The monk had been of ſervice to her; he ſaid that he wiſhed her well; ſhe was grateful for his kindneſs, and thought that no terms were ſtrong enough to be the vehicle of her thanks. With what delight did Ambroſio liſten to the declaration of her artleſs gratitude! The natural grace of her manners, the unequalled ſweetneſs of her voice, her modeſt vivacity, her unſtudied elegance, her expreſſive countenance and intelligent eyes united to inſpire him with pleaſure and admiration; while the ſolidity and correctneſs of her remarks received addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional beauty from the unaffected ſimplicity of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in which they were conveyed.</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio was at length obliged to tear himſelf from this converſation, which poſſeſſed for him but too many charms. He repeated to Antonia his wiſhes, that his viſits ſhould not be made known; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhe promiſed to obſerve. He then quitted the houſe, while his enchantreſs haſtened to her mother, ignorant of the miſchief which her beauty had cauſed. She was eager to know Elvira's opinion of the man whom ſhe had praiſed in ſuch enthuſiaſtic terms, and was delighted to find it equally favourable, if not even more ſo than her own.</p>
                     <p>"Even before he ſpoke," ſaid Elvira, "I was prej<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udiced in his favour: the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

but ſurely, Antonia, I have heard it before. It ſeemed perfectly familiar to my ear; either I muſt have known the abbot in former times, or his voice bears a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſemblance to that of ſome other, to whom I have often liſtened. There were certain tones which touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my very heart, and made me feel ſenſations ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, that I ſtrive in vain to account for them."</p>
                     <p>"My deareſt mother, it produced the ſame effect upon me; yet certainly neither of us ever heard his voice till we came to Madrid. I ſuſpect that what we attribute to his voice, really proceeds from his pleaſant manners, which forbid our conſidering him as a ſtranger. I know not why, but I feel more at my eaſe while converſing with him, than I uſually do with people who are unknown to me. I feared not to repeat to him all my childiſh thoughts; and ſomehow I felt confident that he would hear my folly with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. Oh! I was not deceived in him: he liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me with ſuch an air of kindneſs and attention; he anſwered me with ſuch gentleneſs, ſuch condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; he did not call me an infant, and treat me with contempt, as our croſs old confeſſor at the Caſtle uſed to do. I verily believe, that if I had lived in Murcia a thouſand years, I never ſhould have liked that fat old father Dominic!"</p>
                     <p>"I confeſs, that father Dominic had not the moſt pleaſing manners in the world; but he was honeſt, friendly, and well-meaning."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! my dear mother, thoſe qualities are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon—"</p>
                     <p>"God grant, my child, that experience may not teach you to think them rare and precious! I have
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035729_0288_10065A11FB19BAF0"/>
found them but too much ſo. But tell me, Antonia, why is it impoſſible for me to have ſeen the abbot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?"</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe, ſince the moment when he entered the abbey he has never been on the outſide of its walls. He told me juſt now, that from his ignorance of the ſtreets he had ſome difficulty to find the ſtrada di San Iago, though ſo near the abbey."</p>
                     <p>"All this is poſſible, and ſtill I may have ſeen him <hi>before</hi> he entered the abbey: in order to come out, it was rather neceſſary that he ſhould firſt go in."</p>
                     <p>"Holy Virgin! as you ſay, that is very true. Oh! but might he not have been born in the abbey?"</p>
                     <p>Elvira ſmiled.</p>
                     <p>"Why, not very eaſily."</p>
                     <p>"Stay, ſtay! Now I recollect how it was. He was put into the abbey quite a child; the common people ſay, that he fell from heaven, and was ſent as a preſent to the Capuchins by the Virgin."</p>
                     <p>"That was very kind of her. And ſo he fell from heaven, Antonia? He muſt have had a terrible tumble."</p>
                     <p>"Many do not credit this; and I fancy, my dear mother, that I muſt number you among the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Indeed, as our landlady told my aunt, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral idea is, that his parents being poor and unable to maintain him, left him juſt born at the abbey door; the late ſuperior, from pure charity, had him educated in the convent; and he proved to be a model of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035729_0289_100659DE58E50FE8"/>
and piety, and learning, and I know not what elſe beſides. In conſequence, he was firſt received as a brother of the order, and not long ago was hoſen ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot. However, whether this account or the other is the true one—at leaſt all agree, that when the monks took him under their care he could not ſpeak; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you could not have heard his voice before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the monaſtery, becauſe at that time he had no voice at all."</p>
                     <p>"Upon my word, Antonia, you argue very cloſely; your concluſions are infallible. I did not ſuſpect you of being ſo able a logician."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! you are mocking me; but ſo much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It delights me to ſee you in ſpirits; beſides, you ſeem tranquil and eaſy, and I hope that you will have no more convulſions. Oh! I was ſure the abbot's viſit would do you good."</p>
                     <p>"It has indeed done me good, my child. He has quieted my mind upon ſome points which agitated me, and I already feel the effects of his attention. My eyes grow heavy, and I think I can ſleep a little. Draw the curtains, my Antonia; but if I ſhould not wake before midnight, do not ſit up with me, I charge you."</p>
                     <p>Antonia promiſed to obey her; and, having received her bleſſing, drew the curtains of the bed. She then ſeated herſelf in ſilence at her embroidery-frame, and beguiled the hours with building caſtles in the air. Her ſpirits were enlivened by the evident change for the better in Elvira, and her fancy preſented her with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions bright and pleaſing. In theſe dreams Ambroſio made no deſpicable figure. She thought of him with
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035729_0290_10065A13874505E0"/>
joy and gratitude; but for every idea which fell to the friar's ſhare, at leaſt two were unconſciouſly beſtowed upon Lorenzo. Thus paſſed the time till the bell in the neighbouring ſteeple of the Capuchin cathedral an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the hour of midnight. Antonia remembered her mother's injuctions, and obeyed them, though with reluctance. She undrew the curtains with caution. Elvira was enjoying a profound and quiet ſlumber; her cheek glowed with health's returning colours; a ſmile declared that her dreams were pleaſant, and as Antonia bent over her ſhe fancied that ſhe heard her name pronounced, She kiſſed her mother's forehead ſoftly, and retired to her chamber; there ſhe knelt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſtatue of St. Roſolia, her patroneſs; ſhe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended herſelf to the protection of Heaven, and, as had been her cuſtom from infancy, concluded her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions by chaunting the following ſtanzas:</p>

                     <p>RETURNED undiſcovered to the abbey, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſio's mind was filled with the moſt pleaſing images. He was wilfully blind to the danger of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing himſelf to Antonia's charms: he only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the pleaſure which her ſociety had afforded him, and rejoiced in the proſpect of that pleaſure being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. He failed not to profit by Elvira's indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obtain a ſight of her daughter every day. At firſt he bounded his wiſhes to inſpire Antonia with friendſhip: but no ſooner was he convinced that ſhe felt that ſentiment in its fulleſt extent, than his aim became more decided, and his attentions aſſumed a warmer colour. The innocent familiarity with which ſhe treated him, gave him encouragement. Grown uſed to her modeſty, it no longer commanded the ſame reſpect and awe: he ſtill admired it, but it only made him more anxious to deprive her of that which formed her principal charm. His natural pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etration, of which, unfortunately both for himſelf and Antonia, he poſſeſſed an ample ſhare, ſupplied a knowledge of the arts of ſeduction. He eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the emotions which were favourable to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and ſeized every means with avidity of infuſing
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035729_0294_10065A1735B06668"/>
corruption into Antonia's boſom. This he found no eaſy matter. Extreme ſimplicity prevented her from perceiving the aim to which the monk's inſinuations tended; but the excellent morals which ſhe owed to Elvira's care, the ſolidity and correctneſs of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and a ſtrong ſenſe of what was right, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in her heart by nature, made her feel that his precepts muſt be faulty. By a few ſimple words ſhe frequently overthrew the whole bulk of his ſophiſtical arguments, and made him conſcious how weak they were when oppoſed to virtue and truth. On ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions he took refuge in his eloquence; he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered her with a torrent of philoſophical paradoxes, to which, not underſtanding them, it was impoſſible for her to reply; and thus, though he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince her that his reaſoning was juſt, he at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her from diſcovering it to be falſe. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that her reſpect for his judgment augmented daily, and doubted not with time to bring her to the point deſired.</p>
                     <p>He was not unconſcious that his attempts were highly criminal. He ſaw clearly the baſeneſs of ſeducing the innocent girl; but his paſſion was too violent to permit his abandoning his deſign. He reſolved to purſue it, let the conſequences be what they might. He depended upon finding An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia in ſome unguarded moment; and ſeeing no other man admitted into her ſociety, nor hearing any mentioned either by her or Elvira, he imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined that her young heart was ſtill unoccupied. In the mean while every day increaſed his coldneſs for Matilda. Not a little was this occaſioned by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035729_0295_10065A54033198B0"/>
of his faults to her. To hide them from her, he was not ſufficiently maſter of himſelf; yet he dreaded leſt, in a tranſport of jealous rage, ſhe ſhould betray the ſecret on which his character and even his life depended. Matilda could not but remark his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference: he was conſcious that ſhe remarked it, and, fearing her reproaches, ſhunned her ſtudiouſly. Yet, when he could not avoid her, her mildneſs might have convinced him that he had nothing to dread from her reſentment. She had reſumed the character of the gentle intereſting Roſario: ſhe taxed him not with ingratitude; but her eyes filled with involuntary tears, and the ſoft melancholy of her countenance and voice uttered complaints far more touching than words could have conveyed. Ambroſio was not unmoved by her ſorrow; but, unable to remove its cauſe, he forbore to ſhow that it affected him. As her conduct convinced him that he needed not fear her vengeance, he continued to neglect her, and avoided her company with care. Matilda ſaw that ſhe in vain attempted to regain his affections; yet ſhe ſtifled the impulſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and continued to treat her inconſtant lover with her former fondneſs and affection.</p>
                     <p>By degrees Elvira's conſtitution recovered itſelf. She was no longer troubled with convulſions, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia ceaſed to tremble for her mother. Ambroſio be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held this re-eſtabliſhment with diſpleaſure. He ſaw that Elvira's knowledge of the world would not be the dupe of his ſanctified demeanor, and that ſhe would eaſily perceive his views upon her daughter. He reſolved therefore, before ſhe quitted her chamber, to try the extent of his influence over the innocent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="unknown:035729_0296_10065AF5398FCB48"/>
One evening, when he had found Elvira almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reſtored to health, he quitted her earlier than was his uſual cuſtom. Not finding Antonia in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-chamber, he ventured to follow her to her own. It was only ſeparated from her mother's by a cloſet, in which Flora, the waiting woman, generally ſlept. Antonia ſat upon a ſofa with her back towards the door, and read attentively. She heard not his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, till he had ſeated himſelf by her. She ſtarted, and welcomed him with a look of pleaſure: then riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe would have conducted him to the ſitting room; but Ambroſio, taking her hand, obliged her by gentle violence to reſume her place. She compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without difficulty; ſhe knew not that there was more impropriety in converſing with him in one room than another. She thought herſelf equally ſecure; and having replaced herſelf upon the ſofa, ſhe began to diſcourſe with him with her uſual eaſe and vivacity.</p>
                     <p>Antonia ſpoke of her mother's health with all the enthuſiaſtic joy of a youthful heart.</p>
                     <p>"I admire your filial affection," ſaid the abbot; "it proves the excellence and ſenſibility of your char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter; it promiſes a treaſure to him whom Heaven has deſtined to poſſeſs your affections. The breaſt ſo capable of fondneſs for a parent, what will it feel for a lover! Nay, perhaps, what feels it for one even now! Tell me, my lovely daughter, have you known what it is to love? Anſwer me with ſincerity: forget my habit, and conſider me only as a friend."</p>
                     <p>"What it is to love?" ſaid ſhe, repeating his queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. "Oh! yes, undoubtedly; I have loved many, many people."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="unknown:035729_0297_10065A558AFCF530"/>
"That is not what I mean. The love of which I ſpeak can be felt only for one. Have you never ſeen the man whom you wiſhed to be your huſband?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! no, indeed!"</p>
                     <p>This was an untruth, but ſhe was unconſcious of its falſehood: ſhe knew not the nature of her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Lorenzo; and never having ſeen him ſince his firſt viſit to Elvira<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        </gap>ith every day his image grew leſs forcibly impreſſed upon her boſom: beſides, ſhe thought of an huſband with all a virgin's terror, and negatived the friar's demand without a moment's heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation.</p>
                     <p>"And do you not long to ſee that man, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia? Do you feel no void in your heart, which you fain would have filled up? Do you heave no ſighs for the abſence of ſome one dear to you, but who that ſome one is you know not? Perceive you not that what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly could pleaſe, has charms for you no longer? that a thouſand new wiſhes, new ideas, new ſenſations, have ſprung in your boſom, only to be felt, never to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed? Or, while you fill every other heart with love, is it poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

That melting eye, that bluſhing cheek, that enchanting voluptuous melancholy which at times overſpreads your features—all theſe marks belie your words: you love, Antonia, and in vain would hide it from me."</p>
                     <p>"Father, you amaze me! What is this love of which you ſpeak? I neither know its nature, nor, if I felt it, why I ſhould conceal the ſentiment."</p>
                     <p>

"Have you ſeen no man, Antonia, whom, though never ſeen before, you ſeemed long to have ſought? whoſe form, though a ſtranger's, was familiar to your eyes? the ſound of whoſe voice ſoothed you, pleaſed you, penetrated to your very ſoul? in whoſe preſence you rejoiced, for whoſe abſence you lamented? with whom your heart ſeemed to expand, and in whoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, with confidence unbounded, you repoſed the cares of your own? Have you not felt all this, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia?"</p>
                     <p>"Certainly I have: the firſt time that I ſaw you, I felt it."</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio ſtarted. Scarcely dared he credit his hearing.</p>
                     <p>"Me, Antonia?" he cried, his eyes ſparkling with delight and impatience, while he ſeized her hand, and preſſed it rapturouſly to his lips<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Me, Antonia? You felt thoſe ſentiments for me?"</p>
                     <p>"Even with more ſtrength than you have deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The very moment that I beheld you, I felt ſo pleaſed, ſo intereſted! I waited ſo eagerly to catch the ſound of your voice; and, when I heard it, it ſeemed ſo ſweet! it ſpoke to me a language till then ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known! Methought it told me a thouſand things which I wiſhed to hear! It ſeemed as if I had long known you; as if I had a right to your friendſhip, your advice, and your protection. I wept when you departed, and longed for the time which ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore you to my ſight."</p>
                     <p>"Antonia! my charming Antonia!" exclaimed the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035729_0299_10065A5751579B10"/>
monk, and caught her to his boſom: "Can I believe my ſenſes? repeat it to me, my ſweet girl! Tell me again that you love me, that you love me truly and tenderly!"</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, I do: let my mother be excepted, and the world holds no one more dear to me."</p>
                     <p>At this frank avowal Ambroſio no longer poſſeſſed himſelf: he claſped the bluſhing trembler in his arms. He faſtened his lips greedily upon hers, and ſucked in her pure delicious breath. Startled, alarmed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed at his action, ſurpriſe at firſt deprived her of the power of reſiſtance. At length recovering herſelf, ſhe ſtrove to eſcape from his embrace.</p>
                     <p>"Father!—Ambroſio!" ſhe cried, "releaſe me; for God's ſake!"</p>
                     <p>But the monk heeded not her prayers. Antonia prayed, wept, and ſtruggled: terrified to the extreme, though at what ſhe knew not, ſhe exerted all her ſtrength to repulſe the friar, and was on the point of ſhrieking for aſſiſtance, when the chamber door was ſuddenly thrown open. Ambroſio had juſt ſufficient preſence of mind to be ſenſible of his danger. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly he releaſed Antonia, who uttered an exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of joy, flew towards the door, and found herſelf claſped in the arms of her mother.</p>
                     <p>Alarmed at ſome of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035729_0300_10065A1DE8C7E930"/>
ſeemed to authorize her fears. His frequent viſits, which, as far as ſhe could ſee, were confined to her family; his evident emotion, whenever ſhe ſpoke of Antonia; his youth; and above all, his pernicious philoſophy communicated to her by Antonia, and which accorded but ill with his converſation in her preſence; all theſe circumſtances inſpired her with doubts reſpecting the purity of Ambroſio's friendſhip. In conſequence ſhe reſolved, when he ſhould next be alone with Antonia, to endeavor at ſurpriſing him. Her plan had ſucceeded. 'Tis true, that when ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the room, he had already abandoned his prey; but her daughter's alarm, and the ſhame and confuſion ſtamped upon the friar's countenance, ſufficed to prove that her ſuſpicions were well founded. However, ſhe was too prudent to make thoſe ſuſpicions known. She judged, that to unmaſk the impoſtor would be no eaſy matter, the public being ſo much prejudiced in his favour: and having but few friends, ſhe thought it dangerous to make herſelf ſo powerful an enemy. She affected therefore not to remark his agitation, ſeated herſelf tranquilly upon the ſofa, aſſigned ſome trifling reaſon for having quitted her room unexpectedly, and converſed on various ſubjects with ſeeming confidence and eaſe.</p>
                     <p>Reaſſured by her behaviour, the monk began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf. He ſtrove to anſwer Elvira without appearing embarraſſed: but he was ſtill too great a novice in diſſimulation, and he felt that he muſt look confuſed and awkward. He ſoon broke off the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and roſe to depart. What was his vexation when, on taking leave, Elvira told him, in polite terms, that being now perfectly reeſtabliſhed, ſhe
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035729_0301_10065A58DF74C7B8"/>
thought it an injuſtice to deprive others of his company who might be more in need of it! She aſſured him of her eternal gratitude, for the benefit which during her illneſs ſhe had derived from his ſociety and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and ſhe lamented that her domeſtic affairs, as well as the multitude of buſineſs which his ſituation muſt of neceſſity impoſe upon him, would in future deprive her of the pleaſure of his viſits. Though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the mildeſt language, this hint was too plain to be miſtaken. Still he was preparing to put in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, when an expreſſive look from Elvira ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him ſhort. He dared not preſs her to receive him, for her manner convinced him that he was diſcovered: he ſubmitted without reply, took an haſty leave, and retired to the abbey, his heart filled with rage and ſhame, with bitterneſs and diſappointment.</p>
                     <p>Antonia's mind felt relieved by his departure; yet ſhe could not help lamenting that ſhe was never to ſee him more. Elvira alſo felt a ſecret ſorrow; ſhe had received too much pleaſure from thinking him her friend, not to regret the neceſſity of changing her opinion: but her mind was too much accuſtomed to the fallacy of worldly friendſhips to permit her preſent diſappointment to weigh upon it long. She now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make her daughter aware of the riſk which ſhe had run; but ſhe was obliged to treat the ſubject with caution, leſt, in removing the bandage of ignorance, the veil of innocence ſhould be rent away. She therefore contented herſelf with warning Antonia to be upon her guard, and ordering her, ſhould the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot perſiſt in his viſits, never to receive them but in company. With this injunction Antonia promiſed to comply.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="unknown:035729_0302_10065A1F6FDE8058"/>
Ambroſio haſtened to his cell. He cloſed the door after him, and threw himſelf upon the bed in deſpair. The impulſe of deſire, the ſtings of diſappointment, the ſhame of detection, and the fear of being publicly unmaſked, rendered his boſom a ſcene of the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible confuſion. He knew not what courſe to purſue. Debarred the preſence of Antonia, he had no hopes of ſatisfying that paſſion which was now become a part of his exiſtence. He reflected that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

With the direſt imprecations he vowed vengeance againſt her; he ſwore that, coſt what it would, he ſtill would poſſeſs Antonia. Starting from the bed, he paced the chamber with diſordered ſteps, howled with impotent fury, daſhed himſelf violently againſt the walls, and indulged all the tranſports of rage and madneſs.</p>
                     <p>He was ſtill under the influence of this ſtorm of paſſions, when he heard a gentle knock at the door of his cell. Conſcious that his voice muſt have been heard, he dared not refuſe admittance to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuner. He ſtrove to compoſe himſelf, and to hide his agitation. Having in ſome degree ſucceeded, he drew back the bolt: the door opened, and Matilda appeared.</p>
                     <p>At this preciſe moment there was no one with whoſe preſence he could better have diſpenſed. He had not ſufficient command over himſelf to conceal his vexation. He ſtarted back, and frowned.</p>
                     <p>"I am buſy!" ſaid he in a ſtern and haſty tone; "leave me!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="unknown:035729_0303_10065A5D4CD6F8D8"/>
Matilda heeded him not: ſhe again faſtened the door, and then advanced towards him with an air gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and ſupplicating.</p>
                     <p>"Forgive me, Ambroſio," ſaid ſhe; "for your own ſake I muſt not obey you. Fear no complaints from me; I come not to reproach you with your ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. I pardon you from my heart; and ſince your love can no longer be mine, I requeſt the next beſt gift, your confidence and friendſhip. We cannot force our inclinations: the little beauty which you once ſaw in me has periſhed with its novelty; and if it can no longer excite deſire, mine is the fault, not yours. But why perſiſt in ſhunning me? why ſuch anxiety to fly my preſence? You have ſorrows, but will not permit me to ſhare them; you have diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, but will not accept my comfort; you have wiſhes, but forbid my aiding your purſuits. 'Tis of this that I complain; for though I have given up the claims of the miſtreſs, nothing ſhall prevail on me to give up thoſe of the friend."</p>
                     <p>"Generous Matilda!" he replied, taking her hand, "how far do you riſe ſuperior to the foibles of your ſex! Yes, I accept your offer.

I have been informed of your diſappointment, and diſmiſſion from Elvira's houſe. You now deſpair of poſſeſſing your miſtreſs; but I come to revive your hopes, and point out the road to ſucceſs."</p>
                     <p>"To ſucceſs? Oh! Impoſſible!"</p>
                     <p>"To thoſe who dare, nothing is impoſſible. Rely upon me, and you may yet be happy. The time is come, Ambroſio, when regard for your comfort and tranquillity compels me to reveal a part of my hiſtory, with which you are ſtill unacquainted. Liſten, and do not interrupt me. Should my confeſſion diſguſt you, remember that in making it, my ſole aim is to ſatisfy your wiſhes, and reſtore that peace to your heart which at preſent has abandoned it. I formerly mentioned, that my guardian was a man of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon knowledge. He took pains to inſtil that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge into my infant mind. Among the various ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which curioſity had induced him to explore, he neglected not that which by moſt is eſteemed impious, and by many chimerical: I ſpeak of thoſe arts which relate to the world of ſpirits. His deep reſearches into cauſes and effects, his unwearied application to the ſtudy of natural philoſophy, his profound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited knowledge of the properties and virtues of every gem which enriches the deep, of every herb which the earth produces, at length procured him the diſtinction which he had ſought ſo long, ſo earneſtly.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035729_0305_10065A5ED43848E8"/>
His curioſity was fully ſlaked, his ambition amply gratified. He gave laws to the elements: he could reverſe the order of nature: his eye read the mandates of futurity, and the infernal ſpirits were ſubmiſſive to his commands. Why ſhrink you from me? I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that inquiring look. Your ſuſpicions are right, though your terrors are unfounded. My guardian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed not from me his moſt precious acquiſition. Yet, had I never ſeen <hi>you,</hi> I ſhould never have exerted my power. Like you, I ſhuddered at the thoughts of magic. Like you, I had formed a terrible idea of the conſequences of raiſing a daemon. To preſerve that life which your love had taught me to prize, I had recourſe to means which I trembled at employing. You remember that night which I paſſed in St. Clare's ſepulchre? Then was it that, ſurrounded by moulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bodies, I dared to perform thoſe myſtic rites, which ſummoned to my aid a fallen angel. Judge what muſt have been my joy at diſcovering that my terrors were imaginary. I ſaw the daemon obedient to my orders: I ſaw him trembling at my frown: and found that, inſtead of ſelling my ſoul to a maſter, my courage had purchaſed for myſelf a ſlave."</p>
                     <p>"Raſh Matilda! What have you done? You have doomed yourſelf to endleſs perdition; you have bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered for momentary power, eternal happineſs! If on witchcraft depends the fruition of my deſires, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce your aid moſt abſolutely. The conſequences are too horrible. I dote upon Antonia, but am not ſo blinded by deſire, as to ſacrifice for her poſſeſſion my exiſtence both in this world and in the next."</p>

"Ridiculous prejudices! Oh! bluſh, Ambroſio, bluſh at being ſubjected to their dominion. Where is the riſk of accepting my offers? What ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce my perſuading you to this ſtep, except the wiſh of reſtoring you to happineſs and quiet? If there is danger, it muſt fall upon me. It is I who invoke the miniſtry of the ſpirits: mine therefore will be the crime, and yours the profit; but danger there is none. The enemy of mankind is my ſlave, not my ſovereign. Is there no difference between giving and receiving laws, between ſerving and commanding? Awake from your idle dreams, Ambroſio! throw from you theſe terrors ſo ill ſuited to a ſoul like yours; leave them for common men, and dare to be happy! Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me this night to St. Clare's ſepulchre; there witneſs my incantations, and Antonia is your own."</p>

                     <p>"You <hi>dare</hi> not? How have you deceived me! That mind which I eſteemed ſo great and valiant, proves to be feeble, puerile and grovelling, a ſlave to vulgar errors, and weaker than a woman's."</p>
                     <p>"What? Though conſcious of the danger, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhall I expoſe myſelf to the ſeducer's arts? Shall I renounce for ever my title to ſalvation?

Are you not planning the deſtruction of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, the ruin of a creature whom he formed in the mould of angels? If not of daemons, whoſe aid would you invoke to forward this laudable deſign?

But am I not deceived, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſio! It is not virtue which makes you reject my offer; you <hi>would</hi> accept it but you <hi>dare</hi> not. 'Tis not the crime which holds your hand, but the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 'tis not reſpect for God which reſtrains you, but the terror of his vengeance! Fain would you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him in ſecret, but you tremble to profeſs yourſelf his foe. Now ſhame on the coward ſoul, which wants the courage either to be a firm friend, or an open enemy!"</p>
                     <p>"To look upon guilt with horror, Matilda, is in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a merit: In this reſpect I glory to confeſs myſelf a coward. Though my paſſions have made me devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate from her laws, I ſtill feel in my heart an innate love of virtue. But it ill becomes you to tax me with my perjury: you who firſt ſeduced me to violate my vows; you who firſt rouſed my ſleeping vices, made me feel the weight of religion's chains, and bade me be convinced that guilt had pleaſures.

                     <p>"Oh! ceaſe, Matilda! That ſcoffing tone, that bold and impious language is horrible in every mouth, but moſt ſo in a woman's.

                     <p>"Then yours ſhe will never be! You are baniſhed her preſence; her mother has opened her eyes to your deſigns, and ſhe is now upon her guard againſt them.

                     <p>With theſe words ſhe drew from beneath her habit a mirror of poliſhed ſteel, the borders of which were marked with various ſtrange and unknown characters.</p>
                     <p>

"Amidſt all my ſorrows, amidſt all my regrets for your coldneſs, I was ſuſtained from deſpair by the virtues of this taliſman. On pronouncing certain words, the perſon appears in it on whom the obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's thoughts are bent: thus, though <hi>I</hi> was exiled from <hi>your</hi> ſight, you, Ambroſio, were ever preſent to mine."</p>
                     <p>The friar's curioſity was ſtrongly excited.</p>
                     <p>"What you relate is incredible! Matilda, are you not amuſing yourſelf with my credulity?"</p>
                     <p>"Be your own eyes the judge."</p>
                     <p>She put the mirror into his hand. Curioſity induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to take it, and love, to wiſh that Antonia might appear. Matilda pronounced the magic words. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately a thick ſmoke roſe from the characters traced upon the borders, and ſpread itſelf over the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. It diſperſed again gradually; a confuſed mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of colours and images preſented themſelves to the friar's eyes, which at length arranging themſelves in their proper places, he beheld in miniature Antonia's lovely form.</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio gazed upon it for a few minutes; thoſe few were ſufficient to fix his irreſolution.</p>
                     <p>"I yield!" he cried, daſhing the mirror upon the ground: "Matilda, I follow you! Do with me what you will!"</p>
                     <p>She waited not to hear his conſent repeated. It was already midnight. She flew to her cell, and ſoon returned with her little baſket and the key of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metery,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035729_0310_10065A291290F1E8"/>
which had remained in her poſſeſſion ſince her firſt viſit to the vaults. She gave the monk no time for reflection.</p>
                     <p>"Come!" ſhe ſaid, and took his hand; "follow me, and witneſs the effects of your reſolve."</p>
                     <p>This ſaid, ſhe drew him haſtily along. They paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the burying ground unobſerved, opened the door of the ſepulchre, and found themſelves at the head of the ſubterraneous ſtaircaſe. As yet the beams of the full moon had guided their ſteps, but that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource now failed them. Matilda had neglected to provide herſelf with a lamp. Still holding Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio's hand ſhe deſcended the marble ſteps; but the profound obſcurity with which they were overſpread, obliged them to walk ſlow and cautiouſly.</p>
                     <p>"You tremble!" ſaid Matilda to her companion; "fear not, the deſtined ſpot is near."</p>
                     <p>They reached the foot of the ſtaircaſe; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to proceed, feeling their way along the walls. On turning a corner, ſuddenly they deſcried faint gleams of light, which ſeemed burning at a diſtance. Thither they bent their ſteps. The rays proceeded from a ſmall ſepulchral lamp which flamed unceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly before the ſtatue of St. Clare. It tinged with dim and cheerleſs beams the maſſy columns which ſupported the roof, but was too feeble to diſſipate the thick gloom in which the vaults above were buried.</p>
                     <p>Matilda took the lamp.</p>
                     <p>"Wait for me!" ſaid ſhe to the friar; "in a few moments I am here again."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="unknown:035729_0311_10065A63A2EF34F0"/>
With theſe words ſhe haſtened into one of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which branched in various directions from this ſpot and formed a ſort of labyrinth. Ambroſio was now left alone. Darkneſs the moſt profound ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him, and encouraged the doubts which began to revive in his boſom. He had been hurried away by the delirium of the moment. The ſhame of betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his terrors, while in Matilda's preſence, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to repreſs them; but, now that he was abandoned to himſelf, they reſumed their former aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendancy. He trembled at the ſcene which he was ſoon to witneſs. He knew not how far the deluſions of magic might operate upon his mind; they poſſibly might force him to ſome deed, whoſe commiſſion would make the breach between himſelf and heaven irreparable. In this fearful dilemma, he would have implored God's aſſiſtance, but was conſcious that he had forfeited all claim to ſuch protection. Gladly would he have returned to the abbey; but as he had paſſed through innumerable caverns and winding paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, the attempt of regaining the ſtairs was hopeleſs. His fate was determined; no poſſibility of eſcape pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf. He therefore combated his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and called every argument to his ſuccour, which might enable him to ſupport the trying ſcene with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. He reflected, that Antonia would be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his daring. He inflamed his imagination by enumerating her charms. He perſuaded himſelf, that (as Matilda had obſerved) he always ſhould have time ſufficient for repentance; and that, as he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed <hi>her</hi> aſſiſtance, not that of daemons, the crime of ſorcery could not be laid to his charge. He had read much reſpecting witchcraft; he underſtood that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

a formal act was ſigned renouncing his claim to ſalvation, Satan would have no power over him. He was fully determined not to execute any ſuch act, whatever threats might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e uſed, or advantages held out to him.</p>
                     <p>Such were his meditations while waiting for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda. They were interrupted by a low murmur, which ſeemed at no great diſtance from him. He was ſtartled—he liſtened. Some minutes paſſed in ſilence, after which the murmur was repeated. It appeared to be the groaning of one in pain. In any other ſituation, this circumſtance would only have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited his attention and curioſity. In the preſent, his predominant ſenſation was that of terror. His imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination totally engroſſed by the ideas of ſorcery and ſpirits, he fancied that ſome unquiet ghoſt was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering near him; or elſe that Matilda had fallen a victim to her preſumption, and was periſhing under the cruel fangs of the daemons. The noiſe ſeemed not to approach, but continued to be heard at intervals. Sometimes it became more audible—doubtleſs, as the ſufferings of the perſon who uttered the groans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more acute and inſupportable. Ambroſio now and then thought that he could diſtinguiſh accents, and once in particular he was almoſt convinced that he heard a faint voice exclaim,</p>
                     <p>"God! Oh! God! No hope! No ſuccour!"</p>
                     <p>Yet deeper groans followed theſe words: they died away gradually, and univerſal ſilence again prevailed.</p>
                     <p>"What can this mean?" thought the bewildered monk.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="unknown:035729_0313_10065A68563541C8"/>
At that moment an idea which flaſhed into his mind, almoſt petrified him with horror. He ſtarted and ſhuddered at himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"Should it be poſſible!" he groaned involuntarily; "ſhould it but be poſſible; Oh! what a monſter am I!"</p>
                     <p>He wiſhed to reſolve his doubts, and to repair his fault, if it were not too late already. But theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous and compaſſionate ſentiments were ſoon put to flight by the return of Matilda. He forgot the groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufferer, and remembered nothing but the danger and embarraſſment of his own ſituation. The light of the returning lamp gilded the walls, and in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after Matilda ſtood beſide him. She had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her religious habit: ſhe was now clothed in a long ſable robe, on which was traced in gold embroidery a variety of unknown characters: it was faſtened by a girdle of precious ſtones, in which was fixed a poniard. Her neck and arms were uncovered; in her hand ſhe bore a golden wand; her hair was looſe, and flowed wildly upon her ſhoulders; her eyes ſparkled with terrific expreſſion; and her whole demeanor was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to inſpire the beholder with awe and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>"Follow me!" ſhe ſaid to the monk in a low and ſolemn voice; "all is ready."</p>
                     <p>His limbs trembled while he obeyed her. She led him through various narrow paſſages; and on every ſide, as they paſſed along, the beams of the lamp diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played none but the moſt revolting objects; ſculls, bones, graves, and images whoſe eyes ſeemed to glare
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035729_0314_10065A2DBA0C5618"/>
on them with horror and ſurpriſe. At length they reached a ſpacious cavern, whoſe lofty roof the eye ſought in vain to diſcover. A profound obſcurity hov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered through the void; damp vapours ſtruck cold to the friar's heart, and he liſtened ſadly to the blaſt while it howled along the lonely vaults. Here Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda ſtopped. She turned to Ambroſio. His cheeks and lips were pale with apprehenſion. By a glance of mingled ſcorn and anger ſhe reproved his puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, but ſhe ſpoke not. She placed the lamp upon the ground near the baſket. She motioned that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſio ſhould be ſilent, and began the myſterious rites. She drew a circle round him, another round herſelf; and then, taking a ſmall phial from the baſket, poured a few drops upon the ground before her. She bent over the place, muttered ſome indiſtinct ſentences, and immediately a pale ſulphurous flame aroſe from the ground. It increaſed by degrees, and at length ſpread its waves over the whole ſurface, the circles alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in which ſtood Matilda and the monk. It then aſcended the huge columns of unhewn ſtone, glided along the roof, and formed the cavern into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe chamber totally covered with blue trembling fire. It emitted no heat: on the contrary, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme chillneſs of the place ſeemed to augment with every moment. Matilda continued her incantations; at intervals ſhe took various articles from the baſket, the nature and name of moſt of which were unknown to the friar; but among the few which he diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he particularly obſerved three human fingers, and an agnus dei which ſhe broke in pieces. She threw them all into the flames which burned before her, and they were inſtantly conſumed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="unknown:035729_0315_10065A69E0C38320"/>
The monk beheld her with anxious curioſity. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſhe uttered a loud and piercing ſhriek. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſeized with an exceſs of delirium; ſhe tore her hair, beat her boſom, uſed the moſt frantic geſtures, and, drawing the poniard from her girdle, plunged it into her left arm. The blood guſhed out plentifully; and, as ſhe ſtood on the brink of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſhe took care that it ſhould fall on the outſide. The flames retired from the ſpot on which the blood was pouring. A volume of dark clouds roſe ſlowly from the enſanguined earth, and aſcended gradually till it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the vault of the cavern. At the ſame time a clap of thunder was heard, the echo pealed fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully along the ſubterraneous paſſages, and the ground ſhook beneath the feet of the enchantreſs.</p>
                     <p>It was now that Ambroſio repented of his raſhneſs. The ſolemn ſingularity of the charm had prepared him for ſomething ſtrange and horrible. He waited with fear for the ſpirit's appearance, whoſe coming was announced by thunder and earthquakes. He looked wildly around him, expecting that ſome dreadful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition would meet his eyes, the ſight of which would drive him mad. A cold ſhivering ſeized his body, and he ſunk upon one knee, unable to ſupport himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"He comes!" exclaimed Matilda in a joyful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio ſtarted, and expected the daemon with terror. What was his ſurpriſe when, the thunder ceaſing to roll, a full ſtrain of melodious muſic ſounded in the air! At the ſame time the cloud diſappeared, and he beheld a figure more beautiful than fancy's pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035729_0316_10065A30D865FCA8"/>
ever drew. It was a youth ſeemingly ſcarce eighteen, the perfection of whoſe form and face was unrivalled. He was perfectly naked: a bright ſtar ſparkled upon his forehead, two crimſon wings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended themſelves from his ſhoulders, and his ſilken locks were confined by a band of many coloured fires, which played round his head, formed themſelves into a variety of figures, and ſhone with a brilliancy far ſurpaſſing that of precious ſtones. Circlets of dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds were faſtened round his arms and ankles, and in his right hand he bore a ſilver branch imitating myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. His form ſhone with dazzling glory: he was ſurrounded by clouds of roſe coloured light, and at the moment he appeared, a refreſhing air breathed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes through the cavern. Enchanted at a viſion ſo contrary to his expectations, Ambroſio gazed upon the ſpirit with delight and wonder: yet, however beautiful the figure, he could not but remark a wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the daemon's eyes, and a myſterious melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly imprested upon his features, betraying the fallen angel, and inſpiring the ſpectators with ſecret awe.</p>
                     <p>The muſic ceaſed. Matilda addreſſed herſelf to the ſpirit: ſhe ſpoke in a language unintelligible to the monk, and was anſwered in the ſame. She ſeemed to inſiſt upon ſomething which the daemon was unwilling to grant. He frequently darted upon Ambroſio angry glances, and at ſuch times the friar's heart ſunk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him. Matilda appeared to grow incenſed; ſhe ſpoke in a loud and commanding tone, and her geſtures declared that ſhe was threatening him with her ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. Her menaces had the deſired effect. The ſpirit ſunk upon his knee, and with a ſubmiſſive air preſented to her the branch of myrtle. No ſooner
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035729_0317_10065A6B72E60F50"/>
had ſhe received it, than the muſic was again heard; a thick cloud ſpread itſelf over the apparition; the blue flames diſappeared, and total obſcurity reigned through the cave. The abbot moved not from his place: his faculties were all bound up in pleaſure, anxiety, and ſurpriſe. At length the darkneſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing, he perceived Matilda ſtanding near him in her religious habit, with the myrtle in her hand. No traces remained of the incantation, and the vaults were only illuminated by the faint rays of the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chral lamp.</p>
                     <p>"I have ſucceeded," ſaid Matilda, "though with more difficulty than I expected. Lucifer, whom I ſummoned to my aſſiſtance, was at firſt unwilling to obey my commands: to enforce his compliance, I was conſtrained to have recourſe to my ſtrongeſt charms. They have produced the deſired effect, but I have engaged never more to invoke his agency in your favour. Beware, then, how you employ an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which never will return. My magic arts will now be of no uſe to you: in future you can only hope for ſupernatural aid, by invoking the daemons yourſelf, and accepting the conditions of their ſervice. This you will never do. You want ſtrength of mind to force them to obedience; and unleſs you pay their eſtabliſhed price, they will not be your voluntary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. In this one inſtance they conſent to obey you; I, offer you the means of poſſeſſing your miſtreſs, and be careful not to loſe the opportunity. Receive this conſtellated myrtle: while you bear this in your hand, every door will fly open to you. It will procure you acceſs to-morrow night to Antonia's chamber: then
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035729_0318_10065A3263541528"/>
breathe upon it thrice, pronounce her name, and place it upon her pillow. A death like ſlumber will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſeize upon her, and hold her till break of morning. In this ſtate you may ſatisfy your deſires without danger of being diſcovered; ſince, when day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ſhall diſpel the effects of the enchantment, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia will perceive her diſhonor, but be ignorant of the raviſher. Be happy then, my Ambroſio, and let this ſervice convince you that my friendſhip is diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted and pure. The night muſt be near expiring: let us return to the abbey, leſt our abſence ſhould cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſurpriſe."</p>
                     <p>The abbot received the taliſman with ſilent grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. His ideas were too much bewildered by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of the night, to permit his expreſſing his thanks audibly, or indeed as yet to feel the whole value of her preſent. Matilda took up her lamp and baſket, and guided her companion from the myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cavern. She reſtored the lamp to its former place, and continued her route in darkneſs till ſhe reached the foot of the ſtaircaſe. The firſt beams of the riſing ſun darting down it facilitated the aſcent. Matilda and the abbot haſtened out of the ſepulchre, cloſed the door after them, and ſoon regained the abbey's weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern cloiſter. No one met them, and they retired un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved to their reſpective cells.</p>
                     <p>The confuſion of Ambroſio's mind now began to appeaſe. He rejoiced in the fortunate iſſue of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture: reflecting upon the virtues of the myrtle, he looked upon Antonia as already in his power, and waited with impatience for the approach of midnight.</p>

                     <p>ALL the reſearches of the marquis de las Ciſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas proved in vain. Agnes was loſt to him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Deſpair produced ſo violent an effect upon his conſtitution, that the conſequence was a long and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere illneſs. This prevented him from viſiting El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira, as he had intended; and ſhe being ignorant of the cauſe of his neglect, it gave her no trifling uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. His ſiſter's death had prevented Lorenzo from communicating to his uncle his deſigns reſpecting An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia. The injunctions of her mother forbade his preſenting himſelf to her without the duke's conſent; and as ſhe heard no more of him or his propoſals, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira conjectured that he had either met with a better match, or had been commanded to give up all thoughts of her daughter. Every day made her more uneaſy reſpecting Antonia's fate; yet while ſhe retained the abbot's protection, ſhe bore with fortitude the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of her hopes with regard to Lorenzo and the marquis. That reſource now failed her. She was convinced that Ambroſio had meditated her daughter's ruin; and when ſhe reflected that her death would leave Antonia friendleſs and unprotected in a world ſo baſe, ſo perfidious and depraved, her heart ſwelled with the bitterneſs of apprehenſion. At ſuch times ſhe would ſit for hours gazing upon the lovely girl, and ſeeming to liſten to her innocent prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035729_0320_10065A33F3F1ED88"/>
while in reality her thoughts dwelt upon the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows into which a moment would ſuffice to plunge her. Then ſhe would claſp her in her arms ſuddenly, lean her head upon her daughter's boſom, and bedew it with her tears.</p>
                     <p>An event was in preparation, which, had ſhe known it, would have relieved her from her inquietude. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo now waited only for a favourable opportunity to inform the duke of his intended marriage: howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a circumſtance which occurred at this period obliged him to delay his explanation for a few days longer.</p>
                     <p>Don Raymond's malady ſeemed to gain ground. Lorenzo was conſtantly at his bed-ſide, and treated him with a tenderneſs truly fraternal. Both the cauſe and effects of the diſorder were highly afflicting to the brother of Agnes: yet Theodore's grief was ſcarcely leſs ſincere. That amiable boy quitted not his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a moment, and put every means in practice to conſole and alleviate his ſufferings. The marquis had conceived ſo rooted an affection for his deceaſed miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, that it was evident to all that he never could ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive her loſs. Nothing could have prevented him from ſinking under his grief, but the perſuaſion of her being ſtill alive, and in need of his aſſiſtance. Though convinced of its falſehood, his attendants encouraged him in a belief which formed his only comfort. He was aſſured daily, that freſh perquiſitions were mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſpecting Agnes: ſtories were invented recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the various attempts made to get admittance into the convent; and circumſtances were related, which, though they did not promiſe her abſolute recovery, at
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035729_0321_10065A71C25703A8"/>
leaſt were ſufficient to keep his hopes alive. The marquis conſtantly fell into the moſt terrible exceſs of paſſion, when informed of the failure of theſe ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attempts. Still he would not credit that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ones would have the ſame fate, but flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf that the next would prove more fortunate.</p>
                     <p>Theodore was the only one who exerted himſelf to realize his maſter's chimeras. He was eternally buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in planning ſchemes for entering the convent, or at leaſt of obtaining from the nuns ſome intelligence of Agnes. To execute theſe ſchemes was the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement which could prevail on him to quit Don Raymond. He became a very Proteus, changing his ſhape every day; but all his metamorphoſes were to very little purpoſe. He regularly, returned to the palace de las Ciſternas without any intelligence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his maſter's hopes. One day he took it into his head to diſguiſe himſelf as a beggar; he put a patch over his left eye, took his guitar in hand, and poſted himſelf at the gate of the convent.</p>
                     <p>"If Agnes is really confined in the convent," thought he, "and hears my voice, ſhe will recollect it, and poſſibly may find means to let me know that ſhe is here."</p>
                     <p>With this idea he mingled with a crowd of beggars who aſſembled daily at the gate of St. Clare to receive ſoup, which the nuns were accuſtomed to diſtribute at twelve o'clock. All were provided with jugs or bowls to carry it away; but as Theodore had no utenſil of this kind, he begged leave to eat his portion at the convent door. This was granted without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. His ſweet voice, and, in ſpite of his patched
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035729_0322_10065A384A5DEA58"/>
eye, his engaging countenance won the heart of the good old portereſs, who, aided by a lay ſiſter, was buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſerving to each his meſs. Theodore was bid to ſtay till the others ſhould depart, and promiſed that his requeſt ſhould then be granted. The youth deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no better, ſince it was not to eat ſoup that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf at the convent. He thanked the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs for her permiſſion, retired from the door, and, ſeating himſelf upon a large ſtone, amuſed himſelf in tuning his guitar while the beggars were ſerved.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the crowd was gone, Theodore was beckoned to the gate, and deſired to come in. He obeyed with infinite readineſs, but affected great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at paſſing the hallowed threſhold, and to be much daunted by the preſence of the reverend ladies. His feigned timidity flattered the vanity of the nuns, who endeavoured to reaſſure him. The portereſs took him into her own little parlour: in the mean while the lay ſiſter went to the kitchen, and ſoon returned with a double portion of ſoup of better quality than what was given to the beggars. His hoſteſs added ſome fruits and confections from her own private ſtore, and both encouraged the youth to dine heartily. To all theſe attentions he replied with much ſeeming gratitude, and abundance of bleſſings upon his benefactreſſes. While he ate, the nuns admired the delicacy of his features, the beauty of his hair, and the ſweetneſs and grace which accompanied all his actions. They la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to each other in whiſpers, that ſo charming a youth ſhould be expoſed to the ſeductions of the world, and agreed that he would be a worthy pillar of the catholic church. They concluded their conference by reſolving, that heaven would be rendered a real ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035729_0323_10065A734A72DDA0"/>
if they entreated the prioreſs to intercede with Ambroſio for the beggar's admiſſion into the order of Capuchins.</p>
                     <p>This being determined, the portereſs, who was a perſon of great influence in the convent, poſted away in all haſte to the domina's cell. Here ſhe made ſo flaming a narrative of Theodore's merits, that the old lady grew curious to ſee him. Accordingly the porter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs was commiſſioned to convey him to the parlour grate. In the interim, the ſuppoſed beggar was ſifting the lay ſiſter with reſpect to the fate of Agnes: her evidence only corroborated the domina's aſſertions. She ſaid, that Agnes had been taken ill on returning from confeſſion, had never quitted her bed from that moment, and that ſhe had herſelf been preſent at the funeral. She even atteſted having ſeen her dead body, and aſſiſted with her own hands in adjuſting it upon the bier. This account diſcouraged Theodore: yet, as he had puſhed the adventure ſo far, he reſolved to witneſs its concluſion.</p>
                     <p>The portereſs now returned, and ordered him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her. He obeyed, and was conducted into the parlour, where the lady prioreſs was already poſted at the grate. The nuns ſurrounded her, who all flocked with eagerneſs to a ſcene which promiſed ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Theodore ſaluted them with profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and his preſence had the power to ſmooth for a moment even the ſtern brow of the ſuperior. She aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral queſtions reſpecting his parents, his religion, and what had reduced him to a ſtate of beggary. To theſe demands his anſwers were perfectly ſatisfactory and perfectly falſe. He was then aſked his opinion of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035729_0324_10065A39D2522F80"/>
a monaſtic life. He replied in terms of high eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſpect for it. Upon this the prioreſs told him, that his obtaining an entrance into a religious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was not impoſſible; that her recommendation would not permit his poverty to be an obſtacle: and that, if ſhe found him deſerving it, he might depend in future upon her protection. Theodore aſſured her, that to merit her favour would be his higheſt ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and having ordered him to return next day, when ſhe would talk with him further, the domina quitted the parlour.</p>
                     <p>The nuns, whom reſpect for the ſuperior had till then kept ſilent, now crowded all together to the grate, and aſſailed the youth with a multitude of queſtions. He had already examined each with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Alas! Agnes was not amongſt them. The nuns heaped queſtion upon queſtion ſo thickly, that it was ſcarcely poſſible for him to reply. One aſked where hé was born, ſince his accent declared him to be a foreigner; another wanted to know why he wore a patch upon his left eye: ſiſter Helena inquired wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he had not a ſiſter like him, becauſe ſhe ſhould like ſuch a companion: and ſiſter Rachael was fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the brother would be the pleaſanter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of the two. Theodore amuſed himſelf with relating to the credulous nuns, for truths, all the ſtrange ſtories which his imagination could invent. He related to them his ſuppoſed adventures, and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrated every auditor with aſtoniſhment, while he talked of giants, ſavages, ſhipwrecks, and iſlands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited</p>

                        <l>" By anthropophagi, and men whoſe heads</l>
                        <l>" Do grow beneath their ſhoulders,"</l>
                     </lg>
                     <pb n="70" facs="unknown:035729_0325_10065A7733D07720"/>
                     <p>with many other circumſtances to the full as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. He ſaid that he was born in Terra Incognita, was educated at an Hottentot univerſity, and had paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two years among the Americans of Sileſia.</p>
                     <p>"For what regards the loſs of my eye," ſaid he, "it was a juſt puniſhment upon me for diſreſpect to the Virgin, when I made my ſecond pilgrimage to Loretto. I ſtood near the altar in the miraculous chapel: the monks were proceeding to array the ſtatue in her beſt apparel. The pilgrims were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cloſe their eyes during this ceremony; but though by nature extremely religious, curioſity was too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful. At the moment . . . . . I ſhall penetrate you with horror, reverend ladies, when I reveal my crime! . . . At the moment that the monks were changing her ſhift, I ventured to open my left eye, and gave a little peep towards the ſtatue. That look was my laſt! The glory which ſurrounded the Virgin was too great to be ſupported. I haſtily ſhut my ſacrilegious eye, and never have been able to uncloſe it ſince!"</p>
                     <p>At the relation of this miracle the nuns all croſſed themſelves, and promiſed to intercede with the bleſſed Virgin for the recovery of his ſight. They expreſſed their wonder at the extent of his travels, and at the ſtrange adventures which he had met with at ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an age. They now remarked his guitar, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired whether he was an adept in muſic. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with modeſty, that it was not for him to decide upon his talents, but requeſted permiſſion to appeal to them as judges. This was granted without difficulty.</p>
                     <p>"But at leaſt," ſaid the old portereſs, "take care not to ſing any thing profane."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="unknown:035729_0326_10065A3B58F753B0"/>
"You may depend upon my diſcretion," replied Theodore; "you ſhall hear how dangerous it is for young women to abandon themſelves to their paſſions, illuſtrated by the adventure of a damſel, who fell ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly in love with an unknown knight."</p>
                     <p>"But is the adventure true?" inquired the porter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs.</p>
                     <p>"Every word of it. It happened in Denmark; and the heroine was thought ſo beautiful, that ſhe was known by no other name than that of 'the lovely maid."</p>
                     <p>"In Denmark, ſay you?" mumbled an old nun: "are not the people all blacks in Denmark?"</p>
                     <p>"By no means, reverend lady; they are of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate pea green, with flame coloured hair and whiſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers."</p>
                     <p>"Mother of God! Pea-green?" exclaimed ſiſter Helena: "Oh! 'tis impoſſible!"</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible!" ſaid the portereſs, with a look of contempt and exultation: "Not at all: when I was a young woman, I remember ſeeing ſeveral of them myſelf."</p>
                     <p>Theodore now put his inſtrument in proper order. He had read the ſtory of a king of England, whoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was diſcovered by a minſtrel; and he hoped that the ſame ſcheme would enable him to diſcover Agnes, ſhould ſhe be in the convent. He choſe a ballad, which ſhe had taught him herſelf in the caſtle of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denberg: ſhe might poſſibly catch the ſound, and he
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035729_0327_10065A78BACDF868"/>
hoped to hear her replying to ſome of the ſtanzas. His guitar was now in tune, and he prepared to ſtrike it.</p>
                     <p>"But, before I begin," ſaid he, "it is neceſſary to inform you, ladies, that this ſame Denmark is terribly infeſted by ſorcerers, witches, and evil ſpirits. Every element poſſeſſes its appropriate daemons. The woods are haunted by a malignant power, called 'The Erl, or Oak King:' he it is who blights the trees, ſpoils the harveſt, and commands the imps and goblins. He appears in the form of an old man of majeſtic figure, with a golden crown, and long white beard. His principal amuſement is to entice young children from their parents; and as ſoon as he gets them into his cave, tears them into a thouſand pieces. The rivers are governed by another fiend, called 'The Water King.' His province is to agitate the deep, occaſion ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecks, and drag the drowning ſailors beneath the waves. He wears the appearance of a warrior, and employs himſelf in luring young virgins into his ſnare: what he does with them when he catches them in the water, reverend ladies, I leave for you to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine. 'The Fire King' ſeems to be a man all formed of flames: he raiſes the meteors and wandering lights which beguile travellers into ponds and marſhes, and he directs the lightning where it may do moſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. The laſt of theſe elementary daemons is called 'The Cloud King:' his figure is that of a beautiful youth, and he is diſtinguiſhed by two large ſable wings: though his outſide is ſo enchanting, he is not a bit better diſpoſed than the others. He is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally employed in raiſing ſtorms, tearing up foreſts by
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035729_0328_10065A3CEA1B8A80"/>
the roots, and blowing caſtles and convents about the ears of their inhabitants. The firſt has a daughter, who is queen of the elves and fairies: the ſecond has a mother, who is a powerful enchantreſs. Neither of theſe ladies is worth more than the gentlemen. I do not remember to have heard any family aſſigned to the other two daemons, but at preſent I have no buſineſs with any of them except the fiend of the waters. He is the hero of my ballad; but I thought it neceſſary, before I began, to give you ſome account of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings."</p>
                     <p>Theodore then played a ſhort ſymphony; after which, ſtretching his voice to its utmoſt extent, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate its reaching the ear of Agnes, he ſang the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſtanzas:</p>

                     <p>The youth ceaſed to ſing. The nuns were delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſweetneſs of his voice, and maſterly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of touching the inſtrument: but however accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able this applauſe would have been at any other time, at preſent it was inſipid to Theodore. His artifice had not ſucceeded. He pauſed in vain-between the ſtanzas; on voice replied to his, and he abandoned the hope of equalling Blondel.</p>
                     <p>The convent bell now warned the nuns that it was time to aſſemble in the refectory. They were obliged to quit the grate: they thanked the youth for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment which his muſic had afforded them, and charged him to return the next day. This he promiſed. The nuns, to give him the greater inclination to keep his word, told him that he might always depend upon the convent for his meals, and each of them made him ſome little preſent. One gave him a box of ſweetmeats; another, an agnus dei; ſome brought reliques of ſaints, waxen images, and conſecrated croſſes; and others preſented him with pieces of thoſe works in which the religious excel, ſuch as embroid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, artificial flowers, lace, and needle work. All theſe he was adviſed to ſell, in order to put himſelf
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035729_0332_10065A42BA47F3D0"/>
into better caſe; and he was aſſured that it would be eaſy to diſpoſe of them, ſince the Spaniards hold the performances of the nuns in high eſtimation. Having received theſe gifts with ſeeming reſpect and gratitude,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035729_0333_10065A80D793B0B8"/>
he remarked, that, having no baſket, he knew not how to convey them away. Several of the nuns were haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening in ſearch of one, when they were ſtopped by the return of an elderly woman, whom Theodore had
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035729_0334_10065A4445B41540"/>
not till then obſerved. Her mild countenance, and reſpectable air prejudiced him immediately in her favour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="unknown:035729_0335_10065A840F3EADF0"/>
"Hah!" ſaid the portereſs, "here comes the mother St. Urſula with a baſket."</p>
                     <p>The nun approached the grate, and preſented the baſket to Theodore: it was of willow, lined with blue ſatin, and upon the four ſides were painted ſcenes from the legend of St. Genevieve.</p>
                     <p>"Here is my gift," ſaid ſhe, as ſhe gave it into his hand: "Good youth deſpiſe it not. Though its value ſeems inſignificant, it has many hidden virtues."</p>
                     <p>She accompanied theſe words with an expreſſive look. It was not loſt upon Theodore. In receiving the preſent he drew as near the grate as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>"Agnes!" ſhe whiſpered in a voice ſcarcely intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible.</p>
                     <p>Theodore, however, caught the ſound. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that ſome myſtery was concealed in the baſket, and his heart beat with impatience and joy. At this moment the domina returned. Her air was gloomy and frowning, and ſhe looked if poſſible more ſtern than ever.</p>
                     <p>"Mother St. Urſula, I would ſpeak with you in private."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="unknown:035729_0336_10065A45CD46ED00"/>
The nun changed colour, and was evidently diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed.</p>
                     <p>"With me?" ſhe replied, in a faltering voice.</p>
                     <p>The domina motioned that ſhe muſt follow her, and retired. The mother St. Urſula obeyed her. Soon after, the refectory bell ringing a ſecond time, the nuns quitted the grate, and Theodore was left at liberty to carry off his prize. Delighted that at length he had obtained ſome intelligence for the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, he flew rather than ran till he reached the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel de las Ciſternas. In a few minutes he ſtood by his maſter's bed with the baſket in his hand. Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo was in the chamber, endeavouring to reconcile his friend to a misfortune which he felt himſelf but too ſeverely. Theodore related his adventure, and the hopes which had been created by the mother St. Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula's gift. The marquis ſtarted from his pillow. That fire which ſince the death of Agnes had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, now revived in his boſom, and his eyes ſparkled with eagerneſs of expectation. The emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which Lorenzo's countenance betrayed were ſcarcely weaker, and he waited with inexpreſſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience for the ſolution of this myſtery. Raymond caught the baſket from the hands of his page: he emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied the contents upon the bed, and examined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> with minute attention. He hoped that a letter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>ound at the bottom. Nothing of the kind appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſearch was reſumed, and ſtill with no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſs. At length Don Raymond obſerved that one corner of the blue ſatin lining was unripped he tore it open haſtily, and drew forth a ſmall ſcrap of paper, neither folded or ſealed. It was addreſſed to
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035729_0337_10065A8595973CA8"/>
the marquis de las Ciſternas, and the contents were as follow:</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <p>Having recogniſed your page, I ventured to ſend theſe few lines. Procure an order from the cardinal duke for ſeizing my perſon, and that of the domina; but let it not be executed till Friday at midnight. It is the feſtival of St. Clare: there will be a proceſſion of nuns by torch light, and I ſhall be among them. Beware, not to let your intention be known. Should a ſyllable be dropped to excite the domina's ſuſpicions, you will never hear of me more. Be cautious, if you prize the memory of Agnes, and wiſh to puniſh her aſſaſſins. I have that to tell, will freeze your blood with horror.</p>

                     <p>No ſooner had the marquis read the note, than he fell back upon his pillow, deprived of ſenſe or motion. The hope failed him which till now had ſupported his exiſtence; and theſe lines convinced him but too poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively that Agnes was indeed no more. Lorenzo felt this circumſtance leſs forcibly, ſince it had always been his idea that his ſiſter had periſhed by unfair means. When he found by the mother St. Urſula's letter how true were his ſuſpicions, the confirmation excited no other ſentiment in his boſom than a wiſh to puniſh the murderers as they deſerved. It was no eaſy taſk to recal the marquis to himſelf. As ſoon as he recovered his ſpeech, he broke out into execrations againſt the aſſaſſins of his beloved, and vowed to take upon them a ſignal vengeance. He continued to rave and torment himſelf with impotent paſſion, till his conſtitution, enfeebled by grief and illneſs, could ſupport itſelf no longer, and relapſed into inſenſibility. His melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035729_0338_10065A4A80E844F0"/>
ſituation ſincerely affected Lorenzo, who would willingly have remained in the apartment of his friend: but other cares now demanded his preſence. It was neceſſary to procure the order for ſeizing the prioreſs of St. Clare. For this purpoſe, having committed Raymond to the care of the beſt phyſicians in Madrid, he quitted the hotel de las Ciſternas, and bent his courſe towards the palace of the cardinal duke.</p>
                     <p>His diſappointment was exceſſive, when he found that affairs of ſtate had obliged the cardinal to ſet out for a diſtant province. It wanted but five days to Friday: yet, by travelling day and night, he hoped to return in time for the pilgrimage of St. Clare. In this he ſucceeded. He found the cardinal duke, and repreſented to him the ſuppoſed culpability of the prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, as alſo the violent effects which it had produced upon Don Raymond. He could have uſed no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo forcible as this laſt. Of all his nephews the marquis was the only one to whom the cardinal duke was ſincerely attached: he perfectly doted upon him, and the prioreſs could have committed no greater crime in his eyes, than to have endangered the life of the marquis. Conſequently, he granted the order of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt without difficulty. He alſo gave Lorenzo a letter to a principal officer of the Inquiſition, deſiring him to ſee his mandate executed. Furniſhed with theſe papers, Medina haſtened back to Madrid, which he reached on the Friday a few hours before dark. He found the marquis ſomewhat eaſier, but ſo weak and exhauſted, that without great exertion he could neither ſpeak nor move. Having paſſed an hour by his bed ſide, Lorenzo left him to communicate his deſign to his uncle, as alſo to give Don Ramirez de Mello the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035729_0339_10065A871C2B0F40"/>
cardinal's letter. The firſt was petrified with horror, when he learned the fate of his unhappy niece. He encouraged Lorenzo to puniſh her aſſaſſins, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to accompany him at night to St. Clare's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Don Ramirez promiſed his firmeſt ſupport, and ſelected a band of truſty archers to prevent oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition on the part of the populace.</p>
                     <p>But while Lorenzo was anxious to unmaſk one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious hypocrite, he was unconſcious of the ſorrows prepared for him by another. Aided by Matilda's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal agents, Ambroſio had reſolved upon the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Antonia's ruin. The moment deſtined to be ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to her arrived. She had taken leave of her mother for the night. As ſhe kiſſed her, ſhe felt an unuſual deſpondency infuſe itſelf into her boſom. She left her, and returned to her inſtantly, threw herſelf into her maternal arms, and bathed her cheek with tears. She felt uneaſy at quitting her, and a ſecret preſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſured her that never muſt they meet again. Elvira obſerved, and tried to laugh her out of this childiſh prejudice. She chid her mildly for encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging ſuch ungrounded ſadneſs, and warned her how dangerous it was to give way to ſuch ideas.</p>
                     <p>To all her remonſtrances ſhe received no other anſwer than—</p>
                     <p>"Mother! Dear mother! oh! would to God it were morning!"</p>
                     <p>Elvira, whoſe inquietude reſpecting her daughter was a great obſtacle to her perfect reeſtabliſhment, was ſtill labouring under the effects of her late ſevere illneſs. She was this evening more than uſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035729_0340_10065A4C08C072B0"/>
and retired to bed before her accuſtomed hour. Antonia withdrew from her mother's chamber with regret, and, till the door cloſed, kept her eyes fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her with melancholy expreſſion. She retired to her own apartment: her heart was filled with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs. It ſeemed to her that all her proſpects were blaſted, and the world contained nothing for which it was worth exiſting. She ſunk into a chair, reclined her head upon her arm, and gazed upon the floor with a vacant ſtare, while the moſt gloomy images floated before her fancy. She was ſtill in this ſtate of inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, when ſhe was diſturbed by hearing a ſtrain of ſoft muſic breathed beneath her window. She roſe, drew near the caſement, and opened it to hear it more diſtinctly. Having thrown her veil over her face, ſhe ventured to look out. By the light of the moon ſhe perceived ſeveral men below with guitars and lutes in their hands; and at a little diſtance from them ſtood another wrapped in his cloak, whoſe ſtature and appearance bore a ſtrong reſemblance to Lorenzo's. She was not deceived in this conjecture. It was indeed Lorenzo himſelf, who, bound by his word not to preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Antonia without his uncle's conſent, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by occaſional ſerenades, to convince his miſtreſs that his attachment ſtill exiſted. His ſtratagem had not the deſired effect. Antonia was far from ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this nightly muſic was intended as a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her. She was too modeſt to think herſelf worthy ſuch attentions; and concluding them to be addreſſed to ſome neighbouring lady, ſhe grieved to find that they were offered by Lorenzo.</p>
                     <p>The air which was played was plaintive and melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. It accorded with the ſtate of Antonia's mind,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035729_0341_10065A88D10D2490"/>
and ſhe liſtened with pleaſure. After a ſymphony of ſome length, it was ſucceeded by the ſound of voices, and Antonia diſtinguiſhed the following words:</p>

                     <p>The muſic ceaſed: the performers diſperſed, and ſilence prevailed through the ſtreet. Antonia quitted the window with regret. She, as uſual, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf to the protection of St. Roſolia, ſaid her accuſtomed prayers, and retired to bed. Sleep was not long abſent, and his preſence relieved her from her terrors and inquietude.</p>
                     <p>It was almoſt two o'clock before the monk ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to bend his ſteps towards Antonia's dwelling. It has been already mentioned, that the abbey was at no great diſtance from the ſtrada di San Iago. He reached the houſe unobſerved. Here he ſtopped and heſitated for a moment. He reflected on the enormity of the crime, the conſequences of a diſcovery, and the probability after what had paſſed, of Elvira's ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be the culprit. On the others hand it was ſuggeſted, that ſhe could do no more than ſuſpect; that no proofs of his guilt could be produced; and finally, he believed tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> his fame was too firmly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed to be ſhaken by the unſupported accuſations of two unknown women. This latter argument was perfectly falſe. He knew not how uncertain is the air of popular applauſe, and that a moment ſuffices to make him to-day, the deteſtation of the world, who yeſterday was its idol. The reſult of the monk's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations was, that he ſhould proceed in his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. He aſcended the ſteps leading to the houſe. No ſooner did he touch the door with the ſilver myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, than it flew open, and preſented him with a free
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035729_0343_10065A8BABF8F928"/>
paſſage. He entered, and the door cloſed after him of its own accord.</p>
                     <p>Guided by the moon beams, he proceeded up the ſtaircaſe with ſlow and cautious ſteps. He looked round him every moment with apprehenſion and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety. He ſaw a ſpy in every ſhadow, and heard a voice in every murmur of the night breeze. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of the guilty buſineſs on which he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed appalled his heart, and rendered it more timid than a woman's. Yet ſtill he proceeded. He reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the door of Antonia's chamber. He ſtopped and liſtened. All was huſhed within. The total ſilence perſuaded him that his intended victim was retired to reſt, and he ventured to lift up the latch. The door was faſtened, and reſiſted his efforts. But no ſooner was it touched by the taliſman than the bolt flew back. The intruder ſtepped on, and found himſelf in the chamber, where ſlept the innocent girl, unconſcious how dangerous a viſitor was drawing near her couch. The door cloſed after him, and the bolt ſhot again into its faſtening.</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio advanced with precaution. He took care that not a board ſhould creak under his foot, and held in his breath as he approached the bed. His firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to perform the magic ceremony as Matilda had charged him: he breathed thrice upon the ſilver myrtle, pronounced over it Antonia's name, and laid it upon her pillow. The effects which it had already produced, permitted not his doubting its ſucceſs in prolonging the ſlumbers of his devoted miſtreſs; and no ſooner was the enchantment performed, than he conſidered nor to be abſolutely in his power. He
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035729_0344_10065A4F706D3780"/>
now ventured to caſt a glance upon the ſleeping beauty. A ſingle lamp burning before the ſtatue of St. Roſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, ſhed a faint light through the room, and permitted him to examine all the charms of the lovely object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. She lay with her cheek reclining upon one ivory arm; the other reſted on the ſide of the bed with graceful indolence. A few treſſes of her hair had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped from beneath the muſlin which confined the reſt, and fell careleſsly over her boſom, as it heaved with ſlow and regular ſuſpiration. The warm air had ſpread her cheek with higher colour than uſual. A ſmile inexpreſſibly ſweet played round her ripe and coral lips, from which every now and then eſcaped a gentle ſigh, or an half pronounced ſentence. An air of enchanting innocence and candour was ſpread over every feature. But the modeſty viſible in her whole appearance, inſtead of perſuading him to renounce them, ſerved only to confirm the monk in his deſigns.</p>
                     <p>He remained for ſome moments loſt in motionleſs admiration! Her mouth half open ſeemed to ſolicit a kiſs: he bent over her: he joined his lips to hers, and drew in the fragrance of her breath with rapture.</p>
                     <p>"Gracious God!" at that moment exclaimed a voice behind him: "Am I not deceived? Is not this an illuſion?"</p>
                     <p>Terror, confuſion, and diſappointment accompanied theſe words, as they ſtruck Ambroſio's hearing. He ſtarted, and turned towards the voice. Elvira ſtood at the door of the chamber, and regarded the monk with looks of ſurpriſe and deteſtation.</p>
                     <p>A frightful dream had repreſented to her Antonia
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035729_0345_10065A8EC5C4E9D8"/>
on the verge of a precipice. She ſaw her trembling on the brink: every moment ſeemed to threaten her fall, and ſhe heard her exclaim with ſhrieks, "Save me, mother! ſave me!—Yet a moment, and it will be too late." Elvira woke in terror. The viſion had made too ſtrong an impreſſion upon her mind, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her reſting till aſſured of her daughter's ſafety. She haſtily ſtarted from her bed, threw on a looſe night gown, and, paſſing through the cloſet in which ſlept the waiting woman, reached Antonia's chamber in time to reſcue her from the betrayer's graſp.</p>
                     <p>His ſhame and her amazement ſeemed to have pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified into ſtatues both Elvira and the monk. They remained gazing upon each other in ſilence. The lady was the firſt to recover herſelf.</p>
                     <p>"It is no dream," ſhe cried: "it is really Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio who ſtands before me. It is the man whom Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid eſteems a ſaint, that I find at this late hour near the couch of my unhappy child. Monſter of hypoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy! I already ſuſpected your deſigns, but forebore your accuſation in pity to human frailty. Silence would now be criminal. The whole city ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of your infamy. I will unmaſk you, villain, and convince the church what a viper ſhe cheriſhes in her boſom."</p>
                     <p>Pale and confuſed, the baffled culprit ſtood trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling before her. He would fain have extenuated his offence, but could find no apology for his conduct. He could produce nothing but broken ſentences, and excuſes which contradicted each other. Elvira was too juſtly incenſed to grant the pardon which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted. She proteſted that ſhe would raiſe the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035729_0346_10065ACA3A9880E8"/>
and make him an example to all future hypocrites. Then haſtening to the bed, ſhe called to Antonia to wake; and finding that her voice had no effect, ſhe took her arm, and raiſed her forcibly from the pillow. The charm operated too powerfully. Antonia remained inſenſible; and, on being releaſed by her mother, ſunk back upon the pillow.</p>
                     <p>"This ſlumber cannot be natural," cried the amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Elvira, whoſe indignation increaſed with every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: "ſome myſtery is concealed in it. But trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hypocrite! All your villainy ſhall ſoon be unrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled. Help! help!" ſhe exclaimed aloud: "With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there! Flora! Flora!"</p>
                     <p>"Hear me for one moment, lady!" cried the monk, reſtored to himſelf by the urgency of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: by all that is ſacred and holy, I ſwear that your daughter's honor is ſtill unviolated. Forgive my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion! Spare me the ſhame of a diſcovery, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to regain the abbey undiſturbed. Grant me this requeſt in mercy! I promiſe not only that Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſhall be ſecure from me in future, but that the reſt of my life ſhall prove—"</p>
                     <p>Elvira interrupted him abruptly.</p>
                     <p>"Antonia ſecure from you? <hi>I</hi> will ſecure her. You ſhall betray no longer the confidence of parents. Your iniquity ſhall be unveiled to the public eye. All Madrid ſhall ſhudder at your perfidy and hypoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy. What ho! there! Flora! Flora! I ſay."</p>
                     <p>While ſhe ſpoke thus, the remembrance of Agnes ſtruck upon his mind. Thus had ſhe ſued to him for mercy, and thus had he refuſed her prayer! It was
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035729_0347_10065A904D47CF90"/>
now his turn to ſuffer, and he could not but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that his puniſhment was juſt. In the mean while Elvira continued to call Flora to her aſſiſtance; but her voice was ſo choaked with paſſion, that the ſervant, who was buried in profound ſlumber, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to all her cries: Elvira dared not go towards the cloſet in which Flora ſlept, leſt the monk ſhould take that opportunity to eſcape. Such indeed was his intention: he truſted that, could he reach the abbey unobſerved by any other than Elvira, her ſingle teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony would not ſuffice to ruin a reputation ſo well eſtabliſhed as his was in Madrid. With this idea he haſtened towards the door. Elvira was aware of his deſign: ſhe followed him, and, ere he could draw back the bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, ſeized him by the arm, and detained him.</p>
                     <p>"Attempt not to fly!" ſaid ſhe: "you quit not this room without witneſſes of your guilt."</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio ſtruggled in vain to diſengage himſelf. Elvira quitted not her hold, but redoubled her cries for ſuccour. The friar's danger grew more urgent. He expected every moment to hear people aſſembling at her voice; and, worked up to madneſs by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of ruin, he adopted a reſolution equally deſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and ſavage. Turning round ſuddenly, with one hand he graſped Elvira's throat ſo as to prevent her continuing her clamour, and with the other daſhing her violently upon the ground, he dragged her towards the bed. Confuſed by this unexpected attack, ſhe ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had power to ſtrive at forcing herſelf from his graſp: while the monk, ſnatching the pillow from beneath her daughter's head, covering with it Elvira's face, and preſſing his knee upon her ſtomach with all
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035729_0348_10065ACEE5F59B08"/>
his ſtrength, endeavoured to put an end to her exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He ſucceeded but too well. Her natural ſtrength increaſed by the exceſs of anguiſh, long did the ſufferer ſtruggle to diſengage herſelf but in vai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. The monk continued to kneel upon her breaſt, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed without mercy the convulſive trembling of her limbs beneath him, and ſuſtained with inhuman firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the ſpectacle of her agonies, when ſoul and body were on the point of ſeparating. Thoſe agonies at length were over. She ceaſed to ſtruggle for life. The monk took off the pillow, and gazed upon her. Her face was covered with a frightful blackneſs: her limbs moved no more: the blood was chilled in her veins: her heart had forgotten to beat; and her hands were ſtiff and frozen. Ambroſio beheld before him that once noble and majeſtic form, now become a corſe, cold, ſenſeleſs, and diſguſting.</p>
                     <p>This horrible act was no ſooner perpetrated, than the friar beheld the enormity of his crime. A cold dew flowed over his limbs: his eyes cloſed: he ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered to a chair, and ſunk into it almoſt as lifeleſs as the unfortunate who lay extended at his feet. From this ſtate he was rouſed by the neceſſity of flight, and the danger of being found in Antonia's apartment. He had no deſire to profit by the execution of his crime. Antonia now appeared to him an object of diſguſt. A deadly cold had uſurped the place of that warmth which glowed in his boſom. No ideas offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his mind but thoſe of death and guilt, of preſent ſhame and future puniſhment. Agitated by remorſe and fear, he prepared for flight: yet his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors did not ſo completely maſter his recollection, as to prevent his taking the precautions neceſſary for his
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035729_0349_10065A91D62743C0"/>
ſafety. He replaced the pillow upon the bed, and, with the fatal taliſman in his hand, bent his unſteady ſteps towards the door. Bewildered by fear, he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied that his flight was oppoſed by legions of phantoms. Wherever he turned, the disfigured corſe ſeemed to lie in his paſſage, and it was long before he ſucceeded in reaching the door. The enchanted myrtle produced its former effect. The door opened, and he haſtened down the ſtaircaſe. He entered the abbey unobſerved; and having ſhut himſelf into his cell, he abandoned his ſoul to the tortures of unavailing remorſe, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of impending detection.</p>

                     <p>AMBROSIO ſhuddered at himſelf when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on his rapid advances in iniquity. The enormous crime which he had juſt committed, filled him with real horror. The murdered Elvira was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually before his eyes, and his guilt was already pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed by the agonies of his conſcience. Time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, conſiderably weakened theſe impreſſions: one day paſſed away; another followed it, and ſtill not the leaſt ſuſpicion was thrown upon him. Impunity reconciled him to his guilt. He began to reſume his ſpirits; and as his fears of detection died away, he paid leſs attention to the reproaches of remorſe. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda exerted herſelf to quiet his alarms. At the firſt intelligence of Elvira's death ſhe ſeemed greatly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and joined the monk in deploring the unhappy cataſtrophe of his adventure; but when ſhe found his agitation to be ſomewhat calmed, and himſelf better diſpoſed to liſten to her arguments, ſhe proceeded to mention his offence in milder terms, and convince him that he was not ſo highly culpable as he appeared to conſider himſelf. She repreſented, that he had only availed himſelf of the rights which nature allows to every one, thoſe of ſelf preſervation: that either El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira or himſelf muſt have periſhed; and that her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibility
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:035729_0351_10065A9635958F50"/>
and reſolution to ruin him had deſervedly marked her out for the victim. She next ſtated, that as he had before rendered himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ſpected to Elvira, it was a fortunate event for him that her lips were cloſed by death; ſince, without this laſt adventure, her ſuſpicions, if made public, might have produced very diſagreeable conſequences. He had therefore freed himſelf from an enemy, to whom the errors of his conduct were ſufficiently known to make her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and who was the greateſt obſtacle to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon Antonia. Thoſe deſigns ſhe encouraged him not to abandon. She aſſured him that, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger protected by her mother's watchful eye, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would fall an eaſy conqueſt; and by praiſing and enumerating Antonia's charms ſhe ſtrove to rekindle the deſires of the monk. In this endeavour ſhe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded but too well.</p>
                     <p>As if the crimes into which his paſſion had ſeduced him had only increaſed its violence, he was now bent more earneſtly than ever on procuring its gratification. The ſame ſucceſs in concealing his preſent guilt, he truſted, would attend his future. He was deaf to the murmurs of conſcience, and reſolved to ſatisfy his deſires at any price. He waited only for an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of repeating his former enterpriſe; but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that opportunity by the ſame means was now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable. In the firſt tranſports of deſpair he had daſhed the enchanted myrtle into a thouſand pieces. Matilda told him plainly, that he muſt expect no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſtance from the infernal powers, unleſs he was willing to ſubſcribe to their eſtabliſhed conditions. This Ambroſio was determined not to do. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded himſelf that, however great might be his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,

He therefore reſolutely refuſed to enter into any bond or compact with the fiends; and Matilda, finding him obſtinate upon this point, forebore to preſs him further. She exerted her invention to diſcover ſome means of putting Antonia into the abbot's power: nor was it long before that means preſented itſelf.</p>
                     <p>While her ruin was thus meditating, the unhappy girl herſelf ſuffered ſeverely from the loſs of her moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Every morning on waking, it was her firſt care to haſten to Elvira's chamber. On that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Ambroſio's fatal viſit, ſhe woke later than was her uſual cuſtom: of this ſhe was convinced by the abbey chimes. She ſtarted from her bed, threw on a few looſe garments haſtily, and was ſpeeding to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how her mother had paſſed the night, when her foot ſtruck againſt ſomething which lay in her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. She looked down. What was her horror at recogniſing Elvira's livid corſe! She uttered a loud ſhriek, and threw herſelf upon the floor. She claſped the inanimate form to her boſom, felt that it was dead cold, and, with a movement of diſguſt, of which ſhe was not miſtreſs, let it fall again from her arms. The cry had alarmed Flora, who haſtened to her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The ſight which ſhe beheld penetrated her with horror; but her alarm was more audible than Antonia's. She made the houſe ring with her lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, while her miſtreſs, almoſt ſuffocated with grief, could only mark her diſtreſs by ſobs and groans. Flora's ſhrieks ſoon reached the ears of the hoſteſs. whoſe terror and ſurpriſe were exceſſive on learning
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035729_0353_10065A97C4292F80"/>
the cauſe of this diſturbance. A phyſician was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent for; but, on the firſt moment of beholding the corſe, he declared that Elvira's recovery was beyond the power of art. He proceeded therefore to give his aſſiſtance to Antonia, who by this time was truly in need of it. She was conveyed to bed, while the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady buſied herſelf in giving orders for Elvira's burial. Dame Jacintha was a plain good kind of woman, charitable, generous, and devout; but her intellects were weak, and ſhe was a miſerable ſlave to fear and ſuperſtition. She ſhuddered at the idea of paſſing the night in the ſame houſe with a dead body. She was perſuaded that Elvira's ghoſt would appear to her, and no leſs certain that ſuch a viſit would kill her with fright. From this perſuaſion, ſhe reſolved to paſs the night at a neighbour's, and inſiſted that the funeral ſhould take place the next day. St. Clare's cemetery being the neareſt, it was determined that Elvira ſhould be buried there. Dame Jacintha engaged to defray every expenſe attending the burial. She knew not in what circumſtances Antonia was left; but, from the ſparing manner in which the family had lived, ſhe concluded them to be indifferent: conſequently, ſhe entertained very little hope of ever being recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed. But this conſideration prevented her not from taking care that the interment was performed with decency, and from ſhewing the unfortunate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia all poſſible reſpect.</p>
                     <p>Nobody dies of mere grief; of this Antonia was an inſtance. Aided by her youth and healthy conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe ſhook off the malady which her mother's death had occaſioned; but it was not ſo eaſy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the diſeaſe of her mind. Her eyes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035729_0354_10065AD39AB40B58"/>
filled with tears; every trifle affected her, and ſhe evidently nouriſhed in her boſom a profound and rooted melancholy. The ſlighteſt mention of Elvira, the moſt trivial circumſtance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> that beloved parent to her memory, was ſufficient to throw her into ſerious agitation. How much would her grief have been increaſed, had ſhe known the agonies which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated her mother's exiſtence! But of this no one entertained the leaſt ſuſpicion. Elvira was ſubject to ſtrong convulſions: it was ſuppoſed that, aware of their approach, ſhe had dragged herſelf to her daughter's chamber, in hopes of aſſiſtance: that a ſudden acceſs of her fits had ſeized her, too violent to be reſiſted by her already enfeebled ſtate of health; and that ſhe had expired ere ſhe had time to reach the medicine which generally relieved her, and which ſtood upon a ſhelf in Antonia's room. This idea was firmly credited by the few people who intereſted themſelves about El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira. Her death was eſteemed a natural event, and ſoon forgotten by all, ſave by her who had too much reaſon to deplore her loſs.</p>
                     <p>In truth, Antonia's ſituation was ſufficiently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſing and unpleaſant. She was alone, in the midſt of a diſſipated and expenſive city; ſhe was ill provided with money and worſe with friends. Her aunt Leonella was ſtill at Cordova, and ſhe knew not her direction. Of the marquis de las Ciſternas ſhe heard no news. As to Lorenzo, ſhe had long given up the idea of poſſeſſing any intereſt in his boſom. She knew not to whom ſhe could addreſs herſelf in her preſent dilemma. She wiſhed to conſult Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio, but ſhe remembered her mother's injunctions to
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035729_0355_10065A99B1078380"/>
ſhun him as much as poſſible; and the laſt converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Elvira had held with her upon the ſubject, had given her ſufficient lights reſpecting his deſigns, to put her upon her guard againſt him in future. Still all her mother's warnings could not make her change her good opinion of the friar. She continued to feel that his friendſhip and ſociety were requiſite to her happineſs: ſhe looked upon his failings with a partial eye, and could not perſuade herſelf that he really had intended her ruin. However, Elvira had poſitively commanded her to drop his acquaintance, and ſhe had too much reſpect for her orders to diſobey them.</p>
                     <p>At length ſhe reſolved to addreſs herſelf for advice and protection to the marquis de las Ciſternas, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her neareſt relation. She wrote to him, briefly ſtating her deſolate ſituation: ſhe beſought him to compaſſionate his brother's child, to continue to her Elvira's penſion, and to authorize her retiring to his old caſtle in Murcia, which till now had been her retreat. Having ſealed her letter, ſhe gave it to the truſty Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, who immediately ſet out to execute her commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But Antonia was born under an unlucky ſtar. Had ſhe made her application to the marquis but one day ſooner, received as his neice, and placed at the head of his family, ſhe would have eſcaped all the misfortunes with which ſhe was now threatened. Raymond had always intended to execute this plan: but firſt, his hopes of making the propoſal to Elvira through the lips of Agnes, and afterwards his diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment at loſing his intended bride, as well as the ſevere illneſs which for ſome time had confined him to his bed, made him defer from day to day the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035729_0356_10065AD658ED8010"/>
an aſylum in his houſe to his brother's widow. He had commiſſioned Lorenzo to ſupply her liberally with money. But Elvira, unwilling to receive obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations from that nobleman, had aſſured him that ſhe needed no immediate pecuniary aſſiſtance. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the marquis did not imagine that a trifling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay on his part would create any embarraſſment; and the diſtreſs and agitation of his mind might well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his negligence.</p>
                     <p>Had he been informed that Elvira's death had left her daughter friendleſs and unprotected, he would doubtleſs have taken ſuch meaſures as would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her from every danger. But Antonia was not deſtined to be ſo fortunate. The day on which ſhe ſent her letter to the palace de las Ciſternas, was that following Lorenzo's departure from Madrid. The marquis was in the firſt paroxyſms of deſpair at the conviction that Agnes was indeed no more: he was delirious; and his life being in danger; no one was ſuffered to approach him. Flora was informed that he was incapable of attending to letters, and that probably a few hours would decide his fate. With this unſatisfactory anſwer ſhe was obliged to return to her miſtreſs, who now found herſelf plunged into greater difficulties than ever.</p>
                     <p>Flora and Dame Jacintha exerted themſelves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole her. The latter begged her to make herſelf eaſy, for that as long as ſhe choſe to ſtay with her ſhe would treat her like her own child. Antonia, finding that the good woman had taken a real affection for her, was ſomewhat comforted by thinking that ſhe had at leaſt one friend in the world. A letter was brought
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:035729_0357_10065A9B39DC6890"/>
to her, directed to Elvira. She recogniſed Leonella's writing, and, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pening it with joy, found a detailed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her aunt's adventures at Cordova. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her ſiſter that ſhe had recovered her legacy, had loſt her heart, and had received in exchange that of the moſt amiable of apothecaries, paſt, preſent, and to come. She added, that ſhe ſhould be at Madrid on the Tueſday night, and meant to have the pleaſure of preſenting her caro ſpoſo in form. Though her nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials were far from pleaſing Antonia, Leonella's ſpeedy return gave her niece much delight. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in thinking that ſhe ſhould once more be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a relation's care. She could not but judge it to be highly improper for a young woman to be living among abſolute ſtrangers, with no one to regulate her conduct, or protect her from the inſults to which in her defenceleſs ſituation ſhe was expoſed. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looked forward with impatience to the Tueſday night.</p>
                     <p>It arrived. Antonia liſtened anxiouſly to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages as they rolled along the ſtreet. None of them ſtopped, and it grew late without Leonella's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Still Antonia reſolved to ſit up till her aunt's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival: and, in ſpite of all her remonſtrances, dame Jacintha and Flora inſiſted on doing the ſame. The hours paſſed on ſlow and tediouſly. Lorenzo's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from Madrid had put a ſtop to the nightly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enades: ſhe hoped in vain to hear the uſual ſound of guitars beneath her window. She took up her own and ſtruck a few chords; but muſic that evening had loſt its charms for her, and ſhe ſoon replaced the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in its caſe. She ſeated herſelf at her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery frame, but nothing went right: the ſilks
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035729_0358_10065AD93B9649A8"/>
were miſſing, the thread ſnapped every moment, and the needles were ſo expert at falling that they ſeemed to be animated. At length a flake of wax fell from the taper which ſtood near her upon a favourite wreath of violets: this completely diſcompoſed her; ſhe threw down her needle and quitted the frame. It was decreed that for that night nothing ſhould have the power of amuſing her, ſhe was the prey of ennui, and employed herſelf in making fruitleſs wiſhes for the arrival of her aunt.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe walked with a liſtleſs air up and down the chamber, the door conducting to that which had been her mother's caught her eye. She remembered that Elvira's little library was arranged there, and thought that ſhe might poſſibly find in it ſome book to amuſe her till Leonella ſhould arrive. Accordingly ſhe took her taper from the table, paſſed through the little cloſet, and entered the adjoining apartment. As ſhe looked around her, the ſight of this room brought to her recollection a thouſand painful ideas. It was the firſt time of her entering it ſince her mother's death. The total ſilence prevailing through the chamber, the bed deſpoiled of its furniture, the cheerleſs hearth where ſtood an extinguiſhed lamp, and a few dying plants in the window, which ſince Elvira's loſs had been neglected, inſpired Antonia with a melancholy awe. The gloom of night gave ſtrength to this ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She placed her light upon the table, and ſunk into a large chair, in which ſhe had ſeen her mother ſeated a thouſand and a thouſand times. She was never to ſee her ſeated there again! Tears unbidden ſtreamed down her cheek, and ſhe abandoned herſelf to the ſadneſs which grew deeper with every moment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="unknown:035729_0359_10065A9E26A50548"/>
Aſhamed of her weakneſs, ſhe at length roſe from her ſeat; ſhe proceeded to ſeek for what had brought her to this melancholy ſcene. The ſmall collection of books was arranged upon ſeveral ſhelves in order. Antonia examined them without finding any thing likely to intereſt her, till ſhe put her hand upon a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume of old Spaniſh ballads. She read a few ſtanzas of one of them. They excited her curioſity. She took down the book, and ſeated herſelf to peruſe it with eaſe. She trimmed the taper which now drew towards its end, and then read the following ballad:</p>

The peruſal of this ſtory was ill calculated to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Antonia's melancholy. She had naturally a ſtrong inclination to the marvellous; and her nurſe, who believed firmly in apparitions, had related to her, when

<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035729_0364_10065AE0E13C58B8"/>
was often ſuſceptible of terrors, which, when ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their natural and inſignificant cauſe, made her bluſh at her own weakneſs. With ſuch a turn of mind, the adventure which ſhe had juſt been read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficed to give her apprehenſions the alarm. The hour and the ſcene combined to authorize them. It was the dead of night; ſhe was alone, and in the chamber once occupied by her deceaſed mother. The weather was comfortleſs and ſtormy; the wind howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed around the houſe, the doors rattled in their frames, and the heavy rain pattered againſt the windows. No other ſound was heard. The taper, now burnt down to the ſocket, ſometimes flaring upwards, ſhot a gleam of light through the room, then ſinking again ſeemed upon the point of expiring. Antonia's heart throbbed
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035729_0365_10065AA4871DCED0"/>
with agitation; her eyes wandered fearfully over the objects around her, as the trembling flame illuminated them at intervals. She attempted to riſe from her ſeat, but her limbs trembled ſo violently that ſhe was unable to proceed. She then called Flora, who was in a room at no great diſtance; but agitation choaked her voice, and her cries died away in hollow murmurs.</p>
                     <p>She paſſed ſome minutes in this ſituation, after which her terrors began to diminiſh. She ſtrove to recover herſelf, and acquire ſtrength enough to quit the room. Suddenly ſhe fancied that ſhe heard a low ſigh drawn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> her. This idea brought back her former weakneſs. She had already raiſed herſelf from her ſeat, and was on the point of taking the lamp from the table. The imaginary noiſe ſtopped
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035729_0366_10065AE26802DBE0"/>
her; ſhe drew back her hand, and ſupported herſelf upon the back of a chair. She liſtened anxiouſly, but nothing more was heard.</p>
                     <p>"Gracious God!" ſhe ſaid to herſelf, "what could be that ſound? Was I deceived, or did I really hear it?"</p>
                     <p>Her reflections were interrupted by a voice at the door ſcarcely audible: it ſeemed as if ſomebody was whiſpering. Antonia's alarm increaſed; yet the bolt ſhe knew to be faſtened, and this idea in ſome degree reaſſured her. Preſently the latch was lifted up ſoftly, and the door moved with caution backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Exceſs of terror now ſupplied Antonia with that ſtrength of which ſhe had till then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Scarcely had ſhe reached the middle of the room, when the latch was lifted up a ſecond time. An involuntary movement obliged her to turn her head. Slowly and gradually the door turned upon its hinges, and ſtanding upon the threſhold, ſhe beheld a tall thin figure, wrapped in a white ſhroud which covered it from head to foot.</p>
                     <p>This viſion arreſted her feet; ſhe remained as if petrified in the middle of the apartment. The ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with meaſured and ſolemn ſteps drew near the table. The dying taper darted a blue and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly flame as the figure advanced towards it. Over the table was fixed a ſmall clock; the hand of it was upon the ſtroke of three. The figure ſtopped oppoſite to the clock; it raiſed its right arm, and pointed to
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:035729_0367_10065AA9DD1AD9F8"/>
the hour, at the ſame time looking earneſtly upon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia, who waited for the concluſion of this ſcene, motionleſs and ſilent.</p>
                     <p>The figure remained in this poſture for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The clock ſtruck. When the ſound had ceaſed, the ſtranger advanced yet a few ſteps nearer Antonia.</p>
                     <p>"Yet three days," ſaid a voice faint, hollow, and ſepulchral; "yet three days, and we meet again!"</p>
                     <p>Antonia ſhuddered at the words.</p>
                     <p>"We meet again?" ſhe pronounced at length with difficulty: "Where ſhall we meet? Whom ſhall I meet?"</p>
                     <p>The figure pointed to the ground with one hand, and with the other raiſed the linen which covered its face.</p>
                     <p>"Almighty God! My mother?"</p>
                     <p>Antonia ſhrieked, and fell lifeleſs upon the floor.</p>
                     <p>Dame Jacintha, who was at work in a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chamber, was alarmed by the cry: Flora was juſt gone down ſtairs to fetch freſh oil for the lamp by which they had been ſitting. Jacintha therefore haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened alone to Antonia's aſſiſtance, and great was her amazement to find her extended upon the floor. She raiſed her in her arms, conveyed her to her apartment, and placed her upon the bed, ſtill ſenſeleſs. She then proceeded to bathe her temples, chafe her hands, and uſe all poſſible means of bringing her to herſelf. With
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:035729_0368_10065AE3EFB44BA8"/>
ſome difficulty ſhe ſucceeded. Antonia opened her eyes, and looked round her wildly.</p>
                     <p>"Where is ſhe?" ſhe cried in a trembling voice: "Is ſhe gone? Am I ſafe? Speak to me! Comfort me! Oh! ſpeak to me, for God's ſake!"</p>
                     <p>"Safe from whom, my child?" replied the aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed Jacintha: "What alarms you? Of whom are you afraid?"</p>
                     <p>"In three days! She told me that we ſhould meet in three days! I heard her ſay it! I ſaw her, Jacintha, I ſaw her but this moment!"</p>
                     <p>She threw herſelf upon Jacintha's boſom.</p>
                     <p>"You ſaw her?—Saw whom?"</p>
                     <p>"My mother's ghoſt!"</p>
                     <p>"Chriſt Jeſus!" cried Jacintha; and, ſtarting from the bed, let fall Antonia upon the pillow, and fled in conſternation out of the room.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe haſtened down ſtairs ſhe met Flora aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                     <p>"Go to your miſtreſs, Flora," ſaid ſhe; "here are rare doings! Oh! I am the moſt unfortunate woman alive! My houſe is filled with ghoſts and dead bodies, and the Lord knows what beſides; yet I am ſure nobody likes ſuch company leſs than I do. But go your way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus ſaying, ſhe continued her courſe to the ſtreet door, which ſhe opened; and, without allowing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:035729_0369_10065AAB65180478"/>
time to throw on her veil, ſhe made the beſt of her way to the Capuchin abbey. In the mean while, Flora haſtened to her lady's chamber, equally ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and alarmed at Jacintha's conſternation. She found Antonia lying upon the bed, inſenſible. She uſed the ſame means for her recovery that Jacintha had already employed; but finding that her miſtreſs only recovered from one fit to fall into another, ſhe ſent in all haſte for a phyſician. While expecting his arrival, ſhe undreſſed Antonia, and conveyed her to bed.</p>
                     <p>Heedleſs of the ſtorm, terrified almoſt out of her ſenſes, Jacintha ran through the ſtreets, and ſtopped not till ſhe reached the gate of the abbey. She rang loudly at the bell, and as ſoon as the porter appeared, ſhe deſired permiſſion to ſpeak to the ſuperior. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſio was then conferring with Matilda upon the means of procuring acceſs to Antonia. The cauſe of Elvira's death remaining unknown, he was convinced that crimes were not ſo ſwiftly followed by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as his inſtructors the monks had taught him, and as till then he had himſelf believed. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion made him reſolve to purſue his deſigns upon Antonia, for whom dangers and difficulties only ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have increaſed his paſſion. The monk had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made one attempt to gain admiſſion to her preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but Flora had refuſed him in ſuch a manner as to convince him that all future endeavours muſt be vain. Elvira had confided her ſuſpicions to that truſty ſervant: ſhe had deſired her never to leave Ambroſio alone with her daughter, and, if poſſible, to prevent their meeting altogether. Flora promiſed to obey her, and had executed her orders to the very letter.
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:035729_0370_10065AE577E44210"/>
Ambroſio's viſit had been rejected that morning, though Antonia was ignorant of it. He ſaw that to obtain a ſight of his miſtreſs by open means was out of the queſtion; and both himſelf and Matilda had conſumed the night in endeavouring to invent ſome plan, whoſe event might be more ſucceſsful. Such was their employment when a lay brother enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the abbot's cell, and informed him that a woman calling herſelf Jacintha Zuniga requeſted audience for a few minutes.</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio was by no means diſpoſed to grant the petition of his viſitor. He refuſed it poſitively, and bade the lay brother tell the ſtranger to return the next day. Matilda interrupted him—</p>
                     <p>"See this woman," ſaid ſhe in a low voice; "I have my reaſons."</p>
                     <p>The abbot obeyed her, and ſignified that he would go to the parlour immediately. With this anſwer the lay brother withdrew. As ſoon as they were alone, Ambroſio inquired why Matilda wiſhed him to ſee this Jacintha.</p>
                     <p>"She is Antonia's hoſteſs, replied Matilda; "ſhe may poſſibly be of uſe to you; but let us examine her, and learn what brings her hither."</p>
                     <p>They proceeded together to the parlour, where Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cintha was already waiting for the abbot. She had conceived a great opinion of his piety and virtue; and, ſuppoſing him to have much influence over the devil, thought that it muſt be an eaſy matter for him to lay Elvira's ghoſt in the Red Sea. Filled with this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, ſhe had haſtened to the abbey, As ſoon as
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035729_0371_10065AACEC941C00"/>
ſhe ſaw the monk enter the parlour, ſhe dropped upon her knees, and began her ſtory as follows:</p>
                     <p>"Oh! reverend father! ſuch an accident! ſuch an adventure! I know not what courſe to take; and unleſs you can help me, I ſhall certainly go diſtracted. Well, to be ſure, never was woman ſo unfortunate as myſelf! All in my power to keep clear of ſuch abom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination have I done, and yet that all is too little. What ſignifies my telling my beads four times a day, and obſerving every faſt preſcribed by the calendar? What ſignifies my having made three pilgrimages to St James of Compoſtella, and purchaſed as many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons from the pope as would buy off Cain's puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Nothing proſpers with me! All goes wrong, and God only knows whether any thing will ever go right again! Why now, be your holineſs the judge—My lodger dies in convulſions; out of pure kindneſs I bury her at my own expenſe; [not that ſhe is any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of mine, or that I ſhall be benefited a ſingle piſtole by her death: I got nothing by it, and therefore you know, reverend father, that her living or dying was juſt the ſame to me. But that is nothing to the purpoſe; to return to what I was ſaying]—I took care of her funeral, had every thing performed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and properly, and put myſelf to expenſe enough God knows! And how do you think the lady repays me for my kindneſs? Why truly by refuſing to ſleep quietly in her comfortable deal coffin, as a peaceable well diſpoſed ſpirit ought to do, and coming to plague me, who never wiſh to ſet eyes on her again. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth it well becomes her to go racketing about my houſe at midnight, popping into her daughter's room through the keyhole, and frightening the poor child
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035729_0372_10065AEA4DCE4958"/>
out of her wits! Though ſhe be a ghoſt, ſhe might be more civil than to bolt into a perſon's houſe who likes her company ſo little. But as for me, reverend father, the plain ſtate of the caſe is this: if ſhe walks into my houſe, I muſt walk out of it, for I cannot abide ſuch viſitors—not I. Thus you ſee, your ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, that without your aſſiſtance I am ruined and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever. I ſhall be obliged to quit my houſe: nobody will take it when 'tis known that ſhe haunts it, and then I ſhall find myſelf in a fine ſituation. Miſerable woman that I am! what ſhall I do? what will become of me?"</p>
                     <p>Here ſhe wept bitterly, wrung her hands, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to know the abbot's opinion of her caſe.</p>
                     <p>"In truth, good woman," replied he, "it will be difficult for me to relieve you, without knowing what is the matter with you. You have forgotten to tell me what has happened, and what it is you want."</p>
                     <p>"Let me die," cried Jacintha, "but your ſanctity is in the right! This then is the fact ſtated briefly—A lodger of mine is lately dead; a very good ſort of woman, that I muſt needs ſay for her; as far as my knowledge of her went, though that was not a great way. She kept me too much at a diſtance; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhe was given to be upon the high ropes; and whenever I ventured to ſpeak to her; ſhe had a look with her which always made me feel a little queeriſh: God forgive me for ſaying ſo! However, though ſhe was more ſtately than needful, and affected to look down upon me (though, if I am well informed, I come of as good parents as ſhe could do for her ears, for her father was a ſhoemaker at Cordova, and mine was an
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:035729_0373_10065AAE9E926E68"/>
hatter at Madrid—aye, and a very creditable hatter too, let me tell you,) yet for all her pride ſhe was a quiet well behaved body, and I never wiſh to have a better lodger. This makes me wonder the more at her not ſleeping quietly in her grave; but there is no truſting to people in this world. For my part, I never ſaw her do amiſs, except on the Friday before her death. To be ſure, I was then much ſcandalized by ſeeing her eat the wing of a chicken. 'How, Madona Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra!' quoth I (Flora, may it pleaſe your reverence, is the name of the waiting maid)—'how, Madona Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra!' quoth I, 'does your miſtreſs eat fleſh upon Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days? Well! well! ſee the event, and then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Dame Jacintha warned you of it!' Theſe were my very words; but, alas! I might as well have held my tongue. Nobody minded me: and Flora, who is ſomewhat pert and ſnappiſh (more is the pity, ſay I,) told me, that there was no more harm in eating a chicken than the egg from which it came: nay, ſhe even declared, that if her lady added a ſlice of bacon, ſhe would not be an inch nearer damnation. God protect us! a poor ignorant ſinful ſoul! I proteſt to your holineſs, I trembled to hear her utter ſuch blaſphemies, and expected every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſee the ground open and ſwallow her up, chicken and all; for you muſt know, worſhipful father, that while ſhe talked thus, ſhe held the plate in her hand on which lay the identical roaſt fowl: and a fine bird it was, that I muſt ſay for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>—done to a turn, for I ſuperintended the cooking of it myſelf. It was a little gallician of my own raiſing, may it pleaſe your holineſs, and the fleſh was as white as an egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell, as indeed Donna Elvira told me herſelf. 'Dame

Jacintha,' ſaid ſhe very good humouredly, though, to ſay the truth, ſhe was always very polite to me—"</p>
                     <p>Here Ambroſio's patience failed him. Eager to know Jacintha's buſineſs in which Antonia ſeemed to be concerned, he was almoſt diſtracted while liſtening to the rambling of this proſing old woman. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted her, and proteſted that if ſhe did not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately tell her ſtory and have done with it, he ſhould quit the parlour, and leave her to get out of her diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties by herſelf. This threat had the deſired effect. Jacintha related her buſineſs in as few words as ſhe could ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>age: but her account was ſtill ſo prolix, that Ambroſio had need of his patience to bear him to the concluſion.</p>
                     <p>"And ſo, your reverence," ſaid ſhe, after relating Elvira's death and burial, with all their circumſtances—"and ſo your reverence, upon hearing the ſhriek, I put away my work, and away poſted I to Donna Antonia's chamber. Finding nobody there, I paſſed on to the next: but I muſt own I was a little timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at going in; for this was the very room where Donna Elvira uſed to ſleep. However, in I went, and ſure enough there lay the young lady at full length upon the floor, as cold as a ſtone, and as white as a ſheet. I was ſurpriſed at this, as your holineſs may well ſuppoſe: but, oh me! how I ſhook when I ſaw a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The face was Donna Elvira's I muſt confeſs; but out of its mouth came clouds of fire; its arms were loaded with heavy chains, which it rattled piteouſly; and every hair on its head was a ſerpent as big as my arm. At this I was frightened enough,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:035729_0375_10065AB301138EF8"/>
and began to ſay my Ave Maria: but the ghoſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting me uttered three loud groans, and roared out in a terrible voice, 'Oh! that chicken's wing! my poor ſoul ſuffers for it.' As ſoon as ſhe ſaid this, the ground opened, the ſpectre ſunk down, I heard a clap of thunder, and the room was filled with a ſmell of brimſtone. When I recovered from my fright, and had brought Donna Antonia to herſelf, who told me that ſhe cried out upon ſeeing her mother's ghoſt (and well might ſhe cry, poor ſoul! had I been in her place, I ſhould have cried ten times louder,) it directly came into my head, that if any one had power to quiet this ſpectre, it muſt be your reverence. So hither I came in all diligence, to beg that you will ſprinkle my houſe with holy water, and lay the apparition in the Red Sea."</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio ſtared at this ſtrange ſtory, which he could not credit.</p>
                     <p>"Did Donna Antonia alſo ſee the ghoſt?" ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>"As plain as I ſee you, reverend father."</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio pauſed for a moment. Here was an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offered him of gaining acceſs to Antonia, but he heſitated to employ it. The reputation which he enjoyed in Madrid was ſtill dear to him; and ſince he had loſt the reality of virtue, it appeared as if its ſemblance was become more valuable. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that publicly to break through the rule never to quit the abbey precincts would derogate much from his ſuppoſed auſterity. In viſiting Elvira, he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taken care to keep his features concealed from the domeſtics. Except by the lady, her daughter, and
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035729_0376_10065AED6099D340"/>
the faithful Flora, he was known in the family by no other name than that of father Jerome. Should he comply with Jacintha's requeſt, and accompany her to her houſe, he knew that the violation of his rule could not be kept a ſecret. However, his eagerneſs to ſee Antonia obtained the victory. He even hoped that the ſingularity of this adventure would juſtify him in the eyes of Madrid. But whatever might be the conſequences, he reſolved to profit by the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity which chance had preſented to him. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive look from Matilda confirmed him in his reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution.</p>
                     <p>"Good woman," ſaid he to Jacintha, "what you tell me is ſo extraordinary that I can ſcarcely credit your aſſertions. However, I will comply with your requeſt. To-morrow, after matins, you ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Home!" exclaimed Jacintha; "I go home? Not I, by my troth!—except under your protection, I ſet no foot of mine within the threſhold. God help me! the ghoſt may meet me upon the ſtairs, and whiſk me away with her to the devil! Oh! that I had accepted young Melchior Baſco's offer! then I ſhould have had ſome body to protect me: but now I am a lone woman, and meet with nothing but croſſes and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. Thank Heaven, it is not yet too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. There is Simon Gonzalez will have me any day of the week; and if I live till daybreak, I will marry him out of hand: an huſband I will have, that is determined; for, now this ghoſt is once in my houſe.
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:035729_0377_10065AB81F6C1CF8"/>
I ſhall be frightened out of my wits to ſleep alone. But, for God's ſake reverend father! come with me now. I ſhall have no reſt till the houſe is purified, or the poor young lady either. The dear girl! ſhe is in a piteous taking: I left her in ſtrong convulſions, and I doubt ſhe will not eaſily recover her fright."</p>
                     <p>The friar ſtarted, and interrupted her haſtily.</p>
                     <p>"In convulſions, ſay you? Antonia in convulſions? Lead on, good woman, I follow you this moment."</p>
                     <p>Jacintha inſiſted upon his ſtopping to furniſh himſelf with a veſſel of holy water. With this requeſt he complied. Thinking herſelf ſafe under his protection ſhould a legion of ghoſts attack her, the old woman returned the monk a profuſion of thanks, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted together for the ſtrada di San Iago.</p>
                     <p>So ſtrong an impreſſion had the ſpectre made upon Antonia, that for the firſt two or three hours, the phyſician declared her life to be in danger. The fits at length becoming leſs frequent, induced him to alter his opinion. He ſaid that to keep her quiet was all that was neceſſary; and he ordered a medicine to be prepared, which would tranquillize her nerves, and procure her that repoſe which at preſent ſhe much wanted. The ſight of Ambroſio, who now appeared with Jacintha at her bed ſide, contributed eſſentially to compoſe her ruffled ſpirits. Elvira had not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained herſelf upon the nature of his deſigns, to make a girl ſo ignorant of the world as her daughter aware how dangerous was his acquaintance. At this moment, when, penetrated with horror at the ſcene which had juſt paſſed, and dreading to contemplate the ghoſt's prediction, her mind had need of all the
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:035729_0378_10065AB486C48B40"/>
ſuccours of friendſhip and religion, Antonia regarded the abbot with an eye doubly partial. That ſtrong prepoſſeſſion in his favour ſtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> exiſted, which ſhe had felt for him at firſt ſight: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> fancied, yet knew not wherefore, that his preſence was a ſafeguard to her from every danger, inſult, or misfortune. She thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him gratefully for his viſit, and related to him the adventure which had alarmed her ſo ſeriouſly.</p>
                     <p>The abbot ſtrove to reaſſure her, and convince her that the whole had been a deception of her overheated fancy. The ſolitude in which ſhe had paſſed the evening, the gloom of night, the book which ſhe had been reading, and the room in which ſhe ſat, were all calculated to place before her ſuch a viſion. He treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the idea of ghoſts with ridicule, and produced ſtrong arguments to prove the fallacy of ſuch a ſyſtem. His converſation tranquillized and comforted her, but did not convince her. She could not believe that the ſpectre had been a mere creature of her imagination: every circumſtance was impreſſed upon her mind too forcibly to permit her flattering herſelf with ſuch an idea. She perſiſted in aſſerting that ſhe had really ſeen her mother's ghoſt, had heard the period of her diſſolution announced, and declared that ſhe never, ſhould quit her bed alive. Ambroſio adviſed her againſt encouraging theſe ſentiments, and then quitted her chamber, having promiſed to repeat his viſit on the morrow. Antonia received this aſſurance with every mark of joy; but the monk eaſily perceived that he was not equally acceptable to her attendant. Flora obeyed Elvira's injunctions with the moſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous obſervance. She examined with an anxious eye every circumſtance likely in the leaſt to prejudice
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:035729_0379_10065AB695BA87D0"/>
her young miſtreſs, to whom ſhe had been attached for many years. She was a native of Cuba, had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Elvira to Spain, and loved the young Antonia with a mother's affection. Flora quitted not the room for a moment while the abbot remained there: ſhe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his every word, his every look, his every action. He ſaw that her ſuſpicious eye was always fixed upon him; and, conſcious that his deſigns would not bear inſpection ſo minute, he felt frequently confuſed and diſconcerted. He was aware that ſhe doubted the purity of his intentions; that ſhe would never leave him alone with Antonia: and, his miſtreſs defended by the preſence of this vigilant obſerver, he deſpaired of finding the means to gratify his paſſion.</p>
                     <p>As he quitted the houſe, Jacintha met him, and begged that ſome maſſes might be ſung for the repoſe of Elvira's ſoul, which ſhe doubted not was ſuffering in purgatory.</p>
                     <p>He promiſed not to forget her requeſt; but he perfectly gained the old woman's heart, by engaging to watch during the whole of the approaching night in the haunted chamber. Jacintha could find no terms ſufficiently ſtrong to expreſs her gratitude, and the monk departed loaded with her benedictions.</p>
                     <p>It was broad day when he returned to the abbey. His firſt care was to communicate what had paſſed to his confidant. He felt too ſincere a paſſion for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia, to have heard unmoved the prediction of her ſpeedy death, and he ſhuddered at the idea of loſing an object ſo dear to him. Upon this head Matilda reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him. She confirmed the arguments which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had already uſed: ſhe declared Antonia to have
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035729_0380_10065AF0D7CFE6C8"/>
been deceived by the wandering of her brain, by the ſpleen which oppreſſed her at the moment, and by the natural turn of her mind to ſuperſtition and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous. As to Jacintha's account, the abſurdity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed itſelf. The abbot heſitated not to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> believe that ſhe had fabricated the whole ſtory, either confuſed by terror, or hoping to make him comply more readily with her requeſt. Having overruled the monk's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, Matilda continued thus:</p>
                     <p>"The prediction and the ghoſt are equally falſe: but it muſt be your care, Ambroſio, to verify the firſt. Antonia within three days muſt indeed be dead to the world: but ſhe muſt live for you. Her preſent ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and this fancy which ſhe has taken into her head, will colour a plan which I have long meditated, but which was impracticable without your procuring ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to Antonia. She ſhall be yours, and yours for ever. All the vigilance of her duenna ſhall not avail her; but this very day muſt the ſcheme be put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, for you have no time to loſe. The nephew of the duke of Medina Celi prepares to demand An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia for his bride: in a few days ſhe will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the palace of her relation, the marquis de las Ciſternas, and there ſhe will be ſecure from your attempts. Thus during your abſence have I been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by my ſpies, who are ever employed in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me intelligence for your ſervice. Now then liſten to me. There is a juice extracted from certain herbs known but to few, which brings on the perſon who drinks it the exact image of death. Let this be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered to Antonia: you may eaſily find means to pour a few drops into her medicine. The effect will be throwing her into ſtrong convulſions for an hour:
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035729_0381_10065ABB208A8548"/>
after which her blood will gradually ceaſe to flow, and heart to beat: a mortal paleneſs will ſpread itſelf over her features, and ſhe will appear a corſe to every eye. She has no friends about her: you may charge yourſelf unſuſpected with the ſuperintendance of her funeral, and cauſe her to be buried in the vaults of St. Clare. Their ſolitude and eaſy acceſs render theſe caverns favourable to your deſigns. Give Antonia the ſoporific draught this evening: eight and forty hours after ſhe has drank it, life will revive in her boſom. She will then be abſolutely in your power: ſhe will find all reſiſtance unavailing, and neceſſity will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel her to receive you in her arms."</p>
                     <p>"Antonia will be in my power!" exclaimed the monk; "Matilda, you tranſport me! At length then happineſs will be mine, and that happineſs will be your gift, will be the gift of friendſhip! Oh! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda, how can I expreſs to you my gratitude?"</p>
                     <p>"By profiting by my counſels. Ambroſio I live but to ſerve you; your intereſt and happineſs are equally mine. Be your perſon Antonia's, but to your friendſhip and your heart I ſtill aſſert my claim. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to yours forms now my only pleaſure. Should my exertions procure the gratification of your wiſhes, I ſhall conſider my trouble to be amply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid. But let us loſe no time. The liquor of which I ſpoke is only to be found in St. Clare's laboratory. Haſten then to the prioreſs, requeſt of her admiſſion to the laboratory, and it will not be denied. There is a cloſet at the lower end of the great room, filled with liquids of different colours and qualities; the bottle in queſtion ſtands by itſelf, upon the third ſhelf on the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035729_0382_10065AF25E0499D0"/>
left. It contains a greeniſh liquor: fill a ſmall phial with it when you are unobſerved, and Antonia is your own."</p>
                     <p>The monk ſcrupled not to adopt this infamous plan. His paſſion, but too violent before, had acquired freſh vigour from the ſight of Antonia; and, inflamed by the remembrance of her beauties, he entered into Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda's ſcheme without heſitation.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner were matins over, than he bent his courſe towards the convent of St. Clare. His arrival threw the whole ſiſterhood into the utmoſt amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The prioreſs was ſenſible of the honor done her convent by his paying it his firſt viſit, and ſtrove to expreſs her gratitude by every poſſible attention. He was paraded through the garden, ſhown all the reliques of ſaints and martyrs, and treated with as much reſpect and diſtinction as had he been the Pope himſelf. On his part, Ambroſio received the domina's civilities very graciouſly, and ſtrove to remove her ſurpriſe at his having broken through his reſolution. He ſtated that among his penitents, illneſs prevented many from quitting their houſes. Theſe were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the people who moſt needed his advice and the comforts of religion. Many repreſentations had been made to him upon this account, and, though highly repugnant to his own wiſhes, he had found it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, for the ſervice of Heaven, to change his determination, and quit his beloved retirement. The prioreſs applauded his zeal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and his charity towards mankind. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>clared that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid was happy in poſſeſſing a man ſo perfect and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproachable. In ſuch diſcourſe the friar at length
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:035729_0383_10065ABDF2977250"/>
reached the laboratory: he found the cloſet; the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtood in the place which Matilda had deſcribed, and the monk ſeized an opportunity to fill his phial unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with the ſoporific liquor. Then, having par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken of a collation in the refectory, he retired from the convent, pleaſed with the ſucceſs of his viſit, and leaving the nuns delighted by the honor conferred upon them.</p>
                     <p>He waited till evening before he took the road to Antonia's dwelling. Jacintha welcomed him with tranſport, and beſought him not to forget his promiſe to paſs the night in the haunted chamber. That promiſe he now repeated. He found Antonia tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well, but ſtill harping upon the ghoſt's prediction. Flora moved not from her lady's bed, and, by ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms yet ſtronger than on the former night, teſtified her diſlike to the abbot's preſence. Still Ambroſio affected not to obſerve them. The phyſician arrived while he was converſing with Antonia. It was dark already: lights were called for, and Flora was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to deſcend for them herſelf. However, as ſhe left a third perſon in the room, and expected to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but a few minutes, ſhe believed that ſhe riſked nothing in quitting her poſt. No ſooner had ſhe left the room than Ambroſio moved towards the table, on which ſtood Antonia's medicine. It was placed in a receſs of the window. The phyſician, ſeated in an arm chair, and employed in queſtioning his patient, paid no attention to the proceedings of the monk. Ambroſio <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> opportunity; he drew out the fatal phial, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> a few drops fall into the medicine: he then haſtily left the table, and returned to the ſeat which he had quitted. When Flora made her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:035729_0384_10063CB50E460D80"/>
with lights, every thing ſeemed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as ſhe had left it.</p>
                     <p>The phyſician declared that Antonia might quit her chamber the next day with perfect ſafety. He recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her following the ſame preſcription which on the night before had procured her a refreſhing ſleep. Flora replied, that the draught ſtood ready upon the table: he adviſed the patient to take it without delay, and then retired. Flora poured the medicine into a cup, and preſented it to her miſtreſs. At that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Ambroſio's courage failed him. Might not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda have deceived him? Might not jealouſy have perſuaded her to deſtroy her rival, and ſubſtitute poiſon in the room of an opiate? This idea appeared ſo reaſonable, that he was on the point of preventing her from ſwallowing the medicine. His reſolution was adopted too late. The cup was already emptied, and Antonia reſtored it into Flora's hands. No remedy was now to be found: Ambroſio could only expect the moment impatiently deſtined to decide upon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia's life or death, upon his own happineſs or deſpair.</p>
                     <p>Dreading to create ſuſpicion by his ſtay, or betray himſelf by his mind's agitation, he took leave of his victim, and withdrew from the room. Antonia part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him with leſs cordiality than on the former night. Flora had repreſented to her miſtreſs, that to admit his viſits was to diſobey her mother's orders. She deſcribed to her his emotion on entering the room, and the fire which ſparkled in his eyes while he gazed upon her. This had eſcaped Antonia's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, but not her attendant's, who, explaining
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:035729_0385_10065ABF9DEC7620"/>
the monk's deſigns, and their probable conſequences, in terms much clearer than Elvira's, though not quite ſo delicate, had ſucceeded in alarming her young lady, and perſuading her to treat him more diſtantly than ſhe had done hitherto. The idea of obeying her mother's will at once determined Antonia. Though ſhe grieved at loſing his ſociety, ſhe conquered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſufficiently to receive the monk with ſome degree of reſerve and coldneſs. She thanked him with reſpect and gratitude for his former viſits, but did not invite his repeating them in future. It now was not the fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar's intereſt to ſolicit admiſſion to her preſence and he took leave of her as if not deſigning to return. Fully perſuaded that the acquaintance which ſhe dreaded was now at an end, Flora was ſo much worked upon by his eaſy compliance, that ſhe began to doubt the juſtice of her ſuſpicions. As ſhe lighted him down ſtairs, ſhe thanked him for having endeavoured to root out from Antonia's mind her ſuperſtitious terrors of the ſpectre's prediction: ſhe added, that, as he ſeemed intereſted in Donna Antonia's welfare, ſhould any change take place in her ſituation, ſhe would be careful to let him know it. The monk, in replying, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ook pains to raiſe his voice, hoping that Jacintha would hear it. In this he ſucceeded. As he reached the foot of the ſtairs with his conductreſs, the landlady failed not to make her appearance.</p>
                     <p>"Why, ſurely you are not going away, reveren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> father?" cried ſhe: "Did you not promiſe to paſs the night in the haunted chamber? Chriſt Jeſus! I ſhall be left alone with the ghoſt, and a fine pickle I ſhall be in by morning! Do all I could, ſay all I could, that obſtinate old brute, Simon Gonzalez, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:035729_0386_10065AF6F255CDA0"/>
to marry me to-day: and before to-morrow comes, I ſuppoſe I ſhall be torn to pieces by the ghoſts and goblins and devils, and what not! For God's ſake, your holineſs, do not leave me in ſuch a woful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! On my bended knees I beſeech you to keep your promiſe: watch this night in the haunted cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; lay the apparition in the Red Sea, and Jacintha remembers you in her prayers to the laſt day of her exiſtence!"</p>
                     <p>This requeſt Ambroſio expected and deſired; yet he affected to raiſe objections, and to ſeem unwilling to keep his word. He told Jacintha that the ghoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted no where but in her own brain, and that her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon his ſtaying all night in the houſe was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and uſeleſs. Jacintha was obſtinate: ſhe was not to be convinced, and preſſed him ſo urgently not to leave her a prey to the devil, that at length he granted her requeſt. All this ſhow of reſiſtance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not upon Flora, who was naturally of a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious temper. She ſuſpected the monk to be acting a part very contrary to his own inclinations, and that he wiſhed for no better than to remain where he was. She even went ſo far as to believe that Jacintha was in his intereſt; and the poor old woman was immediately ſet down as being no better than ſhe ſhould be. While ſhe applauded herſelf for having penetrated into this plot againſt her lady's honor, ſhe reſolved in ſecret to render it fruitleſs.</p>
                     <p>"So then," ſaid ſhe to the abbot with a look half ſatirical and half indignant—"ſo then you mean to ſtay here to-night? Do ſo, in God's name! Nobody will prevent you. Sit up to watch for the ghoſt's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival;
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035729_0387_10065AC125329D10"/>
I ſhall ſit up too, and the Lord grant that I may ſee nothing worſe than a ghoſt? I quit not Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Antonia's bed ſide during this bleſſed night. Let me ſee any one dare to enter the room, and be he mortal or immortal, be he ghoſt, devil, or man, I warrant his repenting that ever he croſſed the threſhold!"</p>
                     <p>This hint was ſufficiently ſtrong, and Ambroſio underſtood its meaning. But inſtead of ſhewing that he perceived her ſuſpicions, he replied mildly, that he approved the duenna's precautions, and adviſed her to perſevere in her intention. This ſhe aſſured him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully that he might depend upon her doing. Jacintha then conducted him into the chamber where the ghoſt had appeared, and Flora returned to her lady's</p>
                     <p>Jacintha opened the door of the haunted room with a trembling hand: ſhe ventured to peep in, but the wealth of India would not have tempted her to croſs the threſhold. She gave the taper to the monk, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him well through the adventure, and haſtened to be gone. Ambroſio entered. He bolted the door, placed the light upon the table, and ſeated himſelf in the chair which on the former night had ſuſtained Antonia. In ſpite of Matilda's aſſurances that the ſpectre was a mere creation of fancy, his mind was impreſſed with a certain myſterious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The ſilence of the night, the ſtory of the apparition, the chamber wainſcotted with dark oak pannels, the recollection which it brought with it of the murdered Elvira, and his incertitude reſpecting the nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> more, and he the wretched cauſe of her death . . . . The ſuppoſition was too horrible to dwell upon. He drove away theſe dreadful images, and as often they preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again before him. Matilda had aſſured him that the effects of the opiate would be ſpeedy. He liſtened with fear, yet with eagerneſs, expecting to hear ſome diſturbance in the adjoining chamber. All was ſtill ſilent. He concluded that the drops had not begun to operate. Great was the ſtake for which he now played: a moment would ſuffice to decide upon his miſery or happineſs. Matilda had taught him the means of aſcertaining that life was not extinct for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; upon this aſſay depended all his hopes. With every inſtant his impatience redoubled; his terrors grew more lively, his anxiety more awake. Unable to bear this ſtate of incertitude, he endeavoured to divert it by ſubſtituting the thoughts of others for his own. The books, as was before mentioned, were ranged upon ſhelves near the table: this ſtood exactly oppoſite to the bed, which was placed in an alcove near the cloſet door. Ambroſio took down a volume, and ſeated himſelf by the table: but his attention wandered from the pages before him. Antonia's image, and that of the murdered Elvira, perſiſted to force themſelves before his imagination. Still he continued to read, though his eyes ran over the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters without his mind being conſcious of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                     <p>Such was his occupation when he fancied that he heard a footſtep. He turned his head; but nobody
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:035729_0389_10065AC598242148"/>
was to be ſeen. He reſumed his book; but in a few minutes after, the ſame ſound was repeated, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a ruſtling noiſe cloſe behind him. He now ſtarted from his ſeat, and, looking round him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the cloſet door ſtanding half uncloſed. On his firſt entering the room, he had tried to open it, but found it bolted on the inſide.</p>
                     <p>"How is this?" ſaid he to himſelf: "how comes this door unfaſtened?"</p>
                     <p>He advanced towards it, he puſhed it open, and looked into the cloſet: no one was there. While he ſtood irreſolute, he thought that he diſtinguiſhed a groaning in the adjacent chamber: it was Antonia's, and he ſuppoſed that the drops began to take effect. But upon liſtening more attentively, he found the noiſe to be cauſed by Jacintha, who had fallen aſleep by the lady's bed ſide, and was ſnoring moſt luſtily. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſio drew back, and returned to the other room, muſing upon the ſudden opening of the cloſet door, for which he ſtrove in vain to account.</p>
                     <p>He paced the chamber up and down in ſilence. At length he ſtopped, and the bed attracted his attention. The curtain of the receſs was but half drawn. He ſighed involuntarily.</p>
                     <p>"That bed," ſaid he in a low voice, "that bed was Elvira's! There has ſhe paſſed many a quiet night, for ſhe was good and innocent. How ſound muſt have been her ſleep! and yet now ſhe ſleeps ſounder! Does ſhe indeed ſleep? Oh! God grant that ſhe may! What if ſhe roſe from her grave at this ſad and ſilent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>? What if ſhe broke the bonds of the tomb, and
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:035729_0390_10065AFCFAC39058"/>
glided angrily before my blaſted eyes? Oh! I never could ſupport the ſight! Again to ſee her form diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by dying agonies, her blood ſwollen veins, her livid countenance, her eyes burſting from their ſock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets with pain!—to hear her ſpeak of future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, menace me with Heaven's vengeance, tax me with the crimes I have committed, with thoſe I am going to commit . . . . . Great God! what is that?"</p>
                     <p>As he uttered theſe words, his eyes, which were fixed upon the bed, ſaw the curtain ſhaken gently back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards. The apparition was recalled to his mind, and he almoſt fancied that he beheld Elvira's viſionary form reclining upon the bed. A few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conſideration ſufficed to reaſſure him.</p>
                     <p>"It was only the wind," ſaid he, recovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Again he paced the chamber; but an involuntary movement of awe and inquietude conſtantly led his eye towards the alcove. He drew near it with irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. He pauſed before he aſcended the few ſteps which led to it. He put out his hand thrice to remove the curtain, and as often drew it back.</p>
                     <p>"Abſurd terrors!" he cried at length, aſhamed of his own weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>Haſtily he mounted the ſteps, when a figure dreſſed in white ſtarted from the alcove, and, gliding by him, made with precipitation towards the cloſet. Madneſs and deſpair now ſupplied the monk with that courage, of which he had till then been deſtitute. He ſlew down the ſteps, purſued the apparition, and attempted to graſp it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="unknown:035729_0391_10065AC71FDE6AB0"/>
"Ghoſt, or devil, I hold you!" he exclaimed, and ſeized the ſpectre by the arm.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Chriſt Jeſus!" cried a ſhrill voice; "holy father, how you gripe me! I proteſt that I meant no harm!"</p>
                     <p>This addreſs, as well as the arm which he held, convinced the abbot that the ſuppoſed ghoſt was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial fleſh and blood. He drew the intruder to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the table, and, holding up the light, diſcovered the features of . . . . . Madona Flora!</p>
                     <p>Incenſed at having been betrayed by this trifling cauſe into fears ſo ridiculous, he aſked her ſternly, what buſineſs had brought her to that chamber. Flora, aſhamed at being found out, and terrified at the ſeverity of Ambroſio's looks, fell upon her knees, and promiſed to make a full confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>I proteſt reverend father," ſaid ſhe, "that I am quite grieved at having diſturbed you; nothing was further from my intention. I meant to get out of the room as quietly as I got in; and had you been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that I watched you, you know it would have been the ſame thing as if I had not watched you at all. To be ſure I did very wrong in being a ſpy upon you—that I cannot deny. But, Lord! your reverence, how can a poor weak woman reſiſt curioſity? Mine was ſo ſtrong to know what you were doing, that I could not but try to get a little peep without any body know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing about it. So with that I left old Dame Jacintha ſitting by my lady's bed, and I ventured to ſteal into the cloſet. Being unwilling to interrupt you, I contented myſelf at firſt with putting my eye to the keyhole; but as I could ſee nothing by this means, I
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:035729_0392_10063CB69BEAFCE8"/>
undrew the bolt, and, while your back was turned to the alcove, I whipt me in ſoftly and ſilently. Here I lay ſnug behind the curtain, till your reverence found me out, and ſeized me ere I had time to regain the cloſet door. This is the whole truth, I aſſure you, holy father, and I beg your pardon a thouſand times for my impertinence."</p>
                     <p>During this ſpeech the abbot had time to recollect himſelf: he was ſatisfied with reading the penitent ſpy a lecture upon the dangers of curioſity, and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the action in which ſhe had been juſt diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered. Flora declared herſelf fully perſuaded that ſhe had done wrong; ſhe promiſed never to be guilty of the ſame fault again, and was retiring very humble and contrite to Antonia's chamber, when the cloſet door was ſuddenly thrown open, and in ruſhed Jacintha, pale and out of breath.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Father! Father!" ſhe cried in a voice almoſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hoaked with terror, "What ſhall I do? What ſhall I do? Here is a fine piece of work! Nothing but misfortunes! Nothing but dead people, and dying people! Oh! I ſhall go diſtracted! I ſhall go diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted!"</p>
                     <p>"Speak! Speak!" cried Flora and the monk at the ſame time: "What has happened? what is the matter?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! I ſhall have another co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="138" facs="unknown:035729_0393_10065AC8A7B9A998"/>
Flora ran, or rather flew, to her lady's chamber: Ambroſio followed her, his boſom trembling with hope and apprehenſion. They found Antonia as Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cintha had deſcribed, torn by racking convulſions, from which they in vain endeavoured to relieve her. The monk diſpatched Jacintha to the abbey in all haſte, and commiſſioned her to bring father Pablos back with her without loſing a moment.</p>
                     <p>"I will go for him," replied Jacintha, "and tell him to come hither; but as to bringing him myſelf, I ſhall do no ſuch thing. I am ſure that the houſe is bewitched, and burn me if ever I ſet foot in it again!"</p>
                     <p>With this reſolution ſhe ſet out for the monaſtery, and delivered to Father Pablos the abbot's orders. She then betook herſelf to the houſe of old Simon Gonzalez, whom ſhe reſolved never to quit till ſhe had made him her huſband, and his dwelling her own.</p>
                     <p>Father Pablos had no ſooner beheld Antonia, than he pronounced her incurable. The convulſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for an hour; during that time her agonies were much milder than thoſe which her groans created in the abbot's heart. Her every pang ſeemed a dagger in his boſom, and he curſed himſelf a thouſand times for having adopted ſo barbarous a project. The hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expired, by degrees the fits became leſs frequent, and Antonia leſs agitated. She felt that her diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was approaching, and that nothing could ſave her.</p>
                     <p>"Worthy Ambroſio," ſhe ſaid in a feeble voice, while ſhe preſſed his hand to her lips; "I am now at
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:035729_0394_10065AFE870A2B78"/>
liberty to expreſs how grateful is my heart for your attention and kindneſs. I am upon the bed of death; yet an hour, and I ſhall be no more. I may therefore acknowledge without reſtraint, that to relinquiſh your ſociety was very painful to me: but ſuch was the will of a parent, and I dared not diſobey. I die without repugnance: there are few who will lament my leaving them—there are few whom I lament to leave. Among thoſe few, I lament for none more than for yourſelf; but we ſhall meet again Ambroſio! we ſhall one day meet in heaven: there ſhall our friendſhip be renewed, and my mother ſhall view it with pleaſure!</p>
                     <p>She pauſed. The abbot ſhuddered when ſhe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Elvira. Antonia imputed his emotion to pity and concern for her.</p>
                     <p>"You are grieved for me, Father," ſhe continued: "Ah! ſigh not for my loſs. I have no crimes to repent, at leaſt none of which I am conſcious; and I reſtore my ſoul without fear to him from whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it. I have but few requeſts to make; yet let me hope that what few I have ſhall be granted. Let a ſolemn maſs be ſaid for my ſoul's repoſe, and another for that of my beloved mother; not that I doubt her reſting in her grave. I am now convinced that my reaſon wandered, and the falſehood of the ghoſt's prediction is ſufficient to prove my error. But every one has ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This done, I have nothing more to aſk for than your prayers. Promiſe to remember my requeſts, and I ſhall reſign my life without a pang or ſorrow."</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio engaged to comply with her deſires, and proceeded to give her abſolution. Every moment announced the approach of Antonia's fate. Her ſight failed, her heart beat ſluggiſhly, her fingers ſtiffened and grew cold, and at two in the morning ſhe expired without a groan. As ſoon as the breath had forſaken her body, father Pablos retired, ſincerely affected at the melancholy ſcene. On her part, Flora gave way to the moſt unbridled ſorrow. Far different concerns employed Ambroſio: he ſought for the pulſe whoſe throbbing, ſo Matilda had aſſured him, would prove Antonia's death but temporal. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ound it—he preſſed it—it palpitated beneath his hand, and his heart was filled with ecſtacy. However, he carefully concealed his ſatisfaction at the ſucceſs of his plan. He aſſumed a melancholy air, and addreſſing himſelf to Flora, warned her againſt abandoning herſelf to fruitleſs ſorrow. Her tears were too ſincere to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her liſtening to his counſels, and ſhe continued to weep unceaſingly. The friar withdrew, firſt promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give orders himſelf about the funeral, which, out of conſideration for Jacintha, as he pretended,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:035729_0396_10065BD0904A7C88"/>
ſhould take place with all expedition. Plunged in grief for the loſs of her beloved miſtreſs, Flora ſcarcely attended to what he ſaid. Ambroſio haſtened to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the burial. He obtained permiſſion from the prioreſs, that the corſe ſhould be depoſited in St. Clare's ſepulchre: and on the Friday morning, every proper and needful ceremony being performed, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia's body was committed to the tomb.</p>
                     <p>On the ſame day Leonella arrived at Madrid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to preſent her young huſband to Elvira. Various circumſtances had obliged her to defer her journey from Tueſday to Friday; and ſhe had no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of making this alteration in her plans known to her ſiſter. As her heart was truly affectionate, and as ſhe had ever entertained a ſincere regard for Elvira and her daughter, her ſurpriſe at hearing of their ſudden and melancholy fate was fully equalled by her ſorrow and diſappointment. Ambroſio ſent to inform her of Antonia's bequeſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>HIS whole attention bent upon bringing to juſtice the aſſaſſins of his ſiſter, Lorenzo little thought how ſeverely his intereſt was ſuffering in another quarter. As was before mentioned, he returned not to Madrid till the evening of that day on which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia was buried. Signifying to the Grand Inquiſitor the order of the cardinal duke (a ceremony not to be neglected when a member of the church was to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted publicly), communicating his deſign to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Don Ramirez, and aſſembling a troop of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants ſufficient to prevent oppoſition, furniſhed him with full occupation during the few hours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding midnight. Conſequently he had no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to inquire about his miſtreſs, and was perfectly ignorant both of her death and her mother's.</p>
                     <p>The marquis was by no means out of danger: his delirium was gone, but had left him ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, that the phyſicians declined pronouncing upon the conſequences likely to enſue. As for Raymond himſelf, he wiſhed for nothing more earneſtly than to join Agnes in the grave. Exiſtence was hateful to him: he ſaw nothing in the world deſerving his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and he hoped to hear that Agnes was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged and himſelf given over in the ſame moment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="unknown:035729_0398_10065B0010D9A8E0"/>
Followed by Raymond's ardent prayers for ſucceſs, Lorenzo was at the gates of St. Clare a full hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time appointed by the mother St. Urſula. He was accompanied by his uncle, by Don Ramirez de Mello, and a party of choſen archers. Though in conſiderable numbers, their appearance created no ſurpriſe: a great crowd was already aſſembled before the convent doors, in order to witneſs the proceſſion. It was naturally ſuppoſed, that Lorenzo and his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants were conducted thither by the ſame deſign. The duke of Medina being recogniſed, the people drew back, and made way for his party to advance. Lorenzo placed himſelf oppoſite to the great gate, through which the pilgrims were to paſs. Convinced that the prioreſs could not eſcape him, he waited pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for her appearance, which ſhe was expected to make exactly at midnight.</p>
                     <p>The nuns were employed in religious duties eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in honor of St. Clare, and to which no profane was ever admitted. The chapel windows were illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated. As they ſtood on the outſide, the auditors heard the full ſwell of the organ, accompanied by a chorus of female voices, riſe upon the ſtillneſs of the night. This died away, and was ſucceeded by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſtrain of harmony: it was the voice of her who was deſtined to ſuſtain in the proceſſion the character of St. Clare. For this office the moſt beautiful virgin of Madrid was always ſelected, and ſhe upon whom the choice fell, eſteemed it as the higheſt of honors. While liſtening to the muſic, whoſe melody diſtance only ſeemed to render ſweeter,<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="144" facs="unknown:035729_0399_10065B39B5191420"/>
wrapped up in profound attention. Univerſal ſilence prevailed through the crowd, and every heart was filled with reverence for religion—every heart but Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo's. Conſcious that among thoſe who chanted the praiſes of their God ſo ſweetly there were ſome who cloaked with devotion the fouleſt ſins, their hymns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him with deteſtation of their hypocriſy. He had long obſerved with diſapprobation and contempt the ſuperſtition which governed Madrid's inhabitants. His good ſenſe had pointed out to him the artifices of the monks, and the groſs abſurdity of their miracles, wonders, and ſuppoſititious reliques. He bluſhed to ſee his countrymen the dupes of deceptions ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and only wiſhed for an opportunity to free them from their monkiſh fetters. That opportunity, ſo long deſired in vain, was at length preſented to him. He reſolved not to let it ſlip, but to ſet before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in glaring colours, how enormous were the abuſes but too frequently practiſed in monaſteries, and how unjuſtly public eſteem was beſtowed indiſcriminately upon all who wore a religious habit. He longed for the moment deſtined to unmaſk the hypocrites, and convince his countrymen, that a ſanctified exterior does not always hide a virtuous heart.</p>
                     <p>The ſervice laſted till midnight was announced by the convent bell. That ſound being heard, the muſic ceaſed: the voices died away ſoftly, and ſoon after the lights diſappeared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> on whoſe depoſition every thing depended. Unleſs the mother St. Urſula ſhould be preſent, he could only accuſe the prioreſs upon ſuſpicion; and this reflection gave him ſome little apprehenſion for the ſucceſs of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. The tranquillity which ſeemed to reign through the convent, in ſome degree reaſſured him: ſtill he expected the moment eagerly, when the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his ally ſhould deprive him of the power of doubting.</p>
                     <p>The abbey of Capuchins was only ſeparated from the convent by the garden and cemetery. The monks had been invited to aſſiſt at the pilgrimage. They now arrived, marching two by two with lighted torches in their hands, and chanting hymns in honor of St. Clare. Father Pablos was at their head, the abbot having excuſed himſelf from attending. The people made way for the holy train, and the friars placed themſelves in ranks on either ſide of the great gates. A few minutes ſufficed to arrange the order of the proceſſion. This being ſettled, the convent doors were thrown open, and again the female chorus ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in full melody. Firſt appeared a band of chor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters. As ſoon as they had paſſed, the monks fell in two by two, and followed with ſteps ſlow and meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured: next came the novices: they bore no tapers as did the profeſſed, but moved on with eyes bent down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſeemed to be occupied by telling their beads. To them ſucceeded a young and lovely girl, who repreſented St. Lucia: ſhe held a golden baſon,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035729_0401_10065B3CD2D5A7C0"/>
in which were two eyes: her own were covered by a velvet bandage, and ſhe was conducted by another nun habited as an angel. She was followed by St. Catherine, a palm branch in one hand, a flaming ſword in the other; ſhe was robed in white, and her brow was ornamented with a ſparkling diadem. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her appeared St. Genevieve, ſurrounded by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of imps, who, putting themſelves into groteſque attitudes, drawing her by the robe, and ſporting round her with antic geſtures, endeavoured to diſtract her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from the book on which her eyes were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fixed. Theſe merry devils greatly entertained the ſpectators, who teſtified their pleaſure by repeated burſts of laughter. The prioreſs had been careful to ſelect a nun whoſe diſpoſition was naturally ſolemn and ſaturnine. She had every reaſon to be ſatisfied with her choice: the drolleries of the imps were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely thrown away, and St. Genevieve moved on without diſcompoſing a muſcle.</p>
                     <p>Each of theſe ſaints was ſeparated from the other by a band of choriſters, exalting her praiſe in their hymns, but declaring her to be very much inferior to St. Clare, the convent's avowed patroneſs. Theſe having paſſed, a long train of nuns appeared, bearing like the choriſters, each a burning taper. Next came the reliques of St. Clare, incloſed in vaſes equally precious for their materials and workmanſhip: but they attracted not Lorenzo's attention. The nun who bore the heart occupied him entirely. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Theodore's deſcription, he doubted not her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mother St. Urſula. She ſeemed to look round with anxiety. As he ſtood foremoſt in the rank by which the proceſſion paſſed, her eye caught Lorenzo's.
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:035729_0402_10065B0475CC9158"/>
A fluſh of joy overſpread her till then pallid cheek. She turned to her companion eagerly.</p>
                     <p>"We are ſafe," he heard her whiſper, "'tis her brother."</p>
                     <p>His heart being now at eaſe, Lorenzo gazed with tranquillity upon the remainder of the ſhow. Now appeared its moſt brilliant ornament: it was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine faſhioned like a throne, rich with jewels, and dazzling with light. It rolled onwards upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed wheels, and was guided by ſeveral lovely chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren dreſſed as ſeraphs. The ſummit was covered with ſilver clouds, upon which reclined the moſt beautiful form that eyes ever witneſſed. It was a damſel repreſenting St. Clare: her dreſs was of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable price, and round her head a wreath of dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds formed an artificial glory: but all theſe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments yielded to the luſtre of her charms. As ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, a murmur of delight ran through the crowd. Even Lorenzo confeſſed ſecretly, that he never beheld more perfect beauty; and had not his heart been An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia's, it muſt have fallen a ſacrifice to this enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing girl. As it was, he conſidered her only as a fine ſtatue: ſhe obtained from him no tribute ſave cold admiration: and when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he had paſſed him, he thought of her no more.</p>
                     <p>"Who is ſhe?" aſked a byſtander in Lorenzo's hearing.</p>
                     <p>"One whoſe beauty you muſt often have heard celebrated. Her name is Virginia de Villa Franca: ſhe is a penſioner of St. Clare's convent, a relation of the prioreſs, and has been ſelected with juſtice as the ornament of the proceſſion."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="148" facs="unknown:035729_0403_10065B3FD95AB900"/>
The throne moved onwards. It was followed by the prioreſs herſelf: ſhe marched at the head of the remaining nuns with a devout and ſanctified air, and cloſed the proceſſion. She moved on ſlowly: her eyes were raiſed to Heaven: her countenance calm and tranquil, ſeemed abſtracted from all ſublunary things, and no feature betrayed her ſecret pride at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing the pomp and opulence of her convent. She paſſed along, accompanied by the prayers and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the populace: but how great was the general confuſion and ſurpriſe when Don Ramirez, ſtarting forward, challenged her as his priſoner!</p>
                     <p>For a moment amazement held the domina ſilent and immoveable: but no ſooner did ſhe recover her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than ſhe exclaimed againſt ſacrilege and impiety, and called upon the people to reſcue a daughter of the church. They were eagerly preparing to obey her, when Don Ramirez, protected by the archers from their rage, commanded them to forbear, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened them with the ſevereſt vengeance of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. At that dreaded word every arm fell, every ſword ſhrunk back into its ſcabbard. The prioreſs herſelf turned pale, and trembled. The general ſilence convinced her that ſhe had nothing to hope but from innocence, and ſhe beſought Don Ramirez in a faltering voice to inform her of what crime ſhe was accuſed.</p>
                     <p>"That you ſhall know in time," replied he; "but firſt I muſt ſecure the mother St. Urſula."</p>
                     <p>"The mother St. Urſula?" repeated the domina faintly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="unknown:035729_0404_10065B07FB508A30"/>
At this moment caſting her eyes round, ſhe ſaw Lorenzo and the duke, who had followed Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirez.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! great God!" ſhe cried, claſping her hands together with a frantic air, "I am betrayed."</p>
                     <p>"Betrayed?" replied St. Urſula, who now arrived conducted by ſome of the archers, and followed by the nun her companion in the proceſſion: "not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, but diſcovered. In me recogniſe your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer: you know not how well I am inſtructed in your guilt:—Segnor," ſhe continued, turning to Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirez, "I commit myſelf to your cuſtody. I charge the prioreſs of St. Clare with murder, and ſtake my life for the juſtice of my accuſation."</p>
                     <p>A general cry of ſurpriſe was uttered by the whole audience, and an explanation was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> demanded. The trembling nuns, terrified at the noiſe and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal confuſion, had diſperſed, and fled different ways. Some regained the convent: others ſought refuge in the dwellings of their relations; and many, only ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their preſent danger, and anxious to eſcape from the tumult, ran through the ſtreets, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered they knew not whither. The lovely Virginia was one of the firſt to fly. And in order that ſhe might be better ſeen and heard, the people deſired that St. Urſula ſhould harrangue them from the vacant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The nun complied: ſhe aſcended the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> machine, and then addreſſed the ſurrounding multitude as follows:</p>
                     <p>"However ſtrange and unſeemly may appear my conduct, when conſidered to be adopted by a female
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:035729_0405_10065B41610844B0"/>
and a nun, neceſſity will juſtify it moſt fully. A ſecret, an horrible ſecret weighs heavy upon my ſoul: no reſt can be mine till I have revealed it to the world, and ſatisfied that innocent blood which calls from the grave for vengeance. Much have I dared, to gain this opportunity of lightening my conſcience. Had I failed in my attempt to reveal the crime, had the domina but ſuſpected that the myſtery was known to me, my ruin was inevitable. Angels who watch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſingly over thoſe who deſerve their favour, have enabled me to eſcape detection. I am now at liberty to relate a tale, whoſe circumſtances will freeze every honeſt ſoul with horror. Mine is the taſk to rend the veil from hypocriſy, and ſhew miſguided parents to what dangers the woman is expoſed, who falls under the ſway of a monaſtic tyrant.</p>
                     <p>"Among the votaries of St. Clare, none was more lovely, none more gentle, than Agnes de Medina. I knew her well: ſhe entruſted to me every ſecret of her heart: I was her friend and confidant, and I loved her with ſincere affection. Nor was I ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in my attachment. Her piety unfeigned, her willingneſs to oblige, and her angelic diſpoſition, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her the darling of all that was eſtimable in the convent. The prioreſs herſelf, proud, ſcrupulous and forbidding, could not refuſe Agnes that tribute of approbation which ſhe beſtowed upon no one elſe. Every one has ſome fault. Alas! Agnes had her weakneſs: ſhe violated the laws of our order, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the inveterate hate of the unforgiving domina. St. Clare's rules are ſevere: but grown antiquated and neglected, many of late years have either been forgotten, or changed by univerſal conſent into milder
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:035729_0406_10065B09A7008EE0"/>
puniſhments. The penance adjudged to the crime of Agnes was moſt cruel, moſt inhuman. The law had been long exploded. Alas! it ſtill exiſted, and the revengeful prioreſs now determined to revive it. This law decreed, that the offender ſhould be plunged into a private dungeon, expreſsly conſtituted to hide from the world for ever the victim of cruelty and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannic ſuperſtition. In this dreadful abode ſhe was to lead a perpetual ſolitude, deprived of all ſociety, and believed to be dead by thoſe whom affection might have prompted to attempt her reſcue. Thus was ſhe to languiſh out the remainder of her days, with no other food than bread and water, and no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort than the free indulgence of her tears."</p>
                     <p>The indignation created by this account was ſo violent, as for ſome moments to interrupt St. Urſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's narrative. When the diſturbance ceaſed, and ſilence again prevailed through the aſſembly, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her diſcourſe, while at every word the domina's countenance betrayed her increaſing terrors.</p>
                     <p>"A council of the twelve elder nuns was called: I was of the number. The prioreſs in exaggerated colours deſcribed the offence of Agnes, and ſcrupled not to propoſe the revival of this almoſt forgotten law. To the ſhame of our ſex be it ſpoken, that, either ſo abſolute was the domina's will in the convent, or ſo much had diſappointment, ſolitude, and ſelf denial hardened their hearts and ſoured their tempers, this barbarous propoſal was aſſented to by nine voices out of the twelve. I was not one of the nine. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent opportunities had convinced me of the virtues of Agnes, and I loved and pitied her moſt ſincerely. The mothers Bertha and Cornelia joined my party:
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:035729_0407_10065B44CC52F010"/>
we made the ſtrongeſt oppoſition poſſible, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior found herſelf compelled to change her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In ſpite of the majority in her favour, ſhe feared to break with us openly. She knew that, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Medina family, our forces would be too ſtrong for her to cope with: and ſhe alſo knew that, after being once impriſoned, and ſuppoſed dead, ſhould Agnes be diſcovered, her ruin would be inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſhe therefore gave up her deſign, though with much reluctance. She demanded ſome days to reflect upon a mode of puniſhment, which might be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the whole community; and ſhe promiſed, that as ſoon as her reſolution was fixed, the ſame council ſhould be again ſummoned. Two days paſſed away: on the evening of the third it was announced, that on the next morning Agnes ſhould be examined: and that according to her behaviour on that occaſion her puniſhment ſhould be either ſtrengthened or miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>
                     <p>"On the night preceding this examination, I ſtole to the cell of Agnes at an hour when I ſuppoſed the other nuns to be buried in ſleep. I comforted her to the beſt of my power: I bade her take courage, told her to rely upon the ſupport of her friends, and taught her certain ſigns, by which I might inſtruct her to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the domina's queſtions by an aſſent or negative. Conſcious that her enemy would ſtrive to confuſe, embarraſs, and daunt her, I feared her being enſnared into ſome confeſſion prejudicial to her intereſts. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anxious to keep my viſit ſecret, I ſtayed with Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes but a ſhort time. I bade her not to let her ſpirits be caſt down. I mingled my tears with thoſe which ſtreamed down her cheek, embraced her fondly, and
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:035729_0408_10065B0B31DFF1C0"/>
was on the point of retiring, when I heard the ſound of ſteps approaching the cell. I ſtarted back. A cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which veiled a large crucifix offered me a retreat, and I haſtened to place myſelf behind it. The door opened. The prioreſs entered, followed by four other nuns. They advanced towards the bed of Agnes. The ſuperior reproached her with her errors in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt terms. She told her, that ſhe was a diſgrace to the convent, that ſhe was reſolved to deliver the world and herſelf from ſuch a monſter, and commanded her to drink the contents of a goblet now preſented to her by one of the nuns. Aware of the fatal properties of the liquor, and trembling to find herſelf upon the brink of eternity, the unhappy girl ſtrove to excite the dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ina's pity by the moſt affecting prayers. She ſued for life in terms which might have melted the heart of a fiend. She promiſed to ſubmit patiently to any pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, to ſhame, impriſonment, and torture, might ſhe but be permitted to live! Oh! might ſhe but live another month, or week, or day! Her mercileſs enemy liſtened to her complaints unmoved: ſhe told her, that at firſt ſhe meant to have ſpared her life, and that if ſhe had altered her intention ſhe had to thank the oppoſition of her friends. She continued to inſiſt upon her ſwallowing the poiſon: ſhe bade her recommend herſelf to the Almighty's mercy, not to her's and aſſured her that in an hour ſhe would be numbered with the dead. Perceiving that it was vain to implore this unfeeling woman, ſhe attempted to ſpring from her bed, and call for aſſiſtance: ſhe hoped, if ſhe could not eſcape the fate announced to her, at leaſt to have witneſſes of the violence committed. The prioreſs gueſſed her deſign: ſhe ſeized her forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by the arm, and puſhed her back upon her pillow;
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:035729_0409_10065B465410D358"/>
at the ſame time drawing a dagger, and placing it at the breaſt of the unfortunate Agnes, ſhe proteſted that if ſhe uttered a ſingle cry, or heſitated a ſingle moment to drink the poiſon, ſhe would pierce her heart that inſtant. Already half dead with fear, ſhe could make no further reſiſtance. The nun approached with the fatal goblet; the domina obliged her to take it, and ſwallow the contents. She drank, and the horrid deed was accompliſhed. The nuns then ſeated themſelves round the bed; they anſwered her groans with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; they interrupted with ſarcaſms the prayers in which ſhe recommended her parting ſoul to mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they threatened her with Heaven's vengeance and eternal perdition; they bade her deſpair of pardon, and ſtrowed with yet ſharper thorns, death's painful pillow. Such were the ſufferings of this young un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate till releaſed by fate from the malice of her tormentors. She expired in horror of the paſt, in fears for the future; and her agonies were ſuch as muſt have amply gratified the hate and vengeance of her enemies. As ſoon as her victim ceaſed to breathe, the domina retired, and was followed by her accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices.</p>
                     <p>"It was now that I ventured from my conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I dared not to aſſiſt my unhappy friend, aware that, without preſerving her, I ſhould only have brought on myſelf the ſame deſtruction. Shocked and terrified beyond expreſſion at this horrid ſcene, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had I ſufficient ſtrength to regain my cell. As I reached the door of that of Agnes, I ventured to look towards the bed on which lay her lifeleſs body, once ſo lovely and ſo ſweet! I breathed a prayer for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſpirit, and vowed to revenge her death by the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:035729_0410_10065B0E533E6058"/>
ſhame and puniſhment of her aſſaſſins. With danger and difficulty I have kept my oath. I unwarily drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſome words at the funeral of Agnes, while thrown off my guard by exceſſive grief, which alarmed the guilty conſcience of the prioreſs. My every action was obſerved; my every ſtep was traced. I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſurrounded by the ſuperior's ſpies. It was long before I could find the means of conveying to the unhappy girl's relations an intimation of my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. It was given out, that Agnes had expired ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly: this account was credited not only by her friends in Madrid, but even by thoſe within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. The poiſon had left no marks upon her body: no one ſuſpected the true cauſe of her death, and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unknown to all, ſave the aſſaſſins and myſelf.</p>
                     <p>"I have no more to ſay; for what I have already ſaid, I will anſwer with my life. I repeat that the prioreſs is a murdereſs; that ſhe has driven from the world, perhaps from Heaven, an unfortunate, whoſe offence was light and venial; that ſhe has abuſed the power entruſted to her hands, and has been a tyrant, a barbarian, and an hypocrite. I alſo accuſe the four nuns. Violante, Camilla, Alix, and Mariana, as being her accomplices, and equally criminal."</p>
                     <p>Here St. Urſula ended her narrative. It created horror and ſurpriſe throughout; but when ſhe relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inhuman murder of Agnes, the indignation of the mob was ſo audibly teſtified, that it was ſcarcely poſſible to hear the concluſion. This confuſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with every moment. At length a multitude of voices exclaimed, that the prioreſs ſhould be given up to their fury. To this Don Ramirez poſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:035729_0411_10065B47DD83C940"/>
to conſent. Even Lorenzo bade the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that ſhe had undergone no trial, and adviſed them to leave her puniſhment to the Inquiſition. All repreſentations were fruitleſs; the diſturbance grew ſtill more violent, and the populace more exaſperated. In vain did Ramirez attempt to convey his priſoner out of the throng. Wherever he turned, a band of rioters barred his paſſage, and demanded her being delivered over to them more loudly than before. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirez ordered his attendants to cut their way through the multitude. Oppreſſed by numbers, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to draw their ſwords. He threatened the mob with the vengeance of the Inquiſition: but, in this moment of popular phrenſy, even this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful name had loſt its effect. Though regret for his ſiſter made him look upon the prioreſs with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Lorenzo could not help pitying a woman in a ſituation ſo terrible: but in ſpite of all his exertions and thoſe of the duke, of Don Ramirez, and the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the people continued to preſs onwards. They forced a paſſage through the guards who protected their deſtined victim, dragged her from her ſhelter, and proceeded to take upon her a moſt ſummary and cruel vengeance. Wild with terror, and ſcarcely knowing what ſhe ſaid, the wretched woman ſhrieked for a moment's mercy: ſhe proteſted that ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the death of Agnes, and could clear herſelf from the ſuſpicion beyond the power of doubt. The rioters heeded nothing but the gratification of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous vengeance. They refuſed to liſten to her: they ſhewed her every ſort of inſult, loaded her with mud and filth, and called her by the moſt opprobrious appellations. They tore her one from another, and
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:035729_0412_10065B1194519960"/>
each new tormentor was more ſavage than the former. They ſtifled with howls and execrations her ſhrill cries for mercy, and dragged her through the ſtreets, ſpurning her, trampling her, and treating her with every ſpecies of cruelty which hate or vindictive fury could invent. At length a flint, aimed by ſome well directing hand, ſtruck her full upon the temple. She ſunk upon the ground, bathed in blood, and in a few minutes terminated her miſerable exiſtence. Yet though ſhe no longer felt their inſults, the rioters ſtill exerciſed their impotent rage upon her lifeleſs body. They beat it, trod upon it, and ill uſed it, till it became no more than a maſs of fleſh, unſightly, ſhapeleſs, and diſguſting.</p>
                     <p>Unable to prevent this ſhocking event. Lorenzo and his friends had beheld it with the utmoſt horror: but they were rouſed from their compelled inactivity, on hearing that the mob were attacking the convent of St. Clare. The incenſed populace confounding the innocent with the guilty, had reſolved to ſacrifice all the nuns of that order to their rage, and not to leave one ſtone of the building upon another. Alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this intelligence, they haſtened to the convent, reſolved to defend it if poſſible, or at leaſt to reſcue the inhabitants from the fury of the rioters. Moſt of the nuns had fled, but a few ſtill remained in their habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Their ſituation was truly dangerous. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as they had taken the precaution of faſtening the inner gates, with this aſſiſtance Lorenzo hoped to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the mob, till Don Ramirez ſhould return to him with a more ſufficient force.</p>
                     <p>Having been conducted by the former diſturbance to the diſtance of ſome ſtreets from the convent, he did
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:035729_0413_10065B4AFB640A60"/>
not immediately reach it. When he arrived, the throng ſurrounding it was ſo exceſſive, as to prevent his approaching the gates. In the interim, the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace beſieged the building with perſevering rage: they battered the walls, threw lighted torches in at the windows, and ſwore that by break of day not a nun of St. Clare's order ſhould be left alive. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo had juſt ſucceeded in piercing his way through the crowd, when one of the gates was forced open. The rioters poured into the interior part of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where they exerciſed their vengeance upon every thing which found itſelf in their paſſage. They broke the furniture into pieces, tore down the pictures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the reliques, and in their hatred of her ſervant forgot all reſpect to the ſaint. Some employed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſearching out the nuns, others in pulling down parts of the convent, and others again in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fire to the pictures and other valuable furniture which it contained. Theſe latter produced the moſt deciſive deſolation. Indeed the conſequences of their action were more ſudden than themſelves had expected or wiſhed. The flames riſing from the burning piles caught part of the building, which, being old and dry, the conflagration ſpread with rapidity from room to room. The walls were ſoon ſhaken by the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing element. The columns gave way, the roofs came tumbling down upon the rioters, and cruſhed many of them beneath their weight. Nothing was to be heard but ſhrieks and groans. The convent was wrapped in flames, and the whole preſented a ſcene of devaſtation and horror.</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo was ſhocked at having been the cauſe, however innocent of this frightful diſturbance: he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:035729_0414_10065B131A78D718"/>
to repair his fault by protecting the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs inhabitants of the convent. He entered it with the mob, and exerted himſelf to repreſs the prevailing fury, till the ſudden and alarming progreſs of the flames compelled him to provide for his own ſafety. The people now hurried out as eagerly as they had before thronged in; but their numbers clogging up the door way, and the fire gaining upon them rapidly, many of them periſhed ere they had time to effect their eſcape. Lorenzo's good fortune directed him to a ſmall door in a farther aiſle of the chapel. The bolt was already undrawn: he opened the door, and found himſelf at the foot of St. Clare's ſepulchre.</p>
                     <p>Here he ſtopped to breathe. The duke and ſome of his attendants had followed him, and thus were in ſecurity for the preſent. They now conſulted what ſteps they ſhould take to eſcape from this ſcene of diſturbance; but their deliberations were conſiderably interrupted by the ſight of volumes of fire riſing from amidſt the convent's maſſy walls, by the noiſe of ſome heavy arch tumbling down in ruins, or by the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled ſhrieks of the nuns and rioters, either ſuffocating in the preſs, periſhing in the flames, or cruſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the weight of the falling manſion.</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo inquired, whither the wicket led? He was anſwered, To the garden of the Capuchins: and it was reſolved to explore an outlet upon that ſide. Accordingly the duke raiſed the latch, and paſſed into the adjoining cemetery. The attendants followed without ceremony. Lorenzo, being the laſt, was alſo on the point of quitting the colonnade, when he ſaw the door of the ſepulchre opened ſoftly. Some one
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:035729_0415_10065B4C8F31FBF0"/>
looked out, but on perceiving ſtrangers uttered a loud ſhriek, ſtarted back again, and flew down the marble ſtairs.</p>
                     <p>"What can this mean?" cried Lorenzo: "Here is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> myſtery concealed. Follow me without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay!"</p>
                     <p>Thus ſaying, he haſtened into the ſepulchre, and purſued the perſon who continued to fly before him. The duke knew not the cauſe of this exclamation, but, ſuppoſing that he had good reaſons for it, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him without heſitation. The others did the ſame, and the whole party ſoon arrived at the foot of the ſtairs. The upper door having been left open, the neighbouring flames darted from above a ſufficient light to enable Lorenzo's catching a glance of the fugitive running through the long paſſages and diſtant vaults; but when a ſudden turn deprived him of this aſſiſtance, total darkneſs ſucceeded, and he could only trace the object of his inquiry by the faint echo of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring feet. The purſuers were now compelled to proceed with caution: as well as they could judge, the fugitive alſo ſeemed to ſlacken pace, for they heard the ſteps follow each other at longer intervals. They at length were bewildered by the labyrinth of paſſages, and diſperſed in various directions. Carried away by his eagerneſs to clear up this myſtery, and to penetrate into which he was impelled by a movement ſecret and unaccountable, Lorenzo heeded not this circumſtance till he found himſelf in total ſolitude. The noiſe of footſteps had ceaſed, all was ſilent around, and no clue offered itſelf to guide him to the flying perſon. He ſtopped to reflect on the means moſt likely to aid his purſuit. He was perſuaded that no common
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:035729_0416_10065B14D5695E78"/>
cauſe would have induced the fugitive to ſeek that dreary place at an hour ſo unuſual: the cry which he had heard, ſeemed uttered in a voice of terror; and he was convinced that ſome myſtery was attached to this event. After ſome minutes paſſed in heſitation, he continued to proceed, feeling his way along the walls of the paſſage. He had already paſſed ſome time in this ſlow progreſs, when he deſcried a ſpark of light glimmering at a diſtance. Guided by this obſervation, and having drawn his ſword, he bent his ſteps towards the place whence the beam ſeemed to be emitted.</p>
                     <p>It proceeded from the lamp which flamed before St. Clare's ſtatue. Before it ſtood ſeveral females, their white garments ſtreaming in the blaſt as it howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along the vaulted dungeons. Curious to know what had brought them together in this melancholy ſpot, Lorenzo drew near with precaution. The ſtrangers ſeemed earneſtly engaged in converſation. They heard not Lorenzo's ſteps, and he approached unobſerved, till he could hear their voices diſtinctly.</p>
                     <p>"I proteſt," continued ſhe who was ſpeaking when he arrived, and to whom the reſt were liſtening with great attention; "I proteſt that I ſaw them with my own eyes. I flew down the ſteps, they purſued me, and I eſcaped falling into their hands with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Had it not been for the lamp I ſhould never have found you."</p>
                     <p>"And what could bring them hither?" ſaid another in a trembling voice; "do you think that they were looking for us?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="unknown:035729_0417_10065B5160C67508"/>
"God grant that my fears may be falſe," rejoined the firſt; "but I doubt they are murderers! If they diſcover us, we are loſt! As for me, my fate is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. My affinity to the prioreſs will be a ſufficient crime to condemn me; and though till now theſe vaults have afforded me a retreat...."</p>
                     <p>Here looking up, her eye fell upon Lorenzo, who had continued to approach ſlowly.</p>
                     <p>"The murderers!" ſhe cried.</p>
                     <p>She ſtarted away from the ſtatue's pedeſtal on which ſhe had been ſeated, and attempted to eſcape by flight. Her companions at the ſame moment uttered a terrified ſcream, while Lorenzo arreſted the fugitive by the arm. Frightened and deſperate, ſhe ſunk upon her knees before him.</p>
                     <p>"Spare me!" ſhe exclaimed; "for Chriſt's ſake, ſpare me! I am innocent, indeed I am!"</p>
                     <p>While ſhe ſpoke, her voice was almoſt choaked with fear. The beams of the lamp darting full upon her face, which was unveiled, Lorenzo recogniſed the beautiful Virginia de Villa Franca. He haſtened to raiſe her from the ground, and beſought her to take courage. He promiſed to protect her from the riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, aſſured her that her retreat was ſtill a ſecret, and that ſhe might depend upon his readineſs to defend her to the laſt drop of his blood. During this converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the nuns had thrown themſelves into various at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes: one knelt, and addreſſed herſelf to Heaven; another hid her face in the lap of her neighbour; ſome liſtened motionleſs with fear to the diſcourſe of the ſuppoſed aſſaſſin; while others embraced the
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:035729_0418_10065B17A798FA68"/>
ſtatue of St. Clare, and implored her protection with frantic cries. On perceiving their miſtake, they crowded round Lorenzo, and heaped benedictions on him by dozens. He found that on hearing the threats of the mob, and terrified by the cruelties which from the convent towers they had ſeen inflicted on the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, many of the penſioners and nuns had taken re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in the ſepulchre. Among the former was to be reckoned the lovely Virginia; nearly related to the prioreſs, ſhe had more reaſon than the reſt to dread the rioters, and now beſought Lorenzo earneſtly not to abandon her to their rage. Her companions, moſt of whom were women of noble family, made the ſame requeſt, which he readily granted: he promiſed not to quit them till he had ſeen each of them ſafe in the arms of her relations. But he adviſed their deferring to quit the ſepulchre for ſome time longer, when the popular fury ſhould be ſomewhat calmed, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of military force have diſperſed the multitude.</p>
                     <p>"Would to God," cried Virginia, "that I were already ſafe in my mother's embraces! How ſay you, Segnor? will it be long ere we may leave this place? Every moment that I paſs here, I paſs in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!"</p>
                     <p>"I hope, not long," ſaid he; "but till you can proceed with ſecurity, this ſepulchre will prove an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable aſylum. Here you run no riſk of a diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, and I would adviſe your remaining quiet for the next two or three hours."</p>
                     <p>"Two or three hours?" exclaimed ſiſter Helena: "If I ſtay another hour in theſe vaults, I ſhall expire with fear! Not the wealth of worlds ſhould bribe me
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:035729_0419_10065B52EA59B490"/>
to undergo again what I have ſuffered ſince my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hither. Bleſſed Virgin! To be in this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly place in the middle of night, ſurrounded by the mouldering bodies of my deceaſed companions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting every moment to be torn in pieces by their ghoſts who wander about me, and complain, and groan, and wail accents that make my blood run cold..... Chriſt Jeſus! It is enough to drive me to madneſs!"</p>
                     <p>"Excuſe me," replied Lorenzo, "if I am ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that while menaced by real woes you are capable of yielding to imaginary dangers. Theſe dangers are puerile and groundleſs: combat them, holy ſiſter; I have promiſed to guard you from the rioters; but againſt the attacks of ſuperſtition you muſt depend for protection upon yourſelf. The idea of ghoſts is ridic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulous in the extreme; and if you continue to be ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ideal terrors...."</p>
                     <p>"Ideal?" exclaimed the nuns with one voice: "Why, we heard it ourſelves, Segnor! Every one of us heard it! It was frequently repeated, and it ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every time more melancholy and deep. You will never perſuade me that we could all have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. No, no; had the noiſe been merely created by fancy ...."</p>
                     <p>"Hark! hark!" interrupted Virginia, in a voice of terror; "God preſerve us! There it is again!"</p>
                     <p>The nuns claſped their hands together, and ſunk upon their knees. Lorenzo looked round him eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and was on the point of yielding to the fears which already had poſſeſſed the women. Univerſal ſilence prevailed. He examined the vault, but nothing was
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:035729_0420_10065B1AC51FB8C8"/>
to be ſeen. He now prepared to addreſs the nuns, and ridicule their childiſh apprehenſions, when his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was arreſted by a deep and long drawn groan.</p>
                     <p>"What was that?" he cried and ſtarted.—</p>
                     <p>"There, Segnor!" ſaid Hel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>na: "Now you muſt be convinced! You have heard the noiſe yourſelf! Now judge whether our terrors are imaginary. Since we have been here, that groaning has been repeated almoſt every five minutes. Doubtleſs it proceeds from ſome ſoul in pain who wiſhes to be prayed out of purgatory: but none of us dare to aſk it the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As for me, were I to ſee an apparition, the fright, I am very certain, would kill me out of hand."</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſaid this, a ſecond groan was heard yet more diſtinctly. The nuns croſſed themſelves, and haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repeat their prayers againſt evil ſpirits. Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo liſtened attentively. He even thought that he could diſtinguiſh ſounds as of one ſpeaking in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, but diſtance rendered them inarticulate. The noiſe ſeemed to come from the midſt of the ſmall vault in which he and the nuns then were, and which a multitude of paſſages branching out in various direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions formed into a ſort of ſtar. Lorenzo's curioſity, which was ever awake, made him anxious to ſolve this myſtery. He deſired that ſilence might be kept. The nuns obeyed him. All was huſhed till the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtillneſs was again diſturbed by the groaning, which was repeated ſeveral times ſucceſſively. He perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be moſt audible, when upon following the ſound he was conducted cloſe to the ſhrine of St. Clare.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="unknown:035729_0421_10065B5470A94298"/>
"The noiſe comes from hence," ſaid he, "Whoſe is this ſtatue?"</p>
                     <p>Helena, to whom he addreſſed the queſtion, pauſed for a moment. Suddenly ſhe clapped her hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>"Aye!" cried ſhe, "it muſt be ſo. I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the meaning of theſe groans."</p>
                     <p>The nuns crowded round her, and beſought her ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly to explain herſelf. She gravely replied, that for time immemorial the ſtatue had been famous for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming miracles. From this ſhe inferred, that the ſaint was concerned at the conflagration of a convent which ſhe protected, and expreſſed her grief by audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lamentations. Not having equal faith in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous ſaint, Lorenzo did not think this ſolution of the myſtery quite ſo ſatisfactory, as the nuns, who ſubſcribed to it without heſitation. In one point 'tis true that he agreed with Helena. He ſuſpected that the groans proceeded from the ſtatue: the more he liſtened the more was he confirmed in this idea. He drew nearer to the image, deſigning to inſpect it more cloſely: but perceiving his intention, the nuns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him for God's ſake to deſiſt, ſince, if he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtatue, his death was inevitable.</p>
                     <p>"And in what conſiſts the danger?" ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>"Mother of God! In what?" replied Helena, ever eager to relate a miraculous adventure: "If you had only heard the hundredth part of thoſe marvellous ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries about this ſtatue, which the domina uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count! She aſſured us often and often, that if we only dared to lay a finger upon it, we might expect the
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:035729_0422_10065B1C4D515510"/>
moſt fatal conſequences. Among other things ſhe told us, that a rob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er having entered theſe vaults by night, he obſerved yonder ruby, whoſe value is ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable. Do you ſee it Segnor? It ſparkles upon the third finger of the hand in which ſhe holds a crown of thorns. This jewel naturally excited the villain's cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity. He reſolved to make himſelf maſter of it. For this purpoſe he aſcended the pedeſtal; he ſupported himſelf by graſping the ſaint's right arm, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his own towards the ring. What was his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, when he ſaw the ſtatue's hand raiſed in a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of menace, and heard her lips pronounce his eternal perdition! Penetrated with awe and conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he deſiſted from his attempt, and prepared to quit the ſepulchre. In this he alſo failed. Flight was denied him. He found it impoſſible to diſengage the hand which reſted upon the right arm of the ſtatue. In vain did he ſtruggle: he remained fixed to the image, till the inſupportable and fiery anguiſh which darted itſelf through his veins, compelled his ſhriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for aſſiſtance. The ſepulchre was now filled with ſpectators. The villain confeſſed his ſacrilege, and was only releaſed by the ſeparation of his hand from his body. It has remained ever ſince faſtened to the image. The robber turned hermit, and led ever after an exemplary life. But yet the ſaint's decree was performed; and tradition ſays, that he continues to haunt the ſepulchre, and implore St. Clare's pardon with groans and lamentations. Now I think of it, thoſe which we have juſt heard, may very poſſibly have been uttered by the ghoſt of this ſinner; but of this I will not be poſitive. All that I can ſay is, that ſince that time no one has ever dared to touch the
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:035729_0423_10065B58150FBD28"/>
ſtatue. Then do not be fool hardy, good Segnor! For the love of Heaven, give up your deſign, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe yourſelf unneceſſarily to certain deſtruction."</p>
                     <p>Not being convinced that his deſtruction would be ſo certain as Helena ſeemed to think it, Lorenzo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in his reſolution. The nuns beſought him to deſiſt, in piteous terms, and even pointed out the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber's hand, which was in effect ſtill viſible upon the arm of the ſtatue. This proof, as they imagined, muſt convince him. It was very far from doing ſo; and they were greatly ſcandalized when he declared his ſuſpicion that the dried and ſhrivelled fingers had been placed there by order of the prioreſs. In ſpite of their prayers and threats he approached the ſtatue. He ſprang over the iron rails which defended it, and the ſaint underwent a thorough examination. The image at firſt appeared to be of ſtone, but proved on further inſpection to be formed of no more ſolid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials than coloured wood. He ſhook it, and attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to move it: but it appeared to be of a piece with the baſe which it ſtood upon. He examined it over and over: ſtill no clue guided him to the ſolution of this myſtery, for which the nuns were become equally ſolic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous, when they ſaw that he touched the ſtatue with impunity. He pauſed, and liſtened: the groans were repeated at intervals, and he was convinced of being in the ſpot neareſt to them. He muſed upon this ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar event, and ran over the ſtatue with inquiring eyes. Suddenly they reſted upon the ſhrivelled hand. It ſtruck him that ſo particular an injunction was not given without cauſe, not to touch the arm of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. He again aſcended the pedeſtal: he examined the object of his attention, and diſcovered a ſmall knob
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:035729_0424_10065B1DF8E60270"/>
of iron concealed between the ſaint's ſhoulder and what was ſuppoſed to have been the hand of the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. This obſervation delighted him. He applied his fingers to the knob, and preſſed it down forcibly. Immediately a rumbling noiſe was heard within the ſtatue, as if a chain tightly ſtretched was flying back. Startled at the ſound, the timid nuns ſtarted away, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to haſten from the vault at the firſt appearance of danger. All remaining quiet and ſtill, they again gathered round Lorenzo, and beheld his proceedings with anxious curioſity.</p>
                     <p>Finding that nothing followed this diſcovery, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended. As he took his hand from the ſaint, ſhe trembled beneath his touch. This created new ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the ſpectators, who believed the ſtatue to be animated. Lorenzo's ideas upon the ſubject were widely different. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e eaſily comprehended, that the noiſe which he had heard was occaſioned by his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looſened a chain which attached the image to its pedeſtal. He once more attempted to move it, and ſucceeded without much exertion. He placed it upon the ground, and then perceived the pedeſtal to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and covered at the opening with an heavy iron grate.</p>
                     <p>This excited ſuch general curioſity, that the ſiſters forgot both their real and imaginary dangers. Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo proceeded to raiſe the grate, in which the nuns aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted him to the utmoſt of their ſtrength. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was accompliſhed with little difficulty. A deep abyſs now preſented itſelf before them, whoſe thick obſcurity the eye ſtrove in vain to pierce. The rays of the lamp were too feeble to be of much aſſiſtance. Nothing was diſcernible, ſave a flight of rough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:035729_0425_10065B5B0EAF79C8"/>
ſteps, which ſunk into the yawning gulph, and were ſoon loſt in darkneſs. The groans were heard no more: but all believed them to have aſcended from this cavern. As he bent over it, Lorenzo fancied that he diſtinguiſhed ſomething bright twinkling through the gloom. He gazed attentively upon the ſpot where it ſhowed itſelf, and was convinced that he ſaw a ſmall ſpark of light, now viſible, now diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing. He communicated this circumſtance to the nuns: they alſo perceived the ſpark: but when he declared his intention to deſcend into the cave, they united to oppoſe his reſolution. All their remonſtrances could not prevail on him to alter it. None of them had courage enough to accompany him; neither could he think of depriving them of the lamp. Alone, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and in darkneſs, he prepared to purſue his deſign, while the nuns were contented to offer up prayers for his ſucceſs and ſafety.</p>
                     <p>The ſteps were ſo narrow and uneven, that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend them was like walking down the ſide of a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice. The obſcurity by which he was ſurrounded, rendered his footing inſecure. He was obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with great caution, leſt he ſhould miſs the ſteps and fall into the gulph below him. This he was ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral times on the point of doing. However, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſooner upon ſolid ground than he had expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He now found that the thick darkneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable miſts which reigned through the cavern, had deceived him into the belief of its being much more profound than it proved upon inſpection. He reached the foot of the ſtairs unhurt: he now ſtopped, and looked round for the ſpark, which had before caught his attention. He ſought it in vain: all was
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:035729_0426_10065B220B274D08"/>
dark and gloomy. He liſtened for the groans; but his ear caught no ſound except the diſtant murmur of the nuns above, as in low voices they repeated their ave marias. He ſtood irreſolute to which ſide be ſhould addreſs his ſteps. At all events, he determined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: he did ſo, but ſlowly, fearful leſt, inſtead of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, he ſhould be retiring from the object of his ſearch.

                        </gap>. A plaintive tone, ſounding at no great diſtance, at length reached his hearing: he bent his courſe joyfully towards it. It became more audible as he advanced; and he ſoon beheld again the ſpark of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which a low project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wall had hitherto concealed from him.</p>
                     <p>It proceeded from a ſmall lamp which was placed upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n heap of ſtones, and whoſe faint and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly rays ſerved rather to point out than diſpel the horrors of a narrow gloomy dungeon, formed in one ſide of the cavern: it alſo ſhowed ſeveral other receſſes of ſimilar conſtruction, but whoſe depth was buried in obſcurity. Coldly played the light upon the damp walls, whoſe dew-ſtained ſurface gave back a feeble reflection. A thick and peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fog clouded the height of the vaulted dungeon. As Lorenzo advanced, he felt a piercing chillneſs ſpread itſelf through his veins. The frequent groans ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him to move forwards. He turned towards them, and by the lamp's glimmering beams beheld in a corner of this loathſome abode, a creature ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a bed of ſtraw, ſo wretched, ſo emaciated, ſo pale, that he doubted to think her woman. She was half naked: her long diſhevelled hair fell in diſorder
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:035729_0427_10065B5C96B4C650"/>
over her face, and almoſt entirely concealed it. One waſted arm hung liſtleſsly upon a tattered rug, which covered her convulſed and ſhivering limbs: the other was wrapped round a ſmall bundle, and held it cloſely to her boſom. A large roſary lay near her: oppoſite to her was a crucifix, on which ſhe bent her ſunk eyes fixedly, and by her ſide ſtood a baſket and a ſmall earthen pitcher.</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo ſtopped: he was petrified with horror. He gazed upon the miſerable object with diſguſt and pity. He trembled at the ſpectacle: he grew ſick at heart: his ſtrength failed him, and his limbs were unable to ſupport his weight. He was obliged to lean againſt the low wall which was near him, unable to go forward or to addreſs the ſufferer. She caſt her eyes towards the ſtaircaſe: the wall concealed Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo, and ſhe obſerved him not.</p>
                     <p>"No one comes!" ſhe at length murmured.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſpoke, her voice was hollow, and rattled in her throat: ſhe ſighed bitterly.</p>
                     <p>"No one comes!" ſhe repeated: "no! they have forgotten me! they will come no more!"</p>
                     <p>She pauſed for a moment; then continued mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:</p>
                     <p>"Two days! two long, long days, and yet no food! and yet no hope, no comfort! Fooliſh woman! how can I wiſh to lengthen a life ſo wretched!—Yet ſuch a death! O God! to periſh by ſuch a death! to lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger out ſuch ages in torture! Till now, I knew not what it was to hunger!—Hark!—No! no one comes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will come no more."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="unknown:035729_0428_10065B239224AF10"/>
She was ſilent. She ſhivered, and drew the rug over her naked ſhoulders:</p>
                     <p>"I am very cold: I am ſtill unuſed to the damps of this dungeon: 'tis ſtrange: but no matter. Colder ſhall I ſoon be, and yet not feel it. I ſhall be cold, cold as thou art."</p>
                     <p>She looked at the bundle, which lay upon her breaſt. She bent over it, and kiſſed it; then drew back haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, and ſhuddered with diſguſt:</p>
                     <p>"It was once ſo ſweet! It would have been ſo lovely, ſo like him! I have loſt it for ever. How a few days have changed it! I ſhould not know it again myſelf! Yet it is dear to me. God! how dear!—I will forget what it is! I will only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what it was, and love it as well as when it was ſo ſweet! ſo lovely! ſo like him!—I thought that I had wept away all my tears, but here is our ſtill lingering."</p>
                     <p>She wiped her eyes with a treſs of her hair. She put out her hand for the pitcher, and reached it with difficulty. She caſt into it a look of hopeleſs inquiry. She ſighed, and replaced it upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>"Quite a void!—Not a drop!—Not one drop left to cool my ſcorched up burning palate!—Now would I give treaſures for a draught of water!—And they are God's ſervants who make me ſuffer thus!—They think themſelves holy, while they torture me like fiends!—They are cruel and unfeeling; and 'tis they who bid me repent; and 'tis they who threaten me with eternal perdition! Saviour, Saviour! you think not ſo!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="unknown:035729_0429_10065B5E1DF68840"/>
She again fixed her eyes upon the crucifix, took her roſary, and, while ſhe told her beads, the quick mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her lips declared her to be praying with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency.</p>
                     <p>While he liſtened to her melancholy accents, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo's ſenſibility became yet more violently affected. The firſt ſight of ſuch miſery had given a ſenſible ſhock to his feelings: but that being paſt, he now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the captive. She heard his ſteps, and, uttering a cry of joy, dropped the roſary.</p>
                     <p>"Hark! hark! hark!" ſhe cried, "ſome one comes!"</p>
                     <p>She ſtrove to raiſe herſelf, but her ſtrength was une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the attempt; ſhe fell back, and, as ſhe ſunk again upon the bed of ſtraw, Lorenzo heard the rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of heavy chains. He ſtill approached, while the priſoner thus continued:</p>
                     <p>"Is it you, Camilla? You are come then at laſt? Oh! it was time! I thought that you had forſaken me; that I was doomed to periſh of hunger. Give me to drink, Camilla, for pity's ſake; I am faint with long faſting, and grown ſo weak that I cannot raiſe myſelf from the ground. Good Camilla, give me to drink, leſt I expire before you."</p>
                     <p>Fearing that ſurpriſe in her enfeebled ſtate might be fatal, Lorenzo was at a loſs how to addreſs her.</p>
                     <p>"It is not Camilla," ſaid he at length, ſpeaking in a low and gentle voice.</p>
                     <p>"Who is it then?" replied the ſufferer; "Alix, perhaps, or Violante. My eyes are grown ſo dim and
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:035729_0430_10065B259CF27A08"/>
feeble, that I cannot diſtinguiſh your features; but whichever it is, if your breaſt is ſenſible of the leaſt compaſſion, if you are not more cruel than wolves and tigers, take pity on my ſufferings. You know that I am dying for want of ſuſtenance. This is the third day ſince theſe lips have received nouriſhment. Do you bring me food? Or come you only to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my death, and learn how long I have yet to exiſt in agony?"</p>
                     <p>"You miſtake my buſineſs," replied Lorenzo; "I am no emiſſary of the cruel prioreſs. I pity your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and come hither to relieve them."</p>
                     <p>"To relieve them?" repeated the captive; "ſaid you to relieve them?"</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time ſtarting from the ground, and ſupporting herſelf upon her hands, ſhe gazed upon the ſtranger earneſtly.</p>
                     <p>"Great God!—Is it no illuſion?—A man? Speak! Who are you? What brings you hither? Come you to ſave me, to reſtore me to liberty, to life and light? Oh! ſpeak, ſpeak quickly, leſt I encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age an hope whoſe diſappointment will deſtroy me."</p>
                     <p>"Be calm!" replied Lorenzo, in a voice ſoothing and compaſſionate; "the domina of whoſe cruelty you complain, has already paid the forfeit of her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: you have nothing more to fear from her. A few minutes will reſtore you to liberty and the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your friends, from whom you have been ſeclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. You may rely upon my protection. Give me your hand, and be not fearful. Let me conduct you
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:035729_0431_10065B2740EBCB48"/>
where you may receive thoſe attentions which your feeble ſtate requires."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! yes! yes! yes!" cried the priſoner with an exulting ſhriek; "there is a God then, and a juſt one! Joy! Joy! I ſhall once more breathe the freſh air, and view the light of the glorious ſunbeams! I will go with you! Stranger, I will go with you! Oh! Heaven will bleſs you for pitying an unfortunate! But this too muſt go with me," ſhe added, pointing to the ſmall bundle, which ſhe ſtill claſped to her boſom; "I cannot part with this. I will bear it away: it ſhall convince the world how dreadful are the abodes ſo falſely termed religious. Good ſtranger! lend me your hand to riſe: I am faint with want, and ſorrow, and ſickneſs, and my ſtrength has quite forſaken me! So, that is well!"</p>
                     <p>As Lorenzo ſtooped to raiſe her, the beams of the lamp ſtruck full upon his face.</p>
                     <p>"Almighty God!" ſhe exclaimed: "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?—That look! thoſe features!—Oh! yes, it is, it is....."</p>
                     <p>She extended her arms to throw them round him, but her enfeebled frame was unable to ſuſtain the emotions which agitated her boſom. She fainted, and again ſunk upon the bed of ſtraw.</p>
                     <p>Lorenzo was ſurpriſed at her laſt exclamation. He thought that he had before heard ſuch accents as her hollow voice had juſt formed, but where, he could not remember. He ſaw that in her dangerous ſituation immediate phyſical aid was abſolutely neceſſary, and he haſtened to convey her from the dungeon. He
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:035729_0432_100834F2DFACCB90"/>
was at firſt prevented from doing ſo by a ſtrong chain faſtened round the priſoner's body, and fixing her to the neighbouring wall. However, his natural ſtrength being aided by anxiety to relieve the unfortunate, he ſoon forced out the ſtaple, to which one end of the chain was attached: then taking the captive in his arms, he bent his courſe towards the ſtaircaſe. The rays of the lamp above, as well as the murmur of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male voices, guided his ſteps. He gained the ſtairs, and in a few minutes after arrived at the iron grate.</p>
                     <p>The nuns during his abſence had been terribly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by curioſity and apprehenſion. They were equally ſurpriſed and delighted on ſeeing him ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emerge from the cave. Every heart was filled with compaſſion for the miſerable creature, whom he bore in his arms. While the nuns, and Virginia in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, employed themſelves in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to recal her to her ſenſes, Lorenzo related in a few words the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his finding her. He then obſerved to them, that by this time the tumult muſt have been quelled, and that he could now conduct them to their friends without danger. All were eager to quit the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre. Still, to prevent all poſſibility of ill uſage, they beſought Lorenzo to venture out firſt alone, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether the coaſt was clear. With this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt he complied. Helena offered to conduct them to the ſtaircaſe, and they were on the point of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when a ſtrong light flaſhed from ſeveral paſſages upon the adjacent walls. At the ſame time ſteps were heard of people approaching haſtily, and whoſe number ſeemed to be conſiderable. The nuns were greatly alarmed at this circumſtance; they ſuppoſed their retreat to be diſcovered, and the rioters to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:035729_0433_10065B60008D4BE0"/>
in purſuit of them. Haſtily quitting the priſoner, who remained inſenſible, they crowded round Lorenzo, and claimed his promiſe to protect them. Virginia alone forgot her own danger by ſtriving to relieve the ſorrows of another. She ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the ſufferer's head upon her knees, bathing her temples with roſe water, chaſing her cold hands, and ſprinkling her face with tears which were drawn from her by compaſſion. The ſtrangers approaching nearer, Lorenzo was enabled to diſpel the fears of the ſuppliants. His name pronounced by a number of voices, among which he diſtinguiſhed the duke's, pealed along the vaults, and convinced him that he was the object of their ſearch. He communicated this intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to the nuns, who received it with rapture. A few moments after confirmed this idea. Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirez as well as the duke appeared, followed by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants with torches. They had been ſeeking him through the vaults, in order to let him know that the mob was diſperſed, and the riot entirely over. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo recounted briefly his adventure in the cavern, and explained how much the unknown was in want of medical aſſiſtance. He beſought the duke to take charge of her, as well as of the nuns and penſioners.</p>
                     <p>"As for me," ſaid he, "other cares demand my attention. While you with one half of the archers convey theſe ladies to their reſpective homes, I wiſh the other half to be left with me. I will examine the cavern below, and pervade the moſt ſecret receſſes of the ſepulchre. I cannot reſt till convinced that yonder wretched victim was the only one confined by ſuperſtition in theſe vaults."</p>
                     <p>The duke applauded his intention. Don Ramirez
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:035729_0434_10065B28DD105690"/>
offered to aſſiſt him in his inquiry, and his propoſal was accepted with gratitude. The nuns, having made their acknowledgments to Lorenzo, committed themſelves to the care of his uncle, and were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſepulchre. Virginia requeſted that the unknown might be given to her in charge, and prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed to let Lorenzo know, whenever ſhe was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently recovered to accept his viſits. In truth ſhe made this promiſe more from conſideration for herſelf, than for either Lorenzo or the captive. She had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed his politeneſs, gentleneſs, and intrepidity with ſenſible emotion. She wiſhed earneſtly to preſerve his acquaintance; and in addition to the ſentiments of pity which the priſoner excited, ſhe hoped that her attention to this unfortunate would raiſe her a degree in the eſteem of Lorenzo. She had no occaſion to trouble herſelf upon this head. The kindneſs already diſplayed by her, and the tender concern which ſhe had ſhewn for the ſufferer, had gained her an exalted place in his good graces. While occupied in alleviating the captive's ſorrows, the nature of her employment adorned her with new charms, and rendered her beauty a thouſand times more intereſting. Lorenzo viewed her with admiration and delight: he conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered her as a miniſtering angel deſcended to the aid of afflicted innocence; nor could his heart have reſiſted her attractions, had it not been ſteeled by the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Antonia.</p>
                     <p>The duke now conveyed the nuns in ſafety to the dwellings of their reſpective friends. The reſcued priſoner was ſtill inſenſible, and gave no ſigns of life, except by occaſional groans. She was borne upon a ſort of litter. Virginia, who was conſtantly by the
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:035729_0435_10065B62EEEDAC00"/>
ſide of it, was apprehenſive that, exhauſted by long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, and ſhaken by the ſudden change from bonds and darkneſs to liberty and light, her frame would never get the better of the ſhock. Lorenzo and Don Ramirez ſtill remained in the ſepulchre. After delib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erating upon their proceedings, it was reſolved that, to prevent loſing time, the archers ſhould be divided into two bodies: that with one, Don Ramirez ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> cavern, while Lorenzo, with the other, might penetrate into the further vaults. This being arranged, and his followers being provided with torches, Don Ramirez advanced to the cavern. He had already deſcended ſome ſteps, when he heard peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple approaching haſtily from the interior part of the ſepulchre. This ſurpriſed him, and he quitted the cave precipitately.</p>
                     <p>"Do you hear footſteps?" ſaid Lorenzo. "Let us bend our courſe towards them. 'Tis from this ſide that they ſeem to proceed."</p>
                     <p>At that moment a loud and piercing ſhriek induced him to quicken his ſteps.</p>
                     <p>"Help! help, for God's ſake!" cried a voice, whoſe melodious tone penetrated Lorenzo's heart with terror.</p>

                     <p>ALL this while Ambroſio was unconſcious of the dreadful ſcenes which were paſſing ſo near. The execution of his deſigns upon Antonia employed his every thought. Hitherto he was ſatisfied with the ſucceſs of his plans. Antonia had drank the opiate, was buried in the vaults of St. Clare, and abſolutely in his diſpoſal. Matilda, who was well acquainted with the nature and effects of the ſoporific medicine, had computed that it would not ceaſe to operate till one in the morning. For that hour he waited with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. The feſtival of St. Clare preſented him with a favourable opportunity of conſummating his crime. He was certain that the friars and nuns would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the proceſſion, and that he had no cauſe to dread an interruption <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> deſired to be excuſed. He doubted not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that being beyond the reach of help, cut off from all the world, and totally in his power, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia would fall an eaſy victim to his villainy. The affection which he had ever expreſſed for him, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted this perſuaſion: but he reſolved, that, ſhould
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:035729_0437_10065B6658A70130"/>
ſhe prove obſtinate, no conſideration whatever ſhould be permitted to counteract his plans. Secure from a diſcovery, he ſhuddered not at the idea of employing force; or, if he felt any repugnance, it aroſe not from a principle of ſhame or compaſſion, but from his feeling for Antonia the moſt ſincere and ardent affection.</p>
                     <p>The monks quitted the abbey at midnight. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda was among the choriſters, and led the chant. Ambroſio was left by himſelf, and at liberty to purſue his own inclinations. Convinced that no one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained behind to watch his motions, or diſturb his pleaſures, he now haſtened to the weſtern aiſles. His heart beating with hope, not unmingled with anxiety, he croſſed the garden, unlocked the door which admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the cemetery, and in a few minutes he ſtood before the vaults. Here he pauſed: he looked round him with ſuſpicion, conſcious that his buſineſs was unfit for any other eye. As he ſtood in heſitation, he heard the melancholy ſhriek of the ſcreech owl: the wind rattled loudly againſt the windows of the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent convent, and, as the current ſwept by him, bore with it the faint notes of the chant of choriſters. He opened the door cautiouſly, as if fearing to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard; he entered, and cloſed it again after him. Guided by his lamp, he threaded the long paſſages, in whoſe windings Matilda had inſtructed him, and reached the private vault which contained his ſleeping miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Its entrance was by no means eaſy to diſcover; but this was no obſtacle to Ambroſio, who at the time of Antonia's funeral had obſerved it too carefully to be
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:035729_0438_10065B2EF15A3378"/>
deceived. He found the door, which was unfaſtened, puſhed it open, and deſcended into the dungeon. He approached the humble tomb in which Antonia repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He had provided himſelf with an iron crow and a pickaxe: but this precaution was unneceſſary. The grate was ſlightly faſtened on the outſide: he raiſed it, and, placing the lamp upon its ridge, bent ſilently over the tomb. By the ſide of three putrid half corrupted bodies lay the ſleeping beauty. A lively red, the forerunner of returning animation, had already ſpread itſelf over her cheeks; and as wrapped in her ſhroud ſhe reclined upon her funeral bier, ſhe ſeemed to ſmile at the images of death around her. While he gazed upon the rotting bones and diſguſting figures, who perhaps were once as ſweet and lovely, Ambroſio thought upon Elvira, by him reduced to the ſame ſtate. As the memory of that horrid act glanced upon his mind, it was clouded with a gloomy horror; yet it ſerved but to ſtrengthen his reſolution to deſtroy Antonia's honor.</p>
                     <p>"For your ſake, fatal beauty!" murmured the monk while gazing on his devoted prey, "for your ſake have I committed this murder, and ſold myſelf to eternal tortures. Now you are in my power: the produce of my guilt will at leaſt be mine. Hope not that your prayers breathed in tones of unequalled melody, your bright eyes filled with tears, and your hands lifted in ſupplication, as when ſeeking in peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence the Virgin's pardon: hope not that your mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocence, your beauteous grief, or all your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant arts, ſhall ranſom you from my embraces. Before the break of day, mine you muſt, and mine you ſhall be!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="unknown:035729_0439_100834F9D1FD4D08"/>
"Antonia! wretched Antonia! Too ſoon were the villain's words verified. Heaven, for purpoſes no doubt wiſe in themſelves, but whoſe aim the ſight of mortals is too weak to diſcern, interpoſed not in the unhappy girl's behalf. Animation was only reſtored to make her ſenſible that the monk was a villain, and herſelf undone!</p>
                     <p>Scarcely had he ſucceeded in his deſign, when he ſhuddered at himſelf, and the means by which it was effected. The very exceſs of his former paſſion for Antonia now contributed to inſpire him with diſguſt; and a ſecret impulſe made him feel how baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly was the crime which he had juſt committed. He ſtarted haſtily from her. She, who ſo lately had been the object of his adoration, now raiſed no other ſentiment in his heart than averſion and rage. He turned away from her; or, if his eyes reſted upon her figure involuntarily, it was only to dart upon her looks of hate. The unfortunate remained ſtretched upon the earth in ſilent deſpair; the tears chaſed each other ſlowly down her cheeks, and her boſom heaved with frequent ſobs. Oppreſſed with grief, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome time in this ſtate of torpidity. At length ſhe roſe with difficulty, and dragging her feeble ſteps towards the door, prepared to quit the dungeon.</p>
                     <p>The ſound of her footſteps rouſed the monk from his ſullen apathy. Starting from the tomb, againſt which he reclined, while his eyes wandered over the images of corruption contained in it, he purſued the victim of his brutality, and ſoon overtook her. He ſeized her by the arm, and violently forced her back into the dungeon.</p>
                     <p>

"Whither go you?" he cried in a ſtern voice; "return this inſtant!"</p>
                     <p>Antonia trembled at the fury of his countenance.</p>
                     <p>"What would you more?" ſhe ſaid with timidity: "Is not my ruin completed? Am I not undone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever? Is not your cruelty contented, or have I yet more to ſuffer? Let me depart, let me return to my home, and weep unreſtrained my ſhame and my affliction!"</p>
                     <p>"Return to your home?" repeated the monk, with bitter and contemptuous mockery; then ſuddenly his eyes flaming with paſſion, "What? that you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce me to the world? that you may proclaim me a hypocrite, a betrayer, a monſter of cruelty, luſt and ingratitude? No, no, no! I know well the whole weight of my offences; well, that your complaints would be too juſt, and my crimes too notorious!

                     <p>As he thundered out theſe words, he violently graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Antonia's arm, and ſpurned the earth with deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fury.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſing his brain to be turned, Antonia ſunk in terror upon her knees; ſhe lifted up her hands, and her voice almoſt died away ere ſhe could give it utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                     <p>"Spare me! ſpare me!" ſhe murmured with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>

                     <p>He quitted her, and paced the dungeon with a wild and diſordered air. His eyes rolled fearfully; Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia trembled whenever ſhe met their gaze. He ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meditate on ſomething horrible, and ſhe gave up all hopes of eſcaping from the ſepulchre with life. Yet in harbouring this idea ſhe did him injuſtice.
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:035729_0442_10065B309DE4F828"/>
Amidſt the horror and diſguſt to which his ſoul was a prey, pity for his victim ſtill held a place in it. The ſtorm of paſſion once over, he would have given worlds had he poſſeſſed them, to have reſtored to her that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of which his unbridled paſſions had deprived her. Of the deſires which had urged him to the crime, no trace was left in his boſom: his nature ſeemed to revolt at their very idea, and fain would he have wiped from his memory the ſcene which had juſt paſſed. As his gloomy rage abated, in proportion did his compaſſion augment for Antonia. He ſtopped, and would have ſpoken to her words of comfort; but he knew not from whence to draw them, and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gazing upon her with mournful wildneſs. Her ſituation ſeemed ſo hopeleſs, ſo woe begone, as to baffle mortal power to relieve her. What could he do for her? Her peace of mind was loſt, her honor irreparably ruined. She was cut off for ever from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, nor dared he give her back to it. He was conſcious that, were ſhe to appear in the world again, his guilt would be revealed, and his puniſhment inevit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. To one ſo laden with crimes, death came armed with double terrors. Yet, ſhould he reſtore Antonia to light, and ſtand the chance of her betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, how miſerable a proſpect would preſent itſelf before her! She could never hope to be creditably eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed; ſhe would be marked with infamy, and condemned to ſorrow and ſolitude for the remainder of her exiſtence. What was the alternative? A reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution far more terrible for Antonia, but which at leaſt would enſure the abbot's ſafety. He determined to leave the world perſuaded of her death, and to retain her a captive in this gloomy priſon. There he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:035729_0443_10065B6B624AB790"/>
to viſit her every night, to bring her food, to profeſs his penitence, and mingle his tears with hers. The monk felt that this reſolution was unjuſt and cruel; but it was his only means to prevent Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia from publiſhing his guilt and her own infamy. Should he releaſe her, he could not depend upon her ſilence. His offence was too flagrant to permit his hoping for her forgiveneſs. Beſides, her reappearing would excite univerſal curioſity, and the violence of her affliction would prevent her from concealing its cauſe. He determined, therefore, that Antonia ſhould remain a priſoner in the dungeon.</p>
                     <p>He approached her with confuſion painted on his countenance. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>iſed her from the ground—her hand trembled as he took it, and he dropped it again as if he had touched a ſerpent. Nature ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil at the touch. He felt himſelf at once repulſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from and attracted towards her, yet could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for neither ſentiment. There was ſomething in her look which penetrated him with horror; and though his underſtanding was ſtill ignorant of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience pointed out to him the whole extent of his crime. In hurried accents, yet the gentleſt he could find, while his eye was averted, and his voice ſcarcely audible, he ſtrove to conſole her under a misfortune which now could not be avoided. He declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſincerely penitent, and that he would gladly ſhed a drop of his blood for every tear which his barbarity had forced from her. Wretched and hopeleſs, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia liſtened to him in ſilent grief; but when he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced her confinement in the ſepulchre, that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful doom, to which even death ſeemed preferable, rouſed her from her inſenſibility at once. To linger
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:035729_0444_10065B32468C1A08"/>
out a life of miſery in a narrow loathſome cell, know to exiſt by no human being ſave her betrayer, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by mouldering corſes, breathing the peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial air of corruption, never more to behold the light, or drink the pure gale of heaven—the idea was more terrible than ſhe could ſupport. It conquered even her abhorrence of the friar. Again ſhe ſunk upon her knees; ſhe beſought his compaſſion in terms the moſt pathetic and urgent: ſhe promiſed, would he but reſtore her to liberty, to conceal her injuries from the world; to aſſign any reaſons for her reappearance, which he might judge proper; and, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the leaſt ſuſpicion from falling upon him, ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to quit Madrid immediately. Her entreaties were ſo urgent as to make a conſiderable impreſſion upon the monk. He reflected, that in keeping her concealed as he had at firſt intended, he was adding a freſh injury to thoſe which ſhe had already ſuffered; and that if ſhe adhered to her promiſes, whether ſhe was confined or at liberty, his life and reputation were equally ſecure. On the other hand, he trembled leſt in her affliction Antonia ſhould unintentionally break her engagement, or that her exceſſive ſimplicity and ignorance of deceit ſhould permit ſome one more artful to ſurpriſe her ſecret. However well founded were theſe apprehenſions, compaſſion, and a ſincere wiſh to repair his fault as much as poſſible, ſolicited his complying with the prayers of his ſuppliant. The difficulty of colouring Antonia's unexpected return to life, after her ſuppoſed death and public interment, was the only point which kept him irreſolute. He was ſtill pondering on the means of removing this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle, when he heard the ſound of feet approaching with precipitation. The door of the vault was thrown
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:035729_0445_10065B700B5FF8D8"/>
open, and Matilda ruſhed in, evidently much confuſed and terrified.</p>
                     <p>On ſeeing a ſtranger enter, Antonia uttered a cry of joy; but her hopes of receiving ſuccour from him were ſoon diſſipated. The ſuppoſed novice, without expreſſing the leaſt ſurpriſe at finding a woman alone with the monk, in ſo ſtrange a place, and at ſo late an hour, addreſſed him thus without loſing a moment:</p>
                     <p>"What is to be done? We are loſt, unleſs ſome ſpeedy means is found of diſpelling the rioters. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſio, the convent of St. Clare is on fire; the prior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs has fallen a victim to the fury of the mob. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready is the abbey menaced with a ſimilar fate. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed at the threats of the people, the monks ſeek for you every where. They imagine that your authority alone will ſuffice to calm this diſturbance. No one knows what is become of you, and your abſence cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates univerſal aſtoniſhment and deſpair. I profited by the confuſion, and fled hither to warn you of the danger."</p>
                     <p>"This will ſoon be remedied," anſwered the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot; I will haſten back to my cell: a trivial reaſon will account for my having been miſſed."</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible!" rejoined Matilda: "The ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre is filled with archers. Lorenzo de Medina, with ſeveral officers of the Inquiſition, ſearches through the vaults, and pervades every paſſage. You will be intercepted in your flight; your reaſons for being at this late hour in the ſepulchre will be examined; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia will be found, and then you are undone forever."</p>
                     <p>"Lorenzo de Medina? Officers of the Inquiſition?
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:035729_0446_10065BA8575C9358"/>
What brings them here? Seek they for me? Am I then ſuſpected? Oh! ſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Matilda! anſwer me in pity!"</p>
                     <p>"As yet they do not think of you; but I fear that they will ere long. Your only chance of eſcaping their notice reſts upon the difficulty of exploring this vault. The door is artfully hidden; haply it may not be obſerved, and we may remain concealed till the ſearch is over."</p>
                     <p>"But Antonia...... Should the inquiſitors draw near, and her cries be heard....."</p>
                     <p>"Thus I remove that danger!" interrupted Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time drawing a poniard, ſhe ruſhed upon her devoted prey.</p>
                     <p>"Hold! hold!" cried Ambroſio, ſeizing her hand, and wreſting from it the already lifted weapon. "What would you do, cruel woman? The unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate has already ſuffered but too much, thanks to your pernicious counſels! Would to God that I had never followed them! Would to God that I had never ſeen your face!"</p>
                     <p>Matilda darted upon him a look of ſcorn.</p>
                     <p>"Abſurd!" ſhe exclaimed with an air of paſſion and majeſty, which impreſſed the monk with awe. "After robbing her of all that made it dear, can you fear to deprive her of a life ſo miſerable? But 'tis well! Let her live to convince you of your folly. I abandon you to your evil diſtiny! I diſclaim your alliance! Who trembles to commit ſo inſignificant a
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035729_0447_10065B719315BE00"/>
crime, deſerves not my protection. Hark! hark! Ambroſio; hear you not the archers? They come, and your deſtruction is inevitable!"</p>
                     <p>At this moment the abbot heard the ſound of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant voices. He flew to cloſe the door, on whoſe concealment his ſafety depended, and which Matilda had neglected to faſten. Ere he could reach it, he ſaw Antonia glide ſuddenly by him, ruſh through the door, and fly towards the noiſe with the ſwiftneſs of an arrow. She had liſtened attentively to Matilda; ſhe heard Lorenzo's name mentioned, and reſolved to riſk every thing to throw herſelf under his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The door was open. The ſounds convinced her that the archers could be at no great diſtance. She muſtered up her little remaining ſtrength, ruſhed by the monk ere he perceived her deſign, and bent her courſe rapidly towards the voices. As ſoon as he recovered from his firſt ſurpriſe, the abbot failed not to purſue her. In vain did Antonia redouble her ſpeed, and ſtretch every nerve to the utmoſt. Her enemy gained upon her every moment: ſhe heard his ſteps cloſe after her, and felt the heat of his breath glow upon her neck. He overtook her; he twiſted his hand in the ringlets of her ſtreaming hair, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to drag her back with him to the dungeon. Antonia reſiſted with all her ſtrength. She folded her arms round a pillar which ſupported the roof, and ſhrieked loudly for aſſiſtance. In vain did the monk ſtrive to threaten her to ſilence.</p>
                     <p>"Help!" ſhe continued to exclaim: "help! help! for God's ſake!"</p>
                     <p>Quickened by her cries, the ſound of footſteps was
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:035729_0448_10065BA9F8C04648"/>
heard approaching. The abbot expected every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſee the inquiſitors arrive. Antonia ſtill reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he now enforced her ſilence by means the moſt horrible and inhuman. He ſtill graſped Matilda's dagger: without allowing himſelf a moment's reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he raiſed it, and plunged it twice in the boſom of Antonia. She ſhrieked, and ſunk upon the ground. The monk endeavoured to bear her away with him, but ſhe ſtill embraced the pillar firmly. At that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the light of approaching torches flaſhed upon the walls. Dreading a diſcovery, Ambroſio was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to abandon his victim, and haſtily fled back to the vault, where he had left Matilda.</p>
                     <p>He fled not unobſerved. Don Ramirez, happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to arrive the firſt, perceived a female bleeding upon the ground, and a man flying from the ſpot, whoſe confuſion betrayed him for the murderer. He inſtantly purſued the fugitive, with ſome part of the archers, while the others remained with Lorenzo to protect the wounded ſtranger. They raiſed her, and ſupported her in their arms. She had fainted from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of pain, but ſoon gave ſigns of returning life. She opened her eyes: and on lifting up her head, the quantity of fair hair fell back, which till then had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured her features.</p>
                     <p>"God Almighty! it is Antonia!"</p>
                     <p>Such was Lorenzo's exclamation, while he ſnatched her from the attendant's arms, and claſped her in his own.</p>
                     <p>Though aimed by an uncertain hand, the poniard had anſwered but too well the purpoſe of its employer. The wounds were mortal, and Antonia was conſcious
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:035729_0449_10065B7362C9BB30"/>
that ſhe never could recover. Yet the few moments which remained for her, were moments of happineſs. The concern expreſſed upon Lorenzo's countenance, the frantic fondneſs of his complaints, and his earneſt inquiries reſpecting her wounds, convinced her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a doubt that his affections were her own. She would not be removed from the vaults, fearing leſt motion ſhould only haſten her death: and ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to loſe thoſe moments which ſhe paſſed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving proofs of Lorenzo's love, and aſſuring him of her own. She told him, that had ſhe ſtill been undefiled ſhe might have lamented the loſs of life; but that, deprived of honor and branded with ſhame, death was to her a bleſſing: ſhe could not have been his wife; and that hope being denied her, ſhe reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf to the grave without one ſigh of regret. She bade him take courage, conjured him not to abandon himſelf to fruitleſs ſorrow, and declared that ſhe mourned to leave nothing in the whole world but him. While every ſweet accent increaſed rather than light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened Lorenzo's grief, ſhe continued to converſe with him till the moment of diſſolution. Her voice grew faint, and ſcarcely audible; a thick cloud ſpread itſelf over her eyes; her heart beat ſlow and irregular, and every inſtant ſeemed to announce that her fate was near at hand.</p>
                     <p>She lay, her head reclining upon Lorenzo's boſom, and her lips ſtill murmuring to him words of comfort. She was interrupted by the convent bell, as, tolling at a diſtance, it ſtruck the hour. Suddenly Antonia's eyes ſparkled with celeſtial brightneſs: her frame ſeemed to have received new ſtrength and animation. She ſtarted from her lover's arms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="195" facs="unknown:035729_0450_10065BAB8D7A5CF8"/>
"Three o'clock," ſhe cried. "Mother, I come!"</p>
                     <p>She claſped her hands and ſunk lifeleſs upon the ground. Lorenzo, in agony, threw himſelf beſide her. He tore his hair, beat his breaſt, and refuſed to be ſeparated from the corſe. At length his force be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exhauſted, he ſuffered himſelf to be led from the vault, and was conveyed to the palace de Medina ſcarcely more alive than the unfortunate Antonia.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, though cloſely purſued, Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio ſucceeded in regaining the vault. The door was already faſtened when Don Ramirez arrived, and much time elapſed ere the fugitive's retreat was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. But nothing can reſiſt perſeverance. Though ſo artfully concealed, the door could not eſcape the vigilance of the archers. They forced it open, and entered the vault to the infinite diſmay of Ambroſio and his companion. The monk's confuſion, his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to hide himſelf, his rapid flight, and the blood ſprinkled upon his clothes, left no room to doubt his being Antonia's murderer. But when he was recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed for the immaculate Ambroſio, "the man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs," the idol of Madrid; the faculties of the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators were chained up in ſurpriſe, and ſcarcely could they perſuade themſelves that what they ſaw was no viſion. The abbot ſtrove not to vindicate himſelf, but preſerved a ſullen ſilence. He was ſecured and bound. The ſame precaution was taken with Matilda. Her cowl being removed, the delicacy of her features and profuſion of her golden hair betrayed her ſex; and this incident created freſh amazement. The dagger was alſo found in the tomb, where the monk had thrown it; and the dungeon having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:035729_0451_10065B77B49DDD28"/>
a thorough ſearch, the two culprits were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the priſons of the Inquiſition.</p>
                     <p>Don Ramirez took care that the populace ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ignorant both of the crimes and profeſſion of the captives. He feared a repetition of the riots, which had followed the apprehending the prioreſs of St. Clare. He contented himſelf with ſtating to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uchins the guilt of their ſuperior. To avoid the ſhame of a public accuſation, and dreading the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fury, from which they had already ſaved their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey with much difficulty, the monks readily permitted the inquiſitors to ſearch their manſion without noiſe. No freſh diſcoveries were made. The effects found in the abbot's and Matilda's cells were ſeized, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Inquiſition to be produced in evidence. Every thing elſe remained in its former poſition, and order and tranquillity once more prevailed through Madrid.</p>
                     <p>St. Clare's convent was completely ruined by the united ravages of the mob and conflagration. Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remained of it but the principal walls, whoſe thickneſs and ſolidity had preſerved them from the flames. The nuns who had belonged to it were obliged, in conſequence, to diſperſe themſelves into other ſocieties: but the prejudice againſt them ran high, and the ſuperiors were very unwilling to admit them. However, moſt of them being related to fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies the moſt diſtinguiſhed for their riches, birth, and power, the ſeveral convents were compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, though they did it with a very ill grace. This prejudice was extremely falſe and unjuſtifiable. After a cloſe inveſtigation, it was proved that all in
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:035729_0452_10065BAFDD9B3D28"/>
the convent were perſuaded that Agnes had died in childbed, except the four nuns whom St. Urſula had pointed out. Theſe had fallen victims to the popular fury, as had alſo ſeveral who were perfectly innocent and unconſcious of the whole affair. Blinded by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, the mob had ſacrificed every nun who fell into their hands: they who eſcaped were entirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the duke de Medina's prudence and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Of this they were conſcious, and felt for that nobleman a proper ſenſe of gratitude.</p>
                     <p>Virginia was not the moſt ſparing of her thanks; ſhe wiſhed equally to make a proper return for his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and to obtain the good graces of Lorenzo's uncle. In this ſhe eaſily ſucceeded. The duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her beauty with wonder and admiration; and while his eyes were enchanted with her form, the ſweetneſs of her manners, and her tender concern for the ſuffering nun, prepoſſeſſed his heart in her favour. This Virginia had diſcernment enough to perceive, and ſhe redoubled her attention to the invalid. When he parted from her at the door of her father's palace, the duke entreated permiſſion to inquire occaſionally after her health. His requeſt was readily granted; Virginia aſſured him, that the marquis de Villa Franca would be proud of an opportunity to thank him in perſon for the protection afforded to her. They now ſeparated; he enchanted with her beauty and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſhe much pleaſed with him, and more with his nephew.</p>
                     <p>On entering the palace, Virginia's firſt care was to ſummon the family phyſician, and take care of her unknown charge. Her mother haſtened to ſhare with
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:035729_0453_10065B7941024D00"/>
her the charitable office. Alarmed by the riots, and trembling for his daughter's ſafety, who was his only child, the marquis had flown to St. Clare's convent, and was ſtill employed in ſeeking her. Meſſengers were now diſpatched on all ſides to inform him, that he would find her ſafe at his hotel, and deſire him to haſten thither immediately. His abſence gave Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia liberty to beſtow her whole attention upon her patient; and though much diſordered herſelf by the adventures of the night, no perſuaſion could induce her to quit the bed ſide of the ſufferer. Her conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being much enfeebled by want and ſorrow, it was ſome time before the ſtranger was reſtored to her ſenſes. She found great difficulty in ſwallowing the medicines preſcribed to her; but this obſtacle being removed, ſhe eaſily conquered her diſeaſe, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from nothing but weakneſs. The attention which was paid her, the wholeſome food to which ſhe had been long a ſtranger, and her joy at being reſtored to liberty, to ſociety, and, as ſhe dared to hope, to love, all this combined to her ſpeedy reeſtabliſhment. From the firſt moment of knowing her, her melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſituation, her ſufferings almoſt unparalleled, had gained the affections of her amiable hoſteſs. Virginia felt for her the moſt lively intereſt; but how was ſhe delighted, when, her gueſt being ſufficiently recovered to relate her hiſtory, ſhe recogniſed in the captive nun the ſiſter of Lorenzo!</p>
                     <p>This victim of monaſtic cruelty was indeed no other than the unfortunate Agnes. During her abode in the convent, ſhe had been well known to Virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia; but her emaciated form, her features altered by affliction, her death univerſally credited, and her over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:035729_0454_10065BB1635F2918"/>
and matted hair which hung over her face and boſom in diſorder, at firſt had prevented her being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected. The prioreſs had put every artifice in practice to induce Virginia to take the veil; for the heireſs of Villa Franca would have been no deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acquiſition. Her ſeeming kindneſs and unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted attention ſo far ſucceeded, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> relation began to think ſeriouſly upon compliance. Better inſtructed in the diſguſt and ennui of a monaſtic life, Agnes had penetrated the deſigns of the domina. She trembled for the innocent girl, and endeavoured to make her ſenſible of her error. She painted in their true colours the numerous inconveniences attached to a convent, the continued reſtraint, the low jealouſies, the petty intrigues, the ſervile court and groſs flattery expected by the ſuperior. She then bade Virginia reflect on the brilliant proſpect which preſented it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before her. The idol of her parents, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Madrid, endowed by nature and education with every perfection of perſon and mind, ſhe might look forward to an eſtabliſhment the moſt fortunate. Her riches furniſhed her with the means of exerciſing, in their fulleſt extent, charity and benevolence, thoſe virtues ſo dear to her; and her ſtay in the world would enable her diſcovering objects worthy her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, which could not be done in the ſecluſion of a convent.</p>
                     <p>Her perſuaſions induced Virginia to lay aſide all thoughts of the vei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, but another argument, not uſed by Agnes, had more weight with her than all the others put together. She had ſeen Lorenzo when he viſited his ſiſter at the grate; his perſon pleaſed her, and her converſations with Agnes generally uſed to
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:035729_0455_10065B7AC9B7E658"/>
terminate in ſome queſtion about her brother. She, who doted upon Lorenzo, wiſhed for no better than an opportunity to trumpet out his praiſe. She ſpoke of him in terms of rapture; and, to convince her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor how juſt were his ſentiments, how cultivated his mind, and elegant his expreſſions, ſhe ſhewed her at different times the letters which ſhe received from him. She ſoon perceived that from theſe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations the heart of her young friend had imbibed impreſſions which ſhe was far from intending to give, but was truly happy to diſcover. She could not have wiſhed her brother a more deſirable union: heireſs of Villa Franca, virtuous, affectionate, beautiful, and accompliſhed, Virginia ſeemed calculated to make him happy. She ſounded her brother upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, though without mentioning names or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. He aſſured her in his anſwers, that his heart and hand were totally diſengaged, and ſhe thought that upon theſe grounds ſhe might proceed without danger. She in conſequence endeavoured to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the dawning paſſion of her friend. Lorenzo was made the conſtant topic of her diſcourſe; and the avidity with which her auditor liſtened, the ſighs which frequently eſcaped from her boſom, and the eagerneſs with which upon any digreſſion ſhe brought back the converſation to the ſubject whence it had wandered, ſufficed to convince Agnes that her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's addreſſes would be far from diſagreeable. She at length ventured to mention her wiſhes to the duke. Though a ſtranger to the lady herſelf, he knew enough of her ſituation to think her worthy his nephew's hand. It was agreed between him and his niece, that ſhe ſhould inſinuate the idea to Lorenzo, and ſhe only waited his return to Madrid to propoſe her
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:035729_0456_10065BB30076C258"/>
friend to him as his bride. The unfortunate events which took place in the interim prevented her from executing her deſign. Virginia wept her loſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, both as a companion, and as the only perſon to whom ſhe could ſpeak of Lorenzo. Her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> continued to prey upon her heart in ſecret, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſhe had almoſt determined to confeſs her ſentiments to her mother, when accident once more threw their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in her way. The ſight of him ſo near her, his politeneſs, his compaſſion, his intrepidity, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined to give new ardour to her affection. When ſhe now found her friend and advocate reſtored to her, ſhe looked upon her as a gift from Heaven; ſhe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to cheriſh the hope of being united to Lorenzo, and reſolved to uſe with him his ſiſter's influence.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſing that before her death Agnes might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have made the propoſal, the duke had placed all his nephew's hints of marriage to Virginia's account; conſequently he gave them the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable reception. On returning to his hotel, the relation given him of Antonia's death, and Lorenzo's behaviour on the occaſion, made evident his miſtake. He lamented the circumſtances; but the unhappy girl being effectually out of the way, he truſted that his deſigns would yet be executed. 'Tis true that Lorenzo'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> s;ituation juſt then ill ſuited him for a bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom. His hopes diſappointed at the moment when he expected to realize them, and the dreadful and ſudden death of his miſtreſs had affected him very ſeverely. The duke found him upon the bed of ſickneſs. His attendants expreſſed ſerious apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for his life; but the uncle entertained not the ſame fears. He was of opinion, and not unwiſely,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:035729_0457_10065B7C5088E518"/>
that "men have died, and worms have ate them, but not for love!" He therefore flattered himſelf, that, however deep might be the impreſſion made upon his nephew's heart, time and Virginia would be able to efface it. He now haſtened to the afflicted youth, and endeavoured to conſole him: he ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſed in his diſtreſs, but encouraged him to reſiſt the encroachments of deſpair. He allowed, that he could not but feel ſhocked at an event ſo terrible, nor could he blame his ſenſibility; but he beſought him not to torment himſelf with vain regrets, and rather to ſtruggle with affliction, and preſerve his life, if not for his own ſake, at leaſt for the ſake of thoſe who were fondly attached to him. While he laboured thus to make Lorenzo forget Antonia's loſs, the duke paid his court aſſiduouſly to Virginia, and ſeized every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to advance his nephew's intereſt in her heart.</p>
                     <p>It may eaſily be expected that Agnes was not long without inquiring after Don Raymond. She was ſhocked to hear the wretched ſituation to which grief had reduced him; yet ſhe could not help exulting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly when ſhe reflected that his illneſs proved the ſincerity of his love. The duke undertook the office himſelf, of announcing to the invalid the happineſs which awaited him. Though he omitted no precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to prepare him for ſuch an event, at this ſudden change from deſpair to happineſs, Raymond's tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports were ſo violent, as nearly to have proved fatal to him. Theſe once paſſed, the tranquillity of his mind, the aſſurance of felicity, and above all, the preſence of Agnes (who was no ſooner reeſtabliſhed by the care of Virginia and the marchioneſs, than ſhe haſtened to attend her lover,) ſoon enabled him to overcome the
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:035729_0458_10065BBAD0C3A810"/>
effects of his late dreadful malady. The calm of his ſoul communicated itſelf to his body, and he recovered with ſuch rapidity as to create univerſal ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>Not ſo Lorenzo. Antonia's death, accompanied with ſuch terrible circumſtances, weighed upon his mind heavily. He was worn down to a ſhadow; nothing could give him pleaſure. He was perſuaded with difficulty to ſwallow nouriſhment ſufficient for the ſupport of life, and a conſumption was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſociety of Agnes formed his only comfort. Though accident had never permitted their being much together, he entertained for her a ſincere friendſhip and attachment. Perceiving how neceſſary ſhe was to him, ſhe ſeldom quitted his chamber. She liſtened to his complaints with unwearied attention, and ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by the gentleneſs of her manners, and by ſympathiſing with his diſtreſs. She ſtill inhabited the palace de Villa Franca, the poſſeſſors of which treated her with marked affection. The duke had intimated to the marquis his wiſhes reſpecting Virginia. The match was unexceptionable; Lorenzo was heir to his uncle's immenſe property, and was diſtinguiſhed in Madrid for his agreeable perſon, extenſive knowledge, and propriety of conduct. Add to this, that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs had diſcovered how ſtrong was her daughter's prepoſſeſſion in his favour.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence, the duke's propoſal was accepted without heſitation: every precaution was taken to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Lorenzo's ſeeing the lady with thoſe ſentiments which ſhe ſo well merited to excite. In her viſits to her brother, Agnes was frequently accompanied by the marchioneſs; and as ſoon as he was able to move into his antichamber, Virginia, under her mother's
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:035729_0459_10065B80E86CC910"/>
protection, was ſometimes permitted to expreſs her wiſhes for his recovery. This ſhe did with ſuch deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, the manner in which ſhe mentioned Antonia was ſo tender and ſoothing, and, when ſhe lamented her rival's melancholy fate, her bright eyes ſhone ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful through her tears, that Lorenzo could not behold or liſten to her without emotion. His relations, as well as the lady, perceived that with every day her ſociety ſeemed to give him freſh pleaſure, and that he ſpoke of her in terms of ſtronger admiration. However, they prudently kept their obſervations to themſelves. No word was dropped which might lead him to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their deſigns. They continued their former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and attention, and left time to ripen into a warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſentiment the friendſhip which he already felt for Virginia.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, her viſits became more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; and latterly there was ſcarce a day, of which ſhe did not paſs ſome part by the ſide of Lorenzo's couch. He gradually regained his ſtrength, but the progreſs of his recovery was ſlow and doubtful. One evening he ſeemed to be in better ſpirits than uſual. Agnes and her lover, the duke, Virginia, and her parents were ſitting round him. He now for the firſt time entreated his ſiſter to inform him how ſhe had eſcaped the effects of the poiſon which St. Urſula had ſeen her ſwallow. Fearful of recalling thoſe ſcenes to his mind in which Antonia had periſhed, ſhe had hitherto concealed from him the hiſtory of her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. As he now ſtarted the ſubject himſelf, and thinking that perhaps the narrative of her ſorrows might draw him from the contemplation of thoſe on which he dwelt too conſtantly, ſhe immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:035729_0460_10065BB48903ADA0"/>
with his requeſt. The reſt of the company had already heard her ſtory: but the intereſt which all preſent felt for its heroine, made them anxious to hear it repeated. The whole ſociety ſeconding Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo's entreaties, Agnes obeyed. She firſt recounted the diſcovery which had taken place in the abbey chapel, the domina's reſentment, and the midnight ſcene of which St. Urſula had been a concealed wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Though the nun had already deſcribed this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter event, Agnes now related it more circumſtantially, and at large. After which ſhe proceeded in her nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative as follows:</p>

                                 <head>CONCLUSION OF THE HISTORY OF AGNES DE MEDINA.</head>
                                 <p>MY ſuppoſed death was attended with the greateſt agonies. Thoſe moments which I believed my laſt were embittered by the domina's aſſurances that I could not eſcape perdition; and as my eyes cloſed, I heard her rage exhale itſelf in curſes on my offence. The horror of this ſituation, of a death bed from which hope was baniſhed, of a ſleep from which I was only to wake to find myſelf the prey of flames and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, was more dreadful than I can deſcribe. When animation revived in me, my ſoul was ſtill impreſſed with theſe terrible ideas. I looked round with fear, expecting to behold the miniſters of divine vengeance. For the firſt hour, my ſenſes were ſo bewildered, and my brain ſo dizzy, that I ſtrove in vain to arrange the ſtrange images which floated in wild confuſion before me. If I endeavoured to raiſe myſelf from the ground, the wandering of my head deceived me. Every thing around me ſeemed to rock, and I ſunk once more upon the earth. My weak and dazzled eyes were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:035729_0461_10065B826F682B60"/>
to bear a nearer approach to a gleam of light, which I ſaw trembling above me. I was compelled to cloſe them again, and remain motionleſs in the ſame poſture.</p>
                                 <p>A full hour elapſed, before I was ſufficiently my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to examine the ſurrounding objects. When I did examine them, what terror filled my boſom! I found myſelf extended upon a ſort of wicker couch. It had ſix handles to it, which doubtleſs had ſerved the nuns to convey me to my grave. I was covered with a linen cloth: ſeveral faded flowers were ſtrown over me. On one ſide lay a ſmall wooden crucifix; on the other a roſary of large beads. Four low narrow walls confined me. The top was alſo covered, and in it was fitted a ſmall grated door, through which was admitted the little air that circulated in this miſerable place. A faint glimmering of light, which ſtreamed through the bars, permitted me to diſtinguiſh the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding horrors. I was oppreſſed by a noiſome ſuffocating ſmell; and perceiving that the grated door was unfaſtened, I thought that I might poſſibly effect my eſcape. As I raiſed myſelf with this deſign, my hand reſted upon ſomething ſoft: I graſped it, and advanced it towards the light. Almighty God! what was my diſguſt! my conſternation! In ſpite of its putridity, and the worms which preyed upon it, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a corrupted human head, and recogniſed the features of a nun who had died ſome months before. I threw it from me, and ſunk almoſt lifeleſs upon my bier.</p>
                                 <p>When my ſtrength returned, this circumſtance, and the conſciouſneſs of being ſurrounded by the
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:035729_0462_10065BB948C02C60"/>
loathſome and mouldering bodies of my companions, increaſed my deſire to eſcape from my fearful priſon. I again moved towards the light. The grated door was within my reach. I lifted it without difficulty: probably it had been left uncloſed, to facilitate my quitting the dungeon. Aiding myſelf by the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the walls, ſome of whoſe ſtones projected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reſt, I contrived to aſcend them, and drag myſelf out of my priſon. I now found myſelf in a vault tolerably ſpacious. Several tombs, ſimilar in appearance to that whence I had juſt eſcaped, were ranged along the ſides in order, and ſeemed to be conſiderably ſunk within the earth. A ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chral lamp was ſuſpended from the roof by an iron chain, and ſhed a gloomy light through the dungeon. Emblems of death were ſeen on every ſide: ſkulls, ſhoulder blades, thigh bones, and other reliques of mortality, were ſcattered upon the dewy ground. Each tomb was ornamented with a large crucifix, and in one corner ſtood a wooden ſtatue of St. Clare. To theſe objects I at firſt paid no attention: a door, the only outlet from the vault, had attracted my eyes. I haſtened towards it, having wrapped my winding ſheet cloſely round me. I puſhed againſt the door, and to my inexpreſſible terror found that it was faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened on the outſide.</p>
                                 <p>I gueſſed immediately, that the prioreſs, miſtaking the nature of the liquor which ſhe had compelled me to drink, inſtead of poiſon had adminiſtered a ſtrong opiate. From this I concluded that, being to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance dead, I had received the rites of burial; and that, deprived of the power of making my exiſtence known, it would be my fate to expire of hunger.
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:035729_0463_10065B840106FC38"/>
This idea penetrated me with horror, not merely for my own ſake, but that of the innocent creature who ſtill lived within my boſom. I again endeavoured to open the door, but it reſiſted all my efforts. I ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my voice to the extent of its compaſs, and ſhrieked for aid.

The tortures which hunger inflicted on me, were the moſt painful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable: yet they ſeemed to increaſe with every hour which paſſed over my head. Sometimes I threw myſelf upon the ground, and rolled upon it wild and deſperate: ſometimes ſtarting up, I returned to the door, again ſtrove to force it open, and repeated my fruitleſs cries for ſuccour. Often was I on the point of ſtriking my temple againſt the ſharp corner of ſome monument, daſhing out my brains, and thus terminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my woes at once. But ſtill the remembrance of my baby vanquiſhed my reſolution. I trembled at a deed, which equally endangered my child's exiſtence and my own. Then would I vent my anguiſh in loud exclamations and paſſionate complaints; and then again my ſtrength failing me, ſilent and hopeleſs I would ſit me down upon the baſe of St. Clare's ſtatue, ſold my arms, and abandon myſelf to ſullen deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. Thus paſſed ſeveral wretched hours. Death advanced towards me with rapid ſtrides, and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that every ſucceeding moment would be that of my diſſolution. Suddenly a neighbouring tomb caught my eye: a baſket ſtood upon it, which till then I had not obſerved. I ſtarted from my ſeat; I made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:035729_0464_10065BBC575BD008"/>
it as ſwiftly as my exhauſted frame would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. How eagerly did I ſeize the baſket, on finding it to contain a loaf of coarſe bread and a ſmall bottle of water!</p>
                                 <p>I threw myſelf with avidity upon theſe humble ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They had to all appearance been placed in the vault for ſeveral days. The bread was hard, and the water tainted: yet never did I taſte food to me ſo delicious. When the cravings of appetite were ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, I buſied myſelf with conjectures upon this new circumſtance. I debated whether the baſket had been placed there with a view to my neceſſity. Hope an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my doubts in the affirmative. Yet who could gueſs me to be in need of ſuch aſſiſtance? If my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence was known, why was I detained in this gloomy vault? If I was kept a priſoner, what meant the ceremony of committing me to the tomb? Or, if I was doomed to periſh with hunger, to whoſe pity was I indebted for proviſions placed within my reach? A friend would not have kept my dreadful puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a ſecret: neither did it ſeem probable that an enemy would have taken pains to ſupply me with the means of exiſtence. Upon the whole I was inclined to think, that the Domina's deſigns upon my life had been diſcovered by ſome one of my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans in the convent, who had found means to ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute an opiate for poiſon; that ſhe had furniſhed me with food to ſupport me, till ſhe could effect my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery; and that ſhe was then employed in giving intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to my relations of my danger, and pointing out a way to releaſe me from captivity. Yet why then was the quality of my proviſions ſo coarſe? how could my friend have entered the vault without the domina's
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:035729_0465_10065B8599782058"/>
knowledge? and if ſhe had entered, why was the door faſtened ſo carefully? Theſe reflections ſtaggered me: yet ſtill this idea was the moſt favourable to my hopes, and I dwelt upon it in preference.</p>
                                 <p>My meditations were interrupted by the ſound of diſtant footſteps. They approached, but ſlowly. Rays of light now darted through the crevices of the door. Uncertain whether the perſons who advanced came to relieve me, or were conducted by ſome other motive to the vault, I failed not to attract their notice by loud cries for help. Still the ſounds drew near. The light grew ſtronger. At length with inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                                       <desc>•••</desc>
                                    </gap> I heard the key turning in the lock. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that my deliverance was at hand, I flew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the door with a ſhriek of joy. It opened: but all my hopes of eſcape died away, when the prior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs appeared, followed by the ſame four nuns who had been witneſſes of my ſuppoſed death. They bore torches in their hands, and gazed upon me in fearful ſilence.</p>
                                 <p>I ſtarted back in terror. The domina deſcended into the vault, as did alſo her companions. She bent upon me a ſtern reſentful eye, but expreſſed no ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe at finding me ſtill living. She took the ſeat which I had juſt quitted. The door was again cloſed, and the nuns ranged themſelves behind their ſuperior, while the glare of their torches, dimmed by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and dampneſs of the vault, gilded with cold beams the ſurrounding monuments. For ſome moments all preſerved a dead and ſolemn ſilence. I ſtood at ſome diſtance from the prioreſs. At length ſhe beckoned to me to advance. Trembling at the ſeverity of her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:035729_0466_10065BBDE70A6E38"/>
my ſtrength ſcarce ſufficed me to obey her. I drew near, but my limbs were unable to ſupport their burden. I ſunk upon my knees, I claſped my hands and lifted them up to her for mercy but had no power to articulate a ſyllable.</p>
                                 <p>She gazed upon me with angry eyes.</p>
                                 <p>"Do I ſee a penitent or a criminal?" ſhe ſaid at length: "Are thoſe hands raiſed in contrition for your crimes, or in fear of meeting their puniſhment? Do thoſe tears acknowledge the juſtice of your doom, or only ſolicit mitigation of your ſufferings? I fear me, 'tis the latter!"</p>
                                 <p>She pauſed, but kept her eyes ſtill fixed upon mine.</p>
                                 <p>"Take courage," ſhe continued; "I wiſh not for your death, but your repentance. The draught which I adminiſtered was no poiſon, but an opiate. My intention in deceiving you, was to make you feel the agonies of a guilty conſcience, had death overtaken you ſuddenly, while your crimes were ſtill unrepented. You have ſuffered thoſe agonies; I have brought you to be familiar with the ſharpneſs of death, and I truſt that your momentary anguiſh will prove to you an eternal benefit. It is not my deſign to deſtroy your immortal ſoul, or bid you ſeek the grave, burthened with the weight of ſins unexpiated. No, daughter, far from it; I will purify you with wholeſome chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, and furniſh you with full leiſure for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and remorſe.—Hear then my ſentence: The ill judged zeal of your friends delayed its execution, but cannot now prevent it. All Madrid believes you to be no more; your relations are thoroughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:035729_0467_10065B89CFC2BE88"/>
of your death, and the nuns your partiſans have aſſiſted at your funeral. Your exiſtence can never be ſuſpected. I have taken ſuch precautions as muſt render it an impenetrable myſtery. Then abandon all thoughts of a world from which you are eternally ſeparated, and employ the few hours which are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you in preparing for the next."</p>
                                 <p>This exordium led me to expect ſomething terrible, I trembled, and would have ſpoken to deprecate her wrath: but a motion of the domina commanded me to be ſilent. She proceeded:</p>
                                 <p>"Though of late years unjuſtly neglected, and now oppoſed by many of our miſguided ſiſters (whom Heaven convert!) it is my intention to revive the laws of our order in their full force. That againſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence is ſevere, but no more than ſo monſtrous an offence demands. Submit to it, daughter, without reſiſtance; you will find the benefit of patience and reſignation in a better life than this. Liſten then to the ſentence of St. Clare. Beneath theſe vaults there exiſt priſons, intended to receive ſuch criminals as yourſelf: artfully is their entrance concealed, and ſhe who enters them muſt reſign all hopes of liberty. Thither muſt you now be conveyed. Food ſhall be ſupplied you, but not ſufficient for the indulgence of appetite: you ſhall have juſt enough to keep together body and ſoul, and its quality ſhall be the ſimpleſt and coarſeſt. Weep, daughter, weep, and moiſten your bread with your tears: God knows, that you have ample cauſe for ſorrow! Chained down in one of theſe ſecret dungeons, ſhut out from ſhe world and light for ever, with no comfort but religion, no ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but repentance; thus muſt you groan away the
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:035729_0468_10065BC258EF2208"/>
remainder of your days. Such are St. Clare's orders; ſubmit to them without repining. Follow me!"</p>
                                 <p>Thunder ſtruck at this barbarous decree, my little remaining ſtrength abandoned me. I anſwered only by falling at her feet, and bathing them with tears. The domina, unmoved by my affliction, roſe from her ſeat with a ſtately air; ſhe repeated her commands in an abſolute tone; but exceſſive faintneſs made me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to obey her. Mariana and Alix raiſed me from the ground, and carried me forwards in their arms. The prioreſs moved on, leaning on Violante, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla preceded her with a torch. Thus paſſed our ſad proceſſion along the paſſages, in ſilence only broken by my ſighs and groans. We ſtopped before the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſhrine of St. Clare. The ſtatue was removed from its pedeſtal, though how I knew not. The nuns afterwards raiſed an iron grate, till then concealed by the image, and let it fall on the other ſide with a loud craſh. The awful ſound, repeated by the vaults above and caverns below me, rouſed me from the deſpondent apathy in which I had been plunged. I looked before me; an abyſs preſented itſelf to my affrighted eyes, and a ſteep and narrow ſtaircaſe, whither my conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were leading me. I ſhrieked, and ſtarted back. I implored compaſſion, rent the air with my cries, and ſummoned both heaven and earth to my aſſiſtance. In vain! I was hurried down the ſtaircaſe, and forced into one of the cells which lined the cavern's ſides.</p>
                                 <p>My blood ran cold, as I gazed upon this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly abode. The cold vapours hovering in the air, the walls green with damp, the bed of ſtraw ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn and comfortleſs, the chain deſtined to bind me
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:035729_0469_10065B8B58210C38"/>
for ever to my priſon, and the reptiles of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, which, as the torches advanced towards them, I deſcried hurrying to their retreats, ſtruck my heart with terrors almoſt too exquiſite for nature to bear. Driven by deſpair to madneſs, I burſt ſuddenly from the nuns who held me; I threw myſelf upon my knees before the prioreſs, and beſought her mercy in the moſt paſſionate and frantic terms.</p>
                                 <p>"If not on me," ſaid I, "look at leaſt with pity on that innocent being, whoſe life is attached to mine! Great is my crime, but let not my child ſuffer for it! My baby has committed no fault. Oh! ſpare me for the ſake of my unborn offspring, whom ere it taſtes life, your ſeverity dooms to deſtruction!"</p>
                                 <p>The prioreſs drew back haſtily; ſhe forced her habit from my graſp, as if my touch had been conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</p>
                                 <p>"What!" ſhe exclaimed with an exaſperated air: "What! Dare you plead for the produce of your ſhame? Shall a creature be permitted to live, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in guilt ſo monſtrous? Abandoned woman, ſpeak for him no more! Better that the wretch ſhould periſh than live: begotten in perjury, incontinence, and pollution, it cannot fail to prove a prodigy of vice. Hear me, thou guilty! Expect no mercy from me, either for yourſelf or brat. Rather pray that death may ſeize you before you produce it; or, if it muſt ſee the light, that its eyes may immediately be cloſed again for ever! No aid ſhall be given you in your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; bring your offspring into the world yourſelf, feed it yourſelf, nurſe it yourſelf, bury it yourſelf: God grant that the latter may happen ſoon, leſt you receive comfort from the fruit of your iniquity!"</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="215" facs="unknown:035729_0470_10065BC3E130C7C8"/>
This inhuman ſpeech, the threats which it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the dreadful ſufferings foretold to me by the dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ina, and her prayers for my infant's death, on whom, though unborn, I already doted, were more than my exhauſted frame could ſupport. Uttering a deep groan, I fell ſenſeleſs at the feet of my unrelenting enemy. I know not how long I remained in this ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; but I imagine that ſome time muſt have elapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before my recovery, ſince it ſufficed the prioreſs and her nuns to quit the cavern. When my ſenſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, I found myſelf in ſilence and ſolitude. I heard not even the retiring footſteps of my perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. All was huſhed, and all was dreadful! I had been thrown upon the bed of ſtraw: the heavy chain which I had already eyed with terror, was wound around my waiſt, and faſtened me to the wall. A lamp glimmering with dull melancholy rays through my dungeon, permitted my diſtinguiſhing all its hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. It was ſeparated from the cavern by a low and irregular wall of ſtone. A large chaſm was left open in it, which formed the entrance, for door there was none. A leaden crucifix was in front of my ſtraw couch. A tattered rug lay near me, as did alſo a chaplet of beads; and not far from me ſtood a pitcher of water, and a wicker baſket containing a ſmall loaf, and a bottle of oil to ſupply my lamp.</p>
                                 <p>With a deſpondent eye did I examine this ſcene of ſuffering: when I reflected that I was doomed to paſs in it the remainder of my days, my heart was rent with bitter anguiſh. I had once been taught to look forward to a lot ſo different! At one time my proſpects had appeared ſo bright, ſo flattering! Now all was loſt to me. Friends, comfort, ſociety, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:035729_0471_10065B8D5D687528"/>
in one moment I was deprived of all! Dead to the world, dead to pleaſure, I lived to nothing but the ſenſe of miſery. How fair did that world ſeem to me, from which I was for ever excluded! How many loved objects did it contain, whom I never ſhould behold again! As I threw a look of terror round my priſon, as I ſhrunk from the cutting wind which howled through my ſubterraneous dwelling, the change ſeemed ſo ſtriking, ſo abrupt, that I doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its reality. That the duke de Medina's niece, that the deſtined bride of the marquis de las Ciſternas, one bred up in affluence, related to the nobleſt families in Spain, and rich in a multitude of affectionate friends—that ſhe ſhould in one moment become a captive, ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arated from the world for ever, weighed down with chains, and reduced to ſupport life with the coarſeſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iments—appeared a change ſo ſudden and incredible, that I believed myſelf the ſport of ſome frightful viſion. Its continuance convinced me of my miſtake with but too much certainty. Every morning I looked for ſome relief from my ſufferings: every morning my hopes were diſappointed. At length I abandoned all idea of eſcaping, I reſigned myſelf to my fate, and only expected liberty when ſhe came the companion of death.</p>
                                 <p>My mental anguiſh, and the dreadful ſcenes in which I had been an actreſs, advanced the period of my labour. In ſolitude and miſery, abandoned by all, unaſſiſted by art, uncomforted by friendſhip, with pangs which if witneſſed would have touched the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt heart, was I delivered of my wretched burden. It came alive into the world; but I knew not how to treat it, or by what means to preſerve its exiſtence.
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:035729_0472_10065BC5942DA640"/>
I could only bathe it with tears, warm it in my boſom, and offer up prayers for its ſafety. I was ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of this mournful employment: the want of proper attendance, my ignorance how to nurſe it, the bitter cold of the dungeon, and the unwholeſome air which inflated its lungs, terminated my ſweet babe's ſhort and painful exiſtence. It expired in a few hours after its birth, and I witneſſed its death with agonies which beggar all deſcription.</p>
                                 <p>But my grief was unavailing. My infant was no more: nor could all my ſighs impart to its little ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der frame the breath of a moment. I rent my wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheet, and wrapped in it my lovely child. I plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it on my boſom, its ſoft arm folded round my neck, and its pale cold cheek reſting upon mine. Thus did its lifeleſs limbs repoſe, while I covered it with kiſſes, talked to it, wept, and moaned over it without remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion day or night. Camilla entered my priſon regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly once every twenty-four hours to bring me food. In ſpite of her flinty nature, ſhe could not behold this ſpectacle unmoved. She feared that grief ſo exceſſive would at length turn my brain; and in truth I was not always in my proper ſenſes. From a principle of compaſſion ſhe urged me to permit the corſe to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; but to this I never would conſent. I vowed not to part with it while I had life: its preſence was my only comfort, and no perſuaſion could induce me to give it up. It ſoon became a maſs of putridity, and to every eye was a loathſome and diſguſting object, to every eye but a mother's. In vain did human feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings bid me recoil from this emblem of mortality with repugnance. I withſtood, and vanquiſhed that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance. I perſiſted in holding my infant to my
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:035729_0473_10065B8EE4B5A0F8"/>
boſom, in lamenting it, loving it, adoring it! Hour after hour have I paſſed upon my ſorry couch, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating what had once been my child. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to retrace its features through the livid corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with which they were overſpread. During my confinement, this ſad occupation was my only delight; and at that time worlds ſhould not have bribed me to give it up. Even when releaſed from my priſon, I brought away my child in my arms. The repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of my too kind friends, [Here ſhe took the hands of the marchioneſs and Virginia, and preſſed them alternately to her lips] at length perſuaded me to reſign my unhappy infant to the grave. Yet I parted from it with reluctance. However, reaſon at length prevailed; I ſuffered it to be taken from me, and it now repoſes in conſecrated earth.</p>
                                 <p>I before mentioned, that regularly once a day Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla brought me food. She ſought not to embitter my ſorrows with reproach. She bade me, 'tis true, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign all hopes of liberty and worldly happineſs; but ſhe encouraged me to bear with patience my tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary diſtreſs, and adviſed me to draw comfort from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. My ſituation evidently affected her more than ſhe ventured to expreſs; but ſhe believed that to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate my fault would make me leſs anxious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it. Often, while her lips painted the enormity of my guilt in glaring colours, her eyes betrayed how ſenſible ſhe was to my ſufferings. In fact, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that none of my tormentors (for the three other nuns entered my priſon occaſionally) were ſo much actuated by the ſpirit of oppreſſive cruelty, as by the idea that to afflict my body was the only way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my ſoul. Nay, even this perſuaſion might not
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:035729_0474_10065BC71E7103B8"/>
have had ſuch weight with them, and they might have thought my puniſhment too ſevere, had not their good diſpoſitions been repreſſed by blind obedience to their ſuperior. Her reſentment exiſted in full force. My project of elopement having been diſcovered by the abbot of the Capuchins, ſhe ſuppoſed herſelf lowered in his opinion by my diſgrace, and in conſequence her hate was inveterate. She told the nuns to whoſe cuſtody I was committed, that my fault was of the moſt heinous nature, that no ſufferings could equal the offence, and that nothing could ſave me from eternal perdition but puniſhing my guilt with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſeverity. The ſuperior's word is an oracle to but too many of a convent's inhabitants. The nuns believed whatever the prioreſs choſe to aſſert: though contradicted by reaſon and charity, they heſitated not to admit the truth of her arguments. They followed her injunctions to the very letter, and were fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that to treat me with lenity, or to ſhew the leaſt pity for my woes, would be a direct means to deſtroy my chance for ſalvation.</p>
                                 <p>Camilla being thus employed about me, was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly charged by the prioreſs to treat me with harſhneſs. In compliance with theſe orders, ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtrove to convince me how juſt was my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and how enormous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                                       <desc>••</desc>
                                    </gap>s my crime. She bade me think myſelf too happy in ſaving my ſoul by mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying my body, and even threatened me ſometimes with eternal perdition. Yet, as I before obſerved, ſhe always concluded by words of encouragement and comfort; and though uttered by Camilla's lips, I eaſily recogniſed the domina's expreſſions. Once, and once only, the prioreſs viſited me in my dungeon.
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:035729_0475_10065B938A102048"/>
She then treated me with the moſt unrelenting cruelty. She loaded me with reproaches, taunted me with my frailty; and, when I implored her mercy, told me to aſk it of Heaven, ſince I deſerved none on earth. She even gazed upon my lifeleſs infant without emotion; and when ſhe left me, I heard her charge Camilla to increaſe the hardſhips of my captivity. Unfeeling woman! But let me check my reſentment. She has expiated her errors by her ſad and unexpected death. Peace be with her! and may her crimes be forgiven in Heaven, as I forgive her my ſufferings on earth!</p>
                                 <p>Thus did I drag on a miſerable exiſtence. Far from growing familiar with my priſon, I beheld it every moment with new horror. The cold ſeemed more piercing and bitter, the air more thick and peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential. My frame became weak, feveriſh, and emaciated. I was unable to riſe from my bed of ſtraw, and exerciſe my limbs in the narrow limits to which the length of my chain permitted me to move. Though exhauſted, faint, and weary, I trembled to profit by the approach of ſleep. My ſlumbers were conſtantly interrupted by ſome obnoxious inſect crawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over me. Sometimes I felt the bloated toad, hideous and pampered with the poiſonous vapours of the dungeon, dragging his loathſome length along my boſom. Sometimes the quick cold lizard rouſed me, leaving his ſlimy track upon my face, and entangling itſelf in the treſſes of my wild and matted hair. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have I at waking found my fingers ringed with the long worms which bred in the corrupted fleſh of my infant. At ſuch times I ſhrieked with terror and diſguſt; and, while I ſhook off the reptile, trembled with all a woman's weakneſs.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="221" facs="unknown:035729_0476_10065BCBB1B6DE20"/>
Such was my ſituation when Camilla was ſuddenly taken ill. A dangerous fever, ſuppoſed to be infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, confined her to her bed. Every one, except the lay ſiſter appointed to nurſe her, avoided her with caution, and feared to catch the diſeaſe. She was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly delirious, and by no means capable of attending to me. The domina, and the nuns admitted to the myſtery, had latterly entirely given me over to Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's care. In conſequence, they buſied themſelves no more about me; and, occupied by preparing for the approaching feſtival, it is more than probable that I never once entered into their thoughts. Of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Camilla's negligence I have been informed ſince my releaſe by the mother St. Urſula. At that time I was very far from ſuſpecting its cauſe. On the contrary, I waited for my gaoler's appearance at firſt with impatience, and afterwards with deſpair. One day paſſed away: another followed it: the third ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. Still no Camilla! ſtill no food! I knew the lapſe of time by the waſting of my lamp, to feed which, fortunately a week's ſupply of oil had been left me. I ſuppoſed, either that the nuns had forgotten me, or that the domina had ordered them to let me periſh. The latter idea ſeemed the moſt probable: yet ſo natural is the love of life, that I trembled to find it true. Though embittered by every ſpecies of miſery, my exiſtence was ſtill dear to me, and I dreaded to loſe it. Every ſucceeding minute proved to me that I muſt abandon all hopes of relief. I was become an abſolute ſkeleton: my eyes already failed me, and my limbs were beginning to ſtiffen. I could only expreſs my anguiſh, and the pangs of that hunger which gnawed my heart ſtrings, by frequent groans,

whoſe melancholy ſound the vaulted roof of the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon reechoed. I reſigned myſelf to my fate: I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready expected the moment of diſſolution, when my guardian angel—when my beloved brother arrived in time to ſave me. My ſight, grown dim and feeble, at firſt refuſed to recogniſe him: and when I did diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh his features, the ſudden burſt of rapture was too much for me to bear. I was overpowered by the ſwell of joy at once more beholding a friend, and that a friend ſo dear to me. Nature could not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my emotions, and took her refuge in inſenſibility.</p>
                                 <p>You already know what are my obligations to the family of Villa Franca. But what you cannot know, is the extent or my gratitude, boundleſs as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of my benefactors. Lorenzo! Raymond! names ſo dear to me! teach me to bear with fortitude this ſudden tranſition from miſery to bliſs. So lately a captive, oppreſſed with chains, periſhing with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſuffering every inconvenience of cold and want, hidden from the light, excluded from ſociety, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, neglected, and, as I feared, forgotten: now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to life and liberty, enjoying all the comforts of affluence and eaſe, ſurrounded by thoſe who are moſt loved by me, and on the point of becoming his bride who has long been wedded to my heart, my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo exquiſite, ſo perfect, that ſcarcely can my brain ſuſtain the weight. One only wiſh remains ungratified. It is to ſee my brother in his former health, and to know that Antonia's memory is buried in her grave. Granted this prayer, I have nothing more to deſire. I truſt that my paſt ſufferings have purchaſed from Heaven the pardon of my momentary weakneſs. That I have offended, offended greatly
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:035729_0478_10065BCD3A5FF840"/>
and grievouſly, I am fully conſcious. But let not my huſband, becauſe he once conquered my virtue, doubt the propriety of my future conduct. I have been frail and full of error: but I yielded not to the warmth of conſtitution. Raymond, affection for you betrayed me. I was too confident of my ſtrength: but I depended no leſs on your honor than on my own. I had vowed never to ſee you more. Had it not been for the conſequences of that unguarded mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my reſolution had been kept. Fate willed it otherwiſe, and I cannot but rejoice at its decree. Still my conduct has been highly blameable; and while I attempt to juſtify myſelf, I bluſh at recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting my imprudence. Let me then diſmiſs the ungrateful ſubject; firſt aſſuring you Raymond, that you ſhall have no cauſe to repent our union, and that, the more culpable have been the errors of your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, the more exemplary ſhall be the conduct of your wife.</p>

                     <p>Here Agnes ceaſed; and the marquis replied to her addreſs in terms equally ſincere and affectionate. Lorenzo expreſſed his ſatisfaction at the proſpect of being ſo cloſely connected with a man for whom he had ever entertained the higheſt eſteem. The Pope's bull had fully and effectually releaſed Agnes from her religious engagements. The marriage was therefore celebrated as ſoon as the needful preparations had been made: for the marquis wiſhed to have the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emony performed with all poſſible ſplendour and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. This being over, and the bride having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the compliments of Madrid, ſhe departed with
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:035729_0479_10065B95121E5610"/>
Don Raymond for his caſtle in Andaluſia. Lorenzo accompanied them, as did alſo the marchioneſs de Villa Franca and her lovely daughter. It is needleſs to ſay that Theodore was of the party, and would be impoſſible to deſcribe his joy at his maſter's marriage. Previous to his departure, the marquis, to atone in ſome meaſure for his paſt neglect, made ſome inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries relative to Elvira. Finding that ſhe, as well as her daughter, had received many ſervices from Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella and Jacintha, he ſhewed his reſpect to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his ſiſter in law by making the two women handſome preſents. Lorenzo followed his example. Leonella was highly flattered by the attentions of noblemen ſo diſtinguiſhed, and Jacintha bleſſed the hour on which her houſe was bewitched.</p>
                     <p>On her ſide, Agnes failed not to reward her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent friends. The worthy mother St. Urſula, to whom ſhe owed her liberty, was named, at her requeſt, ſuperintendant of "the ladies of Charity." This was one of the beſt and moſt opulent ſocieties throughout Spain. Bertha and Cornelia, not chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to quit their friend, were appointed to principal charges in the ſame eſtabliſhment. As to the nuns who had aided the domina in perſecuting Agnes; Camilla, being confined by illneſs to her bed, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in the flames which conſumed St. Clare's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Mariana, Alix, and Violante, as well as two more, had fallen victims to the popular rage. The three others, who had in council ſupported the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's ſentence, were ſeverely reprimanded, and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed to religious houſes in obſcure and diſtant prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inces. Here they languiſhed away a few years, aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:035729_0480_10065BCF02FB5228"/>
of their former weakneſs, and ſhunned by their companions with averſion and contempt.</p>
                     <p>Nor was the fidelity of Flora permitted to go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded. Her wiſhes being conſulted, ſhe declared herſelf impatient to reviſit her native land. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, a paſſage was procured for her to Cuba, where ſhe arrived in ſafety, loaded with the preſents of Raymond and Lorenzo.</p>
                     <p>The debts of gratitude diſcharged, Agnes was at liberty to purſue her favourite plan. Lodged in the ſame houſe, Lorenzo and Virginia were eternally to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The more he ſaw of her, the more was he convinced of her merit. On her part, ſhe laid her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out to pleaſe; and not to ſucceed was for her impoſſible. Lorenzo witneſſed with admiration her beautiful perſon, elegant manners, innumerable tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and ſweet diſpoſition. He was alſo much flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by her prejudice in his favour, which ſhe had not ſufficient art to conceal. However, his ſentiments partook not of that ardent character which had mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his affection for Antonia. The image of that lovely and unfortunate girl ſtill lived in his heart, and baffled all Virginia's efforts to diſplace it. Still, when the duke propoſed to him the match, which he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo earneſtly to take place, his nephew did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the offer. The urgent ſupplications of his friends and the lady's merit, conquered his repugnance to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into new engagements. He propoſed himſelf to the marquis de Villa Franca, and was accepted with joy and gratitude. Virginia became his wife, nor did ſhe ever give him cauſe to repent his choice. His eſteem increaſed for her daily. Her unremitted en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:035729_0481_10065B969A6B7938"/>
to pleaſe him could not but ſucceed. His affection aſſumed ſtronger and warmer colours. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia's image was gradually effaced from his boſom, and, Virginia became ſole miſtreſs of that heart, which ſhe well deſerved to poſſeſs without a partner.</p>
                     <p>The remaining years of Raymond and Agnes, of Lorenzo and Virginia, were happy as can be thoſe allotted to mortals, born to be the prey of grief, and ſport of diſappointment. The exquiſite ſorrows with which they had been afflicted, made them think light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of every ſucceeding woe. They had felt the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt darts in misfortune's quiver. Thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, appeared blunt in compariſon. Having weathered fate's heavieſt ſtorms, they looked calmly upon its terrors: or, if ever they felt affliction's caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual gales, they ſeemed to them gentle as zephyrs which breathe over ſummer ſeas.</p>

                     <p>ON the day following Antonia's death, all Madrid was a ſcene of conſternation and amazement. An archer, who had witneſſed the adventure in the ſepulchre, had indiſcreetly related the circumſtances of the murder: he had alſo named the perpetrator. The confuſion was without example, which this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence raiſed among the devotees. Moſt of them diſbelieved it, and went themſelves to the abbey to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the fact. Anxious to avoid the ſhame to which their ſuperior's ill conduct expoſed the whole brotherhood, the monks aſſured the viſitors, that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſio was prevented from receiving them as uſual by nothing but illneſs. This attempt was unſucceſsful. The ſame excuſe being repeated day after day, the archer's ſtory gradually obtained confidence. The abbot's partiſans abandoned him: no one entertained a doubt of his guilt: and they who before had been the warmeſt in his praiſe, were now the moſt vocife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in his condemnation.</p>
                     <p>While his innocence or guilt was debated in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid with the utmoſt acrimony, Ambroſio was a prey to the pangs of conſcious villainy, and the terrors of puniſhment impending over him. When he looked back to the eminence on which he had lately ſtood, univerſally honoured and reſpected, at peace with the world and with himſelf, ſcarcely could he believe that
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:035729_0483_10065B98A5F698F0"/>
he was indeed the culprit, whoſe crimes and whoſe probable fate he trembled to conſider. But a few weeks had elapſed, ſince he was pure and virtuous, courted by the wiſeſt and nobleſt in Madrid, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by the people with a reverence that approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed idolatry. He now ſaw himſelf ſtained with the moſt loathed and monſtrous ſins, the object of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal execration, a priſoner of the Holy Office, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably doomed to periſh in tortures the moſt ſevere. He could not hope to deceive his judges: the proofs of his guilt were too ſtong. His preſence in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre at ſo late an hour, his confuſion at the diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, the dagger which in his firſt alarm he owned had been concealed by him, and the blood which had ſpirted upon his habit from Antonia's wound, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently marked him out for the aſſaſſin. He waited with agony for the day of examination. He had no reſource to comfort him in his diſtreſs. Religion could not inſpire him with fortitude. If he read the books of morality which were put into his hands, he ſaw in them nothing but the enormity of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. If he attempted to pray, he recollected that he deſerved not Heaven's protection, and believed his crimes ſo monſtrous as to exceed even God's infinite goodneſs. For every other ſinner he thought there might be hope, but for him there could be none. Shuddering at the paſt, anguiſhed by the preſent, and dreading the future, thus paſſed he the few days pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding that which was marked for his trial.</p>
                     <p>That day arrived. At nine in the morning his priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on door was unlocked, and his gaoler entering com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to follow him. He obeyed with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. He was conducted into a ſpacious hall hung
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:035729_0484_10065BD4DCBBC238"/>
with black cloth. At the table ſat three grave ſtern looking men, alſo habited in black: one was the Grand Inquiſitor, whom the importance of this cauſe had induced to examine into it himſelf. At a ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er table at a little diſtance ſat the ſecretary, provided with all neceſſary implements for writing. Ambroſio was beckoned to advance, and take his ſtation at the lower end of the table. As his eye glanced down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he perceived various iron inſtruments lying ſcattered upon the floor. Their forms were unknown to him, but apprehenſion immediately gueſſed them to be engines of torture. He turned pale, and with difficulty prevented himſelf from ſinking upon the ground.</p>
                     <p>Profound ſilence prevailed, except when the inquiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itors whiſpered a few words among themſelves myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriouſly. Near an hour paſſed away, and with every ſecond of it Ambroſio's fears grew more poignant. At length a ſmall door, oppoſite to that by which he had entered the hall, grated heavily upon its hinges. An officer appeared, and was immediately followed by the beautiful Matilda. Her hair hung about her face wildly: her cheeks were pale, and her eyes ſunk and hollow. She threw a melancholy look upon Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſio: he replied by one of averſion and reproach. She was placed oppoſite to him. A bell then ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thrice. It was the ſignal for opening the court; and the inquiſitors entered upon their office.</p>
                     <p>In theſe trials, neither the accuſation is mentioned, nor the name of the accuſer. The priſoners are only aſked, whether they will confeſs. If they reply, that, having no crime, they can make no confeſſion, they are put to the torture without delay. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:035729_0485_100834EE4CA7E610"/>
at intervals, either till the ſuſpected avow themſelves culpable, or the perſeverance of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminants is worn out and exhauſted: but without a direct acknowledgment of their guilt, the Inquiſition never pronounces the final doom of its priſoners. In general, much time is ſuffered to elapſe without their being queſtioned; but Ambroſio's trial had been haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened on account of a ſolemn Auto da Fé which would take place in a few days, and in which the inquiſitors meant this diſtinguiſhed culprit to perform a part, and give a ſtriking teſtimony of their vigilance.</p>
                     <p>The abbot was not merely accuſed of rape and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; the crime of ſorcery was laid to his charge, as well as to Matilda's. She had been ſeized as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice in Antonia's aſſaſſination. On ſearching her cell, various ſuſpicious books and inſtruments were found, which juſtified the accuſation brought againſt her. To criminate the monk, the conſtellated mirror was produced, which Matilda had accidentally left in his chamber. The ſtrange figures engraved upon it caught the attention of Don Ramirez, while ſearching the abbot's cell; in conſequence, he carried it away with him. It was ſhewn to the Grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor, who, having conſidered it for ſome time, took off a ſmall golden croſs which hung at his girdle, and laid it upon the mirror. Inſtantly a loud noiſe was heard reſembling a clap of thunder, and the ſteel ſhivered into a thouſand pieces. This circumſtance confirmed the ſuſpicion of the monk's having dealt in magic. It was even ſuppoſed, that his former influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ds of the people was entirely to be aſcribed to witchcraft.</p>
                     <p>Determined to make him confeſs not only the crimes which he had committed, but thoſe alſo of
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:035729_0486_10065BD664921F20"/>
which he was innocent, the inquiſitors began their examination. Though dreading the tortures, as he yet more dreaded death, which would conſign him to eternal torments, the abbot aſſerted his purity in a voice bold and reſolute. Matilda followed his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but ſpoke with fear and trembling. Having in vain exhorted him to confeſs, the inquiſitors ordered the monk to be put to the queſtion. The decree was immediately executed. Ambroſio ſuffered the moſt excruciating pangs that ever were invented by human cruelty. Yet ſo dreadful is death, when guilt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies it, that he had ſufficient fortitude to perſiſt in his diſavowal. His agonies were redoubled in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; nor was he releaſed till fainting from exceſs of pain, inſenſibility reſcued him from the hands of his tormentors.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was next ordered to the torture; but, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the ſight of the friar's ſufferings, her courage totally deſerted her. She ſunk upon her knees, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged her correſponding with infernal ſpirits, and that ſhe had witneſſed the monk's aſſaſſination of Antonia; but as to the crime of ſorcery, ſhe declared herſelf the ſole criminal, and Ambroſio perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. The latter aſſertion met with no credit. The abbot had recovered his ſenſes in time to hear the confeſſion of his accomplice; but he was too much enfeebled by what he had already undergone, to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable at that time of ſuſtaining new torments. He was commanded back to his cell, but firſt informed, that as ſoon as he had gained ſtrength ſufficient he muſt prepare himſelf for a ſecond examination. The inquiſitors hoped that he would then be leſs hardened and obſtinate. To Matilda it was announced, that
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:035729_0487_10065B9D986D3068"/>
ſhe muſt expiate her crimes in fire on the approaching Auto da Fê. All her tears and entreaties could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure no mitigation of her doom, and ſhe was dragged by force from the hall of trial.</p>
                     <p>Returned to his dungeon, the ſufferings of Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio's body were far more ſupportable than thoſe of his mind. His diſlocated limbs, the nails torn from his hands and feet, and his fingers maſhed and broken by the preſſure of ſcrews, were far ſurpaſſed in anguiſh by the agitation of his ſoul and vehemence of his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. He ſaw that, guilty or innocent, his judges were bent upon condemning him. The remembrance of what his denial had already coſt him, terrified him at the idea of being again applied to the queſtion, and almoſt engaged him to confeſs his crimes. Then again the conſequences of his confeſſion flaſhed before him, and rendered him once more irreſolute. His death would be inevitable, and that a death the moſt dreadful. He had liſtened to Matilda's doom, and doubted not that a ſimilar was reſerved for him. He ſhuddered at the approaching Auto da Fé, at the idea of periſhing in flames, and only eſcaping from endura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torments to paſs into others more ſubtile and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting! With affright did he bend his mind's eye on the ſpace beyond the grave; nor could hide from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf how juſtly he ought to dread Heaven's vengeance. In this labyri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> of terrors, fain would he have taken his refuge in the gloom of atheiſm; fain would he have denied the ſoul's immortality; have perſuaded himſelf that, his eyes once cloſed, they would never more open, and that the ſame moment would anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate his ſoul and body. Even this reſource was refuſed to him. To permit his being blind to the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:035729_0488_10065BD868609410"/>
of this belief, his knowledge was too extenſive, his underſtanding too ſolid and juſt. He could not help feeling the exiſtence of a God. Thoſe truths, once his comfort, now preſented themſelves before him in the cleareſt light; but they only ſerved to drive him to diſtraction. They deſtroyed his ill grounded hopes of eſcaping puniſhment; and, diſpelled by the irreſiſtible brightneſs of truth and conviction, philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy's deceitful vapours faded away like a dream.</p>
                     <p>In anguiſh almoſt too great for mortal frame to bear, he expected the time when he was again to be examined. He buſied himſelf in planning ineffectual ſchemes for eſcaping both preſent and future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Of the firſt there was no poſſibility; of the ſecond deſpair made him neglect the only means. While Reaſon forced him to acknowledge a God's exiſtence, Conſcience made him doubt the infinity of his goodneſs. He diſbelieved that a ſinner like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could find mercy. He had not been deceived into error; ignorance could furniſh him with no excuſe. He had ſeen vice in her true colours. Before he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his crimes, he had computed every ſcruple of their weight, and yet he had committed them.</p>
                     <p>"Pardon?" he would cry in an acceſs of phrenfy: "Oh! there can be none for me!"</p>
                     <p>Perſuaded of this, inſtead of humbling himſelf in penitence, of deploring his guilt, and employing his few remaining hours in deprecating Heaven's wrath, he abandoned himſelf to the tranſports of deſperate rage; he ſorrowed for the puniſhment of his crimes, not their commiſſion; and exhaled his boſom's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in idle ſighs, in vain lamentations, in blaſphemy
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:035729_0489_10065BA0A6925FD8"/>
and deſpair. As the few beams of day which pierced through the bars of his priſon window gradually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, and their place was ſupplied by the pale and glimmering lamp, he felt his terrors redouble, and his ideas become more gloomy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſolemn, more deſpondent. He dreaded the approach of ſleep. No ſooner did his eyes cloſe, wearied with tears and watching, than the dreadful viſions ſeemed to be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed on which his mind had dwelt during the day. He found himſelf in ſulphurous realms and burning caverns, ſurrounded by fiends appointed his torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and who drove him through a variety of tortures, each of which was more dreadful than the former. Amidſt theſe diſmal ſcenes wandered the ghoſts of Elvira and her daughter. They reproached him with their deaths, recounted his crimes to the daemons, and urged them to inflict torments of cruelty yet more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. Such were the pictures which floated before his eyes in ſleep: they vaniſhed not till his repoſe was diſturbed by exceſs of agony. Then would he ſtart from the ground on which he had ſtretched himſelf, his brows running down with cold ſweat, his eyes wild and phrenſied; and he only exchanged the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble certainty for ſurmiſes ſcarcely more ſupportable. He paced his dungeon with diſordered ſteps; he gazed with terror upon the ſurrounding darkneſs, and often did he cry,</p>
                     <p>"Oh! fearful is night to the guilty."</p>
                     <p>The day of his ſecond examination was at hand. He had been compelled to ſwallow cordials, whoſe virtues were calculated to reſtore his bodily ſtrength, and enable him to ſupport the queſtion longer. On the night preceding this dreaded day, his fears for the

morrow permitted him not to ſleep. His terrors were ſo violent as nearly to annihilate his ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The monk ſtarted, and raiſed his melancholy eyes. Matilda ſtood before him. She had quitted her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious habit. She now wore a female dreſs, at once elegant and ſplendid; a profuſion of diamonds blazed upon her robes, and her hair was confined by a coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of roſes. In her right hand ſhe held a ſmall book: a lively expreſſion of pleaſure beamed upon her countenance—but ſtill it was mingled with a wild imperious majeſty, which inſpired the monk with awe, and repreſſed in ſome meaſure his tranſports at ſeeing her.</p>
                     <p>"You here, Matilda!" he at length exclaimed: "How have you gained entrance? Where are your chains? What means this magnificence, and the joy which ſparkles in your eyes? Have our judges relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Is there a chance of my eſcaping? Anſwer me for pity, and tell me what I have to hope or fear."</p>
                     <p>"Ambroſio!" ſhe replied with an air of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dignity: "I have baffled the Inquiſition's fury. I am free: a few moments will place kingdoms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe dungeons and me; yet I purchaſe my liberty at a dear, at a dreadful price! Dare you pay the ſame, Ambroſio?

You are ſilent—You look upon me with eyes of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion and alarm—I read your thoughts, and confeſs their juſtice. Yes, Ambroſio, I have ſacrificed all for life and liberty I am no longer a candidate for Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en!

Let me then exult in my exchange. I have ſold diſtant and uncertain happineſs for preſent and ſecure.

                     <p>She let the book fall upon the ground. A cloud of blue fire wrapped itſelf round her. She waved her hand to Ambroſio, and diſappeared. The momentary glare which the flames poured through the dungeon, on diſſipating ſuddenly, ſeemed to have increaſed its natural gloom. The ſolitary lamp ſcarcely gave light ſufficient to guide the monk to a chair. He threw himſelf into his ſeat, folded his arms, and, leaning his head upon the table, ſunk into reflections perplexing and unconnected.</p>
                     <p>He was ſtill in this attitude, when the opening of the priſon door rouſed him from his ſtupor. He was ſummoned to appear before the Grand Inquiſitor. He roſe and followed his gaoler with painful ſteps. He was led into the ſame hall, placed before the ſame examiners, and was again interrogated whether he would confeſs. He replied as before, that, having no crimes, he could acknowledge none. But when the executioners prepared to put him to the queſtion, when he ſaw the engines of torture, and remembered the pangs which they had already inflicted, his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution failed him entirely. Forgetting the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and only anxious to eſcape the terrors of the preſent moment, he made an ample confeſſion. He diſcloſed every circumſtance of his guilt, and owned not merely the crimes with which he was charged, but thoſe of which he had never been ſuſpected. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interrogated as to Matilda's flight, which had cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated much confuſion; he confeſſed that ſhe had ſold herſelf to Satan, and that ſhe was indebted to ſorcery

for her eſcape. He ſtill aſſured his judges, that for his own part he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> never entered into any compact with the infernal ſpirits; but the threat of being tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured made him declare himſelf to be a ſorcerer and heretic, and whatever other titles the inquiſitors choſe to fix upon him. In conſequence of this avowal, his ſentence was immediately pronounced. He was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to prepare himſelf to periſh in the Auto da Fé, which was to be ſolemnized at twelve o'clock that night. This hour was choſen, from the idea, that, the horror of the flames being heightened by the gloom of midnight, the execution would have a greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the mind of the people.</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio, rather dead than alive, was left alone in his dungeon. The moment in which this terrible decree was pronounced, had nearly proved that of his diſſolution. He looked forward to the morrow with deſpair, and his terrors increaſed with the approach of midnight. Sometimes he was buried in gloomy ſilence; at others, he raved with delirious paſſion, wrung his hands, and curſed the hour when he firſt beheld the light. In one of theſe moments his eye reſted upon Matilda's myſterious gift. His tranſports of rage were inſtantly ſuſpended. He looked earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the book, he took it up, but immediately threw it from him with horror. He walked rapidly up and down his dungeon—then ſtopped, and again fixed his eyes on the ſpot where the book had fallen. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, that here at leaſt was a reſource from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ate which he dreaded. He ſtooped, and took it up a ſecond time. He remained for ſome time trembling and irreſolute; he longed to try the charm, yet fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its conſequences. The recollection of his ſentence
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:035729_0496_10065BF21AA61520"/>
at length fixed his indeciſion. He opened the volume; but his agitation was ſo great, that he at firſt ſought in vain for the page mentioned by Matilda. Aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of himſelf, he called all his courage to his aid. He turned to the ſeventh leaf: he began to read it aloud; but his eyes frequently wondered from the book, while he anxiouſly caſt them round in ſearch of the ſpirit, whom he wiſhed, yet dreaded, to behold. Still he perſiſted in his deſign; and with a voice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſured, and frequent interruptions, he contrived to finiſh the four firſt lines of the page.</p>
                     <p>They were in a language whoſe import was totally unknown to him. Scarce had he pronounced the laſt word, when the effects of the charm were evident. A loud burſt of thunder was heard, the priſon ſhook to its very foundations, a blaze of lightning flaſhed through the cell, and in the next moment, borne upon ſulphurous whirlwinds, Lucifer ſtood before him a ſecond time. But he came not as when at Matilda's ſummons he borrowed the ſeraph's form to deceive Ambroſio. He appeared in all that uglineſs which ſince his fall from heaven had been his portion. His blaſted limbs ſtill bore marks of the Almighty's thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. A ſwarthy darkneſs ſpread itſelf over his gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic form: his hands and feet were armed with long talons. Fury glared in his eyes, which might have ſtruck the braveſt heart with terror. Over his huge ſhoulders waved two enormous ſable wings; and his hair was ſupplied by living ſnakes, which twined themſelves round his brows with frightful hiſſings. In one hand he held a roll of parchment, and in the other an iron pen. Still the lightning flaſhed around him, and the thunder with repeated burſts ſeemed to announce the diſſolution of Nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="242" facs="unknown:035729_0497_10065BEBA1DD8288"/>
Terrified at an apparition ſo different from what he had expected, Ambroſio remained gazing upon the fiend, deprived of the power of utterance. The thunder had ceaſed to roll: univerſal ſilence reigned through the dungeon.</p>
                     <p>"For what am I ſummoned hither?" ſaid the dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in a voice which <hi>ſulphurous fogs had damped to hoarſeneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the ſound Nature ſeemed to tremble. A violent earthquake rocked the ground, accompanied by a freſh burſt of thunder, louder and more appalling than the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio was long unable to anſwer the daemon's demand.</p>
                     <p>"I am condemned to die," he ſaid with a faint voice, his blood running cold while he gazed upon his dreadful viſitor. "Save me! bear me from hence!"</p>
                     <p>"Shall the reward of my ſervices be paid me? Dare you embrace my cauſe? Will you be mine, body and ſoul? Are you prepared to renounce him who made you, and him who died for you? Anſwer but 'Yes!' and Lucifer is your ſlave."</p>
                     <p>"Will no leſs price content you? Can nothing ſatisfy you but my eternal ruin? Spirit, you aſk too much. Yet convey me from this dungeon. Be my ſervant for one hour, and I will be yours for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years. Will not this offer ſuffice?"</p>
                     <p>" It will not. I muſt have your ſoul: muſt have it mine, and mine for eve."</p>
                     <p>"Inſatiate daemon! I will not doom myſelf to endleſs torments. I will not give up my hopes of being one day pardoned."</p>

"You will not? On what chimaera reſt then your hopes? Short ſighted mortal! Miſerable wretch! Are you not guilty? Are you not infamous in the eyes of men and angels?

indeciſion. He deſcribed the agonies of death in the moſt terrific colours; and he worked ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully upon Ambroſio's deſpair and fears, that he prevailed upon him to receive the parchment. He then ſtruck the iron pen which he held into a vein of the monk's left hand. It pierced deep, and was inſtantly filled with blood: yet Ambroſio felt no pain from the wound. The pen was put into his hand: it trembled. The wretch placed the parchment on the table before him, and prepared to ſign it. Suddenly he held his hand: he ſtarted away haſtily, and threw the pen upon the table.</p>
                     <p>"What am I doing?" he cried. Then turning to the fiend with a deſperate air, "Leave me! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone! I will not ſign the parchment"</p>

enemy: but as the hour of puniſhment drew near, his former terrors revived in his heart. Their momentary repoſe ſeemed to have given them freſh vigour. The nearer that the time approached, the more did he dread appearing before the throne of God. He ſhuddered to think how ſoon he muſt be plunged into eternity—how ſoon meet the eyes of his Creator, whom he had ſo grievouſly offended. The bell an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced midnight. It was the ſignal for being led to the ſtake. As he liſtened to the firſt ſtroke, the blood ceaſed to circulate in the abbot's veins. He heard death and torture murmured in each ſucceeding ſound. He expected to ſee the archers entering his priſon; and as the bell forbore to toll, he ſeized the magic volume in a fit of deſpair. He opened it, turned haſtily to the ſeventh page, and, as if fearing to allow himſelf a moment's thought, ran over the fatal lines with rapidity. Accompanied by his former terrors, Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer again ſtood before the trembler.</p>
                     <p>"You have ſummoned me," ſaid the fiend. "Are you determined to be wiſe? Will you accept my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions? You know them already. Renounce your claim to ſalvation, make over to me your ſoul, and I bear you from this dungeon inſtantly. Yet is it time. Reſolve, or it will be too late. Will you ſign the parchment?"</p>

                     <p>"Sign the parchment," replied the daemon in an exulting tone.</p>
                     <p>The contract and the bloody pen ſtill lay upon the table. Ambroſio drew near it. He prepared to ſign his name. A moment's reflection made him heſitate.</p>
                     <p>

"Hark!" cried the tempter: "they come. Be quick. Sign the parchment, and I bear you from hence this moment."</p>
                     <p>In effect, the archers were heard approaching, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to lead Ambroſio to the ſtake. The ſound en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the monk in his reſolution.</p>
                     <p>"What is the import of this writing?" ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>"It makes your ſoul over to me for ever, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve."</p>
                     <p>"What am I to receive in exchange?"</p>
                     <p>"My protection, and releaſe from this dungeon. Sign it, and this inſtant I bear you away."</p>
                     <p>Ambroſio took up the pen. He ſet it to the parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Again his courage failed him. He felt a pang of terror at his heart, and once more threw the pen upon the table.</p>

                     <p>The laſt chain fell from the door of the priſon. The key was heard turning in the lock. Already the iron door grated heavily upon its ruſty hinges—</p>
                     <p>"I am yours for ever, and irrevocably!" cried the monk wild with terror: "I abandon all claim to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I own no power but yours. Hark! hark! they come! Oh ſave me! bear me away!"</p>
                     <p>"I have triumphed! You are mine paſt reprieve, and I fufil my promiſe."</p>
                     <p>While he ſpoke, the door uncloſed. Inſtantly the daemon graſped one of Ambroſio's arms, ſpread his broad pinions, and ſprang with him into the air. The roof opened as they ſoared upwards, and cloſed again when they had quitted the dungeon.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, the gaoler was thrown into the utmoſt ſurpriſe by the diſappearance of his priſoner. Though neither he nor the archers were in time to witneſs the monk's eſcape, a ſulphurous ſmell prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the priſon ſufficiently informed them by whoſe aid he had been liberated. They haſtened to make their report to the Grand Inquiſitor. The ſtory how a ſorcerer had been carried away by the devil, was ſoon noiſed about Madrid; and for ſome days the whole city was employed in diſcuſſing the ſubject. Gradually it ceaſed to be the topic of converſation. Other adventures aroſe whoſe novelty engaged univerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al attention; and Ambroſio was ſoon forgotten as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:035729_0503_10065BF3A0F3B6F8"/>
as if he never had exiſted. While this was paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the monk, ſupported by his infernal guide, trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erſed the air with the rapidity of an arrow; and a few moments placed him upon a precipice's brink, the ſteepeſt in Sierra Morena.</p>
                     <p>Though reſcued from the Inquiſition, Ambroſio as yet was inſenſible of the bleſſings of liberty. The damning contract weighed heavy upon his mind; and the ſcenes in which he had been a principal actor had left behind them ſuch impreſſions as rendered his heart the ſeat of anarchy and confuſion. The objects now before his eyes, and which the full moon ſailing through clouds permitted him to examine, were ill cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to inſpire that calm, of which he ſtood ſo much in need. The diſorder of his imagination was increaſed by the wildneſs of the ſurrounding ſcenery; by the gloomy caverns and ſteep rocks, riſing above each other, and dividing the paſſing clouds; ſolitary cluſters of trees ſcattered here and there, among whoſe thick twined branches the wind of night ſighed hoarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and mournfully; the ſhrill cry of mountain eagles, who had built their neſts among theſe lonely deſerts; the ſtunning roar of torrents, as ſwelled by late rains they ruſhed violently down tremendous precipices: and the dark waters of a ſilent ſluggiſh ſtream which faintly reflected the moon's beams, and bathed the rock's baſe on which Ambroſio ſtood. The abbot caſt round him a look of terror. His infernal conductor was ſtill by his ſide, and eyed him with a look of mingled malice, exultation and contempt.</p>
                     <p>"Whither have you brought me?" ſaid the monk at length in an hollow trembling voice: "Why am I placed in this melancholy ſcene? Bear me from it quickly! Carry me to Matilda!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="249" facs="unknown:035729_0504_10065BE3F7EACDD8"/>
The fiend replied not, but continued to gaze upon him in ſilence. Ambroſio could not ſuſtain his glance; he turned away his eyes, while thus ſpoke the daemon:</p>
                     <p>"I have him then in my power! This model of piety! this being without reproach! this mortal who placed his puny virtues on a level with thoſe of angels. He is mine! irrevocably, eternally mine! Compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of my ſufferings! denizens of hell! How grateful will be my preſent!"</p>
                     <p>He pauſed, then addreſſed himſelf to the monk—</p>
                     <p>"Bear you to Matilda?" he continued, repeating Ambroſio's words: "Wretch! you ſhall ſoon be with her! You well deſerve a place near her, for hell boaſts no miſcreant more guilty than yourſelf. Hark, Ambroſio, while I unveil your crimes! You have ſhed the blood of two innocents; Antonia and Elvira periſhed by your hand. That Antonia whom you violated, was your ſiſter! that Elvira whom you mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, gave you birth! Tremble, abandoned hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite! inhuman parricide! inceſtuous raviſher! trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the extent of your offences! And you it was who thought yourſelf proof againſt temptation, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from human frailties, and free from error and vice! Is pride then a virtue? Is inhumanity no fault? Know, vain man! that I long have marked you for my prey; I watched the movements of your heart; I ſaw that you were virtuous from vanity, not principle, and I ſeized the fit moment of ſeduction. I obſerved your blind idolatry of the Madona's picture. I bade a ſubordinate but crafty ſpirit aſſume a ſimilar form, and you eagerly yielded to the blandiſhments of Matilda, Your pride was gratified by her flattery;
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:035729_0505_10065BF54DF08310"/>
your paſſions only needed an opportunity to break forth; you ran into the ſnare blindly, and ſcrupled not to commit a crime, which you blamed in another with unfeeling ſeverity. It was I who threw Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda in your way; it was I who gave you entrance to Antonia's chamber; and it was I who cauſed the dagger to be given you which pierced your ſiſter's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom! Hear, hear, Ambroſio! <hi>Had you reſiſted me one minute longer, you had ſaved your body and ſoul. The guards whom you heard at your priſon door, came to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify your pardon.</hi> But I had already triumphed: my plots had already ſucceeded. Scarcely could I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe crimes ſo quick as you performed them. You are mine, and Heaven itſelf cannot reſcue you from my power. Hope not that your penitence will make void our contract. Here is your bond ſigned with your blood; you have given up your claim to mercy, and nothing can reſtore you to the rights which you have fooliſhly reſigned. Believe you that your ſecret thoughts eſcaped me? No, no, I read them all! You truſted that you ſhould ſtill have time for repentance. I ſaw your artifice, knew its falſity, and rejoiced in deceiving the deceiver! You are mine beyond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve: I burn to poſſeſs my right, and alive you quit not theſe mountains."</p>
                     <p>During the daemon's ſpeech, Ambroſio had been ſtupified by terror and ſurpriſe. This laſt declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rouſed him.</p>
                     <p>"Not quit theſe mountains alive?" he exclaimed: "Perfidious, what mean you? Have you forgotten our contract?"</p>
                     <p>The fiend anſwered by a malicious laugh:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="251" facs="unknown:035729_0506_10065BE890777058"/>
"Our contract? Have I not performed my part? What more did I promiſe than to ſave you from your priſon? Have I not done ſo? Are you not ſafe from the Inquiſition—ſafe from all but from me? Fool that you were to confide yourſelf to a devil! Why did you not ſtipulate for life, and power, and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure? Then all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ould have been granted: now your reflections come too late. Miſcreant, prepare for death; you have not many hours to live!"</p>
                     <p>On hearing this ſentence, dreadful were the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the devoted wretch! He ſunk upon his knees, and raiſed his hands towards heaven. The fiend read his intention and prevented it—</p>
                     <p>"What?" he cried, darting at him a look of fury: "Dare you ſtill implore the Eternal's mercy? Would you feign penitence, and again act an hypocrite's part? Villain, reſign your hopes of pardon. Thus I ſecure my prey!"</p>
                     <p>As he ſaid this, darting his talons into the monk's ſhaven crown, he ſprang with him from the rock. The caves and mountains rang with Ambroſio's ſhrieks. The daemon continued to ſoar aloft, till, reaching a dreadful height, he releaſed the ſufferer. Headlong fell the monk through the airy waſte; the ſharp point of a rock received him; and he rolled from preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice to precipice, till, bruiſed and mangled, he reſted on the river's banks Inſtantly a violent ſtorm aroſe: the winds in fury <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

with them into the river the corſe of the deſpairing monk.</p>
                     <p>Haughty Lady, why ſhrunk you back when yon poor frail one drew near? Was the air infected by her errors? Was your purity ſoiled by her paſſing breath? Ah! Lady, ſmooth that inſulting brow: ſtifle the reproach juſt burſting from your ſcornful lip: wound not a ſoul that bleeds already! She has ſuffered, ſuffers ſtill. Her air is gay, but her heart is broken; her dreſs ſparkles, but her boſom groans.</p>
                     <p>Lady, to look with mercy on the conduct of others, is a virtue no leſs than to look with ſeverity on your own.</p>
