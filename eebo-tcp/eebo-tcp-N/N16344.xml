            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If theſe deſigns be anſwered, the writer obtains his end; and if not, he has the teſtimony of his own conſcience to the uprightneſs of his intentions.</p>

                  </q>—Our miniſtring brethren of the Tabernacle have ſometimes taken the liberty of making reflections upon us, as if our opinion relating to baptiſm greatly intrenched on the offices and honour of Jeſus Chriſt. Had they met with language and ſentiments like theſe in any of <hi>our</hi> publications, eſpecially in thoſe of the late Dr. <hi>Gill;</hi> they would, undoubtedly, have thought themſelves fully warranted in uſing their utmoſt efforts to expoſe the dangerous error, and to guard their hearers againſt us, as making <hi>a ſaviour</hi> of baptiſm. But while <hi>ſome</hi> of them, being Conformiſts, have ſolemnly profeſſed their cordial conſent to the various articles contained in the book of Common Prayer and adminiſtration of the ſacraments, and while they <hi>all</hi> unite in revering the character of the late Mr. <hi>Whitefield;</hi> they could not be either candid or conſiſtent in condemning us, were we really chargeable with repreſenting baptiſm as neceſſary to ſalvation. What, then, muſt we think of their conduct, when there is no proof, nor the leaſt ſhadow of proof, that we have ever done any ſuch thing?—As I have a ſincere and high regard for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who preach the goſpel and unite in public worſhip at the Tabernacle, and as it is my earneſt prayer that a divine bleſſing may attend them; ſo it would give me real pleaſure to find, that they who fill the pulpit in that place, are more cautious in cenſuring the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and more conſiſtent with their <hi>loud profeſſions</hi> of candour and a catholic ſpirit; leſt, through a miſtake, they be ſtill culpable of bearing falſe witneſs againſt their brethren.</p>

Yet, on Mr Weſley's principles, it muſt be ſo, if the generality of thoſe that have died, ſince baptiſm was inſtituted, be not excluded the kingdom of heaven. For he who conſiders what multitudes of Jews and Heathens have peopled the earth, ever ſince the Chriſtian diſpenſation commenced; what an extenſive ſpread Mahomet's impoſture has had for more than eleven hundred years; and what numbers of infants die without baptiſm, even in Chriſtian countries, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conclude, even admitting Paedobaptiſm to have been practiſed by the apoſtles, that a vaſt majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of deceaſed infants have left the world without being baptized.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Weſley, it is well known, is a very warm defender of general redemption.

               <p>Nor are we conſcious of attributing any degree of importance to Baptiſm, which our Paedobaptiſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting brethren do not allow, and for which they do not plead. Do we conſider it as a divine appointment, as an inſtitution of Chriſt, the adminiſtration and uſe of which are to continue to the end of the world? So do they. Do they conſider it as an ordinance which, when once rightly adminiſtred to a proper ſubject, is never to be repeated? So do we. Do we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as indiſpenſably neceſſary to communion at the Lord's table? So do they. Do we actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe communion to ſuch whom we conſider as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized? So do they. No man, I preſume, if conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by them as not baptized, would be admitted to break bread at the Lord's table, in any of their churches; however amiable his character, or how much ſoever they might eſteem him in other reſpects.</p>

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>the church had not commanded, nor any way autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized, his miniſtering ſervants to require a profeſſion of faith <hi>prior</hi> to baptiſm; and were they equally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the ordinance never was adminiſtered by the apoſtles to any but <hi>infants,</hi> nor in any other way than that of <hi>aſperſion,</hi> or <hi>pouring;</hi> would they not look upon the <hi>immerſion of profeſſing believers</hi> as a quite different thing from baptiſm? And, were this the caſe, would they not conſider us as unbaptized, and refuſe to have communion with us on that account? I am perſuaded they would, notwithſtanding their affection for any of us, as believers in Jeſus Chriſt. Conſequently, if we <hi>be</hi> really culpable in the eyes of our brethren, it is for <hi>denying the validity</hi> of infant baptiſm; not becauſe we <hi>refuſe communion</hi> to Paedobaptiſts—for an error in our <hi>judgment,</hi> which miſleads the conſcience; not for perverſeneſs of <hi>temper,</hi> or a want of <hi>love</hi> to the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Nor was the Lord's ſupper appointed to be <hi>a teſt</hi> of brotherly love among the people of God; though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral objections that are made againſt us, ſeem to proceed on that ſuppoſition. It muſt, indeed, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that as it is a ſacred feaſt and an ordinance of divine worſhip, mutual Chriſtian affection, among communicants at the ſame table, is very becoming and highly neceſſary; and ſo it is in all other branches of ſocial religion. But that ſitting down at the holy ſupper ſhould be conſidered as <hi>the criterion</hi> of my love to individuals, or to any Chriſtian community, does not appear from the word of God. No, the ſupper of our Lord was deſigned for other and greater pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. It was intended to teach and exhibit the moſt intereſting of all truths, and the moſt wonderful of all tranſactions. The deſign of the Great Inſtitutor
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020976_0023_0FB207A0EEAAE258"/>was, that it ſhould be a memorial of God's <hi>love to us,</hi> and of <hi>Immanuel's death for us: that,</hi> the moſt aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favour ever diſplayed; <hi>this,</hi> the moſt ſtupendous fact that angels ever beheld. Yes, the love of God, in giving his dear, his only Son; and the death of Chriſt, as our divine ſubſtitute and propitiatory ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, are the grand objects we are called to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate at the Lord's table.—As to a <hi>proof,</hi> a <hi>ſubſtantial proof</hi> of our love to the children of God, it is not given at ſo cheap and eaſy a rate, as that of ſitting down with them, either accaſionally or ſtatedly, at the holy table. Numbers do that, who are very far from loving the diſciples of Chriſt, for the truth's ſake. To give real evidence of that heavenly affection, there muſt be the exerciſe of ſuch tempers, and the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſuch actions, as require much ſelf-denial; and without which, were we to commune with them ever ſo often, or talk ever ſo loudly of candour and a catholic ſpirit;—we ſhould, after all, be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of that <hi>charity,</hi> without which we are <hi>"nothing".</hi> The reader, therefore, will do well to remember, that the <hi>true teſt</hi> of his love to the diſciples of Chriſt, is, not a ſubmiſſion to any particular ordinance of public worſhip; for that is rather an evidence of his love to God and reverence for his authority; but ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing with them in their afflictions; feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and taking pleaſure in doing them good, whatever their neceſſities may be. For this I have the authority of our final Judge, who will ſay o his people; <q>Come, ye bleſſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for</q>—what? Ye have manifeſted your love to the ſaints and your faith in me, by holding free communion at my table with believers of all denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? No ſuch thing.

On the contrary, do they not profeſs a warm eſteem and affection for all thoſe of whatever communion, who love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and aim to promote his cauſe in the world? and do they not give proof of this, by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a friendly correſpondence with them as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities offer; and by cordially joining them in oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional exerciſes of public worſhip? It is not the diſtinguiſhing tenet of Baptiſm, how much ſoever they wiſh it to prevail, that is the main band that knits them in affection to one another: it is the infinitely nobler conſideration of the relation they ſtand in to Chriſt as his diſciples.

The deſign of the following pages, therefore, is to ſhew, That we cannot receive Paedobaptiſts into communion at the Lord's table, without doing violence to our profeſſed ſentiments, as Baptiſts; and to anſwer the principal objections which theſe our brethren have ſtarted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.

               <p>This appears from hence. That only is baptiſm which Chriſt appointed as ſuch. That, therefore, which eſſentially differs from what he appointed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be baptiſm. But they believe, as well as we, that Paedobaptiſm, as now practiſed, eſſentially differs
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:020976_0034_0FB207C07B5842C0"/>from the appointment of Chriſt, both as to mode and ſubject: yet a mode of adminiſtration, and a ſubject to whom it ſhould be adminiſtered, are neceſſary to the exiſtence of baptiſm, as an ordinance of Chriſt; for without theſe it is only an abſtract notion.

               <p>This, then, is a fact, a notorious, undeniable fact, that our brethren practically deny the neceſſity of baptiſm in order to communion at the ſacred ſupper: for they do not, they cannot believe the aſperſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be Chriſtian baptiſm, without rendering themſelves obnoxious to the charge of <hi>Anabaptiſm.</hi> A ſentiment ſo peculiar, and a conduct ſo uncommon as theirs are, in regard to this inſtitution, require to be well ſupported by the teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt. For were all the Chriſtian churches now in

                     <hi>We have no ſuch cuſtom, neither the churches of God</hi>
                  </q> that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. Yes, conſidering the <hi>novelty</hi> of their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conduct, and what a <hi>contradiction</hi> they are to the faith and order of the whole Chriſtian church; —conſidering that it never was diſputed, ſo far as I can learn, prior to the ſixteenth century, by ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox or heterodox, by Papiſts or Proteſtants, whether <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized</hi> believers ſhould be admitted to the Lord's table; they all agreeing in the contrary practice, however much they differed in matters of equal importance; it may be reaſonably expected, and is by us juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that the, truth of their ſentiment, and the rectitude of their conduct, ſhould be <hi>proved, really proved</hi> from the records of inſpiration.

Our perſuaſion, therefore, concerning the neceſſity of baptiſm as a term of communion, having had the ſanction of univerſal belief and univerſal prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for almoſt ſixteen hundred years, it lies on our brethren to prove that it is falſe and unſcriptural; and to ſhew, from the New Teſtament, that theirs has the ſtamp of divine authority.</p>

But is it not ſtrange, ſtrange to aſtoniſhment, if the ſcriptures contain their ſentiment, and vindicate their conduct, that it never was diſcovered by any who acknowledged the proper Deity, the eternal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and the complete ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, till the latter end of the laſt century? ſeeing, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then, almoſt every principle of the Chriſtian faith, almoſt every branch of Chriſtian worſhip, had been the ſubject, either of learned, or unlearned contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, among ſuch as thought themſelves the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Jeſus Chriſt. The Quakers aroſe, it is well known, about the time when this new ſentiment was firſt adopted in England; and they entirely renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced baptiſm, as well as the Lord's ſupper. But, ſo far as appears, the people of that denomination never ſuppoſed, that they who thought it their duty to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the ſacred ſupper, were at liberty to do it <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> they were baptized.—Here I cannot but remark, with how little affection and reverence the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inſtitutions and the authority of Chriſt were treated, in this iſland, in the laſt century. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious author of the <hi>Pilgrim's Progreſs</hi> was one of the firſt, in this kingdom, who dared to aſſert, that the want of baptiſm <hi>is no bar to communion,</hi> and acted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. The Quakers ariſing a little before him, proceeded a ſtep further, and entirely caſhiered both baptiſm and the Supper of our Lord; looking upon them, as <hi>low, carnal, temporary</hi> appointments. Much reſpect, I allow, is due to the character of <hi>Bunyan.</hi> He was an eminent ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffered in his Maſter's cauſe. Many of his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have been greatly uſeful to the church of God, and ſome of them, it is probable, will tranſmit his name, with honour, to future ages. But yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:020976_0037_0FB207C696300DC0"/>perſuade myſelf, that either his judgment or pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty appeared in this bold innovation. The diſciples of <hi>George Fox,</hi> though leſs conformable to the word of God, acted more conſiſtently with their own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, than did the juſtly celebrated <hi>Dreamer</hi> then, or our brethren who practiſe free communion now.</p>
               <p>But I forgot myſelf. The laſt century was the <hi>grand aera</hi> of improvement in this nation; of prodigious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in light and liberty. <hi>In light;</hi> as well divine, as philoſophical. In <hi>real</hi> philoſophical ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by the labours of a <hi>Bacon,</hi> a <hi>Boyle,</hi> and a <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> In <hi>pretended</hi> theological knowledge, by thoſe of a <hi>Jeſſey</hi> and a <hi>Bunyan.</hi> Did the <hi>former,</hi> by deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches into the ſyſtem of nature, ſurpriſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the world by diſcoveries, of which mankind had never before conceived? The <hi>latter,</hi> penetrating into the goſpel ſyſtem, amuſed mankind, by caſting new light on the poſitive inſtitutions of Jeſus Chriſt, and by placing baptiſm among things of little impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Chriſtian religion; of which no ancient theologue had ever dreamed—none, we have reaſon to think, that loved the Lord Redeemer. <hi>In liberty;</hi> not leſs religious than civil; in the church as well as the ſtate. Did the ſtruggles of real patriotiſm, and the abdication of a Popiſh Prince, make way for true liberty in the <hi>latter?</hi> The repealing of Chriſt's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive laws by <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Barclay,</hi> and the practical claim of a diſpenſing power by <hi>Jeſſey</hi> and <hi>Bunyan,</hi> made way for the <hi>inglorious</hi> liberty of treating poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inſtitutions in the houſe of God juſt as profeſſors pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Some of the Popiſh miſſionaries among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians have been charged, by reſpectable authorities, with concealing the doctrine of <hi>the croſs</hi> from their

As if being baptized, and converſion to Jeſus Chriſt, were one and the ſame thing! What a deſtructive deluſion this! What an impious exaltation of a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inſtitution, into the place of redeeming blood, and the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit!—But were one of our miniſtering brethren, who plead for free communion, to be ſent as a miſſionary into thoſe parts of the world; he, I preſume, would not be in the leaſt danger of thus over-rating baptiſm, and of depreciating its great inſtitutor. No; he would bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preach a <hi>crucified</hi> and riſen Jeſus, as the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of hope for his hearers; and, if the energy of God attended his labours with conſiderable ſucceſs, he would think it his duty to lay before ſuch as believed in Chriſt, what he had learned from the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, relating to a goſpel church—its nature and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, its privileges, duties, and great utility. In doing of which, he could hardly forbear to mention <hi>baptiſm,</hi> as an appointment of his divine Maſter: but though he might <hi>mention</hi> it, yet, on his hypotheſis, he could not <hi>require</hi> a ſubmiſſion to it, as previouſly neceſſary to their incorporating as a church, and their having communion together at the Lord's table. He might, indeed, <hi>recommend</hi> it to his young converts, as having ſomething agreeable in it; but if they did not ſee its propriety; or if, on any other account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him, they did not chooſe to comply, and yet were deſirous of being formed into a church ſtate,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:020976_0039_0FB207CA6F123F48"/>and of having communion at the Lord's table; he could not refuſe, though not one of them was, or would be baptized. For if it be lawful to admit <hi>the</hi> believer to communion, purely <hi>as a believer,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out baptiſm; it cannot be criminal to admit <hi>all</hi> ſuch, if they deſire it: that which is proper and right for <hi>one,</hi> being ſo to <hi>a million,</hi> if they be in the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Thus he would gather a church in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect contraſt with thoſe formed by his fellow miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries. For, while they put baptiſm in the place of the Saviour, he would reject his command, and lay the ordinance entirely aſide: they make it <hi>all</hi> and he make it <hi>nothing.</hi>—And were a narrative of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to fall into the hands of a Paedobaptiſt, who had never heard of any that practiſed, or pleaded, for free communion, what a ſingular figure it would make in his view! <q>A miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, he would ſay, gathering a church among the Indians, and adminiſtering the ſacred ſupper, yet all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants <hi>unbaptized!</hi> Strange, indeed!—A Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian miniſter, called a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> entirely omitting that <hi>very ordinance</hi> from which he takes his denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! This is ſtranger ſtill! For the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> of all men, are ſaid to love <hi>water</hi> and to be fond of <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi> It exceeds the bounds of credibility: but, if it be a fact, he is the oddeſt mortal and the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Baptiſt that ever lived. For he does violence to his own diſtinguiſhing ſentiment, and is guilty of <hi>Felo de ſe.</hi> Like Job's leviathan, he has not his equal on earth: an unheard-of phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non in the religious world, and will probably be the wonder of ages yet unborn. But the ambiguity of his character is ſuch, that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That baptiſm was an ordinance of God, that ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to it was required, and that it was adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to multitudes, before the ſacred ſupper was heard of, or had an exiſtence, are undeniable facts. There never was a time, ſince the miniſtry of our Lord's forerunner commenced, in which it was not the duty of repenting and believing ſinners to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. The venerable <hi>John,</hi> the twelve <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Son of God</hi> incarnate, all united in recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptiſm, at a time when it would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious to have eaten bread and drank wine as an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of divine worſhip. Baptiſm, therefore, had the <hi>priority,</hi> in point of inſtitution; which is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive evidence that it has, and ever will have, a <hi>prior claim</hi> on our obedience.—So, under the ancient economy, <hi>ſacrifices</hi> and <hi>circumciſion</hi> were appointed and practiſed in the patriarchal ages; in the time of Moſes, the <hi>paſchal feaſt</hi> and <hi>burning incenſe</hi> in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place, were appointed by the God of Iſrael.

Let us now conſider the order of <hi>words,</hi> in that commiſſion which was given to the ambaſſadors of Chriſt. He who is king in Zion, when aſſerting the plenitude of his legiſlative authority, and giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to his miniſtering ſervants, with great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity ſays; <q>
                     <hi>All power</hi> is given to me in heaven and earth. Go ye, therefore, and teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>baptizing</hi> them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: teaching them to <hi>obſerve all things whatſoever I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxviii. 18, 19, 20.</note>
                  </q> Such is the high commiſſion, and ſuch the expreſs command, of Him who is <hi>Lord of all,</hi> when addreſſing thoſe that were called to preach his word, and adminiſter his inſtitutions.—Here, it is manifeſt, the commiſſion and command are, firſt of all <hi>to teach:</hi> then—what? To <hi>baptize?</hi> or to <hi>adminiſter the Lord's ſupper?</hi> I leave common ſenſe to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. And, being perſuaded ſhe will give her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict in my favour, I will venture to add; A limited commiſſion includes a <hi>prohibition</hi> of ſuch things as are not contained in it; and poſitive laws imply their <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</hi> For inſtance: When God commanded Abram to circumciſe all his <hi>males,</hi> he readily concluded, that neither circumciſion, nor any rite of a ſimilar nature, was to be adminiſtered to his <hi>females.</hi> And, as our brethren themſelves maintain, when Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that <hi>believers</hi> ſhould be baptized, without mentioning any others; he tacitly prohibited that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance from being adminiſtered to <hi>infants:</hi> ſo, by parity of reaſon, if the ſame ſovereign Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that believers ſhould be baptized—baptized
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:020976_0043_0FB207D62EEFC328"/>
                  <hi>immediately</hi> after they have made a profeſſion of faith; then he muſt intend, that the adminiſtration of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ſhould be <hi>prior</hi> to a reception of the Lord's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: and, conſequently, tacitly <hi>prohibits</hi> every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized perſon having communion at his table.</p>
               <p>The order of adminiſtration in the <hi>primitive</hi> and <hi>apoſtolic practice,</hi> now demands our notice. That the apoſtles, when endued with power from on high, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood our Lord in the ſenſe for which we plead, and practiſed accordingly, is quite evident. For thus it is written; <q>Then they that gladly received his word were" what? admitted to the Lord's table? No; but <hi>baptized.</hi> And the ſame day there were added unto them about three thouſand ſouls. And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtedfaſtly in the apoſtle's doctrine and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in breaking of bread and in prayer.<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts ii. 41, 42.</note>
                  </q>— Now, in regard to the members of this firſt Chriſtian church, either our opponents conclude that they were all baptized, or they do not. If the latter, whence is their concluſion drawn? Not from the ſacred hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's narrative. For thence we learn, that they whoſe hearts were penetrated by keen convictions, were <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted</hi> to be baptized—that they who gladly received the truth were <hi>actually</hi> baptized—and that they who were baptized, and they only, for any thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the contrary, were <hi>added</hi> to the church. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore, our brethren muſt, in this caſe, infer without premiſes and conclude without evidence; or they muſt have recourſe to ſome divine declaration, not contained in this context. But, in what book, in what chapter, in what verſe is any declaration
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:020976_0044_0FB207D79EDDDB00"/>found, relating to this church at Jeruſalem, that can warrant ſuch a concluſion?—If, on the other hand, our brethren allow, that all the members of this truly apoſtolic church were baptized; then, either they conſider the conſtitution of it, in that reſpect, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of the mind of Chriſt, and as a model for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding churches, or they do not. If the former, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jeſus Chriſt diſcovered ſome defect in that plan of proceeding, and, in certain caſes, countermanded his firſt order, or the conduct of our brethren muſt be wrong; they admitting perſons to communion, who; on their own principles, are not baptized. But if they do not look upon this apoſtolic precedent, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs;ive of the mind of Chriſt, and as a pattern for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture imitation to the end of the world; they muſt conſider the apoſtles, either as ignorant of our Lord's will, or as unfaithful in the performance of it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences theſe, which cannot be admitted, without <q>greatly prejudicing the honour and intereſt of true religion, and not a little contributing to the cauſe of infidelity:</q> for which reaſon they will, no doubt, be abhorred by all our brethren.</p>
               <p>Again: It is manifeſt from that firſt and moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic hiſtory of the primitive Chriſtian church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Acts of the apoſtles; that after ſinners had received the truth and believed in Jeſus Chriſt, they were exhorted and commanded, by unerring teachers, to be baptized without delay. For thus we read; <q>Repent and <hi>be baptized</hi> every one of you— When they believed Philip, preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were <hi>baptized,</hi> both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men—And Philip ſaid, If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayeſt. And he anſwered and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:020976_0045_0FB207DE9948F620"/>ſaid, I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God. And he commanded the chariot to ſtand ſtill: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he <hi>baptized</hi> him—And was <hi>baptized,</hi> he and all his ſtraightway—Many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed, and were <hi>baptized</hi> —And now, why tarrieſt thou? <hi>Ariſe and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi>—Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghoſt, as well as we? And he <hi>commanded</hi> them to be <hi>baptized</hi> in the name of the Lord.<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts ii. 38. viii. 12, 37. xvi. 33. xviii. 8. xxii. 16, x. 47.</note>
                  </q>—Hence it is abundantly evident, that baptiſm, in thoſe days, was far from being eſteemed an indifferent thing; and equally far from being deferred, till the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian converts had enjoyed communion at the Lord's table for months and years. Yes, it appears with the brighteſt evidence, that a ſubmiſſion to baptiſm was the <hi>firſt,</hi> the very <hi>firſt</hi> public act of obedience, to which both Jews and Gentiles were called, after they believed in Jeſus Chriſt. And it is equally clear, from the laſt of thoſe paſſages here tranſcribed, that the higheſt evidence of a perſon's acceptance with God, though attended with the baptiſm of the Holy Spirit in the beſtowal of miraculous gifts, was ſo far, in the account of Peter, from ſuperſeding the neceſſity of a ſubmiſſion to the ordinance of baptiſm; that he urged the conſideration of thoſe very facts, as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they who were ſo bleſſed and honoured ſhould ſubmit to it <hi>immediately.</hi> Conſequently, while our brethren revere the authority by which the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020976_0046_0FB207E0AE6DA690"/>apoſtles acted, and while they believe that infant ſprinkling is not baptiſm; they are obliged, in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of theſe ancient precedents, and by all that is amiable in a conſiſtent conduct, to admit none to communion at the Lord's table, whom they do not conſider as really baptized according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt—Nor have we the leaſt reaſon to believe that the apoſtles were inveſted with a <hi>diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> power, to alter our Lord's inſtitutions as they might think proper; either as to mode, or ſubject, or their order and connection one with another. No; they never pretend to any ſuch power; they utterly diſclaim it. Let us hear the declaration of one, as the language of all, and that in regard to the ſacred ſupper. "I have <hi>received of the Lord,</hi> that which alſo I delivered unto you." And again, relating to his doctrine in general, when writing to the ſame people and in the ſame epiſtle, he ſays; <q>I deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you <hi>that which I alſo received</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. xi, 23. xv. 3.</note>.</q> The apoſtles being only <hi>ſervants</hi> in the houſe of God, had no more authority to alter or diſpenſe with an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Jeſus Chriſt, than any other miniſter of the word. Their apoſtolic gifts and powers did not at all inveſt them with a right of <hi>legiſlation</hi> in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their divine <hi>Lord.</hi> They were ſtill but <hi>ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; as ſuch</hi> they claimed regard from the churches, in which they laboured and to which they wrote: at the ſame time freely acknowledging, that it was their indiſpenſable duty to "be found faithful" in the whole extent of their office; they being accountable to the great Head of the church. They acted, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:020976_0047_0FB207E22BBB28F0"/>in the whole compaſs of their duty, under the command, and by the direction of the aſcended Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Nay, the more they were honoured and bleſſed by him, the more were they bound to obey the leaſt intimation of his will.</p>
               <p>Once more: If we regard <hi>the different ſignification</hi> of the two inſtitutions it will appear, that baptiſm ought to precede. In ſubmitting to baptiſm, we have an emblem of our union and communion with Jeſus Chriſt, as our great repreſentative, in his death, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and reſurrection: at the ſame time declaring, that we <q>reckon ourſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin, but alive to God;</q> and that it is our deſire, as well as our duty, to live devoted to him. And as, in baptiſm, we proſeſs to have <hi>received</hi> ſpiritual life; ſo in communicating at the Lord's table, we have the emblems of that heavenly food by which we <hi>live,</hi> by which we <hi>grow,</hi> and in virtue of which we hope to <hi>live for ever.</hi> And as we are born of God but once, ſo we are <hi>baptized</hi> but once: but as our ſpiritual life is maintained by the <hi>continued</hi> agency of divine grace, and the comfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of it enjoyed by the <hi>habitual</hi> exerciſe of faith on the dying Redeemer, ſo it is our duty and privilege <hi>frequently</hi> to receive the holy ſupper. Hence theological writers have often called baptiſm, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of <hi>regeneration,</hi> or of <hi>initiation;</hi> and the Lord's ſupper, the ſacrament of <hi>nutrition.</hi>—Whether, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we conſider the order of <hi>time,</hi> in which theſe two inſtitutions were appointed; or the order of <hi>words,</hi> in the great commiſſion given by our Lord to his miniſtering ſervants; or the order of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>apoſtolic practice;</hi> or the <hi>different ſignification</hi> of the two ſolemn appointments, a ſubmiſſion to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ought ever to <hi>precede</hi> a reception of the Lord's
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:020976_0048_0FB207E54E2AFBD0"/>ſupper. Or, ſhould any one queſtion the validity of this inference, I would only aſk; Whether, in regard to the ſacred ſupper he might not as well deny the neceſſity of always <hi>bleſſing</hi> the bread, before it be broken; or of <hi>breaking</hi> the bread, before it be received; or of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>bread,</hi> before the <hi>wine?</hi> Or, by what <hi>better</hi> arguments, he would prove the oppoſite conduct, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlawful or improper? Nay, if theſe <hi>declarations,</hi> and <hi>facts,</hi> and <hi>precedents,</hi> be not ſufficient to determine the point in our favour; it will be exceedingly hard, if not impoſſible, to conclude with certainty, in what order any two inſtitutions that God ever appointed, were to be adminiſtered. For, ſurely, that order of proceeding which agrees with the <hi>time</hi> in which two inſtitutions were appointed; with the <hi>words</hi> in which the obſervation of them was enjoined; with the <hi>firſt adminiſtration</hi> of them by unerring teachers; and with their <hi>different ſignification,</hi> muſt be the order of <hi>truth,</hi> the order of <hi>propriety,</hi> and the order of <hi>duty,</hi> becauſe it is the order of God. And our brethren will do well to remember, that when Paul commends the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians for <q>keeping the ordinances <hi>as they were delivered to them;</hi>
                  </q> it is plainly and ſtrongly implied, that divine ordinances are given us to <hi>keep;</hi> that they who keep them <hi>as they were inſtituted,</hi> are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; and that they who do not <hi>keep</hi> them at all, or obſerve them in a <hi>different order</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> from that at firſt appointed, are worthy of cenſure. Nor is the order in which the two poſitive inſtitutions of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be adminiſtered, leſs clearly expreſſed in the New Teſtament, than the mode and ſubject of baptiſm. This, however, is a notorious fact, that while the <hi>latter</hi> have been much and warmly diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>former</hi> does not appear to have been ever call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:020976_0049_0FB207EA15EBF428"/>in queſtion by the real diſciples of Chriſt; except in the conduct of thoſe few that plead for free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. They, indeed, practically deny that which appears clear as the ſun, to all other Chriſtians, by frequently admitting perſons to the Lord's table, and baptizing them afterwards: for they do not refuſe to baptize their Paedobaptiſt m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They baptize and then teach; you adminiſter the ſacred ſupper and then baptize. They baptize thouſands whom they never admit to the Lord's table; you receive to that ſacred ordinance numbers who, on your own principles, never were, nor ever will be baptized. Do they argue in defence of their practice and endeavour to prove their point, not by expreſs commands, or plain facts, recorded in the New Teſtament; but by <hi>inferences,</hi> and that, ſometimes, from ſuch paſſages of holy writ, as have not, in our opinion, any relation at all to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? ſo do you. For it is not pretended, that there is any <hi>expreſs command</hi> to receive unbaptized believers into communion; and as to a <hi>plain precedent,</hi> our breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren are equally ſilent. The <hi>whole</hi> of their arguing, therefore, muſt be either analogical or inferential.

               <p>It would, no doubt, have been highly offenſive to God, if the prieſts or the people of old had inverted the order appointed by him, for the adminiſtation of his own ſolemn appointments.

               <p>It muſt, I think, be acknowledged, even by our brethren themſelves, that we have as good a warrant for omitting an <hi>eſſential branch</hi> of an ordinance, or to reverſe the order in which the <hi>conſtituent parts</hi> of an ordinance were originally adminiſtered; as we have to lay aſide a divine inſtitution, or to change the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in which two different appointments were firſt fixed.

               <p>The ſentiment which our brethren adopt, if ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to operate in its full extent, would exclude both baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper from the worſhip of God.

<pb n="53" facs="unknown:020976_0052_0FB207F69E945A98"/>being an unerring rule, that if we dare to queſtion a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's right of communion, becauſe we think he is not baptized; we might almoſt as well deny the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation in the face of the Council of Trent: for we immediately expoſe ourſelves to the dreadful cenſure of acting in a way <q>
                     <hi>greatly prejudicial</hi> to the honour and intereſt of true religion, and <hi>not a little contributing</hi> to the cauſe of <hi>infidelity.</hi>

For infidelity ſtill exiſts; and the principles of it lurk in every breaſt, that will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low unbaptized believers to have a right of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at the Lord's table: of which obnoxious ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, almoſt the whole of the Chriſtian church now is and has ever been. <hi>Pacificus,</hi> I preſume, knows the book to which I refer; and <hi>verbum ſat ſapienti.</hi>

               <p>If, then, our brethren's grand rule of proceeding be right, we are bound to receive believers, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> and have communion with them at the Lord's table, tho' they do not conſider themſelves as baptized. And here I would beg leave to aſk, Whether they would receive a candidate for communion, whom they eſteem as a believer in Jeſus Chriſt, who has not been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in infancy; nor, looking on baptiſm as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary inſtitution, is willing to be baptized at all?
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:020976_0053_0FB207F7EC0BF0A0"/>The ſuppoſition of a perſon, in ſuch circumſtances, applying for fellowſhip at the Lord's table, is far from being improbable; nay, I have known it a real fact. What, then, would our brethren do in ſuch a caſe? As to <hi>Pacificus,</hi> he has informed us plainly enough what would be <hi>his</hi> conduct in ſuch an inſtance; he pleading expreſsly for admitting believers of <hi>all</hi> deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations to communion at the Lord's table. Yes, The very <hi>title</hi> of his piece, is; <q>A modeſt Plea for Free Communion at the Lord's table, between true believers of <hi>all</hi> denominations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is the title of the ſame plea, under the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Candidus,</hi> any way different in its real import, for it runs thus: <q>A modeſt plea for Free Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at the Lord's table; <hi>Particularly</hi> between the Baptiſts and Paedobaptiſts.</q> For it is manifeſt that the emphatical word, <hi>Particularly,</hi> if not quite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, defends free communion, between <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and <hi>Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts;</hi> yet that he is far from denying, nay, that he <hi>really pleads</hi> for the ſame free communion, with thoſe that are neither the one or the other. And who can they be but <hi>Katabaptiſts,</hi> or thoſe in the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with the perſon in the caſe here ſuppoſed? So that whether they be <hi>Quakers,</hi> or <hi>Catholics;</hi> whatever their diſtinguiſhing ſentiments or modes of worſhip may be; they conſider themſelves as bound to admit them to the ſacred ſupper if they look upon them as true believers, and they requeſt communion with them. But as all our opponents are not entirely of their mind in this reſpect, I ſhall proceed with the argument.—If, then, they receive a perſon, in the ſuppoſed caſe, they avowedly reject baptiſm, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to fellowſhip in a church of Chriſt; for if
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:020976_0054_0FB207F9973AAF90"/>it be not requiſite in <hi>every</hi> inſtance, it is not ſo in <hi>any.</hi> If they refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e him, it muſt be becauſe he is not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: for according to the ſuppoſition, they conſider him as a partaker of divine grace and a believer in Jeſus Chriſt. But if they reject him purely on that ground, they ought, on their Antipaedobaptiſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to reject <hi>all</hi> who have had no other than infant baptiſm; becauſe they conſider it as a very different thing from the appointment of Chriſt. Yes, they declare to all the world, every time they adminiſter baptiſm on a profeſſion of faith, to any of their Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſt friends, that they do not believe infant ſprinkling to be an ordinance of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It may, perhaps, be objected; <q>The two caſes are not parallel: becauſe the ſuppoſed candidate for communion, is not only unbaptized, but oppoſes the ordinance itſelf.</q> True: but, admitting a ſmall diſparity, he acts on a principle of conſcience; for he ſuppoſes, with the Quakers, that baptiſm was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, by Jeſus Chriſt, as a ſtanding ordinance in his church; though he has a very different view of the Lord's ſupper. And, to adopt a method of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing uſed by our brethren, when pleading for free communion; What have you to do with another man's conſcience, in a matter that is non-eſſential? To his own Maſter he ſtands or falls. He conſiders the Lord's ſupper as a very important ordinance, and longs to partake of it. And have not you told us, repeatedly, that it was deſigned for <hi>all</hi> believers; that <hi>all</hi> believers are capable of improvement by it; and that they have a right of communion, entirely <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> of our judgment? Is he to be refuſed <hi>one</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in the enjoyment of which he has reaſon to expect the preſence of Chriſt and the bleſſing of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;

Hear, then, I beſeech you, what Mr. Bunyan ſays, who ſpeaks to the following effect. None can, 'render a bigger reaſon than this,' for not ſubmitting to baptiſm, <hi>'I have no light therein.'</hi> Such a perſon has an invincible reaſon, <q>one that all the men upon earth, and all the angels in heaven, are not able to remove. For it is <hi>God</hi> that creates light; and for him to be baptized without light, would only prove him unfaithful to his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and render him a tranſgreſſor againſt God. <note n="*" place="bottom">Bunyan's <hi>Works,</hi> Vol. I. p. 135, 136. 8 vo. edit.</note>

                  </q>—Further; Though, in the caſe ſuppoſed, the candidate for communion <hi>oppoſes</hi> baptiſm, yet there is not ſo great a difference between the two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as may, at firſt view, be imagined. For, on our brethren's Baptiſt principles, infant baptiſm not being an appointment of Chriſt, they who have had no other are unbaptized. In this reſpect, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the caſes are parallel. Beſides, they are equally unwilling to ſubmit to what our opponents conſider as the only true baptiſm; and are equally conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their refuſal. The genuine, the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, therefore, is, (if our brethren would act conſiſtently) they muſt either accept both, or neither; for, in the judgment they form of each, God has received the one, as well as the other. But, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:020976_0058_0FB20800EC644200"/>hinted, by the ſame rule that we receive <hi>one</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, who <hi>is</hi> not baptized; who does not <hi>conſider</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as baptized; who does not <hi>pretend</hi> to be baptized; we may receive <hi>all:</hi> for as there is but one <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> there is but one <hi>law,</hi> relating to this matter; and he who has a right to diſpenſe with it <hi>once,</hi> may do <hi>as often</hi> as he pleaſes. Conſequently, the principle adopted, by thoſe who plead for free communion, has a natural tendency to <hi>exclude baptiſm</hi> from the worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Again: Though our brethren plead, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom they receive and continue in communion with them, are, in their <hi>own judgment,</hi> baptized; yet we may venture to query, whether this be <hi>always</hi> the caſe. The following is a well authenticated fact. Several perſons, being convinced of believers baptiſm, and wiſhing for fellowſhip with the people of God, related their Chriſtian experience to a church and her paſtor who practiſe free communion. It was agreed to receive them. But when the time appointed for their being baptized came, and the paſtor was ready to adminiſter the ordinance to them, one of them was abſent; and, conſequently, was not baptized with his brethren. The ſtated ſeaſon for celebrating the death of Jeſus at his own table quickly approaching, he was, notwithſtanding, received into fellowſhip, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion at the Lord', table, and was baptized after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.<note n="*" place="bottom">If I be not greatly deceived, the Paſtor of this church has pleaded the cauſe of free communion, under the name of <hi>Pacificus.</hi> A character, no doubt, very happily choſen, to expreſs that peculiarly peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful temper and admirably condeſcending conduct, which are ſo clearly diſplayed in this little anecdote.

               <p>The church of England has juſtly incurred the cenſure of all Proteſtant Diſſenters, for her arrogant claim of 'power to <hi>decree rites</hi> or <hi>ceremonies',</hi> in the worſhip of God, <q>and of authority in controverſies

               <p>As the ſovereign authority and univerſal dominion of God, over his rational creatures; as his abſolute right, not only to worſhip, but alſo to be worſhipped in his <hi>own way;</hi> are more ſtrongly aſſerted and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſplayed in his poſitive inſtitutions, than in any other branches of his worſhip; ſo, it is manifeſt, that we cannot diſobey his revealed will concerning them, without impeaching his wiſdom and oppoſing his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty. Becauſe a ſpecial interpoſition of divine authority, and an expreſs revelation of the divine will, conſtitute the baſis, the <hi>only</hi> baſis, on which ſuch inſtitutions reſt, in regard to their mode and ſubject, their order and connection one with another. Surely, then, ſuch of our brethren who admit, as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, what they verily believe is a human invention, cannot but act an unjuſtifiable part. For, on their own principles, infinite wiſdom choſe and abſolute ſovereignty ordained <hi>profeſſing believers</hi> as the ſubjects, and <hi>immerſion</hi> as the mode of baptiſm: and it appears, by their frequently baptizing perſons who were ſprinkled in their infancy, that they look upon ſuch à ſubject and ſuch a mode of adminiſtration, as eſſential to the ordinance. By their conduct, in many inſtances, it alſo appears they are no leſs perſuaded, that unerring wiſdom and ſupreme authority united in appointing baptiſm to be adminiſtred <hi>prior</hi> to the Lord's ſupper: for, where the views and the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:020976_0068_0FB2081BD45CB138"/>of the candidates for fellowſhip with them do not interfere, they always baptize, before they admit to the holy table. Thus, then, ſtands the caſe with our brethren, in regard to the poſitive appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of heaven. They are verily perſuaded that the wiſdom and ſovereignty of God united in ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>immerſion</hi> ſhould be the mode of baptiſm, yet they connive at <hi>ſprinkling;</hi> that <hi>profeſſing believers</hi> ſhould be the ſubjects, yet they admit of <hi>infants;</hi> that baptiſm ſhould be adminiſtered to a believer, <hi>before</hi> he receive the Lord's ſupper, and yet they permit unbaptized perſons to have communion with them in that ſacred ordinance.

Again: as the ſovereign will of God is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and manifeſted in poſitive ordinances than in any other branches of holy worſhip; ſo it is evident, from the hiſtory of the Jewiſh church, which is the hiſtory of Providence for near two thouſand years; that the <hi>divine jealouſy</hi> was never ſooner inſlamed, nor ever more awfully expreſſed, than when God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient people failed in their obedience to ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or deviated from the preſcribed rule of ſuch inſtitutions. The deſtruction of Nadab and Abihu, by fire from heaven: the breach that was made upon Uzzah; the ſtigma fixed and the curſes denounced on Jeroboam; together with the fall and ruin of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by our firſt father's diſobedience to a poſitive command, are among the many authentic proofs of this aſſertion.—Nor need we wonder at the divine procedure, in ſeverely puniſhing ſuch offenders. For knowingly to diſobey the poſitive laws of Jehovah, is to impeach his wiſdom, or his goodneſs, in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; and impiouſly to deny his legiſlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and abſolute dominion over his creatures.

The paſſage to which I reſer, is this: <q>The ordinances of the goſpel are eſtabliſhed by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt, as king and ſupreme law-giver in his church; they are particularly enforced by his own example, and his will expreſsly declared: and as they have no dependance on any circumſtances, which are liable to vary in different countries, or diſtant periods of time, it neceſſarily follows that the primitive model of adminiſtration <hi>ſhould be ſtrictly and conſcientiouſly adhered to.</hi> No pretence to greater propriety, nor any plea of inconveniency, can juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy our <hi>boldly oppoſing the authority of God by the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his law,</hi> and ſubſtituting a human ordinance
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:020976_0072_0FB20822BB302538"/>inſtead of a divine. In a former diſpenſation in which the ritual was numerous and burden ſome, the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> was particularly jealous of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as <hi>Supreme Lawgiver,</hi> and looked upon the <hi>leaſt innovation as a direct oppoſition of his authority.</hi> Moſes, we are informed, was <hi>admoniſhed of God to make all things according to the pattern ſhewed him in the mount.</hi> And thoſe unfortunate youths who preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to alter the form of his religion, and worſhipped him in a way he had not commanded, fell under the ſevereſt marks of his diſpleaſure; which ſhews that he looked upon the leaſt innovation in the <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial part</hi> of his precepts, as an <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>daring oppoſition and contempt</hi> of his authority, and as deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of peculiar and diſtinguiſhed vengeance, as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and open violation of the moral law. And as the great <hi>King</hi> of the univerſe required ſuch exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and punctuality, and inſiſted on ſuch ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous exactneſs in the performance of the minuteſt rite belonging to the <hi>legal</hi> diſpenſation; it would be extremely difficult to aſſign a reaſon why he ſhould be more <hi>lax</hi> and <hi>careleſs,</hi> and allow a <hi>greater ſcope</hi> to human diſcretion under the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> [economy]. The <hi>greater light</hi> which ſhines in our religion, the <hi>ſmall number</hi> and <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of its ceremoniala, and the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> of thoſe inſtitutions being more clearly revealed; are reaſons which <hi>ſtrongly indicate the contrary.</hi> And if it be further obſerved, that the religion of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is particularly calculated to <hi>ſet aſide worldly wiſdom and mortify the pride of man;</hi> it cannot, without great abſurdity, be ſuppoſed, that the ſublime author of it will <hi>diſpenſe with the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his poſitive laws, or admit of the leaſt variation,</hi> to honour that wiſdom, or indulge that pride which
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:020976_0073_0FB2082433F44EE8"/>the whole ſcope of his goſpel hath a manifeſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to abaſe. Surely then it behoves Chriſtians, in an affair of ſuch conſequence, to be circumſpect and wary; it will certainly be well for them, if they can give a good account of their practice, and a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory anſwer to that important queſtion, <hi>Who hath required this of your hand?</hi>

               <p>Though the Lord's ſupper is a poſitive inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, and though we cannot know any thing at all about it, but what we learn from the New Teſtament; yet our brethren make, not the word of revelation, but the meaſure of light and the diſpoſitions of a candidate for fellowſhip, the rule of admiſſion to it.—This appears from hence. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon applies to one of their churches for communion in the ordinances of God's houſe; the paſtor of which community, and a great majority of its members, are Baptiſts. He gives a reaſon of the hope that is in him, to general ſatisfaction. His moral conduct is good,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:020976_0074_0FB20825BB17B750"/>and his character amiable. The paſtor in the name of the church, deſires to know, what are his views of <hi>baptiſm.</hi> He declares himſelf a Paedobaptiſt; ſays he was baptiſed in his infancy, and is quite ſatisfied with it. Now, neither the paſtor, nor the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his people, can look upon this as baptiſm; but conſider it as an invention of men, and a corruption of the worſhip of God. Conſequently, they would be glad if his views, in that reſpect, were otherwiſe. They agree, however, to receive him into commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And why? Becauſe they believe that Chriſt commanded, or that the ſcriptures warrant <hi>infant ſprinkling?</hi> No ſuch thing. Becauſe the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment plainly informs them, that <hi>unbaptiſed converts</hi> were admitted to the Lord's table in the apoſtolic churches? not in the leaſt. Becauſe Jeſus Chriſt has expreſsly granted them a <hi>diſpenſing power,</hi> in regard to baptiſm? They diſclaim any ſuch grant<note n="*" place="bottom">The Church of Rome frankly acknowledges, by her delegates aſſembled in the Council of Trent, that our ſovereign Lord, when he inſtituted the holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, adminiſtered in both kinds, and that it was ſo adminiſtered for ſome time; ſhe, however, expreſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now, though I would by no means inſinuate, that our breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren are equally culpable with that mother of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; yet it may admit of a query, whether, in this particular, ſhe be not more <hi>conſiſtent with herſelf,</hi> than they? <hi>Council of Trent.

Why, truly, the candidate <hi>believes,</hi> is <hi>fully perſuaded,</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſprinkling is real baptiſm; and has been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:020976_0075_0FB2082A935B2F58"/>that he was actually ſprinkled in the firſt ſtate of his life. On this foundation they admit him to the Lord's table: and, which is very remarkable, they receive him with a cordial good will, to have him baptized afterwards, if ever he diſcover an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards it. Their charity forbids them treating a Chriſtian as <hi>unbaptized,</hi> if he do but <hi>heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> himſelf to be baptized. As if that could not be wrong, which a ſincere diſciple of Chriſt firmly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes to be right! Or, as if we were bound, in certain caſes, practically to allow that to be right, which we are fully perſuaded is really wrong!—But might not the paſtor of ſuch a church, on the ſame principle, and with equal countenance from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>baptize</hi> a perſon deſirous of it, without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith, and without any evidence that he is a believer in Jeſus Chriſt? For, as Pacificus and Candidus argue, in regard to baptiſm, Who is to be the judge of what is, or is not <hi>faith?</hi> Moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>every man for himſelf,</hi> and not one for another; elſe we deſtroy the <q>right of private judgment, and go about to eſtabliſh a Popiſh infallibility againſt the liberty of the goſpel. I have no buſineſs with any man's conſcience but my own, unleſs in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, in a proper manner, better to inſtruct it where it appears to be wrong. If my Paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt brother is ſatisfied in his <hi>own mind</hi> that he is rightly baptized [or truly converted] he is ſo to himſelf.</q>—What is there in a falſe perſuaſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to baptiſm, that merits the regard of a <hi>church;</hi> any more than in a deception about faith and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to deſerve the connivance of a <hi>miniſter?</hi> for the ſelf-deception is ſuppoſed to be as <hi>real</hi> in the one caſe, as in the other; though the ſtate of the two candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:020976_0076_0FB2082D1E62D2E8"/>and the danger attending their reſpective miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, are undoubtedly very different. If, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, our ſovereign Lord has not virtually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden us to baptize any without a profeſſion of faith, what right have we ſo to limit the adminiſtration of that ordinance?

Now I appeal to the reader, I appeal to Chriſtians in general, whether there be not as much evidence in the New Teſtament, that baptiſm was adminiſtered by the apoſtles, to ſuch whom they did not conſider <hi>as believers</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt; as there is to conclude, that they received any to communion, before they conſidered them <hi>as baptized</hi> believers. It is not the meaſure of a believer's knowledge, nor the evidence of his integrity; nor is it the charitable opinion we form about his acceptance with God, that is the rule of his admiſſion to the ſacred ſupper; but the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and the <hi>practice</hi> of the apoſtolic churches. To depart from this only rule of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, through ignorance, is a culpable error; and knowingly to deviate from it, is nothing ſhort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the ſovereign majeſty of Zion's King.</p>
               <p>To diſpenſe with the poſitive appointments of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, or to reverſe the order of their adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, in condeſcenſion to weak believers, and with a view to the glory of God, cannot be right.

Now, on their Antipaedobaptiſt principles, they admit unbaptized perſons to the Lord's table; many of whom are never baptised.

               <p>When a Paedobaptiſt applies for communion with Baptiſts, he acts upon a perſuaſion that he has been
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:020976_0081_0FB2083941491618"/>rightly and truly baptized: for there is reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the generality of our Paedobaptiſt brethren would ſtart at the thought of partaking at the Lord's table, while they conſider themſelves as unbaptized. Conſequently, when our opponents admit one of them to communion, they confirm him in what they conſider as a falſe preſumption, and practically ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of what, at other times, they boldly pronounce <hi>a human invention, a tradition of men,</hi> and <hi>will-worſhip;</hi> for ſuch infant ſprinkling muſt be, if not a divine appointment.

               <p>That circumciſion was, by divine command, an indiſpenſable qualification, in every male, for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Jewiſh paſſover, and communion in the ſanctuary worſhip, is generally allowed. And though I am far from thinking that baptiſm came in the place of circumciſion, as many of our Paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt brethren ſuppoſe; yet that the former is equally neceſſary to communion at the Lord's table, under the Chriſtian economy, as the latter was to every male, in order to partake of the paſchal feaſt, and to unite in the tabernacle ſervice, I am fully perſuaded. Nor is my opinion ſingular. It has been the ſenſe of the Chriſtian church in every age; and, excepting thoſe Baptiſts who plead for free communion, it is the voice of the Chriſtian world in general at this day.—I do not find that the neceſſity of circumciſion,

We will ſuppoſe, however, for the ſake of argument, that it was diſputed in the Jewiſh church; and that, amidſt a great variety of intereſting intelligence, which the Rabbinical writers pretend to give, concerning ancient cuſtoms and ancient diſputes, they are found to ſpeak as follows: <q>In the days of our maſter, Moſes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes aroſe about the nature and neceſſity of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: that is, whether the ancient rite was to be performed on the <hi>foreſkin,</hi> or on a <hi>finger;</hi> and, whether it was an indiſpenſably requiſite qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in every male, for a ſeat at the paſchal feaſt, and admiſſion to the ſanctuary worſhip. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of our fathers maintained, that no male, though a ſon of Abraham; that no Gentile, though he might acknowledge and ſerve Abraham's God; had any claim to communion in thoſe joyful and ſolemn ſervices, if he was not circumciſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the divine command, Others contended, with no leſs aſſurance, that circumciſion being only an <hi>outward ſign</hi> of what is internal and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; every male, whether a deſcendent from the loins of our father Abraham, or one of the Gentile race, who knew and feared the God of Iſrael, had an undeniable claim to fellowſhip, though it were not the foreſkin of his fleſh, but a finger that was circumciſed. The latter aſſerted, with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that the holy bleſſed God having accepted ſuch; as plainly appeared by their having the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and ſpiritual circumciſion; it would be <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd</hi> and <hi>uncharitable</hi> to refuſe them communion. And when diſputing with their opponents, they would with an air of ſuperior confidence demand;
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:020976_0083_0FB2083B6688F5B0"/>Will <hi>you</hi> reject from fellowſhip thoſe whom God has received!—Abſolutely reject thoſe who have <hi>the thing ſignified,</hi> barely becauſe, in your opinion, they want the <hi>external ſign!</hi>—Thoſe who poſſeſs the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> perhaps, to a much greater degree than yourſelves, merely becauſe they want the <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow!</hi> What, will you refuſe communion to a brother Iſraelite, or a pious Gentile, in the <hi>taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle</hi> here below, with whom you hope to enjoy everlaſting fellowſhip in the <hi>temple</hi> above! Strange attachment to the manner of performing an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rite!—Beſides, great allowances muſt be made for the prejudices of education. Theſe our breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren whom you reject, as if they were Heathens, as if they were abſolutely unclean; have been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the ſtrongeſt prejudices againſt what we think the true circumciſion. They have been taught from their earlieſt infancy, that though our fathers, for a few centuries after the rite was eſtabliſhed, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally circumciſed the foreſkin; yet that the part on which the ceremony was firſt performed, is by no means <hi>eſſential</hi> to the ordinance. And, therefore, at various inconveniences were found to attend the mode of adminiſtration then generally practiſed; inſtead of cutting off the <hi>praeputium,</hi> many began to circumciſe a <hi>finger;</hi> which has been the cuſtom in ſome of our tribes ever ſince, and which, they ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly plead, is not forbidden by any divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. This, we readily acknowledge, is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; nor dare we, on any account, imitate their proceedings in that reſpect: becauſe, with us, there is no doubt, that the God of our fathers ordained it otherwiſe. But yet, as all have not the ſame op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of information, nor an equal meaſure of
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:020976_0084_0FB2083EA1B1FA00"/>light; and as our brethren are verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that they have been circumciſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the divine command; (for if they were not, they would readily comply with our mode of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding) it is our indiſpenſable duty to receive them in love, and not harraſs their minds with "doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſputations" about a matter that is not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial. For we all worſhip the <hi>ſame God;</hi> and, ſo far as his <hi>moral</hi> worſhip is concerned, in the <hi>ſame way;</hi> though we happen to differ about an external rite, that is by no means eſſential, either to ſpiritual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip here, or to the ſalvation of our ſouls hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—Beſides, though it be admitted that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely appointed mode of adminiſtering the ſacred rite is of <hi>ſome</hi> importance; yet it muſt be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the edification of ſuch as truly fear God is of <hi>infinitely greater importance.</hi> But, if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from the ſolemn ſanctuary worſhip, you debar them from a capital mean of their ſpiritual benefit. You ſhould alſo conſider, who is to be the judge of what is, or is not, the true circumciſion. Every man, moſt certainly, muſt judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not one for another; elſe you deſtroy the right of private judgment; you invade the ſacred prerogative of conſcience; and tacitly advance a claim to infallibility. If your brethren, who cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe a finger inſtead of the part appointed, be ſatisfied in their <hi>own minds,</hi> they are circumciſed <hi>to themſelves:</hi> and while the anſwer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience attends it, God will and does own them in it, to all the ends deſigned by it; ſo that while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as laying them under the ſame obligations to holineſs of heart and life, as we conſider our cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion to do us, why ſhould you not have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:020976_0085_0FB20843D95A8250"/>with them?—Nor are you ſufficiently aware, how <hi>much you injure</hi> the cauſe of real religion, and <hi>promote</hi> the baneful intereſts of infidelity, by being ſo ſtrict and rigid. Were you to be more candid and charitable, in regard to this matter, it might be expected that numbers of our brethren, who, it muſt be allowed, adminiſter this rite in a very improper manner; would cordially unite with us, and, in time, utterly renounce their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. We ſhould alſo have reaſon to hope, that many of our Gentile neighbours, who <hi>deteſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> as performed by us, might become proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes to the Jewiſh religion, and worſhip the moſt high God in fellowſhip with us. But ſo long as you inſiſt, not only on the rite itſelf, (for that we ourſelves are not willing to give up entirely) but on that <hi>mode</hi> of adminiſtration which is ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to them, as indiſpenſably neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with you; it will be, not only a <hi>wall of partition</hi> between us and them, but a <hi>bone of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> among the choſen tribes themſelves. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it muſt impede, greatly impede, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that love to God, and that affection for man, which are of much greater importance than the moſt accurate performance of a merely external rite.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſing our brethren in the courſe of their reading to meet with ſuch an account, what would they think of it? What would they ſay? They would, undoubtedly, ſuſpect the truth of the whole. They would conſider it as a Rabbinical fable. But how would their indignation riſe, were the fabulous narrator to proceed and aſſert; <q>That Moſes and Joſhua, warmly eſpouſing this latter opinion, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:020976_0086_0FB208463B57F0B8"/>much to its credit!</q> This, they would ſay, is abſolutely incredible, and a vile aſperſion on the characters of thoſe illuſtrious ſaints. Had Nadab and Abihu been mentioned as the abettors of this unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural practice, there would have been leſs reaſon to deny the truth of the whole relation; becauſe they were guilty of innovating in the worſhip of God, and were awfully puniſhed for it. But thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the moſt pious, exemplary, and excellent men in all the Iſraelitiſh camp, is beyond the bounds, not only of credibility, but alſo of decency. Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this kind, I am perſuaded, they would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily make, were they to find ſuch a narration in the Talmud, or in any Rabbinical author.—And now give me leave again to remind them; That, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the judgment of the Chriſtian world in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, circumciſion was not more neceſſary for all the males, who deſired communion at the paſchal ſupper and in the ſolemn ſervices of the tabernacle, than baptiſm is to fellowſhip in the Chriſtian church, and a ſeat at the Lord's table—That there is, on their own principles, a wider and a more material dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between baptiſm, as now adminiſtered to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and baptiſm, as appointed by Jeſus Chriſt; than there would have been, between cutting off the foreſkin, and circumciſing a finger: becauſe the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would have been <hi>circumciſion,</hi> and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of a <hi>proper ſubject</hi> alſo, though not of the part required; but <hi>ſprinkling,</hi> whether infants or adults, is no more <hi>baptiſm,</hi> in their account, than it is <hi>immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> —And that, had any members of the ancient ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue introduced, or admitted, ſuch an alteration as that ſuppoſed; they might have defended it on the ſame general grounds, and with much greater
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:020976_0087_0FB20847621203F0"/>plauſibility, in ſeveral reſpects at leaſt, than our brethren can the practice of free communion. For I appeal to my reader, whether the Pentateuch of Moſes and the ſcriptures of the prophets do not ſay as much of the one, as the evangelical hiſtory and the writings of the apoſtles do of the other?</p>
               <p>Paul, when meeting with certain diſciples at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, deſired to know, whether they had received Holy Ghoſt ſince they believed. To whom they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q>We have not ſo much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghoſt.</q> On which the apoſtle put the following queſtion: <q>Unto what then were ye <hi>baptized?</hi>
                  </q> And they ſaid, <q>Unto John's bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</q> From which it plainly appears, that as theſe perſons profeſſed to be diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, Paul <hi>took it for granted</hi> they had been baptized. For his query is not, Have you been <hi>baptized?</hi> But, <q>
                     <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> or into, <hi>what</hi> then were ye baptized?</q> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their baptiſm from their profeſſion: and he had reaſon ſo to do. For he well knew, that the firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator of the ordinance required a ſubmiſſion to it, of all that brought <q>forth fruits meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</q> that the apoſtolic miniſtry demanded the ſame act of obedience, from all that believed in Jeſus Chriſt; and the adminiſtration of baptiſm is a part of the miniſterial office, being ſtrictly connected with teaching the diſciples of Chriſt, <q>to obſerve all things which he has commanded.</q> And, as an author before quoted, juſtly remarks; <q>We find that the preachers of the goſpel always did it, and the people who gladly received the word, deſired it. How indifferent ſoever it appears to ſome in our days, yet the grace of God <hi>never failed</hi> to ſtir up an

               <p>THE cauſe which our brethren undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, is denominated by them, <hi>Free Communion.</hi> That communion, then, for which they plead, is <hi>free.</hi> But here I beg leave to aſk, From <hi>what?</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of <hi>men?</hi> that is a laudable freedom. From the laws of <hi>Heaven?</hi> that were a licentious liberty. Abſurd, in theory; impoſſible, in fact. It never was, it never can be the caſe, that God ſhould inſtitute a poſitive ordinance of divine worſhip, as the Lord's ſupper undoubtedly is; and leave it entirely to the diſcretion of men, to whom it ſhould be adminiſtered. Free—for <hi>whom?</hi> For every one that will? This they do not pretend. For all who imagine themſelves believers and qualified for it? This they dare not aſſert. For, notwithſtanding all their candour and
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:020976_0091_0FB2085185DDF7E8"/>all their catholiciſm, they do not conſider every one that thinks himſelf a believer and deſires communion, as fit for it. Hence it is, they aſk a reaſon of the candidate's hope, and take the liberty of judging for themſelves, what his hope and the ground of it are. They think it their duty to inquire, in what light he views himſelf and what he believes concerning the Son of God. And if, in their judgment, he be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Jeſus Chriſt, they put a negative on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; even tho' they feel an affection for him, as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, a ſincere, a well meaning man. Here, then, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other and great limitation; a boundary which it would not be lawful to ſet, if a poſitive inſtitution were not concerned, and if ſuch limitation were not fixed by the divine Inſtitutor. By parity of reaſon, therefore, if our Lord has given any other direction, relating to the ſame ordinance, it ſhould be regarded with equal reverence and equal punctuality.</p>
               <p>What, then, is the <hi>freedom</hi> for which they plead? Why, that Baptiſt churches ſhould admit Paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts into communion with them. In other words, That they ſhould admit believers to the Lord's table, whom they conſider as unbaptized. A very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary poſition this! Such, however, is <hi>free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:</hi> in defence of which, ſeveral pamphlets have, of late, been publiſhed. And who can tell, but ſome of our brethren may ſo improve on the doctrine of liberty, in regard to divine inſtitutions of a poſitive nature, as to favour us, ere long, with a <hi>Plea for free Baptiſm?</hi>—With a diſſertation, intended to prove the lawfulneſs, and, in ſome caſes, the neceſſity, of adminiſtering baptiſm to ſuch whom we conſider as unbelievers? eſpecially, if the candidates for that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance be firmly perſuaded in their own minds, that
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:020976_0092_0FB208551B794F58"/>they are believers in Jeſus Chriſt. At the ſame time declaring, that it will be at the peril of greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring real religion, <q>
                     <hi>and not a little contributing to the cauſe of infidelity,</hi>
                  </q> if we refuſe.—But let us now briefly conſider what they ſay, in defence of their hypotheſis. They argue, from <hi>ſeveral paſſages</hi> of ſcripture; from the <hi>temper</hi> required of real Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in their behaviour one towards another; and object againſt us our <hi>own conduct,</hi> in another reſpect.</p>
               <p>The principal paſſages adduced from holy writ, and here to be conſidered, are the following:— <q>Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful diſputations—for God hath received him—Receive ye one another, as Chriſt alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us, to the glory of God—God, which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hearts, bare them witneſs, giving them the Holy Ghoſt, even as he did unto us: and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith—I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means ſave ſome. <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom xiv. 1, 3. and xv. 7. Acts xv. 8, 9.1 Cor. ix. 19—23.</note>
                  </q>—On which paſſages we may obſerve in general; Whatever their meaning may be, except our opponents can make it appear, that they contain the grant of a <hi>diſpenſing power</hi> to goſpel miniſters and churches; that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs theſe divine declarations authorize the miniſters and churches of Chriſt, to ſet aſide an ordinance of his, or to invert the order of its adminiſtration, as they may think proper; they are far from anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exigencies of their caſe, or ſerving the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which they are cited.</p>
               <p>Again: The texts produced do not ſo much as <hi>mention</hi> communion at the Lord's table, nor appear
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:020976_0093_0FB2085661967ED8"/>to have the leaſt reference to it. No; the Holy Ghoſt has other objects in view, in each of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts. And as theſe are the principal paſſages to which our brethren appeal in proof of their point, we may take it for granted, that better are not to be found; and, conſequently, as a tacit acknowledgment, that poſitive proof is wanting. But if it be allowed, that there is no <hi>poſitive</hi> evidence in favour of their practice, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> amounts to a conceſſion that there is <hi>no proof</hi> at all. Becauſe nothing of a poſitive and ritual nature can be proved a duty, or agreeable to the will of God, merely by our own reaſonings; nor by arguments formed on moral precepts and general rules of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. For if once we admit any thing in the worſhip of God, as a duty, that is grounded, either on far-fetched inferences from particular declarations of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which the holy penmen do not appear to have had the leaſt thought of the matter in queſtion; or on our own ideas of expediency and uſefulneſs, we ſhall not know where to ſtop. On this principle, a great number of ceremonies were brought into the church of Rome, and might be introduced by us, though not one of them could ſtand that divine que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, "Who hath required this at your hand?" As it cannot be proved, by the deductions of reaſon, that it is the duty of any man to eat bread and to drink wine, as a branch of divine worſhip, but only from the teſtimony of God, ſo what he has revealed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that matter, is our only rule in all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the Lord's ſupper.<note n="*" place="bottom">Plain account of Bap.

               <p>Our brethren maintain, when diſputing with Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſts, that the New Teſtament knows no more of infant <hi>baptiſm,</hi> than it does of infant <hi>communion:</hi> and that many of the arguments adduced in defence of the former, will equally apply to the latter.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Prieſtley is alſo of the ſame opinion.

Produce your warrant from thoſe heavenly inſtitutes contained in the New Teſtament, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a believer to the Lord's table, in a church of Chriſt, while that very church conſiders him as unbaptized; and you ſhall not wait long for equally authentic evidence, that infant baptiſm and infant communion have the ſanction of divine authority. You frequently aſſert, that our arguments formed

Yet, when pleading for free communion, you adopt this very method of arguing, and think it quite concluſive: otherwiſe you never would appeal with ſuch confidence as many of you do, to the paſſages now produced. <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </q> —But let us take a more particular view of the paſſages now before us.</p>
               <p>The converted Romans were commanded by Paul, to <q>receive them that were weak in faith, as God and Chriſt had received them.</q> And we are plainly informed, that the perſons intended were ſuch, as had not a clear diſcernment of their Chriſtian
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:020976_0096_0FB2085F762FB058"/>liberty, in regard to <hi>the eating of meats</hi> forbidden by the ceremonial law, and <hi>the obſervation of days,</hi> that was of old required by it. But what has this to do with <hi>free communion?</hi> Is there no way of <q>receiving him that is weak in faith,</q> but by admitting him to the Lord's table? Muſt the exhortation to receive a Chriſtian brother, be confined to that ſingle inſtance of true benevolence? Or, is our ſo doing the capital idea and the primary ſenſe of the precept, in any of Paul's writings? He ſays, in this very epiſtle, <q>I commend unto you Phebe our ſiſter,—that <hi>ye receive her</hi> in the Lord.</q> Was her admiſſion to the holy table the principal thing that he deſired of the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Romans, on her account? No; he evidently had ſomething elſe in view; ſomething that would manifeſt their love to a diſciple of Chriſt, much more than barely permitting her to have communion with them in the ſacred ſupper. For he immediately adds; <q>And that <hi>ye aſſiſt her</hi> in whatſoever buſineſs ſhe hath need of you. <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xvi. 1, 2.</note>
                  </q> Or, did he ſolicit admiſſion to the Lord's table, for himſelf and his fellow miniſters, among the Corinthians, when he ſaid; <q>
                     <hi>Receive us;</hi> we have wronged no man; we have corrupted no man; we have defrauded no man? <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. vii. 2.</note>
                  </q> Or, for Epaphroditus, when he thus expreſſed himſelf to the Philippians; <q>
                     <hi>Receive him,</hi> therefore, in the Lord, with all gladneſs, and hold ſuch in reputation? <note n="‡" place="bottom">Philip. ii. 29.</note>
                  </q> Or, for Oneſimus, when he ſaid to Philemon; <q>

                  </q> It is, I will venture to affirm, a much greater thing to receive either a weak or a ſtrong believer, in the ſenſe of theſe exhortations; than merely to grant him a place at the Lord's table. Why, then, ſhould our brethren plead for it as they do, as if it were the <hi>grand criterion</hi> of our acknowledging Paedobaptiſts to be real converts, and of our love to them, as ſuch?</p>
               <p>Beſides, the faith of a ſincere believer may be as weak, and require as much forbearance, in regard to the holy ſupper, as in reſpect of baptiſm. A refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and really converted Catholic may deſire fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with us, who ſtill retains the Popiſh error of communion in one kind only: but are we obliged by this apoſtolic precept, to mutilate the ſacred ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in condeſcenſion to his weakneſs?—To em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the weak, as well as the ſtrong believer, in the arms of Chriſtian affection, is a capital duty of the moral law. To bear with a brother's infirmities, and to "forbear one another in love," are certainly required by that command which ſays; <q>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf;</q> and would have been our duty, if neither baptiſm, nor the Lord's ſupper, had ever exiſted. But are we to regulate our conduct, in the admiſſion of perſons to a <hi>poſitive</hi> inſtitution;—to one which depends entirely on the <hi>ſovereign pleaſure</hi> of God, by inferences drawn from the <hi>general</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> duties of the moral law?—Were the precepts of that eternal law ever conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:020976_0098_0FB208640137A540"/>by the prieſts or the people of old, as the rule of adminiſtering poſitive inſtitutions? Had they not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſyſtem of precepts, <hi>expreſs precepts,</hi> intended for that purpoſe? and was not ſuch a ritual abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary?</p>
               <p>Suppoſing, however, that there were no way of receiving one that is weak in faith, but by admitting him to the Lord's table, this text would be far from proving what our opponents deſire; unleſs they could make it appear, that the perſons of whom the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle immediately ſpeaks, were <hi>not members</hi> of the church of Rome, when he gave the advice. There being diſputes among the believing Romans, about the eating of meats and the obſervation of days, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no proof nor any ſhadow of proof, that they had not communion together at the Lord's table.—But admitting that to be a fact, of which there is not the leaſt evidence, the concluſion drawn from the paſſage would not be juſt, except it were alſo proved, that the "weak in faith" were <hi>unbaptized;</hi> or, at leaſt, ſo conſidered by their ſtronger brethren; for <hi>that</hi> is the point in diſpute between us.

Whom does God, whom does Chriſt receive? None but thoſe that believe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs faith in the Lord Meſſiah? Our brethren will not affirm it. For if divine compaſſion did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the dead in ſin; if the kindneſs of Chriſt did not relieve the enemies of God; none of our fallen race would ever be ſaved. But does it hence follow, that we muſt admit the unbelieving and the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, either to baptiſm, or the holy table? Our gracious Lord freely accepts all that deſire it and all that come; but are we bound, by his example, to receive every one that ſolicits communion with us? Our opponents dare not aſſert it. For though the Great Supreme is entirely at liberty to do as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to reject or accept whom he will; yet it is not ſo with his miniſtering ſervants and profeſſing people, in regard to the ſacred ſupper. No; it is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable duty and their everlaſting honour, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

               <p>Beſides, goſpel churches are ſometimes obliged, by the laws of Chriſt, to exclude from their communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe whom he has received; as appears from the caſe of the inceſtuous perſon in the church at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. And have thoſe churches that practiſe free communion never excluded any for ſcandalous back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings; whom, notwithſtanding, they could not but conſider as received of Chriſt? What, do they never exclude any from fellowſhip with them, but ſuch of whom they have no hope! I cannot ſuppoſe, nor will they affirm any ſuch thing. But if there may be a juſt cauſe of <hi>excluding</hi> ſuch from communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom God has received, though at preſent in a ſtate of backſliding; why may there not be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon of <hi>refuſing</hi> communion to ſome, whom we look upon as the objects of God's peculiar favour? Is there not as great a degree of diſapprobation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the <hi>former</hi> caſe, as there is in the <hi>latter?</hi> and is not the word of God our only rule in both ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? It is not every one, therefore, that is received of Jeſus Chriſt who is entitled to communion at his table; but ſuch, and only ſuch, as revere his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſubmit to his ordinances, and obey the laws of his houſe.</p>
               <p>And are our opponents verily perſuaded that <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> is a matter of "doubtful diſputation?"

Yet who, among our brethren, will dare to affert, that no Catholic, who ever diſputed for with hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cup from the people, was received by Jeſus Chriſt?

<pb n="105" facs="unknown:020976_0104_0FB205E68DDD06C8"/>ſhould not be quite diſcarded. For, that baptiſm ought to be adminiſtred prior to the ſacred ſupper, is as clearly revealed, as that either of them was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the uſe of believers in all ſucceeding ages.</p>
               <p>Our honeſt friend, Barclay, when taking notice of thoſe diſputes which have been about the ſacred ſupper, ſays; <q>The ground and matter of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt lies in things extrinſic from, and unneceſſary to, the main matter.

                  </q>—How ſlight the barrier, how thin the partition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween free communion and Katabaptiſm! Thus bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is treated, not as <hi>a branch of divine worſhip,</hi> but as <hi>a tool of human convenience;</hi> not as <hi>an ordinance of</hi> God and a mean of his glory, but as <hi>a happy expedient</hi> in the hands of men, to ſecure the applauſe of their fellow mortals;—that applauſe which is conſidered as due to perſons of a condeſcending, candid, catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirit. If the omiſſion of it would give offence, let it by all means be adminiſtered: and if the uſe of it would be attended with the ſame inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, lay it aſide and ſay not a word about it. Such is the advice of Volkelius and Bunyan.</p>
               <p>The reader, I take it for granted, can hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear obſerving, what an admirable method is here propoſed by this truimvirate, Volkelius, Barclay, and Bunyan, in order to promote and ſecure peace among Chriſtian brethren. A method, it muſt be confeſſed,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:020976_0106_0FB205E95D21D320"/>that is at once very comprehenſive, quite expeditious, and extremely eaſy. <hi>So comprehenſive,</hi> that it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to every caſe: <hi>ſo expeditious,</hi> that any controverſy may, by the happy expedient, be finiſhed in a trice: and <hi>ſo eaſy,</hi> that every one may have the benefit of it. Were it univerſally known and univerſally purſued, there would be ſoon be no diſputes at all, either about truth or duty. For the whole proceſs conſiſts in this; If divulging a truth believed, or practiſing a duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, ſhould at any time give offence, or be likely ſo to do; keep the former to yourſelf, let the latter alone, and all ſhall be well. But how much more agreeable to ſcripture, is the following maxim of a celebrated author; <q>The appointment of God, is the <hi>higheſt law,</hi> the <hi>Supreme neceſſity;</hi> which we ought rather to obey than indulge popular ignorance and weakneſs. <note n="*" place="bottom">Dei ordinatio nobis ſumma lex, ſuprema neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitas, cui potius parendum, quam populari ignorantiae et infirmitati indulgendum. <hi>Turretini Inſt.

What, baptiſm become an article of "doubtful diſputation" in ſo early a day! If, on the other hand, that inſpired writer had <hi>no thought</hi> of baptiſm when he mentioned "doubtful diſputations;" if what he there ſays about matters then in diſpute, regard things that belonged to an <hi>antiquated ritual;</hi> what authority have our brethren to put baptiſm on a level with them?

This, the reader will certainly think is <hi>free</hi> communion. And, indeed, if this text warrant our brethren's practice, I ſee but little objection againſt its being underſtood in ſuch a latitude of ſignification. But, in oppoſition to ſuch a ſenſe of the paſſage, a Paedobaptiſt writer obſerves: <q>This inference is glaringly forced and wide, diſcovering their ignorance of the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſign of the text who make it.

And, after a number of healing things, he concludes with theſe words; <hi>Receive ye one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> That is, ye who are ſaints at Rome, who have agreed to walk together in the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ordinances of the Lord Jeſus; ye who are profeſſedly united in church-commumon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ye one another in love, as becometh ſaints, united in one body for mutual benefit. Bear ye one another's burdens: watch over and admoniſh one another in love, notwithſtanding of ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in ſentiment among you: as to the eating certain meats and regarding certain days, let not that difference make any breach in your communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on together as a church of Chriſt. But let the ſtrong bear with thoſe that are weak, and the weak not be offended with the liberty of the ſtrong.— Judge not one another uncharitably, but let bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love continue.—This is preciſely the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's meaning; as will appear to thoſe who look impartially into the connection of his argument; and by no means ſerves the purpoſe for which the objector, bring it. <note n="*" place="bottom">Smith's <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

               <p>And ſuppoſing our brethren to argue from this paſſage only by way of <hi>analogy,</hi> their inference is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually weak, and their concluſion palpably forced: there being a great, an eſſential difference, between eating or not eating of certain meats, in the apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:020976_0109_0FB205F4AF428E78"/>times; and our being baptized or not baptized, prior to communion at the Lord's table. For, tho' while the ceremonial law was in force, the Jews were obliged to abſtain from prohibited meats; yet our opponents will not affirm, that their obſervance of a negative precept was intended by the Eternal Sovereign, to anſwer ſimilar purpoſes with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of baptiſm, as appointed by Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>latter</hi> is a ſolemn inſtitution of divine worſhip: but can this be aſſerted of the <hi>former?</hi> Baptiſm was inſtituted prior to the ſacred ſupper; was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be adminiſtered to profeſſing believers, before they approached the holy table; and, in the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic age, for aught appears to the contrary, was conſtantly adminiſtered to believers previous to their having communion in the Chriſtian church. But can ſimilar things be affirmed concerning that abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from certain meats, which were forbidden under the Jewiſh economy.</p>
               <p>To conclude my remarks on the text before us, and to illuſtrate the paſſage. Candidus, we will ſuppoſe, is the paſtor of a baptiſt church, and that a diſpute ariſes among his people, about the lawfulneſs of <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blood,</hi> or any thing <hi>ſtrangled.</hi> The controverſy ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes high, and is carried on with too much heat of temper. Each party is blamed by the other; the one, as judaizing; the other, as violating a plain, apoſtolic precept.—A report of this comes to Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. Concerned and grieved at ſuch contentions and ſuch a breach of brotherly love, in a once flouriſhing and happy church, he writes a friendly letter; in which he bewails their hurtful conteſts, gives them his beſt advice, and, among other things, he ſays: <q>Him that is weak in the faith, receive ye, but not
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:020976_0110_0FB205F6273EFF40"/>to doubtful diſputations. For one believeth that he may eat all things: another who is weak, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth herbs. Let not him that eateth, deſpiſe him that eateth not: and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth; for God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him. Wherefore receive ye one another, as Chriſt alſo received us to the glory of God.</q>— In a while-after this healing epiſtle is publiſhed, and read by many. In the peruſal of which, ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and others conclude that the perſons exhorted to mutual forbearance, had <hi>not communion</hi> one with another, under the paſtoral care of Candidus, and that they who are ſtiled, "weak in faith," had never been <hi>baptized.</hi> Nay, ſome aſſert, that the mere <hi>want of baptiſm,</hi> in the opinion of Irenaeus, ought never to be objected againſt any that are candidates for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at the Lord's table; nor ever be made a bar to fellowſhip in a church of Chriſt. Yet Irenaeus was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known, in any inſtance, to give the leaſt cauſe for ſuch a ſuſpicion. The application is eaſy: I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only aſk, Whether, in the ſuppoſed caſe, ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences would be genuine and juſt, or forced and unnatural? and, whether they who drew them might not be ſuſpected of being, either very fanciful and weak, or as acting under the power of ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice? The reader will pardon my prolixity on this paſſage, when he conſiders that our opponents lay a very great ſtreſs upon it.</p>
               <p>By the text produced from the acts of the apoſtles we learn, that "God is no reſpecter of perſons;" that he, as an abſolute ſovereign, beſtows his favours on Jews and Gentiles without any difference. But will our brethren infer from hence, that they whoſe honour and happineſs it is to be his obedient ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:020976_0111_0FB205F7A2422828"/>are entirely at liberty to receive to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the Lord's table all that believe, without any difference? Can they juſtly conclude, that becauſe <hi>Jehovah</hi> diſpenſes his bleſſings as <hi>he</hi> pleaſes, they may adminiſter, or omit, his poſitive inſtitutions as <hi>they</hi> pleaſe?</p>
               <p>Once more: They produce, as much in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, the declarations of Paul to the church at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. ix. 19—23.</note> relating to his own conduct. And what do we learn in general from this paſſage, but that he, out of his great concern for the good of mankind, and his abundant zeal for the glory of God, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do, or forbear, any thing that was lawful, in order to gain an impartial hearing from both Jews and Gentiles wherever he came? I ſaid, any thing that <hi>was lawful;</hi> the rule of which is the divine precept, or ſome example warranted by divine authority. Nor can we view theſe words in a more extenſive ſenſe, without implicitly charging the great apoſtle with <hi>temporizing,</hi> and highly impeaching his exalted character.—But what has this text, any more than the former, to do with the adminiſtration, or lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide, of poſitive inſtitutions? It was the duty of Aaron, as well as of Paul, and of us, to ſeek the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his fellow creatures and the honour of God, to the utmoſt of his ability. But was this general obligation the rule of his performing the ſolemn ſanctuary ſervices on the great day of atonement? Could he conclude from hence, that if the diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people required it, he was at liberty to <hi>omit</hi> any of the ſacred rites, or to <hi>tranſpoſe</hi> the order in which <hi>Jehovah</hi> commanded they ſhould be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:020976_0112_0FB205F95A71E5C0"/>If, however, any of our opponents can make it appear, that this paſſage really has a relation to the poſitive appointments of Chriſt; it muſt be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of a diſpenſing, prieſtly power, in regard to thoſe inſtitutions. And, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if our brethren can make out their claim to the honour, free communion will be eſtabliſhed with a witneſs. In ſuch a caſe it might be expected, that the next advocate for it, when citing the paſſage, would comment upon it, and addreſs us in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner: <q>This text is full to my purpoſe. It contains all I could wiſh, when contending with my ſtricter brethren. For hence it is plain, that I am at liberty, perfectly at liberty, to omit, or adminiſter, the ordinance of baptiſm, juſt as the diſpoſitions and choice of my hearers may render it convenient. Yes, ye <hi>ſtrict Baptiſts!</hi> this admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able text authorizes me, in condeſcenſion to the weakneſs of my ſincere hearers, not only to receive Paedobaptiſts into communion; for that is a mere trifle, with ſuch a patent of church power in my hand; but alſo Semi-Quakers, who reject baptiſm; and converted Catholics, who mutilate the ſacred ſupper; yea to baptize the infant offspring of any who ſhall deſire it. By doing of which, I hope to obtain the favour of many reſpectable Paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, who have been extremely offended by that rigid and forbidding conduct, for which you are ſo notorious. Yes, and by diſpenſing with baptiſm, in ſome inſtances, I doubt not but I ſhall convince many of the utility and neceſſity of it; which you know, would be an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

To our juſtifying righteouſneſs, our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, or an intereſt in the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? So is the Lord's ſupper; and ſo is every branch of our obedience. For they will readily allow, that an intereſt in the divine favour, is not <hi>obtained</hi> by the miſerable ſinner, but <hi>granted</hi> by the Eternal Sovereign. That a juſtifying righteouſneſs is not the <hi>reſult</hi> of human endeavours, but the <hi>work</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="unknown:020976_0114_0FB205FC9C301C38"/>of our heavenly Subſtitute, and a <hi>gift</hi> of boundleſs grace. And that acceptance with the high and holy God, is not on conditions performed <hi>by us</hi> but in conſideration of the <hi>vicarious obedience</hi> and <hi>propitiatory ſufferings</hi> of the great Immanuel. Nay, ſince our firſt father's apoſtacy, there never was an ordinance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, there never was a command given to man, that was intended to anſwer any ſuch end.</p>
               <p>Baptiſm is <hi>not fundamental;</hi> is <hi>not eſſential.</hi> True; it limited to the foregoing caſes. But are we hence to infer, that it is not neceſſary on <hi>other accounts</hi> and in <hi>other views?</hi> If ſo, we may alter, or lay it aſide, juſt as we pleaſe; and, on the ſame principle, we may diſmiſs, as <hi>non-eſſential,</hi> all order and every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in the church of God.</p>
               <p>Is not the inſtitution of baptiſm a branch of divine worſhip? And is not the adminiſtration of it, prior to the Lord's ſupper, eſſential to that order in which Chriſt commanded his poſitive appointments to be regarded? Nay, <hi>Pacificus</hi> himſelf tacitly allows, that the practice of free communion is a breach of order in goſpel churches. For, in anſwer to an objection of this kind, he ſays; <q>Though it be admitted that the order of churches is of <hi>great</hi> importance, yet it muſt be admitted that the edification of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and their obedience to the acknowledged command of Chriſt to all his diſciples, "Do this in remembrance of me," are points of <hi>infinitely greater</hi> importance; the leaſt therefore ought to give way to the greateſt.</q>—The order of churches, then, is of <hi>great</hi> importance, <hi>Pacificus</hi> himſelf being judge; and <hi>Candidus,</hi> his colleague, acknowledges, that it <q>is of <hi>ſome</hi> importance.</q> Nor could they deny it, without impeaching the wiſdom, or the goodneſs of
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:020976_0115_0FB205FDA349A548"/>Chriſt, as Lord over his own houſe; and impoſing that injunction of the Holy Ghoſt, <q>Let all things be done decently and in order.</q> And as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit requires the obſervation of order in the church of God, ſo Paul commends the Corinthians for "keeping the ordinances <hi>as he delivered them;</hi>" and expreſſes a holy joy, on "beholding the order" of that Chriſtian church which was at Coloſſe. But that order which the great Lord of all appointed, and in the practice of which the good apoſtle ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoiced, our brethren, it ſeems, conſider as <hi>a mere trifle</hi>—as comparatively <hi>nothing.</hi> For what is any thing that has only a <hi>finite</hi> importance attending it, when compared with that which is of <hi>infinite</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance? On ſuch a compariſon, it ſinks into little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; it is Ioſt in obſcurity. Yet thus our opponents venture to ſtate the comparative worth of church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the edification of individuals.—But give me leave here to inquire, Whether the primitive order of goſpel churches can be detached from the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative authority of Jeſus Chriſt? And, whether the exerciſe of that authority can be conſidered as having no connection with his honour? To anſwer theſe queſtions in the negative, free communion itſelf can hardly demur. Conſequently, a breach of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Chriſt appointed, as king in Zion, muſt be conſidered as an oppoſition to his crown and dignity; and <hi>his honour</hi> is of much greater importance than the edification of believers. For our Jeſus and our Lawgiver is <hi>Jehovah;</hi> between whoſe <hi>honour</hi> and the <hi>happineſs</hi> of ſinful worms, there is, there can be no compariſon. For the latter is only <hi>a mean,</hi> whereas the former is the <hi>grand end,</hi> not only of a church ſtate, but of the whole economy of providence and
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:020976_0116_0FB205FFE306F310"/>grace. I may, therefore, venture to retort the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; Though it be admitted, that the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians is of <hi>great</hi> importance; yet it muſt be allowed, that the honour of our divine Sovereign is of <hi>infinitely greater</hi> importance; and, conſequently, the primitive order of the goſpel churches ſhould be obſerved.</p>
               <p>Again: Are not my readers a little ſurpriſed at the reaſoning of our opponents which I have juſt produced? Are they not ready to ſay, with ſome of old, "May we know what this new doctrine is?" What, reverſe the order of churches, appointed by God himſelf, with a view to edification! Diſpenſe with a poſitive ordinance of heaven, and break a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine command, under the fair pretence of promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience to Chriſt! Our brethren, in pleading for free communion, bring <q>certain ſtrange things to our ears; we would know, therefore, what theſe things mean,</q> and how they may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. For if we are obliged, in ſome caſes, to ſet aſide an ordinance of divine worſhip, and to break a <hi>poſitive</hi> command, in order that certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals may perform <hi>another poſitive</hi> injunction of the great Legiſlator; the laws of Chriſt are not half ſo conſiſtent as Paul's preaching; <q>which was not yea and nay,</q> as thoſe would be, if the argument here oppoſed were valid.—Nor have we, that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, any thing like a parallel caſe, either in the Old or New Teſtament. We find, indeed, an inſtance, or two, of poſitive and typical rites giving way to natural neceſſities and moral obligations, when the performance of both was impracticable; as, when David are of the ſhew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ead, without incurring a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine cenſure: but we have no example of a poſitive
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:020976_0117_0FB206015F154298"/>being ſet aſide, in favour of any one's <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>prejudice</hi> againſt it, that he might be edified by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to <hi>another poſitive</hi> inſtitution, of which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to partake. That maxim of our Lord, <q>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice;</q> is, therefore, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally inapplicable in the preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bunyan, I know, ſtrenuouſly pleads the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of circumciſion by the Iſraelites in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while they attended on other poſitive appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, as arguing ſtrongly for free commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but he ſeems to have forgotten that the omiſſion of which he ſpeaks, is keenly cenſured by the Holy Ghoſt. The uncircumciſed ſtate of the people, whatever might be the occaſion of it, is called, <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi> "the reproach of Egypt;" which odium was rolled from them on the borders of Canaan, and the place in which they were circumciſed was called by a new name, to perpetuate the memory of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh. v. 9.</note> Now, as that neglect of the Iſraelites was a <hi>breach</hi> of the divine command, <hi>a reproach</hi> to their character as the ſons of Abraham, and ſtands <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi> by the Spirit of God; it cannot be pleaded in defence of a ſimilar omiſſion, with the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of reaſon. And if ſo, I leave our brethren to judge whether it can be imitated <q>without injuring the honour of true religion, and promoting the cauſe of infidelity.</q>—Nor is that other inſtance, which the ſame author produces, relating to the feaſt of paſſover, in the reign of Hezekiah, any more to his purpoſe. For though many of the people were not <q>cleanſed according to the purification of the ſanctuary;</q> though they did eat the paſſover
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:020976_0118_0FB206036D56B080"/>otherwiſe than it was written," and were accepted of God; yet Hezekiah was ſo conſcious of thoſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities, that he deprecated the divine anger, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>The good Lord <hi>pardon</hi> every one that prepareth his heart to ſeek God, the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not not cleanſed according to the purification of the ſanctuary. And the Lord hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to Hezekiah, and <hi>healed</hi> the people.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cron. xxx. 18, 19, 20.</note>
                  </q> With what ſhadow of reaſon, then, or of reverence for God's commands, can any one plead this inſtance in favour of free communion? What, ſhall <hi>a deviation</hi> from the divine rule, in the performance of ſacred rites—a deviation that is acknowledged as <hi>criminal</hi> before the Lord, and for which <hi>pardon</hi> is requeſted, be adduced, as a precedent for the conduct of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians! What would our brethren, what would Mr. Bunyan himſelf have thought of Hezekiah and his people, had they taken the liberty of repeating the diſorderly conduct, whenever they celebrated the paſchal anniverſary?—Taken the liberty of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the divine rule, becauſe Jehovah had <hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </hi> graciouſly pardoned their irregularities, and accepted their ſervices, on a ſimilar occaſion? Would they not have been chargeable with hold preſumption, and with doing evil that good might come?—But I return to our <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>peaceful</hi> opponents.</p>
               <p>Diſturb and break the order of churches, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by Jeſus Chriſt, with a view to edification? The reader will here obſerve, the <hi>order</hi> intended is that of adminiſtering baptiſm to believers, <hi>before</hi> they are admitted to the Lord's table. That infraction of order, therefore, for which they plead, is no
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:020976_0119_0FB2060694613578"/>other than <hi>ſetting aſide</hi> an ordinance, allowed to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; and this to promote the edification of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Very extraordinary, I muſt confeſs? For pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in every age, have been more diſpoſed to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi> the number of religious rites, than to <hi>leſſen</hi> it, with a view to edification. So the Jews of old fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently acted, and as frequently offended God. So the church of Rome has appointed many forms and rites or worſhip, with a view to the edification of her deluded votaries. The church of England alſo has retained the ſign of the croſs in baptiſm, and claims a power to decree rites and ceremonies in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip whenever ſhe pleaſes; and all, no doubt, with a view to <hi>edification.</hi> Yet I never heard that either of thoſe eſtabliſhments, arrogant as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is, ever talked of <hi>altering</hi> the primitive order of the Chriſtion church, or of <hi>omitting</hi> an ordinance, allowed to be divine, with a view to edification. Our brethren, however, plead for this; and, which is equally wonderful, they plead for it under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretext, that a <hi>command</hi> of Chriſt may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But is not baptiſm <hi>a command,</hi> an <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged</hi> command of Chriſt?

Cannot we promote peace and harmony without practically approving of infant ſprinkling, as if it were a divine ordinance; while we are firmly perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that God never appointed it? Or, are we bound to admit as a fact, what we verily believe is a falſhood; The diſtinction between a Chriſtian who holds what I conſider as a practical error in the worſhip of God, and the miſtake maintained, is wide and obvious. It is not an erroneous principle, or an irregular practice, that is the object of genuine charity. No; it is the <hi>perſon</hi> who maintains an error, not the <hi>miſtake</hi> defended, that calls for my candour. The <hi>former,</hi> I am bound by the higheſt authority, to love as myſelf; the <hi>latter,</hi> I ſhould ever conſider as inimical to the honour of God, as unfriendly to my neighbour's happineſs, and therefore diſcourage it, in the exerciſe of Chriſtian tempers, through the whole of my conduct.—It is freely allowed, that a miſtake which relates merely to the mode and ſubject of baptiſm, is comparatively ſmall; but ſtill, while I conſider the aſperſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants as a human invention in the ſolemn ſervice of God, I am bound to enter my proteſt againſt it; and by a uniform practice to ſhew, that I am a <hi>Baptiſt</hi>— the ſame when a Paedobaptiſt brother deſires commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with me, as when one of my own perſuaſion makes a ſimilar requeſt. Thus proving that I act, not under the impulſe of paſſion, but on a dictate of judgment: and then the moſt violent Paedobaptiſt opponents will have no ſhadow of reaſon to impeach my integrity;—no pretence for ſurmiſing, that when
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:020976_0123_0FB2060E1FBE7AE8"/>I gave the right hand of fellowſhip to ſuch as have been immerſed on a profeſſion of faith, I act on <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of conſcience;</hi> but when admitting ſuch to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, who have been only ſprinkled in their infancy, on <hi>motives of convenience.</hi> For it is allowed by all the world, that conſiſtency is the beſt evidence of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>I would alſo take the liberty here to obſerve, that ſome of thoſe churches in which free communion has been practiſed, have not been the moſt remarkable for brotherly love, or Chriſtian peace and harmony. Has the paſtor of a church ſo conſtituted, being a Baptiſt, never found, that his Paedobaptiſt brethren have been a little offended, when he has ventured free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpeak his mind on the mode and ſubject of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? When Paedobaptiſt candidates for communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have been propoſed to ſuch a church, have thoſe members who eſpouſed the ſame ſentiment never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a degree of pleaſure, in the thought of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their number and influence increaſed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that has excited the jealouſy of their Baptiſt brethren? When, on the contrary, there has been a conſiderable addition to the number of Baptiſt members, has not an equal degree of pleaſure in them, raiſed ſimilar ſuſpicions in the minds of their Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt brethren? And are not ſuſpicions and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of this kind, the natural effects of ſuch a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? Muſt not a Baptiſt, as ſuch, deſire his own ſentiment and practice to increaſe and prevail, while he conſiders them as agreeable to the will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Lord? And muſt not a Paedobaptiſt, as ſuch, ſincerely wiſh that his opinion and practice may ſpread and prevail, ſo long as he conſiders infant ſprinkling in the light of a divine appointment? To
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:020976_0124_0FB2060FA01CA078"/>ſuppoſe a member of ſuch a church, whether he be Baptiſt or Paedobaptiſt, to love God, and firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his own ſentiment concerning baptiſm to be a divine truth; and yet be indifferent whether that or its oppoſite prevail, involves a contradiction. For he who is indifferent to the performance of what he conſiders as a command of God, treats God himſelf with an equal degree of indifference: there being no poſſible way of expreſſing our affection for God, but by regarding his revealed will. <q>This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.</q> Now, as our opponents muſt allow, that their communities are liable to all thoſe other imperfections which are common to the real churches of Chriſt; ſo, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, the reader will hardly forbear concluding, that free communion expoſes them to ſome <hi>additional</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages, which are peculiar to themſelves.</p>

For, is it not a fact, that others who plead for infant baptiſm, and thoſe not leſs wiſe and diſcerning, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their conduct in a very different point of light? Do they not look upon it as ſavouring more of <hi>carnal policy,</hi> than of Chriſtian charity; and as being much better calculated to expreſs their <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>popularity,</hi> in adding to the number of their communicants, by opening a back door for the members of Paedobaptiſt churches to enter, than to promote the edification of ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>It ſhould be obſerved, that forbearance and love, not leſs than reſolution and zeal, muſt be directed in the whole extent of their exerciſe, by the word of God; elſe we may greatly offend and become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of other men's ſins, by conniving when we ought to reprove.

To be of ſome religion is but decent; and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of human life require that it be popular and compliant. If men have different notions of Jeſus Chriſt, his divinity, his facrifice, his kingdom, and the cuſtoms of his religion, even from what the apoſtles ſeemed to have; charity [with many] de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that we think well of their religious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, notwithſtanding this.

<pb n="131" facs="unknown:020976_0130_0FB2061AE0B830B0"/>the peace of the Chriſtian church. Thus kind and humble is modern charity.—Inſtead of rejoicing in, or with the truth, it rejoiceth in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the admirable piety that may be produced from ſo many different, yea, oppoſite principles.— It is very true, that the power of godlineſs has oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſuffered in a zealous contention about rites and ceremonies; but the contention has been chiefly about forms of human device. The Chriſtians of old time were taught, not to <hi>diſpute</hi> about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of their Lord, but to <hi>obſerve</hi> them thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and hereby they expreſſed their affection to him and to each other. If that affection be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be more important than the tokens of it, it would be unjuſt to infer that the latter have no obligation; which would imply, that Chriſt and the apoſtles <hi>meant nothing</hi> by their precepts. The Methodiſts have not, indeed, gone ſo far as their ſpiritual brethren [the Quakers] have done, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all external ceremonies; but they are taught to believe, that all concern about the ancient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and cuſtoms of the Chriſtians is mere party-ſpirit, and injurious to the devout exerciſes of the heart.

This unſettledneſs of thought, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven to and fro, and toſſed of though with every wind of doctrine, is a great curſe, not a bleſſing; an irreconcilable enemy, not a true catholicism.— A man of a true cathohe ſpirit—does not halt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

               <p>Our brethren with an air of ſuperior confidence often demand, <q>What have you to do with <hi>another's baptiſm?</hi>
                  </q> This interrogatory I would anſwer by propoſing another: What have I to do with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's <hi>faith, experience,</hi> or <hi>pracliee?</hi> In one view, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, if he do not injure my perſon, character, or property; for to his own maſter he ſtands or falls. In another, much; that is, if he deſire communion with me at the Lord's table. In ſuch a caſe, I may lawfully addreſs him in the following manner: What think you of Chriſt? What know you of yourſelf? Of yourſelf, as a ſinner; of Chriſt, as a faviour? Of Chriſt, as King in Zion; of yourſelf, as a ſubject of his benign government? Are you deſirous to be found in his righteonſneſs, and ſincerely willing to obey his commands? Are you ready to hear his croſs, and to follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goes?—Receiving ſatisfaction to theſe moſt important queries, we will ſuppoſe the converſation thus to proceed: <q>What are the divine commands?</q> After believing, baptiſm
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:020976_0133_0FB206210D718F10"/>is the <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>very firſt</hi> that requires a public act of obedience.—'But I have been baptized.' Perhaps not. Make it appear, however, and I ſhall ſay no more on that ſubject.— <q>I am really perſuaded of it in my own mind. Were it otherwiſe, I ſhould think it my duty, I ſhould not heſitate a moment, to be immerſed on a profeſſion of faith.</q> I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your integrity: abide by the dictates of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Yet care ſhould be taken, that her language be an echo to the voice of divine revelation; elſe you may neglect your duty and ſlight your privileges, offend God and injure your ſoul, even while you obey her commands.— <q>But I am perſuaded Chriſt has accepted me, and that it is my duty to receive the holy ſupper.</q> That Chriſt has received you, I have a pleaſing perſuaſion; and ſo I conclude, in a judgment of charity, concerning all whom I baptize: but that it is the <hi>immediate</hi> duty of any unbaptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to approach the Lord's table, may admit of a query: nay, the general practice of the Chriſtian church in every age, has been quite in the negative. For a learned writer aſſures us, that <q>among <hi>all the abſurdities</hi> that ever were held, none ever maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>that,</hi> that any perſon ſhould partake of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion before he was baptized.</q> Was it, think you, the duty of an ancient Iſraelite to worſhip at the ſanctuary, or to partake of the paſchal ſeaſt, before he was circumciſed? Or, was it the duty of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh prieſts to burn incenſe in the holy place, before they offered the morning or the evening ſacrifice? The appointments of God muſt be adminiſtered in his own way, and in that order which he has fixed. For, to borrow an illuſtration from a well known author, <q>Suppoſe a maſter commands his ſervant to
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:020976_0134_0FB20624A70C1BE8"/>ſow his ground; doth this give a right to him to go <hi>immediately</hi> and caſt in the ſeed, before that ever he break the ground with the plough, and make it fit for the receiving the ſeed? Should he go thus to work, he were a diſobedient ſervant. Neither could it excuſe, that he had his maſter's immediate command to ſow his ground. Even ſo in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Thomas Boſton's <hi>Works,</hi> page 386.</note>—</q> Chriſt commands believers to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him at his own table. But were thoſe believers to whom he firſt gave the command <hi>unbaptized?</hi> Or, can we infer, becauſe it is the duty of all baptized believers to celebrate the Lord's ſupper, that it is the <hi>immediate</hi> duty of one that is not baptized, ſo to do? —<q>Could you produce an inſtance from the records of the New Teſtament, of any believer being refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed communion, merely becauſe he ſcrupled the propriety of being immerſed on a profeſſion of faith, it would warrant your preſent denial. But, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ſhall make it appear, that a truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted perſon, and one who was conſidered as ſuch, deſired fellowſhip with a church of Chriſt in the apoſtolic age: I will engage to prove that he was received, whatever might be his views relating to the mode and ſubject of baptiſm.</q> And when you ſhall adduce an inſtance of any real convert, in thoſe primitive times, conſcientiouſly ſcrupling the uſe of the wine at the Lord's table; I will enter under the ſame obligation to prove, that the ſacred ſupper was adminiſtered to him in his own way.— <q>Will you, then, dare to reject thoſe whom Chriſt accepts!</q> Reject, from what? My eſteem and affection? Far be it! Under a perſuaſion that Chriſt has received
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:020976_0135_0FB20626207DDB18"/>you, I love and honour you as a Chriſtian brother. His image appearing in your temper and conduct commands my regard.—<q>With what conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, then, can you refuſe me communion? If Chriſt has accepted me, if Chriſt himſelf has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with me, why may not you?</q> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with you in the knowledge and comfort of the truth I have; and this would be both my honour and happineſs, were you a converted Jew. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with you I alſo have in affection; but fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at the Lord's table is a diſtinct act, a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing; and is to be regulated entirely by the revealed will of Him that appointed it. Communion at the holy ſupper would never have been either the duty or privilege of any man, if Chriſt had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, any more than it is now my duty to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the ancient paſſover. But that eternal law which requires me <q>to love my neighbour as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</q> would have obliged me to love you, both as a man and a Chriſtian, if baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper had never been ordained.— <q>After all, your profeſſions of affection for me as a believer in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and your refuſing to have communion with me at the holy table, carry the appearance of a ſtrong inconſiſtency.</q> Admitting they do, the inconſiſtency is not peculiar to me, nor to thoſe of my perſuaſion; becauſe I act on a principle received in common by the whole Chriſtian church. There is no denomination of Chriſtians, except thoſe who plead for free communion, that would admit you to the Lord's table, if they did not think you had been baptized. This, therefore, is the principle on which I refuſe to have communion with you: I conſider you as unbaptized. Suppoſe a Jew, a Turk, or a Pagan, to be enlightened by divine grace, to have
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:020976_0136_0FB20628D00155F8"/>the truth as it is in Jeſus, to love God and deſire communion with his people before he is baptized; would you think it right, could your own conſcience admit of it, as conſiſtent with the revealed will of Chriſt and the practice of his apoſtles, that ſuch a requeſt ſhould be granted by any goſpel church? in a caſe of this kind, I preſume,—and there have been millions of Jews and Heathens converted, ſince the Chriſtian aera commenced,—in ſuch a caſe you would eaſily diſcern a conſiſtency, between loving him as a believer, and refuſing to have communion with him till he was baptized. Nay, I cannot help thinking, but you would be ſtartled at the report of any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious community admitting ſuch an one to the Lord's table; becauſe it would ſtrike you as a notorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the divine rule of proceeding; from the laws and ſtatutes of Heaven, in that caſe made and provided. Beſides, you have already acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that if you did not conſider yourſelf as bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; if you thought immerſion on a profeſſion of ſaith eſſential to baptiſm, which you very well know is <hi>my</hi> ſentiment; you ſhould think it your duty to ſubmit, you would not heſitate a moment. So that, were I to encourage your immediate approach to the ſacred ſupper, I ſhould ſtand condemned on your own principles. This, therefore, is the only queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between us, <hi>What is baptiſm?</hi> For you dare not aſſert, you cannot ſuppoſe, that an unbaptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, deſcended from Chriſtian parents, has any pre-eminence, in point of claim to communion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a truly converted Jew: and you muſt allow that I have an equal right with you, or any other man, to judge for myſelf what is eſſential to baptiſm. You verily believe that you have been baptized; I
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:020976_0137_0FB20629F1C58808"/>am equally confident, from your own account of the matter, that you have not. Your conſcience oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the thought of being immerſed on a profeſſion of ſaith, becauſe, in your opinion, it would be rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization; mine cannot encourage your approach to the Lord's table, becauſe I conſider infant baptiſm as invalid.— <q>I perceive, then, that you look upon me as an unbaptized Heathen: for you cannot imagine that I am, or ever was, a Turk or a Jew.</q> Quite a miſtake. I conſider you as a real convert, and love you as a Chriſtian brother. Were you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that a ſon of Abraham after the fleſh, or a dupe to Mahomet's impoſture, or an uncultivated Hottentot, had received the truth and was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord Redeemer; would you ſtill call him, without limitation, a <hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Heathen?</hi> No, candour and common ſenſe would forbid the thought. You would rather ſay, He is a believer in God's Meſſiah, and a lover of Jeſus Chriſt; he feels the power of goſpel truth on his heart, and his moral conduct is comely; but, as yet, he is unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. I ſhould rejoice to ſee him convinced of the importance of that inſtitution, of the connection it has with other appointments of Chriſt, and behold him ſubmit to it. Then, were I in communion, I ſhould freely give him the right hand of fellowſhip, and break bread with him at the Lord's table. Till then, however, though I think it the duty of every Chriſtian to love him for the truth's ſake, I conſider it as no breach of charity, in any community, not to admit him to the Lord's table.—Now I appeal to the reader, I appeal to our brethren themſelves, Whether, on our Antipaedobaptiſt principles, we are not obliged to conſider a truly converted but unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:020976_0138_0FB2062B60E4BB08"/>Muſſulman, and a converted Engliſhman, who has has had no other than Paedobaptiſm, as on a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, in point of claim to communion with us? For God is no reſpecter of perſons. It is not matter where a man was born, or how he was educated; whether he drew his firſt breath at Conſtantinople or Pekin, or London; whether his parents taught him to revere the Koran of Mahomet, the Inſtitutes of Confucius, or the well atteſted Revelation of God; if he really be born of the Spirit, he has an equal claim to all the privileges of a goſpel church, with a true convert deſcended from Chriſtian anceſtors. And if ſo, while our brethren abide by their preſent hypotheſis, they could not refuſe the ſacred ſupper to the one, any more than the other, without the moſt palpable inconſiſtency; though, by admitting the <hi>former</hi> to that divine appointment, they would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and offend all that heard of it.</p>
               <p>Our opponents further ſuggeſt, nay, they ſeem quite confident, <q>That the Chriſtian Jews in the primitive church, might, on our principles, have refuſed communion to the believing Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not circumciſed; and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Gentiles might have denied fellowſhip to the believing Jews, for the oppoſite reaſon.</q> But here our brethren take for granted, what we cannot by any means allow. For this way of talking ſuppoſes, that a ſubmiſſion to baptiſm is no more demanded of believers now, than circumciſion was of Gentile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts in the apoſtolic age; and that we who plead for baptiſm, as a term of communion, have no more authority ſo to do, than Judaizing Chriſtians then had for maintaining the neceſſity of circumciſion. Now ſuch extraordinary poſitions as theſe ſhould not
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:020976_0139_0FB2062FE0DB0A90"/>have been aſſumed <hi>gratis,</hi> but <hi>proved, ſoundly proved;</hi> which, had our oppoſers well and truly performed, would have made me and many of their ſtricter brethren, thorough proſelytes to free communion. Nay, we ſhould, probably, before now, have been in a hopeful way of getting <hi>entirely rid</hi> of that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, about the order and importance of which we now contend. For neither Pacificus, nor Candidus, will dare to aſſert, that our aſcended Lord requires <hi>any</hi> of his diſciples to be circumciſed, either before or after their admiſſion to the holy table: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if their arguing from circumciſion to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm be concluſive, we may abſolutely omit the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as converts of old did the former, without fear of the leaſt offence, or of any divine reſentment.</p>
               <p>And muſt we, indeed, conſider the adminiſtration and the neglect of baptiſm, as on a perfect level with being circumciſed, or uncircumciſed, in the apoſtolic times! Muſt an ordinance of the New Teſtament, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to which our Lord requires of all his diſciples, be placed on the ſame footing with an obſolete rite of the Jewiſh church! How kind it is of our brethren who poſſeſs this knowledge, and are ſo well acquainted with Chriſtian liberty, relating to baptiſm, that they are willing to inform us of its true extent! For, as Socinus long ago obſerved, <q>Ignorance of it is the cauſe of <hi>many evils.</hi>
                  </q> I may, however, venture an appeal to the intelligent reader, Whether this way of arguing does not much better become the pen of Socinus, of Volkelius, or of a Quaker; than that of Pacificus, of Candidus, or of any Baptiſt? Becauſe, as Hornbeek remarks, in anſwer to the Socinians; <q>If is very abſurd to explain the deſign, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the obligation of baptiſm, by the abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:020976_0140_0FB206334E718E38"/>and abuſe of circumciſion.</q> As our breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren deteſt the Socinian ſyſtem in general, I cannot but wonder that they ſhould ſo often uſe weapons, in deſence of their novel ſentiment, that were forged by Socinus, or ſome of his pupils, for a ſimilar pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I could wiſh therefore, that ſome ſuch perſon as Mr. Ryland, who is well known to have an utter averſion to the capital tenets of that pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former of the Reformed church in Poland, would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly take Pacificus to taſk, for paying ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to a depraver of divine truth, and a mutilator of God's worſhip. For who knows but it might have a happy effect, and cauſe him to retract his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Plea?</hi>—Before I proceed to another objection. it may not be amiſs to obſerve, What a <hi>variety</hi> of laudable and kindred purpoſes this argument is adapted to ſerve, according to its various application by different perſons. In the hands of our <hi>opponents,</hi> it effectually proves the neceſſity of admitting infant ſprinkling, in ſome caſes, as a proper <hi>ſuccedaneum</hi> for what they conſider as real baptiſm. From the pen of Socinus, it evinces beyond a doubt, that baptiſm is an <hi>indifferent thing.</hi> And in the mouth of Barclay, it will equally well demonſtrate, that baptiſm ſhould be <hi>entirely laid aſide.</hi> Well, then, might our Candid and Peaceful oppoſers congratulate themſelves on the ſafety of their cauſe, it being defended by ſuch a <hi>three edged</hi> ſword as this! And well might they unite, at one man, in ſaying: <q>If, therefore, this were the <hi>only</hi> thing that could be urged in ſavour of the latitude of communion I plead for, I ſhould think it would be ſufficient; at leaſt ſufficient to excuſe our conduct, and ſtop the mouth of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="unknown:020976_0141_0FB206346B9783F0"/>
But, notwithſtanding all I have ſaid, we ſtand charged by our brethren with a <hi>notorious inconſiſtency</hi> in our own conduct; becauſe we occaſionally admit, with pleaſure, Paedobaptiſt miniſters into our pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, to whom we ſhould refuſe communion at the Lord's table. This objection has been much inſiſted upon of late, and is ſometimes urged againſt us by way of query, to the following effect. <q>Is not as much required in order to an <hi>offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e</hi> in the church, as to <hi>private memberſhip?</hi> Is it not as inconſiſtent to receive a Paedobaptiſt, as a <hi>miniſter,</hi> and admit him into the <hi>pulpit,</hi> as to admit him into the <hi>church</hi> and to the <hi>Lord's table?</hi> Where have you either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or example, for receiving them as <hi>miniſters,</hi> any more than for receiving them <hi>as members?</hi>
                  </q>— Theſe queries being conſidered, by many of our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, as quite unanſwerable, I ſhall take the more notice of them.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing then, that demands regard, is the ſtate of the queſtion which is now before us. For it is not, as theſe queries ſuggeſt, Whether as much be not required in order to an <hi>office</hi> in the church, as to <hi>private communion?</hi> This we readily allow; this we never denied. For what congregation of ſtrict Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts would think they acted conſiſtently in making choice of a Paedobaptiſt for their paſtor, or to offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate as a deacon? Beſides, will not our brethren ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that in every orderly ſociety, and more eſpecially in a church of Chriſt, a perſon muſt be a member before he can be an officer in it? <hi>This</hi> is the point in diſpute, at leaſt it is this about which I contend; Whether baptiſm be equally neceſſary to the <hi>occaſional exerciſe</hi> of miniſterial gifts, as it is to
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:020976_0142_0FB20635F59E41E0"/>
                  <hi>communion</hi> at the Lord's table? and, Whether the ſcripture favour the one as much as the other?</p>
               <p>Such being the true ſtate of the queſtion, I now beg leave to aſk; Suppoſing our brethren to prove the affirmative beyond a doubt, what is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and how are we affected by it? Is it, that we are found guilty of a direct violation of ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine command, that <hi>requires</hi> us to receive Paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts into our communion? No ſuch thing is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Is it, that we oppoſe ſome plain apoſtolic <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent?</hi> neither is this laid to our charge. For they do not believe there were any Paedobaptiſts in the apoſtolic times; and, conſequently, they cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the New Teſtament contains an example of ſuch being received into communion. What, then, is the concluſion they would infer? It muſt, ſurely, be ſomething formidable to every ſtrict Baptiſt; otherwiſe it is hardly ſuppoſable that ſo much weight ſhould be laid upon this objection. The conſequence, however, is only this; The premiſes proved, <hi>the ſtrict Baptiſts have no reaſon to cenſure their brethren of a looſer caſt, becauſe they themſelves are equally culpable, though in a different reſpect.</hi> Or, in other words. <hi>The ſtrict Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, like ſome other folks, are not quite infallible; do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually err; and, by reaſon of a miſtake, impertinently blame the conduct of their more free, and open, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous brethren, when they ought rather to examine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their own.</hi>—But this inference can be of little ſervice to the cauſe of free communion, except it be good logic and ſound divinity, to attempt a juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of my own faults, by proving that he who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes me is equally guilty: or to congratulate my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as an innocent man, becauſe my neighbour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with a good grace reprove me. Our opponents,
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:020976_0143_0FB206376E46EC80"/>I perſuade myſelf, will not be greatly offended with us, if this argument, <hi>Herculean</hi> as it ſeems to them; ſhould not make us complete converts to free commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. So ſoon, however, as our brethren ſhall make it appear, that they have as good a warrant for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Paedobaptiſt believers into ſtated communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I have to admit a Paedobaptiſt miniſter occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally into my pulpit; I will either <hi>encourage</hi> the former, or <hi>entirely refuſe</hi> the latter.</p>
               <p>But if theſe queries prove any thing, they prove too much; more at leaſt, than the queriſts intend. For, according to the argument contained in them, it is equally unwarrantable for us to <hi>hear</hi> a Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babtiſt miniſter preach, or to <hi>unite with him</hi> in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic prayer; as it is for them to receive him into communion. For inſtance: do they demand, <q>Where have you either precept, or example, for admitting Paedobaptiſt miniſters into your pulpits, any more than for receiving them as members?</q> I reſort, on their Baptiſt principles; Where have you either precept or example, in the New Teſtament, for <hi>bearing</hi> Paedobaptiſt miniſters preach; or for <hi>uniting with them</hi> in public prayer, any more than for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them as members? And, to ſhew the futili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this argument, I again demand; If, in <hi>bearing</hi> ſuch miniſters preach, or by <hi>uniting with them</hi> in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic prayer (which are undoubtedly branches of the <hi>moral</hi> worſhip of God, nor peculiar to any diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of religion) we act without any expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or plain example in the New Teſtament; with what propriety, can we blame our brethren for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting.

<pb n="145" facs="unknown:020976_0144_0FB2063CE24F5EF8"/>of God) though they have neither precept nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for ſo doing? Queries of this kind might be multiplied, but theſe may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>But is there <hi>no</hi> difference between the two caſes? <hi>No</hi> difference between occaſionally admitting Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt miniſters into our pulpits, and receiving them, or others of the ſame perſuaſion, into our communion? I can ſcarcely imagine that our breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren themſelves will here anſwer in the negative; but that this difference may plainly appear, let the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing things be obſerved.—Public preaching is not confined to perſons in a <hi>church ſtate,</hi> nor ever was; but the Lord's ſupper is a church ordinance, nor ought ever to be adminiſtered but to a particular church, <hi>as ſuch.</hi> Now it is of a particular church, and of a poſitive ordinance peculiar to it, concerning which is all our diſpute.—There is not that ſtrict mutual relation between bare hearers of the word and their preachers, as there is between the members of a church and her paſtor, or between the members themſelves. And as, according to the appointment of God, perſons muſt <hi>believe</hi> the goſpel before they have any thing to do with poſitive inſtitutions; ſo, in the ordinary courſe of Providence, they muſt <hi>hear</hi> the goſpel in order to their believing. The Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians <hi>heard</hi> before they <hi>believed;</hi> they believed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were <hi>baptized;</hi> and, no doubt, they were baptized before they received the <hi>ſacred ſupper.</hi> (Acts xviii. 8.) When our opponents receive Paedobaptiſts into their fellowſhip, they practically allow what they themſelves conſider as a human invention, to ſuperſede a poſitive, divine inſtitution; and that with a view to their attending on another poſitive appointment of Jeſus Chriſt. Not ſo, when we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:020976_0145_0FB2063E2DDBD288"/>miniſters of that perſuaſion into our pulpits. In this caſe there is no divine inſtitution ſuperſeded; no human invention, in the worſhip of God, encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: nor is it done with a view to introduce them to any poſitive appointment of our ſovereign Lord.— Again: When we admit Paedobaptiſt miniſters into our pulpits, it is in expectation that they will preach the goſpel; that very goſpel which we believe and love, and about which there is no difference between them and us. But when they receive Paedobaptiſts into communion, they openly connive at what they conſider as an error; an error both in judgment and practice; an error of that kind which the ſcripture calls, "will worſhip, and the traditions of men." There is, undoubtedly, a material difference, between hearing a miniſter who, in our judgment, is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the only true baptiſm, diſcourſe on thoſe doctrines he experimentally knows, and countenanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an invention of men. In the former caſe we ſhew an eſteem for his perſonal talents, we honour his miniſterial gifts, and manifeſt our love to the truth; in the latter, we ſet aſide a divinely appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prerequiſite for communion at the Lord's table.</p>
               <p>It has been already obſerved, as a fact, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been called by grace, who were not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in their infancy; and, conſidering baptiſm as a temporary inſtitution, have conſcientiouſly refuſed a ſubmiſſion to that ordinance when converted, who yet deſired communion in the holy ſupper. We will now ſuppoſe a community of ſuch; and that they call to the miniſtry one of their number, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by all competent judges, to poſſeſs great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial gifts, and to be a very uſeful preacher:— Or we may ſuppoſe a reformed Catholic, equally the
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:020976_0146_0FB2063FA2B665F8"/>ſubject of divine grace, and endued with equal abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities for public ſervice: yet conſcientiouſly retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Popiſh error of communion in one kind only. Now, on either of theſe ſuppoſitions, I demand of our brethren, whether they would receive ſuch an one into communion with the ſame readineſs that they would admit him into their pulpits? If they anſwer in the negative, then by their own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, there is not ſo cloſe a connection between ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a perſon to preach amongſt us, and receiving him into communion, as they pretend. And we may venture to retort upon them; Shall an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, laborious and uſeful miniſter of Chriſt <hi>work</hi> for you, and ſhall he not be allowed to <hi>eat</hi> with you! What, ſhall he break the bread of life <hi>to</hi> you, and muſt he not be ſuffered to break bread at the Lord's table <hi>with</hi> you!—Again: We will ſuppoſe a good man and a uſeful preacher to be fully perſuaded, with the Hydroparaſtates in the ſecond century, that <hi>water</hi> ſhould always be uſed at the Lord's table, inſtead of wine; and that, on a principle of conſcience, he abſolutely refuſes the latter: Or, that it is more ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant and more agreeable to <hi>dip</hi> the bread in the wine, and receive them both at once; as practiſed by ſome in the fourth century, and more frequently afterwards: Or, that he conſcientiouſly approves the cuſtom of the Greeks, who mix <hi>boiling water</hi> with wine, <hi>crumble the bread</hi> into it, and taking it out with a ſpoon, receive both elements together.<note n="*" place="bottom">

No; they would be ready to ſay of ſuch a candidate for fellowſhip; He ought to regard the example of Chriſt, who uſed <hi>wine:</hi> Or, he ought to obey the divine command, which requires that we ſhould <hi>drink</hi> the wine. Yet they might not think it proper to refuſe him the occaſional uſe of a pulpit, and might hear him preach the truth, received in common, with pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Though, as Antipaedobaptiſts, it cannot be expected, that we ſhould produce inſtances out of the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament of Paedobaptiſt miniſters being encouraged in a ſimilar way; becauſe we are firmly perſuaded there were none ſuch, till after the ſacred canon was completed: yet we find, in that inſpired volume, a ſufficient warrant for uniting with thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in affection and walk, ſo far as agreed; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their ignorance of ſome part of the
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:020976_0148_0FB2064616A11F10"/>counſel of God, to which a conſcientious obedience is indiſpenſably required, from all thoſe by whom it is known. (Philip. iii. 15, 16.) Yes, the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not only <hi>permits,</hi> as lawful, but <hi>enjoins</hi> as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable duty, that we ſhould love them that love the Lord; and that we ſhould manifeſt his holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in every way, that is not inconſiſtent with a revelation of the divine will in ſome other reſpect. So it was under the Jewiſh economy, and ſo it is now. To admit, therefore, a miniſter to preach among us, with whom we ſhould have no objection to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune, could we allow the validity of infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; as it is a token of our affection for a ſervant of Chriſt, of our love to the truth he preaches, and is not contrary to any part of divine revelation, muſt be lawful: or if not, it lies with our brethren to prove it; becauſe they cannot deny that the word of God requires us to love him, and to manifeſt our affection for him. But as to communion at the holy table, Chriſtians in general have had no more doubt, whether baptiſm ſhould <hi>precede</hi> it, according to a ſpecial revelation of the divine will; than whether baptiſm itſelf be a part of the counſel of God.— When we aſk a Paedobaptiſt miniſter to preach in any of our churches, we act on the ſame general principle, as when we requeſt him to pray with any of us in a private family. And as no one conſiders <hi>this</hi> as an act of church communion, but as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our affection for him, ſo we conſider <hi>that;</hi> and it is viewed by the public, as a branch of the general intercourſe which it is not only lawful, but commendable and profitable to have, with all that preach the goſpel.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, that circumciſion was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

                  </gap>r of the righteouſneſs of faith, a a preacher of that righteouſneſs, and one of Eze<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kiel's worthies, (Chap. xiv, 14, 16, 18, 20.)—Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck, though a king, and a prieſt of the moſt high God; ſuperior to Abraham, and the greateſt perſonal type of the Lord Meſſiah that ever was among men—And Job, though for piety there was none like him upon earth, Jehovah himſelf being judge, and one of the prophet's illuſtrious triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, (Ezek, as before.) Theſe I ſay, notwithſtanding all their piety and holineſs, notwithſtanding all their ſhining excellencies, exalted characters, and uſeful ſervices; could not, as uncircumciſed, have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to communion with the choſen tribes at the tabernacle of the God of Iſrael, without a violation of the divine command. This, I perſuade myſelf, our opponents muſt allow: this, I think, they dare not deny. Yet if Enoch, for inſtance, had been in the camp of Iſrael when Korah and his company mutinied, and had been diſpoſed to give the rebels a lecture on the ſecond coming of Chriſt; I cannot ſuppoſe that his offered ſervice would have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by Moſes or Joſhua, merely becauſe he was not circumciſed. Or, if Noah had been preſent at
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:020976_0150_0FB2064AE5449A88"/>the erection of the tabernacle, and inclined to give the people a ſermon on the future incarnation of the Son of God, and the righteouſneſs of faith; to which moſt important objects that ſacred ſtructure, with its coſtly utenſils and ſolemn ſervices, had a typical regard; I cannot but think they would have given him a hearing. Nay, I appeal to our opponents themſelves, whether they do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſo as well as I. Yet that favoured people <hi>could</hi> not have admitted them to communion in ſome other branches of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip, without tranſgreſſing the laws of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah.</hi> (Exod. xii. 44, 48. Ezek. xliv. 7.) If this be allowed, the conſequence is plain, and the argument, though analogical, is irrefragable. For the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal feaſt and the ſanctuary ſervices were not more of a poſitive nature than the Lord's ſupper; nor were the former more peculiar to that diſpenſation than the latter is to this; but preacing and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word are not peculiar to any diſpenſation of grace, as are baptiſm and the ſacred ſupper.</p>
               <p>Our Lord, though he warned his hearers againſt the pride and hypocriſy, the unbelief and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of the ancient Phariſees, and Scribes, and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh teachers; yet exhorted the people to regard the truths they delivered. (Matt. xxiii, 1, 2, 3.) Our opponents notwithſtanding, cannot imagine that Chriſt would have admitted thoſe eccleſiaſtics. to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, had they deſired it; nor will they aſſert that any, who are not proper ſubjects of that ordinance, ſhould be received into communion.—When the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved diſciple ſaid, <q>Maſter, we ſaw one caſting out devils in thy name, and we forbad him, becauſe he followeth not with us:" Jeſus anſwered, Forbid him not; for he that is not againſt us, is
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:020976_0151_0FB2064C96DF02D0"/>for us.</q> Luke ix. 49, 50. From which it appears, that we are under obligation to encourage thoſe that fight againſt the common enemy, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the common truth; though they and we may have no communion together, in the ſpecial ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God's houſe; which is the very caſe when we admit our Paedobaptiſt brethren to preach among us—We are alſo informed, that the firſt Gentiles who were converted by the apoſtolic miniſtry, were endued with miraculous gifts immediately upon their believing and before they were baptized; for they ſpoke with tongues and glorified God. (Acts. x. 44.) Nor is it improbable but ſome of them then received gifts for the miniſtry; and if ſo, in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their hearts and the tranſport of their joy, they alſo gave the firſt ſpecimen of their future mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, to the pleaſing aſtoniſhment of Peter and thoſe that were with him. But can our brethren ſuppoſe, that the great apoſtle would have taken equal pleaſure in hearing them requeſt a place at the Lord's table, before they were baptized? No; his own conduct oppoſes the thought. For, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held with aſtoniſhment the gifts they received, and hearing with rapture the truths they delivered, <q>he <hi>commanded</hi> them to be baptized in the name of the Lord;</q> to be baptized <hi>immediately</hi> in the name of that Lord, who requires a ſubmiſſion to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from all that believe.</p>
               <p>Once more: A very competent judge of all that pertains to the miniſterial character, and of all that belongs to a Chriſtian profeſſion, has left his opinion on record concerning the miniſtry of certain perſons, whom he conſidered as quite unworthy of his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friendſhip. Yes, Paul, that moſt excellent man,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:020976_0152_0FB206535E2FE3D8"/>when acting as amanuenſis to the Spirit of wiſdom, and when ſpeaking of ſome who preached the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, informs us, that <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>ſtrife</hi> were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on which they acted, and the <hi>increaſe of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi> the end which they had in view. How car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and baſe the principles! How deteſtable the end at which they aimed!—But was the apoſtle offended or grieved, ſo as to wiſh they were ſilenced? Or, did he charge his beloved Philippians, and all the ſincere followers of Chriſt, never to hear them? Let his own declaration anſwer the queries. <q>What then? not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, <hi>Chriſt is preached;</hi> and therein I do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</q> (Philip. i. 15—18.) When a corrupted goſpel is preached, he aſſerts his apoſtolic authority, and thunders out anathemas againſt the propagators of it. (Gal. i. 6—9.) Becauſe, as God will not ſet the ſeal of his bleſſing to a falſhood, or ſanctify a lye, it can do no good; it is pregnant with miſchief. But when the pure goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though on perverſe principles, as it is <hi>the truth,</hi> God frequently owns and renders it uſeful, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may publiſh it.

But though that man of God thus expreſſes himſelf, in reference to goſpel preaching; I cannot imagine, nor will our brethren affirm, that he would with the ſame plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure have admitted any of the Jewiſh converts to communion, becauſe they ſuppoſed themſelves to have been baptized, merely on account of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been waſhed according to the traditions of the elders.

                  <pb n="155" facs="unknown:020976_0154_0FB20656E7CB9388"/>Yet, as Baptiſts, our opponents muſt conſider infant ſprinkling, as having nothing more to recommend it, than <hi>human authority</hi> and <hi>general practice;</hi> which were the grand recomendations of thoſe Jewiſh waſhings, and the very baſis on which they ſtood.— Suppoſe our brethren in the courſe of their reading, were to find it aſſerted by ſome ancient author, <q>That Paul frequently admitted perſons to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, on ſuch a pretence to baptiſm;</q> what would they ſay? They would, I preſume, conſider the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion as a libel on his character. They would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrate the pen which tranſmitted ſuch a falſehood to poſterity; and look on the writer, either as a weak and credulous man, or as a forger of lies. And, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a predilection for free communion biaſſed their judgment, their opinion and cenſure would be much the ſame, were they to find it recorded; <q>He fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently admitted believers to the Lord's table; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> they were baptized.</q> The utter ſilence of the New Teſtament, relating to a conduct of this kind; the many paſſages, in that infallible code of divine worſhip, inconſiſtent with ſuch a practice; and their veneration for the character of the great apoſtle, would oblige them ſo to do. Yet, amazing to think! for ſuch a procedure they plead; ſuch a conduct they adopt; and look upon as greatly injuring the honour and intereſts of real religion, and not a little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the cauſe of infidelity; merely becauſe we cannot conſider them as the followers of Paul in this particular, nor become their humble imitators!</p>

                  </q> Which, by the way, is more than can be aſſerted concerning the ſacred ſupper; for though he inſtituted it with great ſolemnity, yet we do not read that he <hi>partook</hi> of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Welfius <hi>in Luc.</hi> xxii. 18.</note> Was not the adminiſtration of baptiſm ſo honoured at the river Jordan, when the great <hi>Immanuel</hi> ſubmitted to it; when the eternal <hi>Father,</hi> by an audible voice, declared his approbation of it; and when the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended on the head of Jeſus, juſt emerged from the water, as no other inſtitution ever was?

And ſome of his followers have been ſo diſguſted with that form of baptiſm, that they have given profane inſinuations that thoſe words were not originally in the ſcripture; but were taken from the uſual doxology into the form of baptiſm, and then inſerted into the text of Matt. xxviii. 19. <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt.

               <p>Mr. Daniel Turner has alſo borne his teſtimony to the uſefulneſs and importance of baptiſm.

<pb n="161" facs="unknown:020976_0160_0FB206661B55F878"/>being baptized, was the <hi>common token</hi> of ſubjection to Chriſt, <hi>and neceſſary to a regular entrance into his viſible church.</hi>
                  </q> And, when deſcribing the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of thoſe that are to be received into commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he ſays; <q>They ſhould be acquainted with the chief deſign of the rites and poſitive inſtitutions of Chriſtianity, and <hi>reverently uſe them;</hi> viz. baptiſm, and the Lord's ſupper.</q> Once more: Speaking of that reſpect which the two poſitive appointments have to viſible fellowſhip among believers, he ſays; <q>

               <p>After ſuch conſiderations as theſe, relating to the vaſt utility and grand importance of baptiſm, one cannot but wonder at Pacificus, Candidus, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of our opponents that were never ſuſpected of Antitrinitarian error; calling that ordinance, a <hi>non-eſſential,</hi> an <hi>external rite,</hi> an <hi>indifferent thing,</hi> a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> a <hi>mere outward form;</hi> comparing it with <hi>the antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rite of circumciſion,</hi> in the apoſtolic age. How different this way of talking from the quotations I have juſt produced; eſpecially thoſe I have taken
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:020976_0161_0FB20668D0C07B90"/>from pieces that were either publiſhed, or compoſed and recommended, by my worthy friend Mr. Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land! For he looks upon baptiſm, in connection with the Lord's ſupper, as of <hi>unſpeakable importance</hi> to the glory of God, and the very being of a true church upon earth. He inſiſts upon it, that baptiſm demands the believer's regard, <hi>prior</hi> to the holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as it was appointed to be firſt adminiſtered: and he ſeverely cenſures thoſe <hi>inconſiderate mortals,</hi> who treat the ordinance lightly.—Mr. Turner alſo, as we have ſeen, maintains that baptiſm is <hi>the duty of Chriſtians in general;</hi> that it is the <hi>common token</hi> of our ſubjection to Chriſt; that it is <hi>neceſſary to a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar entrance</hi> into the viſible church; and that it is the <hi>foundation</hi> of external communion in the houſe of God. Surely, then, theſe authors cannot but be greatly grieved, if not offended, which thoſe diluting terms and that degrading compariſon, which are uſed by Meſſieurs Pacificus and Candidus, when ſpeaking of the ordinance! Nay, they will be ready to retort upon them that heavy charge, with thoſe <hi>Peaceful</hi> and <hi>Candid</hi> Gentlemen levelled at us; and to remind them that, by treating baptiſm in ſuch a manner, they greatly injure <q>the honour and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of true religion, and not a little contribute to the cauſe of infidelity.</q> For they have united in repeatedly calling baptiſm <hi>a non-eſſential;</hi> and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with that obſolete appointment <hi>circumciſion,</hi> of which judaizing Chriſtians of old were ſo fond. This being the caſe, I am heartily glad that theſe worthy authors have <hi>reprobated</hi> their conduct, and ſo <hi>publicly condemned</hi> their way of thinking, in regard to baptiſm. It may ſerve, perhaps, as an antidote againſt the hurtful influence of their <hi>Modeſt Plea;</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="unknown:020976_0162_0FB20669AB242C98"/>nor may it be entirely uſeleſs to Pacificus and Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus themſelves. But yet, methinks, I could ſincerely wiſh, as Mr. Ryland and Mr. Turner are pretty well acquainted with thoſe writers, that they would ſeriouſly examine and converſe with them <hi>in private,</hi> on the ſubject about which they <hi>ſo widely differ.</hi>—And I may juſt hint, that as they are the fitteſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the world to perform the friendly office, they need not fear provoking their choler. For as their names are, <hi>Candid</hi> and <hi>Peaceful,</hi> ſo is their temper; and it might have a beneficial effect, by making them more careful what they write and publiſh in future, in regard to free communion.—But I return from this digreſſion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bunyan, when ſpeaking of baptiſm, calls it an <hi>outward circumſtantial thing</hi>—A <hi>ſhadow,</hi> an <hi>outward circumſtance—Water—water—water—water—water;</hi> five times over, in ſo many lines. And a ſubmiſſion to baptiſm he deſcribes in equally, degrading lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. For he repreſents it, as an <hi>outward conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to an outward circumſtance</hi>—As an <hi>outward and bodily conformity to outward and ſhadowiſh circumſtances</hi>—And calls it <hi>obedience to water.</hi>

               <p>The Lord's ſupper, however, is conſidered and treated by them in a different manner; for they ſpeak of it as a <hi>delightful,</hi> an <hi>edifying,</hi> an <hi>important</hi> inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>But ſuppoſing it is evident, that baptiſm is <hi>much inferior</hi> to the ſacred ſupper, in point of importance; yet, while it is an ordinance of God, it has an equal claim on our obedience.

                  <hi>SECTION VI.</hi> Reflections on the diſtinguiſhing Character, <hi>Strict Baptiſts,</hi> which our Brethren apply to us.</head>
               <p>OUR opponents, I obſerve, repeatedly call us, <hi>Strict Baptiſts;</hi> but whether for ſo doing they merit commendation, or deſerve cenſure, may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be a queſtion with ſome. If, by the epithet
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:020976_0170_0FB2067C61693CE8"/>
                  <hi>ſtrict,</hi> they mean <hi>exact, accurate, conſcientiouſly nice;</hi> their candour deſerves commendation. In that ſenſe of the term we are not aſhamed to be called <hi>Strict, Baptiſts;</hi> we cheerfully adopt the character.</p>
               <p>It may, however, admit of a query, whether we be ſo fully entitled to poſſeſs this honour without a rival, as our brethren ſeem to inſinuate. Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſtricter than the <hi>apoſtles,</hi> in regard to communion at the Lord's table? That remains to be proved. Is it becauſe we conſider baptiſm as equally the duty of <hi>all</hi> believers? This, indeed, we maintain: and the reaſon is, thoſe arguments which prove it the duty of one, will apply to all. Or, is it becauſe we conſider baptiſm as <hi>a term</hi> of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? We, it is true, avow the ſentiment; but it is far from being peculiar to us. For it appears from the foregoing pages, that we act on a principle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in common by Chriſtians of almoſt every name, in every age, and in every nation. When, therefore, we are compared with profeſſing Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in general, we have no peculiar claim to the epithet <hi>ſtrict;</hi> whatever right we may have to the denomination of <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> or whatever be our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing character, when oppoſed to our brethren with whom we now contend.—Nor can we be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than <hi>ſtrict,</hi> without violating our own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and contradicting our own practice. For <hi>we</hi> believe that all who have received the truth, ſhould profeſs their faith in Jeſus Chriſt and be baptized. And have we not the happineſs, in this reſpect, of agreeing with our brethren? When we made a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic declaration of our dependence on Chriſt, and gave a reaſon of the hope that is in us, we believed it was <hi>our</hi> duty to be baptized, before we received the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>ſupper. Did not our opponents do the ſame? or had it no place at all in their creed? In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch a conviction, <hi>we</hi> were actually immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the name of the Lord, before we approached the holy table. And were not they alſo? But how came it to be either <hi>our</hi> duty, or <hi>theirs,</hi> thus to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed? Was it becauſe they or we <hi>believed</hi> that it was required of us? Or, did a full perſuaſion of this kind conſtitute that <hi>a duty,</hi> which would no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been obligatory? If ſo, a Catholic may lawfully adore the hoſt, a Muſſulman revere Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and a Jew blaſpheme the Meſſiah. No; that which made it our duty to be baptized, and then to receive the Lord's ſupper, was <hi>the command of God;</hi> which lies on every perſon ſo qualified, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing agency of the divine Spirit, as we humbly conceived ourſelves to be. Now, can it be ſuppoſed that this command extends to none but thoſe among real converts, who feel its force on their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? Or, may we ſafely conclude, that a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is no further obliged by any divine precept, or prohibition, than he <hi>ſees</hi> and <hi>acknowledges</hi> the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in regard to himſelf? If ſo, a believer who has been baptized, may live all his days in the neglect of communion at the Lord's table, and ſtand acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of blame; and covetouſneſs is no crime, in thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands who bow at the ſhrine of Mammon; for there are comparatively few lovers of money, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their guilt in that reſpect. Nay, on this principle it will follow, that the more ignorant any believer is, and the leſs tender his conſcience, he is under ſo much the leſs obligation to obey the divine commands.

No; it is not our <hi>conviction</hi> of the propriety, the utility, or the neceſſity of any command which he has given, that entitles him to the performance of it; but, in all things of a moral nature, our being <hi>rational creatures</hi> is the ground of his claim; and in thoſe of a poſitive kind, our <hi>being qualified</hi> according to his direction, whether we be ſo wiſe and ſo ſincere as to acknowledge the obligation, or no. Thus it appears that the epithet <hi>ſtrict,</hi> if taken in the ſenſe already explained, is no diſhonour to us.</p>
               <p>But if, on the contrary, our brethren mean by the epithet, that we are <hi>bigotted, unneceſſarily exact, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripturally confined;</hi> their forwardneſs to give us a name calls for our cenſure. In the former ſenſe, I will venture to affirm, every Baptiſt <hi>ought</hi> to be a <hi>ſtrict</hi> one, or elſe to renounce the name. In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe of the term, we reject the diſtinguiſhing epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet, and require our opponents to prove—I ſay to <hi>prove,</hi> not to ſurmiſe, that it juſtly belongs to us. And that they uſe the word in this <hi>obnoxious</hi> meaning appears to me, by the tenor of their arguing; by ſuperadding that harſher epithet <hi>rigorous;</hi> and by that home charge, of greatly injuring <q>the honour and intereſt of true religion, and <hi>not a little contributing to the cauſe of infidelity?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But if we be <hi>Strict Baptiſts,</hi> what are they? Our brethren will not be offended, if I again aſk, What <hi>are</hi> they; and by <hi>what name</hi> ſhall we call them? That they are not <hi>ſtrict</hi> Baptiſts, is out of all diſpute; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from ſuch they expreſsly diſtinguiſh themſelves, and have abundant reaſon, if the charge juſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned be true, to be <hi>aſhamed</hi> of them. I am obliged,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:020976_0173_0FB2068624D48338"/>therefore, if it be lawful for me to imitate their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiouſneſs, and to give them a name, (for as yet they are <hi>half</hi> anonymous) to ſearch for ſome ſignificant and deſcriptive adjective, that will ſet them at a <hi>wide diſtance</hi> from the ſtrict Baptiſts. But what muſt it be? <hi>Innaccurate,</hi> or <hi>looſe,</hi> or <hi>latitudinarian?</hi> I would not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly, be guilty of a miſnomer; but as all theſe terms are very different in their meaning from that obnoxious word <hi>ſtrict,</hi> it can hardly be ſuppoſed that. I am far from the truth. As they profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> there we agree; but as they hold the ordinance of baptiſm with a <hi>looſe hand,</hi> there we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and hence the neceſſity of ſuch oppoſitely ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant epithets, to mark our different conduct. For names, you know, are ſo much the more perfect, by how much the more they expreſs the nature and properties of perſons and things. Yes, the practice of our opponents makes it evident to all the world, that the term <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> when applied to them, is to be underſtood in ſuch a latitude of ſignification, as will comport with receiving perſons to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who, in their judgment, are <hi>unbaptized.</hi> That is, they are <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> when the ideas expreſſed by that name ſuit the diſpoſitions of their hearers; and they entirely omit the ordinance, from which they take their denomination, when candidates for communion with them do not approve of it. And, which makes their conduct, in this reſpect, appear exceedingly ſtrange, they do not, like his Holineſs of Rome, expreſsly claim a diſpenſing power; nor, in the madneſs of enthuſiaſm, pretend to any new revelation; nor yet, with the diſciples of George Rox, confider baptiſm as a temporary inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Our character, then, is fixed. Their own pens
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:020976_0174_0FB20687A657F6B8"/>have engroſſed it. And, be it known to all men, we are <hi>Strict Baptiſts.</hi> To this character, as before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, we ſubſcribe with hand and heart; in the laſt words of the celebrated Father Paul, <hi>Eſto perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua.</hi> Theirs I have attempted to draw, in contraſt with ours, and will now venture to call them, <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinarian Baptiſts.</hi> Whether they will allow the name to be juſt, and eſteem it as we do ours, I am not certain. But of this I make no doubt, that the religious world in general, were they to ſee and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the opinion and practice of our brethren; would pronounce it deſcriptive of the perſons to whom it is given. <hi>Strict Baptiſts</hi>—they will permit our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to ſtand firſt, as it has confeſſedly the right of primogeniture—<hi>Strict Baptiſts! Latitudinarian Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts!</hi> Theſe characters, in contraſt, ſound very oddly, I muſt confeſs; and they are but of a novel date. For they do not appear to have had an exiſtence till about the middle of the laſt century. What a pity it is but ſomething of a ſimilar kind could have been found, in the ancient monuments of the Jewiſh church, relating to circumciſion, as a prerequiſite for communion in it. Had it appeared, in any authentic records, that the ſons of Abraham, in times of yore, were divided in their judgment about that obſolete rite; and that ſome of them were called <hi>Strict Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſioniſts,</hi> and others <hi>Latitudinarian Circumciſioniſts;</hi> it would have given, at leaſt, an <hi>air</hi> of antiquity to our brethren's hypotheſis, practice, and character. But—we muſt take things as we find them.</p>
               <p>I juſt now recollect, what many of my readers muſt know to be fact, that our Paedobaptiſt brethren, when they have a mind to ſhew their wit and be a little merry at our expence, repreſent the Baptiſts,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:020976_0175_0FB20689C1231788"/>without diſtinction, as <hi>exceedingly fond</hi> of water; as profeſſors that cannot <hi>live</hi> in a church ſtate, without <hi>a great deal of water.</hi> Nay, one of them has very politely called us <hi>'watery Bigots;'</hi> and then adds, <q>Many ignorant ſprinkled Chriſtians are often, to their hurt, <hi>pulled by them into the water.</hi>

                  </q>—Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Gentleman, then, we are <hi>watery bigots.</hi> Well, it does not greatly diſtreſs <hi>me</hi> to be thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by a ſneering antagoniſt; becauſe I really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>much water</hi> is neceſſary to baptiſm, and am no leſs confident, that baptiſm is neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion at the Lord's table. But ſince I have maturely conſidered the ſingular character and peculiar ſituation of our latitudinarian brethren, I can by no means think it either candid or equitable that <hi>they</hi> ſhould be thus repreſented. Becauſe it is evident, evident even to demonſtration, that their profeſſion and practice taken together will not admit of it. They, it muſt be acknowledged, will ſometimes declaim aloud on the neceſſity of a profeſſion of faith, and of immerſion in the name of the triune God, to conſtitute that baptiſm which is from heaven. So, when they write on the ſubject, and publiſh their thoughts to the
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:020976_0176_0FB2068C5F4C2178"/>world at large, they aſſert theſe things with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt confidence. They will alſo, with the venerable John, go down into Jordan, and there adminiſter the ſignificant ordinance: ſo that one would be tempted to think they were <hi>ſtrict</hi> Baptiſts, <hi>real</hi> Baptiſts, and that Baptiſm has no <hi>faſter friends</hi> upon earth. But when they plead for free communion, they <hi>talk</hi> a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent language; they ſpeak of it as an indifferent thing and a mere trifle, that is not worth contending about. And, when they admit communicants, they often <hi>act</hi> in a different way; for, in receiving a Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dohaptiſt, what they conſider as real baptiſm is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſet aſide. They might, conſequently, with equal conſiſtency, admit believers to their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who have neither been immerſed nor ſprinkled; and ſo, like the Quakers, have nothing at all to do with <hi>water</hi> in the worſhip of God. Whether, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a perſon has been immerſed in a river, be the waters ever ſo <hi>many;</hi> or ſprinkled with that element from the palm of the hand, be the drops ever ſo <hi>few;</hi> or has had no concern with water <hi>at all,</hi> it makes no material difference with them, in point of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So, then, as they can receive members into their communities, ſubſiſt in a church ſtate, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy fellowſhip at the Lord's table, with either <hi>much</hi> water, or <hi>little</hi> water, or <hi>none at all;</hi> I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that if our bantering opponent would do them juſtice, while he diſplays his own wit, he ſhould give them a <hi>different name.</hi> For though they ſeem, at ſometimes, to be as fond of water as we are; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon it, that where there is no immerſion there is no baptiſm; yet, at others, they warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend, that believers of <hi>all</hi> denominations, (i. e. Baptiſts with <hi>much</hi> water; Paedobaptiſts, with <hi>little</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="unknown:020976_0177_0FB20691A99658D8"/>water; and Katabaptiſts without <hi>any water</hi> at all) have a right of communion with them in the ſacred ſupper. It behoves the Doctor, therefore, if ever he favour us with another addreſs, to ſearch for a new diſtinguiſhing epithet, to connect with the term <hi>bigots,</hi> that ſhall include and expreſs theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ideas. But whether our own language be able to furniſh an adjective comprehenſive enough, on ſuch an occaſion, I dare not aſſert: very probably, however, among thoſe numerous compounds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the language of ancient Greece, he may find one that is fit for the purpoſe. And as it is not every one, no, nor every Doctor, who could have thought of that elegant phraſe, <hi>'Watery Bigots;'</hi> I doubt not the fertility of his invention, and the well known accuracy of his pen, when handling the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, will enable him to give our brethren a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive character, that ſhall be equally polite and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſuitable.</p>
               <p>Though I am far from ſuſpecting that our breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren want ſincerity, or from thinking that they violate the dictates of conſcience, in maintaining their very ſingular hypotheſis; yet their conduct, in regard to baptiſm, has ſuch an <hi>ambiguous</hi> appearance, and looks ſo much like holding <hi>both ſides</hi> of a contradiction, that I ſhould not wonder if one or another of our Paedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt opponents, were to apply them with a little alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the ſpirited remonſtrance of Bp. Hall to Abp. Laud. The latter being ſtrongly ſuſpected of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilection for Popery, and the former intending to deal roundly with him on that ſubject, addreſſed him in the following language. <q>I would I knew where to find you—To day you are in the tents of the Romaniſts; to morrow in ours; the next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:020976_0178_0FB20692F14A9F30"/>both, againſt both. Our adverſaries think you ours; we theirs—This of yours is the worſt of all tempers. Heat and cold have their uſes; luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs is good for nothing but to trouble the ſtomach—How long will you halt in this indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency? Reſolve one way, and know, at laſt, what you do hold; what you ſhould. Caſt off either your wings or your teeth; and, loathing this bat-like form, be either a bird or a beaſt. If you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, why not now?—God crieth with Jehu, <hi>Who is on my ſide, who?</hi>—Take you <hi>peace;</hi> let me have <hi>truth,</hi> if I cannot have both.</q> * Thus the acute and good Biſhop Hall, to one who halted between two opinions; who was neither an uniform Papiſt, nor a conſiſtent Proteſtant.</p>
               <p>And now, before I conclude, our brethren will ſuffer me alſo to remonſtrate; and the reader may reſt aſſured, that I do it without the leaſt impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their integrity; If infant ſprinkling be a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man invention, diſown it, renounce it, entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, and no longer let it hold the place of a divine inſtitution in any of your churches. But if it be from Heaven, embrace it, profeſs it, practiſe it in the face of the ſun, and lay the other abſolutely aſide, as deſtitute of a divine warrant. For as there is but <hi>one God,</hi> and <hi>one faith,</hi> ſo there is but <hi>one baptiſm.</hi> Divine truth is conſiſtent; divine ordinances are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, for they are not yea and nay; and all the Chriſtian world are conſiſtent with themſelves, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to baptiſm; be ye, therefore, conſiſtent, in this, as you are in other reſpects. That is, be either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> or <hi>Paedobaptiſts;</hi> for, according to your preſent practice, all thinking and impartial men muſt pronounce you an <hi>heterogeneous mixture</hi> of both.</p>
