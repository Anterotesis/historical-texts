            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>HISTORY no where informs us of any event ſo extraordinary as the late revolution in France. If viewed on all ſides, with its attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances, by an attentive and unprejudiced eye, it muſt ſurely excite the greateſt aſtoniſhment; and thoſe who have been uſed to unite in their minds the providence of God with human occurrences, (whether they approve of this great change of things or not,) cannot help inquiring, <hi>Is this from men, or is it from God?</hi> Is it one of thoſe commotions produced by the conflicting paſſions of men, that riſe and ſink, and are ſoon forgotten; or is it one of thoſe events which mark the great aeras of time, and from which originate new orders of things?—If the latter, it is undoubtedly the theme of prophecy.</p>
               <p>Appearances indicate that this will be a fatal ſtroke to the Papal uſurpations, and to the reign of deſpotiſm. Thoſe prophecies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which direct our hopes to that intereſting period, when all Antichriſtian tyrannies are to periſh, deſerve, at this time, peculiar attention. But where ſhall we find a clue to guide us in our inquiries? The author of the following thoughts conſulted commentators the moſt generally approved, on the Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation of John. He found much to edify and excite curioſity, but was ſtill in the midſt of a wilderneſs. At length he was determined to commit himſelf to his own inveſtigations, and explore theſe regions of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, without placing implicit confidence in any guide. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances led him to conjecture, that the beaſt which John ſaw coming up out of the earth, was <hi>Lewis the Fourteenth,</hi> or the French tyranny perfected by him, and ſupported by his ſucceſſors, and that it was this beaſt which ſlew the witneſſes. This is the clue which he has followed, and he thinks it is that by which the mazes of theſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful viſions, at leaſt as far as they have been accompliſhed, may be traced with preciſion, and ſome things which are yet to come be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured with great advantage. But without this to guide us, all ſeems confuſion.</p>

A ſerious application to the ſtudy of the prophecies, and an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive obſervation of the ſigns of the times, have produced in my mind the ſtrongeſt perſuaſion, that the utter downfal of the Papacy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> of deſpotiſm, the reſtoration of the Jews, and the renovation of all things, are near at hand; and that every year will aſtoniſh us with new wonders. <hi>"As the days of Noe were, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came and took them all way, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of Man be</hi>

                  </note>." From this perſuation ariſes the indiſpenſable duty of calling the attention of mankind, with peculiar earneſtneſs, to the things which belong to their peace. <hi>"Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and ſound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble; for the day of the Lord coming, for it is nigh at hand</hi>

               <p>I know what an author, who writes on ſubjects like theſe, has to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. But my heart tells me, that I publiſh theſe thoughts with the pureſt intentions, and that my only aims are to ſerve the intereſts of Chirſtianity, to promote the welfare of my countrymen and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe of humanity, by inviting men to conſider the <hi>ſigns of the times;</hi> that, as <hi>individuals,</hi> and as a <hi>nation,</hi> we may examine our ways, <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>reform;</hi> that thus the Divine diſpleaſure may be averted, and <hi>that</hi> conſtitution, which has ſecured to this empire ſo many bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to which moſt other nations are ſtrangers, may be purified and ſtrengthened, and by theſe means be continued to our poſterity.

                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſa. ix. 6, 7.</note>, who have long been the prey of deſtroyers, and of one another. If we contemplate the principles of the kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, they promiſe fair to produce the enjoyment of all that which the prophets predicted. But where is the effect? The annals of the Chriſtian world, as well as thoſe of the Pagan, diſcover to us little more than the hiſtory of ambition, ſuperſtition, and bloodſhed. The career of this kingdom began in piety towards God, and in love and peace to all mankind. But ſyſtems of error, ſuperſtition, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſoon interrupted its progreſs, and perverted its principles. Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianity has been converted into a ſyſtem of commerce, and thoſe called the miniſters of Chriſt, have been a corporation of traders in the ſouls and liberties of mankind.</p>
               <p>Were I to attempt to define the character of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> I ſhould ſay, <hi>It is all that which oppoſes itſelf to the kingdom of Chriſt, whether it flow from the eccleſiaſtical or civil powers.</hi> The civil conſtitutions of nations, as well as the eccleſiaſtical, ſo far as they accord with, or have a tendency to promote, that pride and that ambition which lead to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, perſecution, and war, are Antichriſtian. Whatever in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is deſtructive of union among Chriſtians, which leads to domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over conſcience, to hinder free enquiry after truth, or any way oppreſſes and perſecutes men for matters cognizable only by God, is Antichriſtian. Whenever there is intolerance: wherever we find conditions of communion among Chriſtians impoteſt, which Chriſt hath not clearly enjoined; wherever creeds and modes of worſhip are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by human power, and men are made to forfeit any of their civil rights, or are ſtigmatized on theſe accounts, there is that ſpirit which is not of God. Wherever one Chriſtian, or ſect of Chriſtians, aſſumes the ſeat of authority and judgment in the church of Chriſt, whether they call for fire to deſtroy thoſe who diſſent from them, or only exclude them from their communion and affection, there is a portion of that ſpirit of Antichriſt which has ſo long oppoſed itſelf to the benign prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the kingdom of the Prince of Peace, has been the cauſe of ſo many evils to humanity, and the occaſion of making the inconſiderate eſteem the amiable religion of Jeſus, as a ſource of miſchief inſtead of benevolence? Alas, how much of this ſpirit remains amongſt us all! How few have learned, that

                  <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt circumciſion is nothing, and uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we are aſſured from the ſcriptures, that all theſe uſurpations and Antichriſtian principles ſhall have an end; and that the goſpel will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the various happy effects which are predicted. The religion of Chriſtians ſhall then no longer conſiſt in

               </p>
               <p>The queſtion is, When may we hope to ſee theſe predictions accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed? Long have a pious few had their eyes fixed on the promiſes of God with ardent expectation, and been crying, <hi>How long, O Lord, ere thou wilt avenge the blood of thy ſaints, and create Jeruſalem a quiet dwelling place, and Zion the joy of all the earth? Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly!—Behold I come at an hour when ye think not! bleſſed is he that watcheth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some ſuppoſe, that all our inquiries about the time of the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the predictions relative to the downfal of Antichriſt, which is to prepare the way for the peaceful kingdom of the Redeemer, are in vain. If ſo, wherefore is it ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy?</hi> Rev. i. 3. <hi>Here is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the beaſt,</hi> xiii. 18.</p>
               <p>Though the meaning of the prophecies is neceſſarily wrapt up in modes of expreſſion not eaſy to be underſtood, as they would otherwiſe operate againſt their own accompliſhment; yet they may not be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inſerutable; and eſpecially when their accompliſhment approaches nearer, and increaſing light is caſt upon them by the ariſing of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances connected with them. This ſeems to be intimated by the angel, Dan. xii. 4, 9, 10. <hi>But thou, O Daniel, ſhut up the words, and ſeal the book, even to the time of the end: many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed.—The words are cloſed up and ſealed till the time of the end. None of the wicked ſhall underſtand, but the wiſe ſhall underſtand.</hi> The meaning of theſe words, according to the learned Dr. Lowth, is, "The nearer the time approaches for the final accompliſhment of the prophecy, the more light ſhall men have for the underſtanding it; for the gradual completion of this and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies ſhall direct obſerving readers to form a judgment concerning thoſe particulars which are yet to be fulfilled. From hence we may obſerve the reaſon of the obſcurity of ſeveral prophecies in ſcripture; and it may be obſerved, that generally thoſe prophecies are moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, the time of whoſe completion is furtheſt off. For the ſame reaſon, in interpreting the prophecies relating to the <hi>latter times</hi> of the world, the judgment of the <hi>latter</hi> writers is to be preferred before that of the <hi>ancients;</hi> becauſe the moderns, living nearer the times when the events were to be fulfilled, had ſurer marks to guide them in their expoſitions." Lowth's Expoſ. Dan. xii. 4. Ver. 9, he paraphraſes thus: "Be content with what has been made known to thee, (Daniel): for the fuller explication of this prophecy is deferred till the time of its accompliſhment draws near." The opinion then of this learned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentater was, that God would ſo diſpoſe things, that obſerving men ſhould, from the ſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In America a revolution has taken place, which is ſingular in its conſequences, and eſpecially as they concern the ſtate of religion. We have long been told, that if the Chriſtian religion were left unprotected by eſtabliſhments, and unſupported by emoluments, it would ſoon he borne down, and all its ſolemnities forſaken and deſpiſed. The experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has here been made, and fact demonſtrates the fallacy of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. The people are caſed of a heavy burden, and pure and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed religion flouriſhes more than ever. Hirelings have withdrawn, but piety and virtue, charity and union increaſe. But a few years after this grand event, one of the firſt nations in Enrope, long enſlaved, and blinded by ſuperſtition, at once broke its chains, and tore away the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages with which Popiſh prieſts had bound the eyes of the multitude. Civil liberty had long been forgotten, and, for more than a hundred years, no liberty of conſcience was permitted to the inſulted people: And, as a nation, they had for ages been made, by their tyrants, the ſcourge of all their neighbours. This people have, to the aſtoniſhment of the whole civilized world, aroſe up as in one day, and, in oppoſition to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined power of their king, their prieſts and nobles, have dared to ſay, <hi>We will be free—We will have juſt and equal laws—No man ſhall puniſh, and no man ſhall be puniſhed, but as the law commands—The poor as well as the rich ſhall be protected—Conſcience is the property of God, and every man ſhall worſhip his Maker as he pleaſes—We will never make war, but in ſelf-defence, and will embrace all men as our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> And this was not the reſolution of a few, it was the ſolemn covenant of twenty-ſix millions or people. What a phaenomenon in the hiſtory of man! What an epoch in the hiſtory of the church! But German deſpots and their creatures, whoſe exiſtence depends on the ignorance and ſervility of mankind, fearing the influence of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, have been exerting all their power to cruſh this riſing ſpirit of liberty, and to ſupport the falling Papacy. By whoſe hand was it that they and their remnant were driven back with loſs and ſhame? His, who maketh the <hi>wrath of man to praiſe him.</hi>—Alas! the calamities which oppoſition to the moſt benevolent ſentiments has occaſioned! The paſſions of men have been enraged, and in the paroxyſm of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, fear, and deſpair, the beſt of cauſes, the cauſe of liberty, has been ſtained by the commiſſion of crimes which afflict a great majority of their own nation; and all the genuine friends of liberty and juſtice throughout the world. None can contemplate them but with the keeneſt anguiſh, except thoſe who are watching for occaſions to ſlander all who reſiſt oppreſſors. The circumſtances of this wonderful revolution, mark it as an event of vaſt importance, and as probably big with conſequences beyond all conjecture.</p>
               <p>The prophecies reſpecting the downfal of the Antichriſtian uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, muſt have their accompliſhment in ſome era; it may be the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. It is therefore ſurely worth our while to inquire how far the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of God's word will agree with the riſe and progreſs of known events.</p>
               <p>Thus it has appeared to me; and the more I examine and think upon the ſubject, the more I am convinced, that the laſt days ſpoken of by God's ſervants the prophets, are faſt approaching; <hi>when Babylon the Great ſhall come in remembrance, and God will avenge the blood of his ſaints, and the kingdoms of this world ſhall become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt;</hi> by not only profeſſing the religion of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,

And this kingdom ſhall not be a kingdom of anarchy, but a ſtate of things, in which the governors and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all the different ranks in ſociety, will unite to promote the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral good. It is not impoſſible that the preſent ſhaking of nations ſhould bring about this deſirable event. Some however object, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the French revolution has been marked with too much outrage and blood; and that the perſons engaged in it are of a character too bad to admit it to be from God,—a work which he approves, and which he intends as the introduction to thoſe happy days of which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have ſpoken.</p>
               <p>It would not be a very difficult taſk to prove, that thoſe German princes, and domeſtic foes to liberty, who have oppoſed the emancipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of France from the yoke of royal and prieſtly tyrants, have been the occaſion of almoſt all the horrors which have been committed; and as their hands will much of the blood be required, which has been, or may hereafter be ſhed, in this mighty and intereſting ſtruggle, between men rouſed up by the ſeverity of their ſufferings, to claim the rights they had long been robbed of, and thoſe continental tyrants who, for ages, have been the ſcourges of the human race. But granting that the leaders in the French revolution have been as attrociouſly wicked as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, this does not, in the ſlighteſt degree, affect our hypotheſis.</p>
               <p>Though many of the inſtruments which Providence employs may be unworthy characters, and though the extraneous evil connected with the revolution in France may afflict our hearts, and provoke not only our cenſure, but our indignation, ſtill the great principles of it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our homage, and the end to be hoped for, the triumphs of truth and juſtice over ſuperſtition, perſecution, and oppreſſion, may excite our joy. Cyrus waded through the blood of kings and armies to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth, and ſubject nations to his will; (he ſpared not children. Iſa. xiii. 18.); but we have been taught to venerate his memory, as the righteous man of the eaſt. And why? Not becauſe all his exploits, us his, were righteous, but becauſe we have ſeen the iſſue, and been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he was made an inſtrument in the hand of God, to execute his righteous judgments; that it was <hi>He</hi> who gave nations before him, and made him rate over kings, that Babylon might fit in the duſt, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Iſrael go free.

               <p>Sir Iſaac Newton had a very ſagacious conjecture, which he told to Dr. Clark, from which Mr. Whiſton ſays be received it, viz. "That the overbearing tyranny and power of the Anchriſtian party, which hath ſo long corrupted Chriſtianity, and enſlaved the Chriſtian world, muſt be put a ſtop to and broken to pieces by the <hi>prevalence of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> for ſome time, before primitive Chriſtianity could be reſtored; which ſeems to be the very means now working in Europe for the ſame good and great end of Providence."

               <p>This was a very ſagacious conjecture indeed; and it is not unlikely that it may ſoon be realized. There are reaſons for fearing, that are long infidelity will as generally prevail as the name of Chriſtianity has done. It is in vain to flatter. It is too evident, that though the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity of individuals, among all ranks and ſects, has been genuine, yet that of nations has been only in name. <hi>By their fruits ſhall ye know them.</hi> The generality of governments have been oppreſſive; a great majority of the miniſters of religion have not only been men of the world, who have ſought after nothing but gain, but they have been cruel lords o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God's heritage, perſecuting inſtead of feeding the flock; teaching men to hate, oppreſs, and murder one another, for opinions; inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating thoſe leſſons of love taught by Jeſus Chriſt. Among the rich and great even the forms of religion are ſcarcely to be found. The ſpeil of the poor is in their houſes, and becauſe they are full they forget God, and are waxed wanton.

But it is probable that this diſguiſe, before the conſummation of all things, will be ſtripped off, and the nations be made to appear in their true character, and thus may be fulfilled, in a ſenſe that has not been ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that prediction of the prophet Iſaiah (chap. xxv. 7.) <hi>He will deſtroy the face of the covering</hi> (the maſk) <hi>caſt over all people, and the vail that is ſpread over all nations.

               <head>FIRST INQUIRY.</head>
               <p>IN endeavouring to make good this hypotheſis, that <hi>the ſigns of the times</hi> indicate the ſpeedy downfal of all that ſpiritual and civil tyranny, which for ſo many ages has prevailed, in oppoſition to the principles of the kingdom of Chriſt, the Prince of Peace, there are three inquiries which claim our attention.</p>
               <p>The firſt reſpects the <hi>dragon</hi> and the <hi>beaſts,</hi> which John ſaw in his viſions. Rev. xi. 7. xii. and xiii.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reſpects <hi>the witneſſes,</hi> Rev. xi.—and the third inquiry is, Whether all numbers of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> which refer to the latter days, will agree with the preſent times? Let us, with that reverence and devout candour which become us when we apply to the word of God for inſtruction, attend to theſe ſeveral inquiries.</p>
               <p>The grand ſcene of the prophetic viſions of John opens in the fourth chapter of the Revelation, and is continued to the end of the book. The whole may be conſidered as a number of ſcenic pictures. Chapter the eleventh is a miniature picture of the hiſtory of the church (the weſtern church eſpecially) from the earlieſt times to the downfal of all Antichriſtian uſurpations. The following viſions are of the ſame pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture variegated, for our inſtruction, on a larger ſcale.</p>
               <p>As there are ſome, into whoſe hands thoſe pages may fall, who have not been uſed to attend to ſubjects like theſe which we are going to diſcuſs, it may be proper briefly to conſider the origin of that ſort of language, and of thoſe hieroglyphic, or more properly ſymbolical, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, which we meet with in the prophets.</p>
               <p>The firſt mode of writing appears to have been by pictures of things, and it muſt have been a long time before mankind arrived at any degree of perfection in the ſcience of letters, as we now have it. To expreſs ideas by a combination of letters, ſyllables, words, and ſentences, is a more wonderful invention than moſt people imagine. The moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way of communicating our conceptions by marks and figures, is by tracing out the images of things; and this is actually verified in the caſe of the Mexicans, whoſe only method of writing their laws and hiſtory, when the Spaniards firſt viſited them, was by this picture writing. The hieroglyphics and ſymbols of the Egyptians and Hebrews, were an improvement on this rude and inconvenient eſſay towards writing. It would be improper to enter far into this ſubject here; I ſhall therefore ſay no more than juſt what may be thought neceſſary to ſhew that the figurative ſtyle, and the ſymbolical repreſentations, which we meet with in the ſcriptures, are not ſo out of the way as ſome may be apt to imagine; nor the workmanſhip, as Dr. Warburten

               <p>In the ſymbols and hieroglyphics of the ancients, a <hi>lion</hi> ſtood for <hi>ſtrength and courage;</hi> a <hi>bullock</hi> was a repreſentation of <hi>agriculture;</hi> a <hi>horſe</hi> of <hi>liberty; a ſpkinx</hi> of <hi>ſubtilty;</hi> a <hi>pelican</hi> of <hi>paternal affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> a <hi>river-horſe</hi> of <hi>impudence; horns</hi> of <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>pre-eminence.</hi> Among the Phenicians a <hi>horn</hi> was the enſign of <hi>royalty;</hi> and hence
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030090_0010_0FE47426AB5A1948"/>they came to be uſed by the prophets, to denote <hi>ſovereignty</hi> and <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſtates</hi> and <hi>kingdoms.</hi> The <hi>ſun, moon,</hi> and <hi>ſtars</hi> alſo, were the ſymbols of <hi>ſtates</hi> and <hi>kingdoms, kings, queens,</hi> and <hi>nobility;</hi> their <hi>eclipſe</hi> ſtood for the <hi>temporary</hi> difaſters which afflicted them, and their extinction, for their <hi>entire</hi> overthrow. If this be conſidered, we need not wonder at what we meet with in the holy ſcriptures, and eſpecially in the prophecies. The prophets ſpeak in the language of the times in which they lived, and repreſent things under ſymbols then well underſtood; and though this mode of repreſenting things is not ſo uſual among us, yet we have ſomething of it too. Modern heraldry is a ſort of hieroglyphics, and we here meet productions as fictitions and monſtrous as a lion with the wings of an eagle, or as a beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns.</p>
               <p>In the prophetic writings, fierce and ſavage beaſts are the hieroglyphic emblems of tyrannic monarchies and ſtates, and the peculiarities of theſe monarchies and ſtates are repreſented by ſuitable creatures, and by ſuch appendages, as are proper to identify them, and deſcribe their characters. Thus in Dan. vii. 4. the kingdom of Babylon is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented under the image of a <hi>lion with eagle's wings,</hi> to type out, not only its power, but the rapidity of its conqueſts, and the height of ſplendour to which it was raiſed. The kingdom of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians,</hi> (ver. 5.) is repreſented by a <hi>bear</hi> with <hi>three ribs in its mouth,</hi> to which it was ſaid, <hi>Ariſe, devour much fleſh.</hi> This was to ſhew the cruelty of theſe people, and their greedineſs after blood and plunder. Their character was that of the all-devouring bear, which has no pity. The ribs in the mouth of it repreſent thoſe nations which they eſpecially made a prey of.—The kingdom of the Macedonians, or Grecians, is characterized (ver. 6.) by a <hi>leopard,</hi> with <hi>four heads,</hi> and <hi>four wings of a fowl.</hi> The leopard is remarkable for its ſwiftneſs; hence, and eſpecially with the wings on its back, it was a fit emblem of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of the Macedonians under the command of Alexander, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered part of <hi>Europe</hi> and all <hi>Aſia</hi> in ſix years. As the lion had <hi>two</hi> wings, to repreſent the rapidity of the Babylonian conqueſts, ſo this leopard has <hi>four,</hi> to ſignify the ſwifter progreſs of the Macedonians. The <hi>four heads</hi> alſo are ſignificant. They are intended to repreſent the ſame circumſtance as the four horns of the he-goat in the eighth chapter. Fifteen years after the death of Alexander, his brother, and two ſons being murdered, his kingdom was broken, or divided, by Caſſander, Lyſimachus, Ptolemy and Seleucus, into four leſſer king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which they ſeized for themſelves.</p>
               <p>It may not be amiſs in this place, to take notice, that whereas, in this viſion in the <hi>ſeventh</hi> chapter, the <hi>Medo Perſian</hi> empire is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented under the emblem of a <hi>bear,</hi> and that of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> under that of a <hi>leopard;</hi> in that of chapter the eighth, the former is typed out by a ram (ver. 3.) with two horns, one higher thau the other, and the higher came up laſt; and the latter by a he-goat, &amp;c. Theſe were moſt apt repreſentations of theſe two empires. For a ram was the royal enſign of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as the eagle was that of the Remans, and as the lion is of England; and the figures of rams' heads with horns, the one higher than the other, are ſtill to be ſeen among the remains of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>That which appeared in the imagination of Nebuchadnezzar as the legs and feet of a great image, whoſe brightneſs was excellent, (Dan. ii. 31—45.) and the form terrible, is here repreſented to Daniel as a fierce and ravenous beaſt. This is the Roman empire, which ſucceeded the Macedonian. "This beaſt," ſays Biſhop Newton, "was ſo great and horrible, that it was not eaſy to find an adequate name for it; and the Roman empire was dreadful and terrible, and ſtrong exceedingly, beyond any of the former kingdoms. It was divers from all kingdoms, not only in its republican from of government, but likewiſe in ſtrength and power, and greatneſs, length of duration, and extent of dominion. <hi>It devoured and brake in pieces, and ſtamped the reſidue with the feet of it</hi> It reduced Macedon into a Roman province about 168 years; the kingdom of Pergamus about 183 years; Syria about 65 years, and Egypt about 30 years, before Chriſt. And beſides the remains of the Macedonian empire, it ſubdued many other provinces and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; ſo that it might, by a very uſual figure, be ſaid to devour the whole earth, and to tread it down and break it in pieces, and became in a manner, what the Roman writers delighted to call it, <hi>terrarum orbis imperium,</hi> "the empire of the whole world." Ver. 7. <hi>And it had ten horns.</hi> And according to the interpretation of the angel, (ver. 24.) <hi>the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings,</hi> or kingdoms, <hi>that ſhall ariſe. Four kings,</hi> a little before, (ver. 17.) ſignify <hi>four kingdoms;</hi> and ſo here ten kings are ten kingdoms, according to the uſual phraſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology of ſcripture. "We muſt look," ſays this learned author, "for theſe ten kingdoms, among the broken pieces of the Roman empire. This empire, as the Romaniſts themſelves allow, was, by means of the incurſions of the northern nations, diſmembered into ten kingdoms; and Machiavel, a Papiſt, little thinking what be was doing, (as Biſhop Chandler obſerves,) has given us their names. 1.

               <p>The ſaints are ſaid to be given into the hand of the horn for a time, times, and dividing of times, and it is given to the beaſt to continue forty and two months, and in Rev. xi. 3. it is ſaid to be 1260 days. The ſame period of time is meant; for a time is a year, times two years, and the dividing of times, half a year, that is, three years and a half (or forty-two months of thirty-days) which are the ſame as the 1260 days; for the ordinary Jewiſh year conſiſted of 360 days, which multiplied by three and a half, amount to that number. And in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic ſtyle, a day is reckoned for a year. Compare Numb. xiv. 34. Ezek. iv. 6, Dan. iv. 16. xii. 7. Rev. xi. 2, 3. xii. 14. xiii. 5. This continuance ſignifies, that he is to practiſe and proſper thus long, for the Greek word refers to the time of his prevailing, not of his exiſting. He will exiſt a little longer, for he will be ſome time a ſlaying after he is attacked.</p>
               <p>Thus, as preparatory to the conſideration of the following ſubjects, I have endeavoured, in as brief a way as poſſible, to ſhew the origin of hieroglyphic or ſymbolical repreſentations, and the aptneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſuch as we have in the writings of the prophets. We will now enter upon our inquiries.</p>
               <p>Let us firſt conſider the viſions in the twelfth and thirteenth chapters, and eſpecially the viſion of the ſecond beaſt, chap. xiii. 11—18. for if theſe be underſtood, we ſhall have a key to unlock, not only the myſteries of the eleventh chapter, but of many others which follow. Chap. xii. 3. <hi>And there appeared another wonder in heaven, and behold a great red dragon, having ſeven heads and ten horns, and ſeven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew the third part of the ſtars of heaven, and did caſt them to the earth,</hi> &amp;c. Moſt of the authors whom I have conſulted, though they allow this chapter to contain a repreſentation of the perſecutions of Pagan Rome, yet have ſtrangely ſpiritualized this dragon, ſo that whilſt we are cautioned of our danger from inviſible ſpirits, the true object is forgotten, and we beat the air.</p>
               <p>There can be no doubt, but the devil is a principal agent in all ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies, eccleſiaſtical and civil; but what is here repreſented by the moſt terrific imagery, appears to be no other than that cruel civil tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Romans, which caſt down all the powers, and ſwept away all the remains of liberty, in Europe, the then ſuppoſed third part of the world; and which, while the imperial head remained in full power, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecured with unrelenting cruelty the church of Chriſt in its infancy; and under all the deſpotiſms which have ariſen from it, has, more or leſs, continued to oppoſe the kingdom of Chriſt. If we compare what is ſaid of the <hi>dragon</hi> in this book with Pſal. lxxiv. 13, 14. Iſa. xxvii. 1. li. 9. Pſal. lxxxvii. 4. lxxxix 10. Ezek. xxix. 2—5. and xxxii. 2. it much confirms our hypotheſis. The tyranny of Egypt, which oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and perſecuted the people of Iſrael, was the type of this; but as this is ſo much more cruel, additional tropes are therefore crowded together, to impreſs us with its enormity; and it is not only the <hi>dragon</hi> and the <hi>ſerpent,</hi> but the <hi>devil</hi> and <hi>ſatan.</hi> While the <hi>firſt beaſt</hi> in the next chapter is the repreſentation of <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual</hi> tyranny, as exerciſed by the Antichriſtian clergy, this dragon repreſents the civil tyranny exerciſed by the Roman Emperors, and by their ſucceſſors, ſo far as they have been, or are tyrannic, in the ſeveral kingdoms which
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030090_0014_0FE474352E8800A8"/>have ariſen out of the ruins of that empire; and eſpecially by thoſe who are now called the <hi>Emperors of Germany,</hi> who profeſs, more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, to ſucceed the deſpots of ancient Rome. They have the ſame origin, and their juriſdiction is alike extenſive; and hence they both appear with ſeven heads and ten horns. This dragon, we ſhall find, gave to the beaſt his power and his ſeat, and great authority; but he ſtill continued, and although wounded, remains to this day, nor has he ever ceaſed to practiſe deſtruction. All the world have worſhipped <hi>him</hi> that gave power unto the beaſt; yea, ſo baſe and ſervile have men been, that they have paid divine homage and paſſive obedience to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer, and have ſaid, in the fulneſs of their folly, not only of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al tyranny, Who is like unto the beaſt! But of civil deſpotiſm, Who is like unto the dragon!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chapter the thirteenth,</hi> verſe the firſt. <hi>I ſtood upon the ſand of the ſea, and ſaw a beaſt riſe up out of the ſea, having ſeven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blaſphemy. And the beaſt which I ſaw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave him his power, and his ſeat, and great authority.</hi> Having ſaid ſo much concerning the <hi>fourth beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>little horn,</hi> in the viſion of <hi>Daniel;</hi> and ſeeing that all Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are pretty well agreed that, by this beaſt, the Papal power, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by the Biſhop of Rome, ſupported by his clergy, and by thoſe princes who have acknowledged his juriſdiction, is intended, the loſs need be ſaid in explaining theſe verſes. As the great red dragon was the <hi>civil</hi> power of Rome, exerciſed by the emperors and their agents, ſo this is the Roman <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> tyranny, exerciſed by the Pope and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian clergy, who have converted the benevolent religion of Jeſus into a ſyſtem of traffic and perſecution, and, as has been obſerved, is the ſame with the little horn in <hi>Daniel the ſeventh.</hi> Its riſing out of the ſea may refer to thoſe commotions of nations which very much favoured the riſing of the Papal tyranny.

And, by the ſeat of the imperial government being removed from Rome, firſt by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to <hi>Byzontium (Conſtantinople),</hi> and afterwards into <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> from whence it paſſed into <hi>Germany,</hi> the Popes became poſſeſſed of <hi>Rome,</hi> the old ſeat of the imperial govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Thus encouraged, he went on his impious career, enjoining not only the worſhip of ſaints and angels, but of images and relies, teaching that he was God's vicegerent and Chriſt's vicar on earth; and that, as ſuch, he had power to grant indulgences, and to pardon ſins, and thus, by theſe, and a great many other abominable dogmas, he blſaſphemed and ſcandalized the perfections, prerogatives, and laws of God; and diſhonoured the memory of them that dwell in heaven, as if they approved of ſuch wicked idolatry and prieſtly craft—And not only was this eccleſiaſtical power exerciſed at Rome, but over diſtant and numerous nations, and great has been the ſlaughter which he has made among thoſe, who, in reſpect to the divine authority, and the rights of conſcience, have rejected his abominable errors, and reſiſted his arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant pretenſions.

Or, if you pleaſe, from a whirlpool which draws into its vortex, and ſwallows up every thing, the moſt precious to man.</p>
               <p>Hiſtorians have repreſented <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. as raiſing the French monarchy to the pinnacle of its glory. And if pride and ambition, perſecution and bloodſhed, conſtitute ſupreme glory, he did ſo. But, <hi>the wiſdom of the world is fooliſhneſs with God.</hi> O the folly and cruelty of men! They create devourers, as if for the pleaſure of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing and celebrating their exploits of blood; and even think it impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to complain when their own turn arrives to be devoured!</p>
               <p>How perfectly do theſe two deſcriptions of the ſecond beaſt agree! The angel deſcribes him as aſcending out of the abyſs; John ſees him riſing out of the earth. And what ſort of a ſpot may we ſuppoſe the theatre of his riſing to be? The choiceſt ſpot which nature can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh?

               <p>
                  <hi>And he had two horns like a lamb.</hi> Here we may obſerve, that the <hi>Bourbons,</hi> formerly kings of <hi>Navarre</hi> only, on the extinction of the family of <hi>Valois,</hi> in 1589, which reigned over France, were become poſſeſſed of both kingdoms; and <hi>Henry</hi> IV. grandfather of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. in whom the kingdoms were united, took the titles of <hi>King of France and Navarre.</hi> Theſe were his two horns like a lamb.</p>

                  <hi>And he ſpake as a dragon.</hi> His profeſſion of that religion which teaches to be meek and harmleſs, preſents an appearance of innocence, but when he opens his mouth, the accents are thoſe of a dragon, which beſpeak him formed for miſchief, and not for the benefit of mankind. All this agrees exactly with the French tyranny, and particularly with <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. who was at once a ſuperſtitious devotee and a cruel deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot; who, though ſtyled the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> practiſed the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the dragon, who made war with them who kept the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and had the teſtimony of Jeſus.

But no ſooner was <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, arrived to years than he formed the reſolution of deſtroying the Proteſtants. Did we not know him to have been a beaſt, we could hardly give credit to the report of the motive which puſhed this reſolution into practice. "Soon after be came to the crown," ſays <hi>Mr. Claude,</hi> page 43. "there aroſe in the kingdom a civil war which proved ſo ſharp and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe of the reformed religion ſtill kept their loyalty ſo inviolable, and accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with ſuch a zeal, and with a fervour ſo extraordinary, and ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, that the king found himſelf obliged to give public marks of it by a declaration made at <hi>St. Germains</hi> in the year 1652. Then, as well at court as in the armies, each ſtrove to proclaim loudeſt the merits of the Reformed." But, can you believe that there is ſo much depravity in human nature? Their enemies ſaid, "If on this occaſion this party could preſerve the ſtate, this ſhews likewiſe that they could have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown it; this party muſt therefore by all means be cruſhed." <hi>Lewis,</hi> and the abettors of his tyranny, inſtantly ſet about it. "A thouſand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As ſoon as the kingdom was ſettled in peace, they fell upon them, and perſecuted them in every imaginable way. They were excluded from the king's houſehold,—from all employments of honour and profit,—all the courts of juſtice, erected by virtue of the <hi>Edict of Nants,</hi> were aboliſhed, ſo that in all trials their enemies only were their judges, and in all the courts of juſtice the cry was, "<hi>I plead againſt a heritic</hi>

               <p>Orders were printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſent from thence to all the cities and pariſhes of the kingdom, which empowered the parochial prieſts, church-wardens, and others, to make an exact inquiry into whatever any of the Reformed might have done or ſaid for twenty years paſt, as well on the ſubject of religion as otherwiſe, to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of this before the juſtices of the peace, and puniſh them to the utmoſt extremity. Thus, the priſons and dungeons were every where filled with theſe pretended criminals; orders were iſſued, which deprived them in general of all ſorts of offices and employments, from the greateſt to the ſmalleſt, in the farms and revenues; they were declared incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of exerciting any employ in the cuſtom-houſes, guards, treaſury, or poſt-office, or even to be meſſengers, ſtage-coachmen, or waggoners. <hi>Now</hi> a college was ſuppreſſed, and <hi>then</hi> a church ſhut up, and at length they were forbid to worſhip God in public at all, by the revocation of the <hi>Edict of Nants,</hi> in 1685. <hi>"Now,"</hi> ſays <hi>Saurin,</hi> "we were baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>then</hi> we were forbidden to quit the kingdom, on pain of death.

The ſtory which lies before me, related by Mr. <hi>Bion,</hi> chaplain on board the Supurbe Galley in 1703, and who was converted from Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by means of the ſcene of ſuffering and patience, which was exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on board that veſſel, when eighteen Proteſtants were baſtinadoed for refuſing to bow the knee, in honour of the myſteries of the maſs, is too excrutiating to tell. As alſo the ſufferings of poor <hi>M.

This little ſtory leaves a deeper ſtain of baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon the character of <hi>Lewis</hi> and his court, than, perhaps, all their other enormities. It was adding that ſort of wanton cruelty to ſlate oppreſſion, which is peculiarly abhorent in the eſtimation of a generous mind. And let us remember, this ſame ſyſtem of deſpotiſm and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution remained till overthrown in 1789. None of theſe cruel laws againſt the Proteſtants were repealed, nor a particle of arbitrary power ſurrendered. Thus, in that country from whence the light of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion firſt iſſued, and where there were more faithful witneſſes againſt the Papal apoſtacy than in any other nation of the world; and from whoſe number and influence, and the laws in their favour, the old perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting power was greatly reduced; there, the uncontrouled reign of of Antichriſt was reſtored.</p>

His great wonders were his alarming e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts; and the ſire which he made to come down from heaven on the earth, in the ſight of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>And he commanded that they ſhould make an image to the beaſt, which had the wound by a ſword and did live,</hi> i. e. This tyrant cauſed a ſyſtem of dominion over conſcience, a ſyſtem of perſecution to be eſtabliſhed, which was the image of the firſt Papal beaſt; for although it was not ſo extenſive a tyranny, as that exerciſed by the Pope, being confined to one kingdom, yet it was the ſimilitude of it. The eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical tyranny now eſtabliſhed was peculiar; it was at once independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and yet in ſupport of the tyranny of the Papal beaſt. In all the other kingdoms where Popery prevails, the ſpiritual power is exerciſed by the Pope; hereties, as they are called, are accuſed, tried, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in his courts, by virtue of laws iſſuing from him, and by his miniſters.

This was a tyranny perfect in us kind, and unknown in other countries; the ſimilitude of the beaſt which had the wound by a ſword and did live—the <hi>beaſt,</hi> of <hi>Rome.

                  </gap>s good providence, has always preſerved to mankind a ſucceſſion of both deſcriptions. Even wiſe and good men have not, perhaps, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently conſidered the worth and importance of the witneſſes of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſcription, in fulfilling the great deſigns of God's goodneſs towards
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030090_0024_0FE47487C09FED68"/>men; and hence they have almoſt always interpreted this prophecy as relating to the <hi>ſtate of religion</hi> only; as if the <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>political</hi> ſtate of men were held in little conſideration by the Lord of the whole earth. But can any man ſhew a good reaſon why the <hi>Hampdens, Sydneys, Lockes,</hi> and <hi>Hoadleys,</hi> may not be con be conſidered as God's <hi>witneſſes,</hi> in their exertions in the cauſe of <hi>civil liberty,</hi> though it may be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an inferior capacity, as well as thoſe who have been employed in the defence of pure religion only? Both have wrought in the cauſe of God, and both have propheſied in ſackcloth.</p>
               <p>If we candidly conſider the matter, the <hi>fourth verſe</hi> ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the foregoing ideas. And although what is ſaid in the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>ſixth</hi> verſes is more obſcure, yet, as far as I can underſtand them, they are not inapplicable to either of theſe characters. Ver. 4, <hi>Theſe are the two elive trees, and the two candleſticks, ſtanding before the God of the whole earth.</hi> We have long been uſed to affix to theſe two beautiful tropes, <hi>olive trees</hi> and <hi>candleſticks,</hi> the idea of <hi>ſaints;</hi> but this is by no means eſſential, for they neceſſarily imply no more than excellence in that character which is ſuſtained, whether religious or civil. Alluſion is here made to the emblems under which <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> were repreſented to the prophet Zechariah (chap. iv. 11-14.); one of whom was employed in re-eſtabliſhing (after the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and in a time of religious and civil peeſecution) the <hi>religious,</hi> and the other the <hi>civil</hi> polity of the Jews. And what have the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, in all ages, and in all countries, who have combated tyrants in the cauſe of liberty and juſtice, as well as the advocates for the uncorrupted truth of Jeſus, been, but golden candleſticks, whoſe lights have illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this dark world, and which have at once made conſpicuous the rights of men and the enormities of oppreſſors—the truth of Jeſus, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties of Antichriſt? And but for the zeal of both theſe, in their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent characters, being kept burning, by that oil of benevolence tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards man, and love to the truth of God's word, which the <hi>olive trees</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What follows is ſtill more highly figurative. Ver. 5, 6. <hi>And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth their enemies.

Rev. xvi. <hi>There,</hi> on the pouring out of the firſt vial, <hi>there fell a grievous ſore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the men who had the mark of the beaſt, and upon them who worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his image; here,</hi> the witneſſes <hi>ſmit the earth with all plagues.— There,</hi> on the pouring out of the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>third</hi> vials, the ſea and the rivers became blood; <hi>here,</hi> the witneſſes turn the waters into blood, and reſtrain the rain of heaven. <hi>There,</hi> on pouring out the fourth vial upon the ſun, men were ſcorched with great heat; <hi>here,</hi> fire proceeds out of the mouths of the witneſſes to devour their enemies. May not this highly figurative deſcription be made more intelligible thus?

And even where dates are fixed, as in the predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reſpecting the return of the Jews from Babylon, after 70 years cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and the appearance of the Meſſiah after 70 weeks, or 490 years; yet the commencement of theſe periods, or the mode of calculation, is involved in obſcurity, till light is thrown upon them by the event. It never was intended that men ſhould know with certainty when any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture event is to take place, and this for an obvious reaſon. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, we ſhould remember, were deſigned not to gratify our <hi>curioſity,</hi> but to confirm our <hi>faith</hi> in the truth of the divine word, by their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment. And hence the neceſſity that theſe <hi>three days and a half</hi> ſhould have a different meaning from the common prophetic days, that thus the time might not ſo eaſily be aſcertained, till the accompliſhment ſhould lead men to their true intention. Were the prophecies ſo clear, that every one could preciſely know the circumſtances, and the time
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030090_0030_0FE474F16111DDB8"/>to which they refer, hindrances, if we may ſpeak thus, would be thrown in the way of God's deſigns; and, in many caſes, a cheek would be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the neceſſary exertions and purſuits of men.

All allow that the language of theſe kinds of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies is very enigmatical, and that days, in ſcripture, are often of a very indeterminate ſignification. But let us imagine a ſimilar caſe. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, on the appearance of our Saviour, a Jew had ſaid to his neighbour, "I think that by the ſeventy weeks of Daniel, (chap. ix. 24—27.) we are to underſtand ſeventy weeks of years, (ſeventy times ſeven) or four hundred and ninety years, and that they are now about to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; and hence it deſerves inquiry whether this Jeſus be not the Meſſiah." It might have been objected, "But where, in our ſacred ſcriptures, does a <hi>week</hi> intend <hi>ſeven years?</hi>"—"No where. But though this be the caſe, yet as this manner of reckoning ſeems to be quite conſiſtent with the enig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030090_0032_0FE4752905F43738"/>ſeven of days, and never ſeven of <hi>years:</hi> whereſover it is abſolutely put, it means of days, is no where uſed of years. Gen. xxix. 27.

               <p>Many have taken it for granted, that that general expectation of the Meſſiah's ſpeedy coming, which prevailed among the Jews, about the time of our Lord's appearance, originated from their interpretation of theſe <hi>weeks</hi> of <hi>Daniel.</hi> But this appears to be taken for granted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof. It is more likely that their expectation aroſe from a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a prophecy of Elias, which is well known to have been generally received among them, viz. that the world was to ſtand ſeven thouſand years; two thouſand without the law, two thouſand under the law, two thouſand under the Meſſiah, and that then was to follow the ſabbatical thouſand; as alſo from the viſit of the wiſe men from the eaſt; the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> and the miniſtry of John the Baptiſt, whom all the people took for a prophet. I can no where find that Jews ever reckoned theſe <hi>weeks</hi> as <hi>ſeven of years.</hi> The objection then would have been as valid in the ſuppoſed caſe, as it is here reſpecting <hi>lunar days.</hi> But whatever the reader's opinion may be reſpecting the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But before we enter upon the conſideration of the vials, permit me to adduce ſome authorities, which, eſpecially if we conſider the time when they were written, more than a hundred years ago, tend very much to ſtrengthen the argument in favour of my hypotheſis reſpecting the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, their ſlaying and reſurrection. The firſt I ſhall mention is <hi>Peter Jurieu,</hi> a French Proteſtant miniſter, whoſe works were publiſhed in Engliſh in 1687. He ſays, "The tenth part of the city which here fell, will, at ſome future time, appear to be the kingdom of France, where a revolution will take place about the year 1785, and a ſeparation from the Papacy follow, when the names of Monks and Nuns, of Carmelites, Auguſtines, Dominicans, &amp;c. ſhall periſh for ever, and all thoſe vain titles, and armorial bearings, which ſerve for ornament and pride, ſhall vaniſh; and brotherly love make all men equal. Not that there ſhall be no diſtinctions; for it is not a kingdom of anarchy, but government ſhall then be without pride and inſolence, without tyranny and violence, and ſubjects ſhall obey their governors with an humble ſpirit." The time required, according to this author, after the quickening of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes (<hi>i. e.</hi> from the time of the revolution) to deſtroy Autichriſt, will be twenty-five years; and that it will take about ſeventy years more for the aboliſhing of ſects and parties among Chriſtians, and for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Jews and Heathens. "And all this" he ſays, "cannot be broughtabout without confuſion and tumult. The Popiſh empire cannot fall, but it muſt cauſe blood and a mighty noiſe." Thus far <hi>Juricu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Goodwin, who wrote a hundred and fifty years ſince, in his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon the Revelation,</hi> Part I. chap. 7. has a great deal which is as aſtoniſhing as it is appoſite to the preſent argument. He ſays, ſect. 6. "The ſaints and churches of France, God has made a wonder to me in all his proceedings towards them, firſt and laſt; and there would ſeem ſome great and ſpecial honour reſerved for them yet at the laſt; for it is certain, that the firſt light of the goſpel, by that firſt and ſecond angei's preaching in <hi>chapter the fourteenth</hi> (which laid the foundation of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt's ruin) was out from among them, and they bore and underwent the great heat of that morning of perſecution, which was as great, if not greater, than any ſince.—And ſo, as that kingdom had the firſt great ſtroke, ſo now it ſhould have the honour of having the laſt great ſtroke in the ruin of Rome."</p>
               <p>Sect. 5th. he ſays, on Rev. xi. "By the earthquake here is meant a great concuſſion or ſhaking of ſtates, political or excleſiaſtical.—The effect of this earthquake, and fall of this tenth part of the city, is killing <hi>ſeven thouſand of the names of men.</hi>—Now, by men of name, in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is meant men of title, office, and dignity.—As in the caſe of Corrah's conſpiracy, ſo here a civil puniſhment falls upon theſe.—For having killed theſe witneſſes, themſelves are to be killed (haply) by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bereft of their names and titles, which are to be rooted out for ever, and condemned to perpetual forgetfulneſs."</p>
               <p>The ſingular agreement of preſent events with what theſe authors fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told from the prophecies, ſo many years ago, is a circumſtance which merits the ſerious attention of all wiſe and conſiderate men; for it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly adds great weight to the conjecture, that what has taken place in France, is the beginning of the final downfal of the Papal uſurpations and tyrannies. And if it ſhould be ſo, woe be to them who attempt to uphold what God has willed to fail! In the ordinary wars which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have waged, they have, perhaps, loſt one or two hundred thouſand lives, and ſlaughtered as many of their enemies: countries have been

My heart trembles at the idea of thoſe cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which are to ſweep the earth, and of thoſe convulſions which ſhall make kingdom and nations!

               <p>As to the gathering of the harveſt and vintage in the fourteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the time ſeems not yet come for their elucidation.

He ſays, in his Expoſition, part II. chap. I. "Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the winepreſs will be brought into this country, he only knows who is the Lord both of the harveſt and the vintage;" (reader, mark well what follows): "only this may be more confidently affirmed, that thoſe carnal Proteſtants in England, and other places, who, like the outward court, have been joined to the people of God, ſhall yet, before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of the beaſt's kingdom and number

It ſtrikes me, that although the <hi>vial</hi> which is to be poured out upon the <hi>earth,</hi> will commence firſt, and that on the <hi>ſea</hi> follow, yet their failing ſtreams will mingle; and although the fall torrent of the latter <hi>vials</hi> may not commence, yet ſome ſmall portion of them may be daſhed upon the rivers, the ſun, or the throne of the beaſt, while the firſt are pouring out; and although the plagues of the latter vials will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence laſt, as in the viſion, yet the ſtreams of the former may ſtill be cunning. The angel's ſaying of this woe, that it cometh <hi>quickly,</hi> and the encumſtance of the ſeven angels with their vials all appearing, and being ſent out at the ſame time, ſuppoſes that they will all be employed together, to execute their miſſions on the leveral objects of the divine diſpleaſure. And we may hope that theſe judgments will ſoon be over.</p>
               <p>Were I to detail half the opinions of authors on the following objects of the Divine vengeance, adding to them my own conjectures, this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet would ſwell into a folio; but as I apprehend that the events which are here repreſented have not yet taken place, or at moſt, are but now commencing, my reflections ſhall be ſhort.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And the firſt went and poured out his vial upon the earth, and there fell a noiſome and grievous fore upon the men which had the mark of the beaſt, and upon them which worſhipped his image.</hi> The pouring out of this vial upon the earth may poſſibly refer to ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar country on the main, where the judgments of God are to commence; or, perhaps, we may be taught by this emblem, that the downfal of the Antichriſtian kingdom ſhall begin with terrible wars on land, in which God's wrath ſhall be manifeſted againſt thoſe armies of land forces which have for ſo many ages been the baſis of tyrannic power, and who, at the nod of deſpots, have ſlaughtered their fellow-creatures, without either thinking or caring about the juſtice or injuſtice of the cauſe; who have been the baſe inſtruments, without a motive, of deſolating nations, and of carrying unnumbered woes from one end of the earth to the other. But the time of judging the cauſe of the dead is come, and both they who have the <hi>mark</hi> of the beaſt, i. e. who are the ſubjects and ſlaves of the Papacy, and they who <hi>worſhip,</hi> or only ſerve and endeavour to ſupport the image of the beaſt, (which, according to what appears from chap. xiii. is the tyranny of the Antichriſtian party in France, all ſuch as ſerve this image of the beaſt, though not Papiſts and flaves to Rome) ſhall experience ſuch enaſtiſements and diſappointments in their attempts to ſupport what God has determined to overthrow, and ſuch violent and ſucceſsful attacks on their power, that they ſhall be deeply wounded,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030090_0038_0FE4753C4CFD3200"/>and grievouſly vexed; or, a noiſome diſeaſe ſhall get into their camp, and cover the earth with their dead: that thus men may ſee the hand which ſmites them, and give glory to God, * <hi>Ye can diſcern the face of the ſky, but can ye not diſcern the ſigns of the times?</hi> Who drove back, and cut off, by a noiſome and grievous diſeaſe, the invading army of Brunſwick?

               <p>Ver. 3. <hi>And the ſecond angel poured out his vial upon the ſea, and it became as the blood of a dead man, and every living ſoul died in the ſea.</hi> As in Iſa. lx. 5. "The abundance of the ſea ſhall be cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto thee," means the inhabitants of Iſlands, or of lands come at by ſea; and as by the ſea, chap. viii. 8. was intended the mariting countries of Europe, and as "woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the ſea," chap. xii. 12. means woe to the inhabitants of continents and of Iſlands, all mankind, ſo the pouring our of this ſecond vial on the ſea, may indicare thoſe calamities which God will bring upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the ſupporters of Papal tyrannies, in ſuch ſituations; or, if the meaning of the pouring out of this ſecond vial of wrath is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted to this ſenſe, it may probably refer alſo to the deſtruction of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val armaments, whether in battle, or by God's more immediate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And ſo great will the deſtruction be, that the ſea will not only be ſtained with blood, but become <hi>as the blood of a dead man.</hi>

               <p>Ver. 4. <hi>And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of water, and they became blood,</hi> &amp;c.

The calamities which are to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this vial, are to be peculiarly grievous. This may be concluded from the following circumſtance: <hi>I heard the angel of the waters ſay, Thou art righteous, O Lord!—Thou haſt given them blood to drink, for they are worthy.</hi> The former judgments paſs in ſilent ſolemnity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>A friend has favoured me with an extract from the works of Mr R. Fleming, who, in a ſermon, printed 1701, applies it to the French monarchy, and ſays; "Whereas Lewis XIV. took the ſun for his emblem, and for his motto, Nec pluribus impar, he may at length, or rather his ſucceſſor, and the monarchy itſelf, before the year 1794, be forced to acknowledge, that in reſpect to neighbouring potentates he is fingulis impar; but as to the expiration of this vial, I fear it will not be before the end of the year 1794." What a ſingular agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween preſent circumſtances and this good man's calculation!</p>
                     <p>If by this vial's being poured out on the ſun, we are to underſtand a drought then the Greek word may refer to the ſun, but if it be an emblem of much rain, or of the wrath which is to be poured out on deſpotiſm, then I think, with Dr Goodwin, that it refers to the angel, who, by the pouring out of this vial, is to afflict tyrants, and their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, with ſcorching calamities.</p>

And we may expect ſoon to ſee heavy judgments fall upon the Roman Pontificate; and that city to be ſucked and burnt which has been the ſource of ſo many corruptions, and which has tyrannized, for ſo many ages, with ſpiritual deſpotiſm, over thoſe kingdoms that have given their power to the beaſt.</p>

                        <p>From comparing this paſſage with chap. xii. I am induced to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that by the dragon here the emperor of Germany, the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſucceſſor of the Roman emperors, is intended: by the beaſt, the Pope and his clergy, and by the falſe prophet, (as Biſhop Newton and Dr Doddridge underſtand it) the ſecond beaſt in chap. xiii. 11. (i. e. the French monarchy.) This will evidently appear to every impartial perſon, to be the ſecond beaſt, if we compare this place with chapters xiii. 13. 14. and xix. 20. He is thus called, becauſe, like the falſe prophets of old, he engages himſelf in ſupport of tyranny and idolatry. The word Naba, the root of Nabia, a prophet, ſignifies in general, to declare the mind of another. Thus Aaron (Ex. vii. 1.) is ſtyled Moſes's prophet. And with equal propriety might Lewis XIV. or the race of the Capets, be ſtyled the falſe prophet of the Pope. Theſe tyrannic powers are to exert themſelves to engage all the kings of the earth, in ſupport of the falling Papacy, and declining deſpotiſm.</p>
                        <p>They are the ſpirits of devils working miracles. No one ſuppoſes theſe to be true miracles. This figurative language is uſed to ſet forth thoſe violences, impoſtures, lies, and frauds, with which they are to deceive or frighten men, and thus bring them into their deſtructive meaſures.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030090_0040_0FE4754935685148"/>of the mouth of the falſe prophet; for they are the ſpirits of devils working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</hi> Here it may be proper to remember, that in ſymbolic hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphics, a frog was the figure by which the ancients repreſented an <hi>impoſtor,</hi> and hence the <hi>Oneiro-critics,</hi> or interpreters of dreams, taught, that as to dream of a dragon fignified <hi>majeſty;</hi> of a ſerpent, <hi>diſeaſe;</hi> of a viper, <hi>money,</hi> &amp;c. ſo to dream of frogs ſignified <hi>impoſtors.</hi> See Warb. Div. Leg. B. iv. ſect. 4. Theſe unclean ſpirits, therefore, (for God condeſcends to ſpeak to men in their own way) repreſent the odious impoſtors who are to act as the agents of theſe tyrannies to betray the kings of the earth and their armies into meaſures for the ſupport of the old Antichriſtian ſyſtem, againſt every attempt which will be made for its deſtruction. But all theſe efforts will be in vain—the wrath of man ſhall praiſe God. It is his battle, and he will overthrow his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the enemies of mankind, with all their hoſts.</p>

They will calculate events on common principles, and deceive themſelves into ruin. Bleſſed is he that watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>Ver. 16. <hi>And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon,</hi> or the mountain of Megiddo, thus call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed becauſe it ſhall be a place more remarkable for ſlaughter than Megid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ever was. Judges v. 19. 2 Kings ix. 27. and Zech. xii. 11. May our country, in that day, whether it be near or afar off, if not engaged on the ſide of the King of kings, be far from the mountain of ſlaughter! In this country, above moſt others, the civil and religious rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have been protected. Let us hope, therefore, that when the Judge of all the earch ſhall make inquiſition for blood, that we ſhall find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; or if, with the reſt of the nations who are to be purified by affliction, we muſt ſhare in the cup of trembling, here is ground for confidence in prayer, that mercy may be mixed with judgment; for the judgment of God will be a judgment of proportion. Where there has been moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, where ſin has been moſt triumphant, and eſpecially where there has been moſt perſecution of conſcience, there will the heavieſt woes fall. Let us therefore repent and ſeek God; This is at all ſeaſons neceſſary, but an additional motive enforces it, when the ſigns of the times ſuggeſt ſome very fignal criſis to be at hand. For whether men will ſee it or not, all things do not continue as they were from the beginning,

               <p>It is but to read a few of theſe prophecies which ſpeak of the wars and judgments of the latter times of the world, to conceive the moſt tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous idea of the carnage which will be made of mankind, and of the fury of the vengeance then to be poured out. When the prophets deſcribe theſe judgments, it is generally, though not always, under the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030090_0041_0FE4754AD53C5B08"/>names of thoſe nations which bordered upon <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and which were the more inveterate and dangerous enemies of Iſrael, ſuch as <hi>Aſſyria, Egypt, Moab, Edom,</hi> and others. This muſt be concluded, as <hi>Lowth, Mede,</hi> and others of our moſt able commentators argue, becauſe thoſe judgments which they denounce are often ſpoken of as deciſive ſtrokes, that ſhould thoroughly vindicate the cauſe of oppreſſed truth and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and put a final period to idolatry, and to all the miſeries and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of God's people. They are often repreſented as the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate preludes of the refloration of Iſrael, and the ſeaſon of univerſal peace.</p>
               <p>To times yet to come are ſuch prophecies as theſe to be referred. Iſa. xiv. 24. "The Lord of hoſts hath ſworn, ſurely as I have thought, ſo ſhall it come to paſs, that I will break the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> in my hand; then ſhall his yoke depart from off thee.—This is the purpoſe that is purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the whole earth, and this is the hand that is ſtretched out upon all nations."—Chap. xxvi. 20. "Come, my people, enter into thy chambers, hide thyſelf, as it were, for a little moment, until the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be overpaſt. For behold the Lord cometh out of his place, to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. The earth alſo ſhall diſcloſe her blood, and ſhall no more cover her ſlain. In that day (chap. xxvii. 1.) the Lord, with his ſore, and great, and ſtrong ſword, ſhall puniſh leviathen, the piercing ſerpent, even leviathen that crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſerpent, and he ſhall ſlay the dragon that is in the ſea." Chap. lxiii. 1-6. "Who is this that cometh from Edom, with died garments from Bozrah?—I that ſpeak in righteouſneſs, mighty to ſave. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the wine fat?—I have trodden the wine-preſs alone, and of the people there was none with me; for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury, and their blood ſhall be ſprinkled upon my garments, and I will ſtain all my raiment. For the day of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come."</p>
               <p>The prophet Joel, alſo propheſying of theſe calamities, ſays, (chap. iii.) "Behold, in thoſe days, and in that time, (when God will ſhew wonders in the heavens, and in the earth, chap. ii. 30. [namely, the political heavens and earth, ſtates and kingdoms] when I ſhall bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the captivity of Judah and Jeruſalem, I will alſo gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoſhaphat, (which may mean any place where <hi>the Lord will execute judgment,</hi> for ſo the word <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> ſignifies in the original, and by <hi>valley,</hi> may be intended ſome low country, called in the 14th verſe <hi>the valley of deciſion,)</hi> and will plead with them there for my people." Ver. 9. "Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles, prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up. Beat your plow-ſhares into ſwords, and your pruning-hooks into ſpeaks: let the weak ſay, I am ſtrong. Aſſemble yourſelves and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourſelves together round about: thither cauſe thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord. (Thy mighty angel, ſays Lowth, to diſcomfit thine enemies.) Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoſhaphat, for there will I fit to judge all the heathen round about. Put ye in the ſickle, for the harveſt is ripe; come, get ye down, for the preſs is full, the fats overflow, for their wickedneſs is great. Munitudes, multitudes, in the valley of deciſion."</p>

In Zech. xiii. 7-9. there ſeems to be a prediction of the ſame times. All are agreed, that the <hi>twelth</hi> and <hi>fourteenth</hi> chapters refer to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration, converſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Jews; nor is there but one objection that is at all plauſible, to the whole of this <hi>thirteenth</hi> being applied to the ſame times. Part of verſe 7. at leaſt the ſenſe of it, is applied (Matth. xxvi. 31.) to the ſcattering of Chriſt's diſciples at his death. <hi>I will ſmite the Shepherd, and the ſheep of the flock ſhall be ſcattered abroad.</hi> But this appears to have been only an accommodation of this paſſage, or of the ſenſe of this and of other paſſages, a uſual practice with the New-Teſtament writers. (See Matth. ii. 15-17. xiii. 35. John xv. 25.) Or our Lord might ſpeak thus in conformity to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place maxim. "Smite the ſhepherd, cut off the leader, and his followers will diſperſe." The thread of the prophecy ſeems to require a different interpretation than what has been uſually given to this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Unity of deſign ſhould always be attended to in the ſtudy of the prophetic writings, as well as of other compoſitions; nor ſhould we ſuppoſe ſo violent a break in the diſcourſe of a prophet, as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe here, unleſs we ſhould be involved in an evident contradiction without it.</p>
               <p>In chap. xi. is predicted the rejection of the Meſſiah by the Jews, and their puniſhment and diſperſion on this account. In chap. xii. we have their return and converſion. In the beginning of the xiiith the pardoning grace which ſhall be extended to them. Then follows the deſtruction of idolatry, and the contempt under which the Antichriſtian-clergy, who have the mark of the beaſt in their hands, (Rev. xiv. 9.) and who have worn garments to deceive the ſimple, ſhall fall, and the ſhifts to which they ſhall be reduced to eſcape the vengeance of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>Verſe the <hi>ſeventh</hi> is a call to the ſword of juſtice to awake againſt the man of ſin, <hi>who oppoſeth and exaleth himſelf above all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God, or that is worſhipped; ſo that he, as God, ſitteth in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God,</hi> 2 Theſſ. ii. 4. He calls himſelf the <hi>vicar</hi> of Chriſt, and God's <hi>vicegerent</hi> upon earth, arrogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf the attributes and prerogatives of deity, and is here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ironically called God's <hi>fellow.</hi> Againſt him is God's ſword to awake, and the prieſthood, and all thoſe orders which have been his ſupporters, are to be ſcattered. <hi>And in all the land two parts therein ſhall be cut off and die, but the third ſhall be left therein.</hi> Great is to be the deſtruction, and great the trials of thoſe who are not deſtroyed. But being brought to repentance, then is to be fulfilled that promiſe which is peculiarly appropriated to the latter days. Ver. 9 <hi>They ſhall call on my name, and I will hear them; I will ſay, It is my people; and they ſhall ſay, the Lord is my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>fourteenth chapter</hi> more largely deſcribes the deſtruction of God's enemies, and the happy days which are to follow; when (ver. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>* Rev. xix. 20.—But perhaps ſome inquiſitive mind may ſay, The beaſt of Rome ſpiritual tyranny, and the falſe prophet, the beaſt of France, his reat ſupporter, are taken, and exemplary juſtice is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them for their abominations, but the dragon, civil tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is not taken with them. No; he aroſe firſt, and he will continue longeſt. But his career is ſhort. Chap. xx. And I ſaw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomleſs pit. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old ſerpent, which is the devil and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and bound him a thouſand years. And caſt him into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, and ſhut him up, and ſet a ſeal upon him, that he ſhould deceive the nations no more till the thouſand years ſhould be fulfilled: and after that he muſt be looſed a little ſeaſon. Now commences the firſt reſurrection, as predicted by Ezekiel (chap. xxxvii.) Now the Jews, and others with them, will find that mercy which will be as life from the dead (Rom. xi. 15.) And as Elias lived in John the Baptiſt, ſo ſhall the former confeſſors and martyrs live in the Chriſtians of this generation. And they ſhall ſit upon thrones of judgment, and act ſo much under the influence of goſpel principles, and eſtabliſh ſuch ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of juſtice and righteouſneſs, that tyranny, which has bound ſo many, ſhall itſelf be bound, and be caſt into the bottomleſs pit. Now liberty and peace, righteouſneſs and joy, will reign undiſturbed, for what is here termed a thouſand years; after which the dragon is to be looſed for a little ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>The events here predicted are evidently the ſame with thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in Ezek. xxxvii. xxxviii. and xxxix. and in Zech. xiv. What length of time then are we to underſtand by theſe thouſand years? I ſuppoſe that all which is here ſaid is figurative, and that the years are not what we generally underſtand by this term. I am inclined to judge thus for two reaſons. Not only from a compariſon of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent prophecies concerning the return of the Jews, the after perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gog and Magog, &amp;c. which do not ſeem to allow of ſo long a term as a thouſand years between the ſhutting up of the dragon and his looſing, but alſo from the general prophetic uſe of ſuch terms. Days, weeks, &amp;c. In the prophecies are generally uſed in a myſtical ſenſe, and for the obvious reaſon which has been mentioned. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe therefore, that by this thouſand years, a thouſand weeks or months are intended. Time only can aſcertain this; but I think the other prophecies reſtrain this period to a thouſand weeks, or a little more than nineteen years. The proper and uſual meaning of the Greek word is a year, but prophetically it may, perhaps, ſtand for any change or revolution of time. John was a Jew, let us therefore examine the Hebrew word for a year, and hear what Buxtorf ſays, Shanah Annus, abſteratione dictus, quod ſole, ad punctum, unde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grediceperat, redeunte, iteretur, &amp; in ſeſua per veſtigia ſemper vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatur &amp; redeat, Now ſeeing that the word year in Hebrew means a repetition, or revolving round and returning by the ſame ſteps, this is as applicable to a week as a year.</p>
                     <p>Thus it appears probable from the prophecies, that after the bloody dragon, civil tyranny, whoſe horrid character no objects in viſible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ſufficiently vile to repreſent; after this crafty ſerpent, which is the devil and ſatan, has been confined for about nineteen years, he will again get out of his priſon, and make a deſperate effort againſt the kingdom of righteouſneſs, peace, and joy; but He who, by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential judgments, caſt the beaſt and the falſe prophet into the lake of fire, will manifeſt himſelf in ſtill more conſpicuous judgments, and caſt this dragon into the ſame place of torment, and thus put an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting end to all tyranny, eccleſiaſtical and civil.—Now a proſpect opens, which tranſports the heart, and figures are uſed proportioned to the ſublimity and felicity of the ſcenes which follow. Let the wiſe and pious anticipate by hope theſe happy days! We look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs!!!</p>

To ſave time, and to ſpare the reader's patience, I ſhall take ſome things for granted, which may be ſeen argued at length in more voluminous writings.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, let us conſider Daniel's viſion in chap. viii. It opens with the appearance of a <hi>ram,</hi> (ver. 4.) having two horns, puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weſtward, and northward, and ſouthward. This the angel interprets (ver. 30.) to be the kings of Media and Perſia. The next object in the viſion is an <hi>he-goat,</hi> (ver. 5.) which came from the weſt, with a notable horn between his eyes. This, the angel Tays, (ver. 21.) is the king of Grecia, the Grecian empire, and the great horn between his eyes, the <hi>firſt</hi> king, or kingdom, under Alexander, his brother, and two ſons. This horn was broken, (ver. 8.) and after it came up four others; the four empires which ſprung up out of the conqueſts of Alexander. <hi>And out of one of them came a little horn,</hi> (ver. 9.) <hi>which waxed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, toward the ſouth, and toward the eaſt, and toward the pleaſant land, and by him the place of the daily ſacrifice was taken away, and the place of his ſanctuary was caſt down,</hi> &amp;c. Ver. 13. <hi>Then I heard one ſaint ſpeaking, and another ſaint ſaid unto that certain ſaint which ſpake, How long ſhall be the viſion concerning the daily ſacrifice, and the tranſgreſſion of deſolation, to give both the ſanctuary and the hoſt to be trodden under foot? And he ſaid unto me, Unto two thouſand and three hundred days, then ſhall the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he cleanſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems natural to reckon theſe 2300 days (or years) either from the firſt part of the viſion, the puſhing of the ram, or the latter end, the violences of the little horn, or from the time when Daniel ſaw the viſion
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Newton, Biſhop of Briſtol, concludes from ver. 13. that theſe days are to be calculated from the beginning of the viſion. "As the question was aſked," ſays he, "not how long the daily ſacrifice ſhall be taken away, and the tranſgreſſion of deſolation continue, but alſo, how long the viſion ſhall laſt: ſo the anſwer is to be underſtood, and theſe two thouſand &amp; three hundred days denote the whole time from the beginning of the viſion to the cleanſing of the ſanctuary." Diſſert on the Proph. vol. i. p. 331. Dr Lowth, in his comment on this paſſage, ſays, "The words may be readered more agreeably to the Hebrew thus: For how long a time ſhall the viſion laſt, the daily ſacrifice be taken away, and the tranſgreſſion of deſolation continue.</note> If we calculate from the time when Daniel ſaw the viſion, the termination of the 2500 years is paſt forty or fifty years, and the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary is not cleanſed. If from the latter part of the viſion, (as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Antiochus) it will carry us to about the year A. D. 2130, which appears too far; for ſuppoſing the 1260 years power of the beaſt, predicted in the Apocalypſe, were to be calculated from the time when the Pope became a temporal prince, from the <hi>exarchate of Ravenna,</hi> being given to him by Pepin, A. D. 755, or by Charlemagne A. D. 774, (ſome thinking that he was not a perfect beaſt till then) this would fall ſhort of Daniel's number by more than a hundred years; but ſeeing that the power, idolatry, corruptions, and uſurpations of the Papacy, were ſuch, at leaſt in the ſixth century, as appear ſufficient to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

And to what period of that empire does this ſo well agree as to the times of Xerxes and that particular puſh which he made when he invaded Greece

Of his land forces, 80,000 were horſe. And beſides this multitude, as many more are reckoned to have followed the camp, ſervants, eunuchs, &amp;c. ſo that the whole number of people engaged in this expedition was at leaſt 5,000,000. What a puſh was this for conqueſt! And, (though he had been puſhing for three or four years before, yet) nothing elſe forbidding it, what period could be more proper for the angel to begin his reckoning from? He paſſed the Helleſpont B. C. 480: four years before this he puſhed at Egypt and reduced it; the next year he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for this invaſion; the following he entered into a league with the Carthaginians againſt the Greeks, and in the year 481 B. C. marches as far as Sardis, on his way towards Greece, where he winters, and in the ſpring paſſes the Helleſpont.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe we ſix the year 481 B. C. for the commencement of Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el's 2300 years, (allowing our chronology to be correct), this carries us to the year of Chriſt 1819, when the ſanctuary and hoſt are no longer to be trodden under foot. <hi>i. e.</hi> the land of Paleſtine is no longer to be in the poſſeſſion of the enemies of the Jews, but they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and the church freed from Antichriſtian abominations.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, that as the Jewiſh year conſiſted but of 360 days, <hi>five days</hi> and a <hi>quarter</hi> ſhort of our ſolar year, this will make a difference of <hi>thirty-one</hi> years ſhort. To which I anſwer, A ſingle Jewiſh year conſiſted but of 360 days, and when we conſider three or four years only, this mode of reckoning may be admitted, but, as we have leap years to regulate our meaſurement of time, ſo had the Jews. When it was neceſſary, they intercalated their month Ador; ſometimes even a whole month, and this they were obliged to do to make their feaſts of the <hi>Paſſover, Penticoſt,</hi> and <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> happen at their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeaſons. The Targum of Chron. xii. 32. ſays of the children of Iſſachar, that "they were ſkilful in the knowledge of times, and wiſe to ſix the beginning of the years; dextrous at ſetting the new moons and fixing their feaſts at their ſeaſons." Hence it follows, that though the Jewiſh ordinary year is to be attended to when but a few years are under conſideration, yet, in a long ſucceſſion of time, they are not to be noticed, for by intercalations they amount to the ſame with ſolar years.</p>
               <p>In Dan. xii. we have three different numbers. (The firſt agrees with that in chap. vii. 25.) Ver. 7, <hi>I heard the man clothed in liven, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto the heaven, and ſware by Him that liveth for

According to Rev. xi. 2. the holy city is to be trodden under foot of the Gentiles <hi>forty and two months;</hi> and in ver. 3. the two witneſſes are to propheſy <hi>twelve hundred and ſixty days</hi> clothed in ſackcloth.

<note n="*" place="bottom">Here let me again remind the reader, that in the ſtyle of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, a day is a year, a month thirty years, and a year 360 years, there being ſo many days in the Jewiſh month and year. A time is the ſame as a year, (Dan. iv. 16.) times, two years, and the dividing of time, half a year, which put together, amount to 1260 prophetic days, or years.</note>.</p>
               <p>But how can we reconcile thoſe three different numbers of Daniel with the ſeven (two in Daniel and live in the Apocalypſe) which agree?</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, let it be allowed, that the convulſions which are to bring about the predicted <hi>final</hi> overthrow of Antichriſt began with the revolution in France in 1789, and then reckon thus.</p>
               <p>Daniel's <hi>time, times, and half a time,</hi> (1260 years) begin and end with the five numbers in the Apocalypſe, and as they are 1260 years, and ſuppoſed to end at the French revolution, they muſt begin A. D. 529, and end in 1789. Daniel's 2300 years begin 481 years before Chriſt, and end in 1819, when ſome other great event, or events, will take place. The <hi>beaſt</hi> and the <hi>falſe prophet,</hi> (Rev. xix. 20.) <hi>i. e.</hi> the Papacy and the French tyranny, having previouſly been brought to an end, then, perhaps, the <hi>dragon,</hi> civil deſpotiſm, will be bound, (Rev. xx. 2.) and the Jews, the dry bones in the valley of viſion, (Ezek. xxxvii.) be raiſed to political life, and reſtored to their own land. —Daniel's 1260 years begin with his <hi>time, times, and half a time,</hi> and with the former five numbers of John in the Apocalypſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> at the commencement of the reign of the beaſt, A. D. 529, and end with the former number, (2300, in 1810, and which they muſt, for they are to accompliſh the ſame event, as may be ſeen by comparing Dan. viii. 12. with chap. xii. 11. This agreement deſerves particular attention. His 1335 years (the end of which, according to him, will eminently he a bleſſed time) begin in the ſame year of Chriſt 529, and terminate in 1864, when perhaps the Jews are to be converted by that remarkable
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030090_0048_0FE47568BA3E1C48"/>appearance of the Lord in their favour, which is predicted in Ezek. xxxviii. xxxix. and in Zech. xii. and xiv. Thus the final attack on the beaſt commences in 789. <hi>Thirty</hi> years are employed in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Papacy, the Turks, and other tyrannies: a ſeaſon, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of great calamities, but eſpecially to the enemies of Chriſt's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The next <hi>forty-five</hi> years, to 1864, to which time Daniel's 1335 years extend, may be ſpent in gathering the Jews (who, according to Jer. xvi. 16. will be unwilling to return to their own land), and in purifying them by thoſe trials which, according to the prophets

               <p>But, perhaps it may be aſked, What arguments are there which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the conjecture of the 529th year of Chriſt being that from which the power of the beaſt is to be dated? I own I have put this year down by accident, as the meaſurement back from 1789. To demonſtrate, that in this year be came to ſuch a ſtate of maturity (for this myſtery of iniquity was forming in the apoſtle's days

But though no man, from the hiſtory of paſt times, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the exact year from which God dates the kingdom of Antichriſt, yet there are good reaſons from which a probable conjecture may be formed, that it was as early as the <hi>ſixth</hi> century.</p>
               <p>The apoſtle Paul, ſpeaking of that which hindered the progreſs of this <hi>wicked one,</hi> ſays, (2 Theſſ. ii. 6—11.) <hi>the myſtery of iniquity doth already work; only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way; and then ſhall that wicked one be revealed,</hi> &amp;c. Our moſt approved commentators ſuppoſe, that by <hi>he who letteth,</hi> the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power is intended, and that we muſt not expect to find this <hi>wicked one</hi> arrived at maturity till the fall of the weſtern empire. This took place A. D. 476. Soon after this, therefore, we may expect the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eleſiaſtical tyranny to be matured.</p>
               <p>Some of our moſt able critics, as Biſhop Newton and Mr. Lowman, are of opinion, that by the wound which the firſt beaſt received, chap. xiii. 3. we are to underſtand the blow which was given to the majeſty and power of Rome, by ſubjecting it to the exarchate of Ravenna; and that by its being healed, is intended its reſtoration to its former dignity, by this exarchate being given to the Pope, by which he became a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral prince. Now, this wounding took place A. D. 568, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 206 years. If this be well conſidered, it tends much to ſtrengthen our argument; for though, when the Pope was made a temporal prince, at the time of this healing, the world wondered more than ever after the beaſt, (Rev. xiii. 3.) yet the Papal beaſt exiſted before, and this only gave him increaſing eclat. But farther to confirm our hypotheſis, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030090_0049_0FE4756A5220BF40"/>the ſtate of ſociety, and particularly the ſtate of what was called the church, in this ſixth century. Now, magiſtrates were tyrants, and prieſts were wicked, ſuperſtitious and intolerant, beyond any former age. Now, numberleſs laws and regulations were obtruded upon the church by human authority, which at once violated the authority of Chriſt, defaced Chriſtianity, and robbed Chriſtians of their deareſt liberties. And in this very year 529, which we are looking for, the <hi>Juſtinian code</hi> was firſt publiſhed, by which thoſe powers, privileges, and immunities were ſecured to the clergy; that union perfected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things civil and eccleſiaſtical, and thoſe laws impoſed on the church which have proved ſo injurious to Chriſtianity, and ſo calamitous to mankind. And which code, through the zeal of the clergy, has been received, more or leſs, as the foundation of the juriſprudence of almoſt every ſtate in Chriſtendom; and that not only in things <hi>civil</hi> but <hi>eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical;</hi> and by this means, as ſome author has obſerved, the old fancy of the Romans, about ſhe eternity of their command, is thus far verified.

Now did monkery overrun the world, and marriage was forbidden, as unworthy of thoſe who aſpired to be ſaints.—And in this very year 529 alſo, a new order of monks, which in a manner abſorbed all the others eſtabliſhed in the weſt, was inſtituted by <hi>Benedict</hi> of <hi>Nurſia.</hi> In proceſs of time, this order having acquired immenſe riches, they ſunk into luxury, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and ſloth; abandoned themſelves to all ſorts of vices; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their zeal and attention to worldly affairs; inſinuated themſelves

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>WHAT remains, but that the reader, unbiafied by a party ſpirit, ſeriouſly revolve in his mind, the proofs which have been adduced, of that tyranny which has ſo long been exerciſed in France, to the grievous oppreſſion of the people of that country, and the great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſurroanding hations, being that beaſtly power which, according to God's word, was to ſlay the witneſſes for truth and liberty; and whether the time for their riſing from their civil and political death be arrived? The conſequences connected with the truth of this fact are unſpeakably intereſting to every nation in Europe, and even to all the world.—Are the diſtreſſing calamities which we have heard of, chaſtiſing judgments for ſin? Their cry, to all ſurrounding nations, is,

Thus might they expect a bleſſing. But if men be ſtill incorrigible in ſin, if ſyſtems of oppreſſion, perſecution, and war, be ſtill pertiſted in, if the nations league themſelves with Papal Antichriſt, for the purpoſe of ſupporting him in his corruptions, robberies, uſurpations, and tyrannies, in vain will they truſt in the wiſdom of their counſellors, the multitude of their riches, or in the power of their numerous fleets and armies. He that fitteth in the heavens will have them in deriſion. When they take counſel, he will bring it to nought; when they aſſociate themſelves, he will break them to pieces:—the Judge ſtandeth before the door. And without repentance and reformation, his judgments will ſpeedily come.</p>
               <p>It is the duty of every member of the community to contribute what in him lies to the peace and happineſs of his country. Who are the beſt friends both of our king and conſtitution; and who perform the beſt ſervices to their fellow-citizens?—they who exert all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to perpetuate imperfections and abuſes, and who flatter where they ought to condemn; or thoſe who plead for timely reform, that we may ward off the evils inſeparable from revolutions, and who liſt up their voice againſt the crying crimes of the nation, that men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and thus the diſpleaſure of God be averted, and his bleſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to future generations? Who promote moſt the general interest and happineſs?—they who labour to blind mankind and pervert their judgments; or thoſe who invite them to diſpaſſionate examination, that they may beware of precipitating themſelves into deſtructive meaſures:—they who, either by riot and intemperance, or by miſre, preſentation and calumny, inflame the paſſions of men, that they may engage them to forward their own intereſted views; or thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to ſerious thoughtfulneſs, and a peaceable purſuit of thoſe meaſures which may prolong the quiet and proſperity of our country? He that ſpeaketh truth ſheweth forth righteouſneſs; but a falſe witneſs deceit.</p>
               <p>I may have failed in the execution; but my aim has been to ſerve my King and Country, and to promote our common happineſs, by inveſtigating a moſt intereſting ſubject. In doing it, I believe that I have performed, though a ſmall, yet an acceptable ſervice to God.— May it be a uſeful one to my countrymen! With a heart agitated and overflowing with anxious concern, I pray that the war which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens us, may be averted; and that the angry clouds which are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing around may ſweep by this long favoured country, and ſpend their ſtores of vengeance only on the heads of inveterate oppreſſors.</p>

               <head>AVERTISEMENT.</head>
               <p>THE many excellent things which have been written by the friends of liberty, of our conſtitution, and of humanity, againſt the preſent war, and on the neceſſity of reformation, and a change of meaſures, may make it ſeem almoſt needleſs to ſay more than has been ſaid; for intereſted men would not believe though one ſhould riſe from the dead. But although little that is new can be expected to be advanced on a ſubject which is ſoplain to the diſpaſſionate and diſintereſted, yet, as the argument in the following pages is placed, if not in a new point of light, yet, in ſuch an one as has not been conſidered in any degree propertioned to its vaſt importance, I am therefore induced to ſubmit it to the public attention.</p>
               <p>It may be thought that the Author has not entered ſo fully into the diſcuſſion of ſome particulars as he ſhould have done, nor beſtowed the pains upon them which their importance required. As to thoſe in the former part of the book, as they have been ſo ably treated on by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous voluminous writers, and as he had but little to produce that was new, he did not think it neceſſary to enter farther into the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them than appeared needful for preparing the way for the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of what he advances reſpecting thoſe ſubjects which ſome may be diſpoſed to reject becauſe novel. And as to the execution of the whole, he muſt beg leave to plead the conſtant toils of his profeſſion, which leave him but now and then an hour for ſuch inveſtigations.— Nothing but a conviction of duty could have induced the Author to preſent this to the Public; he has no ſelfiſh or party views to ſerve; and he hopes for all the indulgence which candour, with juſticce, can beſlow, and no more.</p>
               <p>The love of peace, anxious apprchenſions for trembling liberty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the fate which threatens our country, benevolence towards mankind, and a motive which a Chriſtian and a Proteſlant ought not to be aſhamed to avow, urge me again to addreſs my fellow-ſubjects at this dangerous and awfulcriſis.—May the evils which the Signs of the Times portend, and of which I have ſuch ſtrong apprehenſions, never fall upon my country!—May thoſe meaſure, which alone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Religion is a reality; uncorrupted Chriſtianity is the greateſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that ever God beſtoned upon mankind; but the deformities occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the corruptions of prieſts, and the perverſions of ſtateſmen, have brought it into long diſgrace, and prevented the intended good. The all-wiſe God, for reaſons inſorutable to us, has permitted it to be ſo. This is one of the many myſteries of his providence; but his word will be accompliſhed; the kingdom of Antichriſt will periſh, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted Chriſtianity will revive from the moment of its ruin. We are ſure of the event; but by what particular means this is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and when, is not ſo clearly aſcertained. Theſe are left for events to elucidate. Our duty is to watch the Signs of the Times, and be ready whenever the ſeaſon of reckoning may come. That its approach is to be knowable is put beyond a doubt, for otherwiſe the delincation of the ſigns, and the command to inquire and watch, as well as the promiſe that the wiſe ſhall underſtand, would all be nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
               <p>There is a prevailing prejudice that deſerves ſome attention, and of which it may be as proper to take notice in this place as any where. It is very uſual to hear people ſay of the prophecies, and particularly of thoſe in the book of Revelation, "They are ſo obſcure, and the opinions of the learned reſpecting them are ſo various, that it ſeems impoſſible to come at any certainty: and I therefore never trouble myſelf about them." It is true that there are a great diverſity of opinions, and many ſtrange and wild interpretations and conjectures have been ſtarted. But to what deſcription of prophecies does this chiefly apply? Not to thoſe which have long been accompliſhed, but to ſuch as remain unfulfilled; for though there may not be an exact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of ſentiment as to every particular reſpecting theſe former, yet there is a pretty generalagreement among our writers in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of them. What wild and incoherent notions had the fathers, as they are called, the writers of the early centuries, about Antichriſt, the man of ſin, and the beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns, in Rev. xiii. And why? Becauſe theſe prophecies were not ſufficiently realized. But what Proteſtant commentators differ about theſe predictions now? Scarcely any. To ſay nothing concerning the propheties in the Old Teſtament, which reſerred to the humiliation of the Meſſiah, and which were never underſtood till after their fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, obſerve the progreſs of the elucidation of the book of Revelation. The prophetic parts, to the end of the ninth chapter, are tolerably well underſtood, and though there may not be an exact, yet there is a pretty general agreement in the interpretations of our moſt approved writers, at there is alſo about thoſe other parts that have, for ſome time, been accompliſhed. For inſlance, ſcarcely any lady now doubts but that the fifth and ſixth trumpets refer to the deprodations of the Saracens and Turks; and almoſt all allow that the corruptions and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fions of the Papal church, and its ſupporters, are repreſented by the treading under foot the holy city for forty and two months, and by the witneſſes propheſying in ſachcloth 1200 days, or years, chap. xi. The reaſon of this general a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reement is, becauſe me ſee the fulfilment. But, in the interpretation of ſome other parts of this book, authors are very various, and for this covious reaſon, becauſe unaccompliſhed.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030090_0056_0FE4758B62214248"/>But this is not always to be the caſe. When therefore they are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and the correſpondence of events with the predictions ſuggeſts the true interpretation, it would be the height of folly to reject ſuch interpretations on account of their novelty, or becauſe former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators entertained different opinions. I do not pretend to have any clear and ſpecific ideas of what remains unfulfilled, but I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that the events ſignified in the tent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and in the eleventh chapters of Revelation, ſo far as extends to the nations being angry, and the coming of the wrath of God, are now accompliſhed, or accompliſhing. I think this is as demonſtrable as a thing of the kind can poſſibly be —as demonſtrable as that the ſeventy weeks of Daniel referred to the coming of the Meſſiah, or, as that the fifty-third of Iſaiah was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of his ſufferings and exaltation.</p>
               <p>Some, it is probable, way think that the Author has expreſſed too much confidence reſpecting the ſuppoſed approaching calamities, and too much of what ſome will call enthuſiaſm, for the occaſion; he can only ſay, that whatever diffidence he may entertain as to ſome ſingle and detached hypotheſes, both in this part and in the former, yet he has no doubt remaining as to the great facts, and expected events: and under the impreſſion of this confidence, it would be criminal apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to treat them as common occurrences, and to feel as though but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle were at ſtake.—When Jeſus beheld the capital of his guilty, devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed country, he wept over it.—Whether I write as a wild enchuſiaſt, or as one in his ſober ſenſes, who has ſome reaſon for what he advances, a ſhort time will determine; and, if the reader will ſuppreſs his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and engage himſelf diligently to watch the Signs of the Times but for a few years only, I am willing to refer to ſuture events for the proof that what is now burſting upon us tends to no common iſſue.— Yes, it is more than probable, that many will think the Author a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken enthuſiaſt; but were this the univerſal opinion, (which is far from being the caſe), he is not deſtitute of ſupport againſt immoderaté mortification.</p>
               <p>If I am deceived by ſeeming correſpondencies, or led away by the illuſions of fancy, to adopt ſentiments which way have a tendency to create unneceſſary uncaſineſs, I ſhall eſteem myſelf under obligations to the man who will endeavour candidly to convince me of my delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: and if ſuch an one can produce any well-grounded arguments to overturn what is advanced in the following pages, or in the former part of The Signs of the Times, I hope I am neither ſo pertinacious, nor ſo enthuſiaſtic, as to be incapable of conviction. But while no better arguments are advanced than, "Others have been deceived— opinions are various—when an author wiſhes to ſupport an hypot he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fis of this kind, it is no difficult taſk, in any age, to find events ſuited to his purpoſe—theſe prophecies might be applied to any other country or events as well as to thoſe brought forward," &amp;c. I muſt beg leave ſtill to maintain my confidence.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians believe that the predictions of the prophets are ſometime to be fulfilled. Whenever that time comes, and a certain number of the predicted events have taken place, it is likely that things will be placed in ſuch a point of light as to convey conviction, to the pious and attentive obſerver, of the true intent of the Spirit of God; and it is to be expected, that this will be in proportion to the advancement of the great ſcheme to its perfect completion. Whether ſuch a number
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030090_0057_0FE4758CFA028A48"/>of theſe events have taken place, and whether things are now placed in ſuch a point of light, I hope the reader will candidly and ſeriouſly inquire. The Author thinks it is ſo; and though he does not pretend to determine, from unfulfilled prophecies, either the exact time, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of the accompliſhment of any particular event, yet he thinks that, from what has taken place, a pretty poſitive concluſion may be drawn reſpecting the main events, and that they are very near; namely, the downfal of the Papacy, and of all religious corruptions and uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the overthrow of all tyranny and oppreſſion; the general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and renovation of mankind, and of the overflowing cula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which are to effect, or prepare the way for all this.</p>
               <p>Such is the temper of the times, that ſome filly or party ſpirited peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will, poſſibly, be ready to ſuſpect the Author of want of loyalty to the king, of veneration for the conſtitution, and of love for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; for to ſimilar ſuſpicion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Should it be thus, the Author will be content to conſole himſelf with that conſciouſneſs which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes of the falſehood of ſuch ſurmiſes, of the rectitude of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the hope of His approbation who is the Judge of all, and to whom, and not to the will of men, we ought to live.</p>
               <p>The Author does not profeſs to ſet himſelf up for the apologiſt of the French people; and far be it from him to attempt to juſtify their raſh and wicked deeds: he has not even ſuppoſed that every other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in like ſituations, and with like provocations, would have acted the ſame part which they have; for that would be no alleviation of their guilt. The utmoſt that he has contended for, or ſuggeſted is, that the overthrow of monarchy and Ropery in that country is the accompliſhment of God's word, and in judgment for oppreſſion and corruption; that their great leading principles are good, and that they have a right to legiſlate for themſelves, and chooſe what ſort of government they pleaſe, uncontrouled by any other power on earth.</p>
               <p>Whether the French be right or wrong, in this or that, is no part of the queſtion which it has been thought neceſſary to enter very deeply into;—yet the truth ſeems to be, that there is a ſtrange mixture of the greateſt good and the greateſt evil: much to be applauded and much to be lamented. But the argument againſt the preſent war is drawn from a higher ſource than either the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or practices of the French reformers; and the Author thinks that, whether the French be right or wrong, whether they triumph or periſh, yet moſt of the nations who have made war upon them have involved themſelves in great blame by the raſhneſs of their proceedings, and that they hazard great danger, by attempting to ſupport that, which not only inſpired wiſdom, but general reaſon, has doomed to fall.—But more than this; though the war, on the part of the combined powers, were ever ſo juſt, though as juſt as that of Iſrael againſt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As in their caſes it was for the accumulated guilt of ſucceſſive ages, and for the general depravity of their character, and not for the plame of that particular quarrel in which they fell, that God made theſe invaders his inſtruments for their chaſtiſement and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,

From comparing the ſigns of the times with the declarations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of prophecy, there is great reaſon to apprehend that the time is at hand. Whatever, then, our provocations might be, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is much the ſame, and there is no hope of eſcape or alleviation, but by inſtant Repentance and Reformation.—Never, therefore, was that exhortation more in time, Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is as hand.</p>

If not, he may be aſſured that the following pages will not be to his taſte.—In a Chriſtian country, when queſtions of the laſt importance are in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the fate of nations is at ſlake, there is a peculiar propriety in referring to thoſe ſacred records which we all believe to be from God, to ſee whether they contain any information which may aſſiſt us in forming a right judgment, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The apoſtle Paul (Rom. xv. 4.) declares, reſpecting the writings of the prophets, that "Whatſoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the ſcriptures, might have hope;" and in the beginning of that prouſound and difficult, but important and inſtructive, book of Revelation, it is written, (chap. i. 3.) "Bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep thoſe things which are written therein: the time is at hand." Is it not therefore a ſtrange piece of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not to ſay profaneneſs, in Chriſtians, to maintain, that theſe prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are of a kind which it is as vain as it is unprofitable to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? This is to arraign the wiſdom of God, and deſpiſe thoſe methods of inſtruction which the Inſpirer of prophecy has choſen. Far be this from us! Let us better underſtand that ſaying of the apoſtle to Timothy; "All ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed unto all good works." Many things in this book may be hard to be underſtood, and eſpecially before their fulfilment, or the taking place of ſome events ſo immediately connected with them as to afford the inquirer a clue in his inveſtigations; but it does not thence follow, that we are not to ſearch into the mind and meanig of the Spirit of God, but rather that we ought to redouble our diligence in inquiry, and abound the more in prayer to God, for the teachings of that Spirit who gave the word, and gave it in this form, not that it might never be underſtood, but that, whilſt the purpoſes and operations of God, in providence, ſhould be hid from the careleſs eyes of a wicked world, they might, at the proper ſeaſon, be
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030090_0060_0FE47596F2213C98"/>diſcoverable to the pious and diligent inquirer, for the conſolation of the upright, and, in the end, for the general conviction and edification of mankind. What the angel ſaid to Daniel (chap. xii. 3. 10.) is in point as to the preſent queſtion, and a ground of encouragement to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorate our reſearches. Shut up the words and ſeal the book, even to the time of the end. Many (that is, about the time of the end) ſhall run to and fro. (ſhall inquire and inveſtigate) <hi>and knowledge ſhall be increaſed.

In the fifth chapter we have an account of a book ſealed with ſeven ſeals, which Jeſus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Lamb of God, was alone found worthy to open. This book is the repreſentation of the providence of God, which is committed to the execution of the exalied Redeemer of the world. The opening of the ſeals indicates to us the different peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of hiſtory, from the firſt preaching of the goſpel to the comſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things. In the <hi>ſixth chapter</hi> we have an account of the opening of ſix of the ſeven ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>als. Theſe bring us to the overthrow of the heathen Roman empire, by the emperor Conſtantine, who, about the year 311, embracing Chriſtianity, effected a moſt aſtoniſhing revolution in the hiſtory of idolatry, and procured for the Chriſtian church a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite from the perſecutions which had long harraſſed it, and which ſeemed to threaten its utter extirpation. Now (A.D. 323.) were the four winds of heaven holden (chap. vii.), that they ſhould not blow on the earth, nor on the ſea, nor on any tree, till 144,000 of the ſervants of God were ſealed in their foreheads, with the ſeal of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The former commotions and perſecutions gave place to peace and quietneſs, till Chriſtianity ſhould acquire ſtrength and permanency by the addition of numerous converts. But tares ſprung up among the wheat. The ſeeds of Antichriſtian error, pride, and domination, had long been ſown, and now the ſunſhine of court-favour produced a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful crop. Chriſtianity, or ſomething called by that name, was brought to court; ſhe was carreſled, loaded with riches and honours; was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauched by her alliance with the world, and quickly became the mother of barlots. The true religion of Jeſus Chriſt was adulterated with the maxims of ſtateſmen, and the reveries of enthuſiaſls. The perſecuted became the perſecutors, and univerſal corruption, reviling, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſucceeded. Hence the judgments which follow:</p>
               <p>Chap. viii. "And when he had opened the ſeventh ſeal, there was ſilence in heaven about the ſpace of half an hour." Was this mence, as ſome interpet it, the ſhort quiet which the church enjoyed on the late change of circumſtances; or, (for this quiet had been repreſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chap. viii. 1.) was it not rather the amazement of heaven, on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"And I ſaw the ſeven angels which ſtood before God; and to them were given ſeven trumpets." Theſe ſeven trumpets are to be the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for the uſhering in ſo many diſtinct judgments on apoſtate Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: "And I ſaw another angel come and flood at the altar, having a golden cenſer; and there was given unto him much incenſe, that he ſhould offer it with the prayers of the ſaints upon the golden altar, which was before the throne. And the ſmoke of the incenſe, which came with the prayers of the ſaints, aſcended up before God, out of the angel's hand." The corruption of the Chriſtian church which had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place, and the evils which quickly followed in its train, became a ſubject of ſerious concern to thoſe who ſtill adhered to the truth; and the vindication of diſhonoured Chriſtianity, as well as of oppreſſed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, was the ſubject of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

In this interval the family of Conſtantine, his three ſons, who divided the empire among them, and all his relations, periſhed, chiefly by aſſaſſination and inteſtine wars, within the ſpace of twenty-ſeven years. And ſo fierce and bloody was the war between Conſtantius, who reigned in Aſia and the eaſt, and Magnentius, who had procured the aſſaſſination of Conſtans, and had aſſumed the purple in Italy, that, as Victor obſerves, it almoſt ruined the whole ſtrength of the Roman empire. But this was only the prelude to much greater calamities.</p>
               <p>Ver. 7. "The firſt angel ſounded, and there followed hail, and fire, mingled with blood, and they were caſt upon the earth; and the third part of trees were burnt up, and all green graſs was burnt up." This firſt trumpet brings a terrible ſtorm from the north, the region of hail; and the nature of the ſtorm ſhews the nature of the judgment, it was hail and fire mingled with blood, which denotes wars, and appears to have been a prediction of the terrible inundarions of the Goths, who, about the year 376, broke in upon, and laid waſte a great part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, that third part of the then known world, to which the prophecy refers; for when the prophecy ſpeaks of the judgment falling on a third part, the weſtern empire, or Europe, is to be underſtood. Great were the calamities which were endured, for ſeveral years, from theſe inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. A check was at length given to their depredations: for attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conqueſt of Normandy, A. D. 402, they were defeated, their immenſe treaſures were taken; the captives were delivered, and, as the diſperſed wandered about for ſafety, innumerable numbers were ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. But another enemy quickly appeared.</p>
               <p>Ver. 8. "The ſecond angel ſounded, and, as it were, a great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain burning with fire was call into the ſea; and the third part of the ſea became blood." &amp;c. This appears to be a prediction of the irruption of the Vandal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030090_0062_0FE4759A204D2A40"/>the weſtern and maritime parts of Europe, and here down all before them; ſo that France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, were made a prey of, and Rome itſelf was made to pay for its liberty. Here they ſettled themſelves for a while, till, toward the period of the third trumpet, they went into Africa, and there founded the kingdom of the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</p>
               <p>Ver. 10. "And the third angel ſounded, and there fell a great ſtar from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of water; and the name of the ſtar is called wormwood; and the third part of the waters became worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and many men died of the waters, becauſe they were made bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter." This blazing ſtar, or comet, is Attila, who, with his Huns, A.D. 452, made a terrible invaſion into the weſtern parts, laying waſte the countries about the Danube and Rhine, the greateſt rivers in Europe, and eſpecially Lombardy, which is watered by the Po. His miſſion ſeems to have been particularly againſt this latter country. Right well did he call himſelf, <hi>The ſcourge of God, and the terror of man.</hi> For fourteen years he ſhook both the eaſt and weſt with the moſt cruel fear, laying waſte the provinces, by plundering, fire, and ſword. After having waſted Thrace, Macedon, and Greece, he turned his arms againſt the weſtern empire: he entered Gaul with 700,000 men, ſet moſt of the cities on fire; but, going beyond the bounds of this trumpet, he met with a ſucceſsful reſiſtance, on which he turned his force againſt Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy, took and deſlroyed Aquilea, with ſeveral other cities, ſlaying the inhabitants, and laying the buildings in aſhes. From the Alps to the Appenine, all was ſlight, depopulation, ſlaughter, bondage, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and deſperation. He was preparing to march to Rome, but was diverted from his purpoſe by a ſolemn embaſſy from the emperor, and the promiſe of an annual tribute; and ſo concluding a truce, he retired out of Italy, and paſſed into his own dominions beyond the Danube.</p>
               <p>Whoever caſts an eye upon a map of this country, which he thus ravaged and depopulated, and which comprehended almoſt all the north of Italy, viz. Piedmont, Milan, moſt of the territory of Venice, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua, Parma, Modena, and ſeveral other provinces, he will inſtantly perceive the aptitude of the deſcription of this judgment: it was to fall upon <hi>the third part of the rivers and fountains of water,</hi> and the waters were to become wormwood, &amp;c. Beſide its lakes, no country in Europe is ſointerſected with rivers. There are not many ſhort of a hundred, reckoning the numerous branches, with their ſeveral conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable ſtreams, which fall into the Po. Perhaps, at ſome future time, not far diſtant, the comparing of what may take place in the overthrow of Antichriſt, with this judgment which fell on thoſe countries eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which are watered by the Rhine and the Po, may help us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that other judgment, repreſented in Rev. xvi. 4.7. by the pouring out of the third vial upon the rivers and fountains of water.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. "And the fourth angel founded, and the third part of the ſun was ſmitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the ſtars; ſo as that the third part of them was darkened, and the day ſhone not for a third part of it, and the night likewiſe." This trumpet alſo relates to Europe, and perfects that for which the other trumpets prepared the way, the extinction of the weſtern empire. We may here recollect what Sir I. Newton, in his obſervations upon the prophecies, ſays, reſpecting this ſort of figurative language. "In ſacred prophecy, which regards not ſingle perſons, the ſun is put for
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030090_0063_0FE475A3503E7A50"/>the whole race of kings, in the kingdom or kingdoms of the world politic, ſhining with regal power and glory; the moon, for the body of the common people, conſidered as the king's wife; the ſtars, for ſubordinate princes and great men. Darkneſs is put for obſcurity of condition, and for error, blindneſs, and ignorance; darkening, ſmiting, or ſetting of the ſun, moon, or ſtars, for the ceaſing of a kingdom, or for the deſolation thereof, proportional to the darkneſs; darkening of the ſun, turning the moon into blood, and falling of the ſtars, for the ſame."</p>
               <p>There appear no events to which this extinguiſhing of the third part of the ſun, moon, and ſtars, can be ſo properly applied as to what took place towards the end of the fifth century, when the weſtern emperor, and his ſubordinate governors, were utterly extinguiſhed, and en entire end was put to the very remainders of the Roman Caeſars. This was effected by the fourth inundation of the barbarous nations, when the Heruli, under Odoacer, their leader, invaded Italy, about the year 475 A. C. and, having conquered Auguſtulus, gave the mortal blow to the weſtern empire, and reduced all Italy under the dominion of the barbarian, who aſſumed the title of King of Italy. About ſixteen years after this, Theodoric, king of the Oſtrogoths, at the requeſt of Zeno, emperor of the eaſt, made war upon theſe invaders in the new ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, conquered Odoacer in ſeveral battles, and obtained, as the fruits of his victories, a kingdom for the Oſtrogoths in Italy, which ſubſiſted, under various turns of ſortune, from the year 493 to 552. The ſeat of government was now removed from Rome to Ravenna. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the imperial government, and humiliation of Rome, appears to be that to which the apoſtle Paul alludes, 2 Theſſ. ii. 6, 7. 8. Thus he, or <hi>that</hi> which hindered the man of ſin from perfecting his ſchemes of ambition, was taken away, and free ſcope was given to the Popes to realize that ſpiritual monarchy, after which they had ſo long panted, but could not ſo eaſily effect while the Caeſars continued, and the civil government remained ſo near them.</p>
               <p>Thus have we ſeen the diſſolution of the Roman empire in Europe effected by the irruptions of the barbarous nations, not at once, but by degrees. From its ruins ſprung up the ten kingdoms, which had been ſhewn to Nebuchadnezzar as the ten toes of a great image, (Dan. ii. 42.) and to Daniel and John as ſo many horns of monſtrous and lavage breaſts. Dan. vii. 7. Rev. xii. 3. xiii. 1.</p>
               <p>What was the effect which all theſe great and conſtant calamities that we have been reviewing, produced on the minds of the ſufferers? Did they put a ſtop to corruption, and reduce mankind to repentance? Inſtead of this, immorality, ſuperſtition, prieſtcraft, and cruel oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, civil and religions, ſeemed to increaſe in proportion to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of Providence, and even to outſtrip the calamities which precipitated the down<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fal of the Roman empire. Inſtead of turning to God by repentance; and ſeeking to him for protection, they multiplied their gods; and the only exhortations of the clergy were, "The holy martyrs, our defenders, are preſent; they would be entreated, and they ſeek that they may be ſought. Seek, therefore, unto theſe helpers of your prayers, find out theſe proteciors of your guiltineſs. Let St. Peter be now your helper in all things, tha afterward he may be able to forgive you your ſius. Chant to the croſs, wherein is the wood of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030090_0064_0FE475A5A6CEF3A8"/>the Lord's croſs, and the hair of John the Baptiſt: we fetch always the comfort of our Saviour through the interceſſion of his fore-runner." Thus idolatry was grafted on the Chriſtian profeſſion; and theſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian apoſtates thought, by theſe devotions, and by making converts by ſire and ſword to the holy Catholic church, to atone for their ſins, and bribe the Divinity to interpoſe in their favour. But while they are chanting to ſaints and relies for peace, and ſhedding the blood of the ſaints as the price of ſafety, behold an angel flying through the midſt of heaven, (ver. 13.) ſaying, with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabitants of the earth, by reaſon of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to found!" The three laſt trumpets are called <hi>woe trumpets,</hi> and this becauſe the plagues which were to come, either on account of their much greater ſeverity or longer duration, would be much more terrible than the four former.</p>
               <p>Chap. ix. 1. "And the fifth angel ſounded, and I ſaw a ſtar fall from heaven unto the earth, and to him was given the the key of the bottomleſs pit." Our commentators are generally agreed, that the judgment intended by this trumpet is very obvious, and cannot be eaſily miſtaken. This falling ſtar, or comet, is the grand impoſtor Mahomet, who, in the unſearchable operations of Providence, was the inſtrument of preparing a race of men, or monſters rather, for the ſcourging of apoſtate Chriſtians. Mahomet commenced his career about the year of Chriſt 608. Then he began to propagate his impoſture, and take to himſelf the title of <hi>The Apoſtle of God.</hi> He did not pretend to deliver a new religion, but to revive that which had been given to Adam. In the year 622 he began to teach his diſciples, that God had ordered him to propagate and enforce his religion by fire and ſword. Accordingly, in 623, they began to put in practice this pretended miſſion. Ver. 2. "And he opened the bottomleſs pit, and there aroſe a ſmoke out of the pit, as the ſmoke of a great furnace; and the ſun and the air were darkened by reaſon of the ſmoke of the pit." This ſmoke is his erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous doctrine. Ver. 3. "And there came out of the pit locuſts upon the earth, and to them was given power as the ſcorpions of the earth have power." It does not comport with my limits, nor is it neceſſary to my deſign, to enter into the minutiae of this part of John's viſion; I ſhall only obſerve, that by theſe locuſts we are to underſtand the Saracens, the diſciples of Mahomet, who, for ſo many years, were the ſcourge of the Greek and Latin churches, Aſia and Europe. Here is no mention made of the <hi>third part,</hi> as in the other trumpets, but their commiſſion was againſt all the men who had not the ſeal of God in their foreheads, that is, who were not the ſervants of God, but had apoſtatiſed from the truth to ſuperſtition, idolatry, and perſecution, which was the caſe with the pretended Chriſtians both of Aſia and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, both of thoſe who acknowledged the ſupreme authority of the Biſhop of Rome, and of thoſe who did not. But theſe locuſts were not to kill theſe men, but only to torment them. This does not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, that they were not to inflict death on any, for this they did on innumerable multitudes; but it means that, though they were to be the authors of numberleſs, torments to both the Greek and Latin churches, yet they were not to deſtroy them in their corpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate capacity. This was to be effected by the future woes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:030090_0065_0FE475A73A0CBF90"/>
As to the time during which theſe Saracen locuſts were to torment them who had not the ſeal of God in their foreheads, it is ſaid, in the <hi>fifth verſe,</hi> to be <hi>five months,</hi> prophetic months undoubtedly, or 150 years. Again, it is ſaid, ver. 10. that "they had tails like ſcorpions, and there were ſtings in their tails; and their power was to hurt men five months;" the ſame period of time with that mentioned before, 150 years. There is ſome difficulty in reconciling this time, which the prophecy allots, with the hiſtory of facts. Some ſuppoſe, that an alluſion only is here made to thoſe hot ſummer months in which locuſts are wont to prevail and do miſchief, without intending to markout any certain time. Some, again, ſuppoſe, that as a prophet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic month contains 30 years, the period of 150 years was intended, and that this refers only to that period in which the Saracens made their chief conqueſts, and occaſioned the greateſt calamities. Others ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that both theſe five months are to be reckoned; and then the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of their tormenting men is fixed to 300 years. But others have thought, that here has been, through the miſtake of copyiſts, ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the original text. See <hi>Whiſton's Eſſay on the Revelations,</hi> p. 196. By this hypotheſis, John is ſuppoſed to have written I E or <hi>decapente</hi> and not E or <hi>pente</hi> that is <hi>fiteen</hi> months inſtead of <hi>five,</hi> this being a period which ſeems to agree much better with the hiſtory of the Saracens" for from the beginning of the Saracen empire, or of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture of Mahomet, in 608, to the firſt grand downfal of it, by the riſe of the Turkiſh empire, at the inauguration of <hi>Tangrolipix,</hi> (after the taking of the capital city of Bagdad), A.D. 1057 or 1058, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 450 years. As it is not eſſential to my deſign, I ſhall not labour to ſolve the difficulties which here preſent themſelves, it being enough for our preſent purpoſe, if this fifth trumpet be allowed to refer to the depredations of this cruel people. I ſhall therefore only beg leave to ſuggeſt to the curious, and to thoſe who may have more ability and leiſure for the inveſtigation, whether the firſt <hi>five months</hi> may not refer to the ſevereſt period of their conqueſts and cruelties in Aſia, where they had their beginning, and the latter <hi>five months</hi> to the time of their chief and moſt tormenting depredations in Europe. Thoſe who wiſh to ſee a more laboured explanation of theſe trumpets, may conſult Brightman, Mede, Lowman, Newton, Whiſton, and others. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of whom, except Mede, has the moſt originality; and though he may have ſome peculiarities, and ſtart ſome hypotheſes which may be thought to be unſupported by good argument, yet, altogether, he ſeems to have had the moſt conſiſtent ideas, and I acknowledge my obligations to him.</p>
               <p>Ver. 12. "One woe is paſt, and behold there come two woes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. And the ſixth angel ſounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar, which is before God, ſaying to the ſixth angel which had the trumpet, Looſe the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. And the four angels were looſed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month and a year, for to ſlay the third part of men." It is almoſt impoſſible not to believe that this woe reſers to the Turks, who overthrew and entirely extinguiſhed all that part of the Roman empire which they aſſaulted, by the taking and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is, as Mr. Whiſton obſerves, a moſt proper, or allegorical deſcription of the way and appearance of ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By theſe they were enabled, in the infancy of this art of killing and laying waſte, to archieve ſome of their greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits. By means of his artillery, Amurath the Second broke into the Peloponneſus, and took ſeveral ſtrong places; and in particular at their moſt fatal action, the taking of Conſtantinople, in 1453, ſuch enormous guns were employed as had never been ſeen before. One is deſcribed to have been of ſuch a monſtrous ſize, that it was drawn by ſeventy yoke of oxen, and two thouſand men. If we moreover conſider the cavalry as ſeen over the heads of their horſes, not only do the men ſeem to be as breaſt-plates of fire, but fire, and ſmoke, and brimſtone, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to iſſne from the mouths of their horſes.</p>
               <p>But it being allowed as it is by almoſt all our writers, that the Turks are intended by this <hi>woe,</hi> what chiefly concerns us is, when was this looſing effected, of which the prophecy ſpeaks, and for how long a time were theſe angels prepared to ſlay the third part of men? Concerning theſe four angels, ſee <hi>Mede's Key,</hi> p. 108, and <hi>Whiſton's Eſſay,</hi> p. 199. They underſtand them to be four ſultanies or kingdoms, which the Turks had at or near the river Euphrates, for ſeveral ſucceſſions togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whoſe capital cities were <hi>Bagdad</hi> beyond that river, and <hi>Iconium, Aleppo,</hi> and <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> on this ſide of it. For a great while they were reſtrained to theſe parts, and could not extend their dominion as they wiſhed. Several circumſtances operated to effect this reſtraint, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the expeditions of the cruſaders, in the 12th and 13th centuries, and the power of the khans of Perſia, who, till the beginning of the fourteenth century exerciſed ſome contro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l over them. But it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the ſeveral reſtraints of Providence which had bound them, began to be taken off towards the end of the thirteenth, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fourteenth centuries. All our writers on the ancient Turkiſh hiſtory, complain of the barrenneſs of their materials, and the inaccuracy of dates; but let us trace this matter as well as we can. Firſt obſerve the riſe of the Ottoman family itſelf. The firſt perſon we read of, of this remarkable race, which has been ſuch a ſcourge to Chriſtendom, is Solyman Shah, who attempted, about A.D. 1214, ſay ſome, later, according to others, to retire out of Perſia, to ſeek for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and followers a ſettlement under the Seljukidae, who then reigned in Aſia Minor. In attempting to paſs the Euphrates he was drowned. This ſo diſcouraged his ſons, that two of them returned back into Perſia; but Ortogrul, the third, with his three ſon, Candoz, Sarubani, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thman, or Ottoman, ſtill remained in the neighbourhood of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates for ſome time, till Aladin, the ſultan of I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oniuin, received him, and gave him, and the four hundred families which emigrated with him, a country to inhabit. Ortogrul died about the year 1289, and his ſon Ottoman continued the ſubject and ſoldier of Aladin. By his valour and ſucceſs he raiſed himſelf to great eminence, and the race of the Seljukidae terminating in Aladin, he fixed upon Ottoman to be his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. Oppreſſed with age and infirmities, he is ſaid, in his lifetime, to have devolved on Ottoman the cares and prerogatives of royalty.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030090_0067_0FE475B40E6E1398"/>Mr. Gibbon fixes this in A.D. 1299; but it is generally determined to have been in 1300. From comparing what is ſaia of the length of his reign and the beginning of the reign of his ſon Urchan, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, there is reaſon to conclude that he began his reign in the year of the Hegira (the Turkiſh epoch) 699 or 700, probably the latter. Now, as the Hegira began July 15. 622, A. D. and the Arabian years being lunar, and the Turks reckoning them by thirties, nineteen of which conſiſt of 354 days, and eleven of 355, their year 700 would commence on September 16, 1300. Thus the fourth month of the Turkiſh year would be, according to the Chriſtian era, 1301. Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians ſeldom take any notice of this difference in the commencement of the Turkiſh years, and thoſe of ours; but if an event is ſaid to have taken place in the 700th year of the Hegira, this year commenceing in 1300 of our era, it is therefore ſet down as in that year. It is probable that Ottoman was inaugurated in the year of the Hegira 700; but hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry does not ſay on what day or month of that year; it might be towards the latter end of it. M. Whiſton endeavours very ingeniouſly to prove from certain circumſtances, that he began his reign May 19. 1301. It would certainly afford ſome ſatisfaction, if we could prove to a day or a month from whence to date the beginning of the Ottoman empire. But I queſtion whether this would be enough to prove the exact time of the looſing theſe four angels, or meſſengers of deſtruction. In Ottoman, it is evident that all theſe ſultanies were united; but perhaps their looſing is to be reckoned from ſome great and ſucceſsful expedition under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken ſome time after he had mounted the throne. I think it is clear that it was ſoon after the commencement of his reign; and if we are not able to prove the exact day or year, it does not invalidate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which we mean to draw.</p>
               <p>According to Chalcocondylas, quoted by Mr. Whiſton, ſoon after Ottoman was ſeated on the Turkiſh throne, the Turks made an irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Europe, even as far as the Danube, and a ſecond ſoon after. This ſecond is aſcribed to 1302. But let us hear Mr. Gibbon, (<hi>Hiſt, of the Riſe and Fall of the Rom. Emp.</hi> vol. xi. p. 443.). who cannot be ſuſpected of wiſhing to ſerve the cauſe of Chriſtianity. He laments, with all other writers on theſe ſubjects, the obſcurity of the Turkiſh annals. He dates the firſt breach which Ottoman made upon the Greek empire, July 27. 1299, bvt ſays it was after the Seljukian dynaſty was no more. As authors are pretty well agreed as to the uncertainty of the Turkiſh dates, and as it is pretty clear that Aladin did not die till 1302, perhaps this date is not quite correct. However this may be, he ſays' "The Seljukian dynaſty was no more; and the diſtance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of the Mogul khaus ſoon enfranchiſed him (Ottoman) from the controul of a ſuperior. He was ſituate on the verge of the Greek em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; the Koran ſanctified his <hi>gazi,</hi> or holy war. againſt the infidels; and their political errors unlocked the paſſes of mount Olympus, and invited him to deſcend into the plains of Bithynia. Till the reign of Paleologus, theſe paſſes had been vigilantly guarded by the militia of the country, who were repaid by their own ſafety, and by an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from taxes. The emperor aboliſhed their privilege, and aſſumed their office; but though the tribute was rigorouſly collected, the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the paſſes was neglected, and the hardy mountaineers degenerated into a trembling crowd of peaſants, without ſpirit or diſcipline. It was on the 27th of July, in 1299 of the Chriſtian era, that Othman firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the territory of Nicomedia; and the ſingular accuracy of the date ſeems to diſcloſe ſome foreſight of the rapid and deſtructive growth
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030090_0068_0FE475B662E77878"/>of the monſter." In p. 431. he informs us, that till now "all the emir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, who had occupied the cities or the mountains, confeſſed the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the khan of Perſia, who oftentimes interpoſed his authority, and ſometimes his arms, to check their depredations, and to preſerve the peace and balance of his Turkiſh frontier. The death of Cazan remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this ſalutary controul; and the decline of the Moguls gave a free ſcope to the riſe and progreſs of the Ottoman empire," This event he dates May 31, 1304. This looks very much like the looſing of which the prophecy ſpeaks. Between this and the year 1312 he dates the conqueſt of the maritime country from the Propontis to the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the iſle of Rhodes, ſo long threatened, and ſo often pillaged; and that now (p. 437.) "the captivity or ruin of the ſeven churches of Aſia was conſummated, and the barbarous lords of Ionia and Lydia ſtill trample on the monuments of claſſic and Chriſtian antiquity." And but a few years after this, ſo humbled were the proud Chriſtians of Conſtantinople, the trembling capital of the emperors in the eaſt, that crowds of naked Chriſtians, of both ſexes, and of every age, of prieſts and menks, of matrons and virgins, were expoſed to ſale in their public markets; and all they could do was to deplore the fate of their brethren, who were led away to the worſt evils of temporal and ſpiritual bondage. In 1357 or 1358 they entered the European ſeas with a very numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fleet of ſhips, and never ceaſed their conqueſts, nor received any effectual check, till the latter end of the laſt century. In 1453 they took and ſacked Conſtantinople, entirely conqueredr the eaſtera empire, and made that imperial city the capital of their vaſt dominions.</p>
               <p>But for how long a period was their triumph to continue? Ver. 15. "And the four angels were looſed which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to ſlay the third part of men." According to Mr. Brightman, Dr. Lloyd, Biſhop of Worceſter, Dr. Creſſner, Mr. Whiſton, and others, 890 yeaas, and ſome odd days, are here ſignified. They reckon, with a little variation, thus:

               <p>It admits of a doubt whether the Jewiſh year of 360 days ſhould be counted, or the Julian year as above; but as it does not affect the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis I mean to eſtabliſh, I ſhall not detain the reader to examine it. Mr. Whiſton argues, that it is probable that Ottoman began his reign May 19. 1301, and reckoning from thence to September 1. O. S. 1697, when prince Eugene overthrew the Turks at Zenta, we have exactly the time required. And it deſerves to be remarked, that ever ſince that overthrow they have never been able to make any effectual head againſt the Chriſtians, ſo called, but inſtead of being a plague to the Chriſtian nations, in the prophetic ſenſe of the term, theſe nations have been a plague to them, and their power has been conſtantly leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for though they have made war ſeveral times, it has been almoſt

               <p>What ſome able writers have ſaid on this ſubject deſerves attention, as it ſerves very much to ſtrengthen the argument, which goes to prove, that the hour, and day, and month, and year, for which this woe was prepared, terminated about the end of the laſt century. The firſt whom I ſhall mention, is Mr. Brightman, who wrote in the beginning of the laſt century. He ſays (in his <hi>Expoſition of the book of Revelation,</hi> p. 324. edition of 1644.) "A year. here put ſimply, is underſtood to be a vulgar and uſual Julian year, that conſiſts of 365 days and ſome hours, all which time being numbered from the year 1300, ſhall expire at laſt about the year 1696, which is the laſt term of the Turkiſh name, as other ſcriptures do alſo prove with marvellous conſent." Dr. Croſner and Dr. Lloyd, biſhop of Worceſter, foretold very nearly the peace of Carlowitz from this paſſage. See what Biſhop Burnet, in his <hi>Hiſtory of his Own Times,</hi> ſays of the latter, (vol. iv, p. 297, of 12mo. edit.) "Dr. Lloyd, the preſent learned biſhop of Worceſter, who has now for above twenty years been ſtudying the Revelation with amazing diligence and exactneſs, had long before this year ſaid, the peace between the Turks and the Papal Chriſtians was certainly to be made in the year 1698, which he made out thus: The four angels, mentioned in the fourteenth chapter of Revelation, that were bound in the river Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, which he expounds to be the captains of the Turkiſh forces, that till then were ſubject to the ſultan of Babylon, were to be looſed or freed from that yoke, and to ſet up for themſelves; and theſe were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſlay the third part of men, for an hour, a day, a month, and a year. He reckons the year in St John is the Julian year of 365 days; that is, in the prophetic ſtyle, each day a year; a month is thirty of theſe days, and a day makes one, which added to the former number makes 396. Now he proves from hiſtory, that Ottoman came and began his conqueſts at <hi>Prouſſe,</hi> in the year 1302, to which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer number, in which they were to ſlay the third part of men, being-added, it muſt end in the year 1698; and though the hiſtorians do not mark the hours, or twelfth part of the day or year, which is a month, that is, the beginning of the deſtruction the Turks were to make, yet he is confident if that is ever known, that the prophecy will be found, even in that, to be punctually accompliſhed. After this he thinks their time of hurting the Papal Chriſtians is at an end. They may indeed
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030090_0070_0FE475B995B42318"/>ſtill do miſchief to the Muſcovites, or perſecute their own Chriſtian ſubjects, but they can do no hurt to the Papilins."</p>
               <p>Dr. J. Mather, who wrote in 1710, ſays, in his <hi>Diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith and Fervency in Prayer,</hi> p. 97. "We are aſſured that when the <hi>ſixth trumpet,</hi> called alſo the <hi>ſecond woe,</hi> has done its work, the ſeventh trumpet, called the third woe, will come quickly, Rev. xi. 14. Now there is reaſon to hope that the <hi>ſecond woe, is paſt,</hi> h. e. that the Turk ſhall be no more ſuch a plague to the apoſtate Chriſtian world, as for ages paſt he has been.

               <p>When I conſider the facts which give us reaſon to think that the four angels, or miniſters of deſtruction, which were bound in the river Euphrates, were looſed, when the four ſultanies above enumerated were united under Ottoman, and freed, not only from the reſtraints laid on them by the cruſaders, but from the controul of the khans of Perſia; when I recollect that all this took place about the latter end of the thirteenth century and the beginning of the fourteenth, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the years 1299 and 1304, the Seljukian race being extinct, and the controul of the k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O. S. 1697, when they experienced that ſatal overthrow at Zenta in Hungary, from the the armyunder Prince Eugene.</p>

No. Ver. 20. "And the reſt of men (the members of the Papal church) which were not killed by theſe plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they ſhould not worſhip devils, and idols of gold, and ſilver, and braſs, and ſtone, and of wood, which neither can ſee, nor hear, nor with, neither repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>Muſt we then give up all hope of better days?

               <p>The gleam of conſolation which breaks upon us in this chapter is very ſeaſonable and reviving; the great and laſting troubles predicted in the former chapters, and which occupy a ſpace of 1400 years, are enough to try the faith and patience of the beſt.

The woes of the two laſt trumpets had now afflicted the nations for near a thouſand years; and the enormities of Antichriſt had prevailed for a longer period. To revive the ſpirits, and to animate the hopes of God's ſervants, an angel appears at the end of the ſixth trumpet, or the ſecond woe, to aſſure them that the time of corruption, perſecution, and calamity, ſhall not continue much longer, but that the ſeventh and laſt trumpet ſhall ſoon be ſounded, and that woe come upon Antichriſtian oppreſſors which ſhall finiſh the myſtery of God, and introduce among men his glorious kingdom of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, peace, and happineſs. Seeing then that there are the moſt cogent reaſons for concluding, that the woe of the ſixth trumpet terminated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 1697, near a hundred years ago, and that many good and eminent men have been daily expecting, ſince that time, the judgments of the ſeventh trumpet, which are to bring the triumphs of Popery, idolatry, oppreſſion, and wickedneſs, to an end, and introduce the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, it becomes us to attend to the <hi>Signs of the times,</hi> and ſee whether the fig-tree is not ſhooting forth and annoucing the approach of ſummer. May the Spirit of God direct and illumine our minds, that we may underſtand his word and judge rightly!</p>
               <p>Chap. x. 1. "And I ſaw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the ſun, and his feet as pillars of fire; and he had in his hand a little book open." This little open book appears to be a codicil to that book of which we read in chap. v. coutaining ſome addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional explanatory matter. The book with ſeven ſeals contains a gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al repreſentation of the ſlate of things under the fourth monarchy of the world, (Dan. vii. 7.23.) or of the Roman empire, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and ſtates into which it has been divided, from the firſt preaching of the goſpel to the end of time, and does not take particular notice of the events which more peculiarly concern the church of Chriſt. This little book includes ſeveral diſtinct viſions which repreſent more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

               <p>The obſerving of the greateſt conſequence to this is right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this intereſting and inſtructive book.</p>
               <p>Ver. 2. "And he ſet his right foot upon the ſea, and his left foot on the earth, and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth, and when he had cried, ſeven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven ſaying unto me, Seal up thoſe things which the ſeven thunders uttered, and write them not. And the angel which I faw ſtand upon the ſea, and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and ſware by Him that liveth for ever and ever—that there ſhould be time no longer;" Dr. Doddridge has well expreſſed it, "the times of the judgments, to be ſignified by the pouring out of the ſeven vials, ſhould not be much longer delayed." And thus alſo do Brightman and others explain it, as meaning that delay ſhould be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but that the ſeventh trumpet ſhould now ſpeedily ſound, and the judgments of God bring Babylon the Great to a rapid end. And then (ver. 7.) the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, as he hath declared to his ſervants the prophets. Then the providence of God, in permitting the kingdom of his Son to be ſo long and ſo ſucceſsfully oppoſed; in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his church to be ſo grievouſly harraſſed by its enemies, and in ſuffering oppoſers ſo long to triumph, which has been eſteemed among the chiefeſt myſteries of the Divine conduct, ſhall be illuſtrated, and all nations ſhall ſee, in the deciſive woe upon Babylon, thoſe diſplays of wiſdom and righteouſneſs which ſhall vindicate the Divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all the aſperſions of infidelity.</p>
               <p>Of this great event almoſt all the prophets have ſpoken, and all agree that the calamities will be the moſt tremendous that the nations have ever experienced; but the iſſue, as it concerns the liberty and happineſs of mankind in general, as well as the felicity of the church of Chriſt in particular, the moſt glorious. A glory this very different from that which worldly wiſdom and carnal pride, for ſo many centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, have been aiming at. All the governments of the world will be framed on principles of impartial and general juſtice. Pure and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed religion will revive. "Glory to God in the higheſt, and on the earth peace, good-will toward men," will again be ſung; and both the ſcattered Jews and the fulneſs of the Gentiles will be brought in to ſwell the chorus, and to grace the triumphs of the Son of God. Long have the eyes of believers been looking to the promiſes. and obſerving the <hi>ſigns of the times,</hi> expecting the arrival of theſe promiſed days. But hitherto the time has been <hi>delayed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here, after the ſixth trumpet, or the ſecond woe, is paſt, and the reſt of the men, who were not killed, repented not, and after the ſeven thunder had uttered their voices, the angel ſwears by Him who liveth for ever and ever, that <hi>delay</hi> ſhall be no longer, but the ſeventh angel ſhall ſound.</p>
               <p>In the next chapter, which contains explanatory viſions, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the ſeventh angel does not ſound his trumpet, to bring the deciſive woe, till after the witneſſes are riſen from the dead, in ſome one of the Antichriſtian kingdoms, nor till that kingdom, or tenth part of the Antichriſtian city, is ſo ſhaken by an earthquake that it falls. Here it is neceſſary to recollect what has been advanced in the firſt part of <hi>The Signs of the Times.</hi> It is there endeavoured to be proved,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030090_0073_0FE475C577201B38"/>that by the <hi>ſecond beaſt,</hi> which came up out of the earth, (Rev. xiii. 11 —19.) the French tyranny, as perfected by Lewis XIV, and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his ſucceſſors, was intended; that it was he who, by the repeal of the edict of Nants, and the overthrow of all the remains of civil liberty in France, ſlew the witneſſes for <hi>religious truth</hi> and <hi>civil liberty;</hi> that it was he who cauſed an image, to be made to the firſt beaſt (the Papacy) by the eſtabliſhment of a ſpiritual tyranny ſimilar to that at Rome, and which, contrary to the ſlate of things in any other country where the Pope's ſupremacy in ſpirituals has been acknowledged, was at once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the Pope's authority, and yet in ſupport of his pretenſions and corruptions. I have alſo endeavoured to prove, that it was here the witneſſes lay politically dead for three lunar days and a half, or 105 years; that the revolution in France in 1789 was the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the witneſſes to civil life, and the commotions which have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, the prophetic earthquake here predicted; and that the fall of the tenth part of the city is accompliſhed in the overthrow of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy or tyranny of France. Immediately after this the ſeventh angel ſounds, and uſhers in the <hi>third woe,</hi> which is to be the means of haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the kingdom of God. The nations are angry, (compare chap. xi. 18. with xix. 19.) and gather themſelves together to oppoſe the deſigns of God: his wrath falls upon them, and they are deſtroyed. This <hi>eleventh</hi> chapter we muſt remember, is a miniature picture of the hiſtory of the Chriſtian church, from its firſt beginnings to the end of time, and belongs to the little book which treats of the affairs of the church eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. When the viſions of the book with ſeven ſeals are reſumed, (which book refers to the more mixed and general concerns of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms), as in the <hi>fifteenth</hi> and following chapters, theſe events of the ſeventh trumpet, or third woe, are exhibited on a larger ſcale, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with a more circumſtantial detail.</p>
               <p>Now let us compare tenth chapter with the eleventh. In the tenth chapter we are informed that it was not till after the ſeven thunders had uttered their voices that the angel lifted up his hand to heaven, and ſware by him that liveth for ever, that <hi>delay</hi> ſhould be no longer, but that the myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed by the ſounding of the ſeventh angel. Theſe ſeven thunders, I think, evidently occupy the ſpace between the ending of the ſixth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>mpet and the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſeventh. But, what are theſe thunders? John was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to write what they uttered; and hence moſt commentators have paſt over this part of the prophecy without even conjecturing what might be intended, ſuppoſing that it would be preſumptuous to do ſo. But this has not been the caſe with all. Some have conjectured that though what they uttered was not to be written at that time, yet they are explained in the after viſions. Brightman ſuppoſed them to be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fourteenth chapter: Whiſton imagines that they belong to the laſt vial, chap. xvi. But all this ſeems very unnatural. There are others who ſuppoſe, that though it was not proper to write down what they uttered at that time, yet that, after their accompliſhment, they will be underſtood, and ſuppoſe them to be ſeven warnings which are to precede either the ſeventh trumpet or the laſt vial. It appears to me that as John was forbidden to write down what theſe thunders uttered in viſion, it would be as preſumptuous as it would be uſeleſs, to inquire what it was till the viſion is realized, and the intent of theſe thunders is aſcertained. For as it is likely that it was forbidden to be written, leſt the prophecy ſhould be made too plain before the time that God
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030090_0074_0FE475C70F1F1800"/>would have it underſtood, ſo to attempt an explanation till events have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> archetypes of the thunders quite clear, would be running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. But it does not hence follow that this is always to be the caſe; for when the things ſignified are accompliſhed, they may info<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, in language as plain as events can ſpeak, of what we were not to know before. But, to ſay nothing of what theſe munders might utter, we may obſerve, that as we are not forbidden to inquire what the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral meaning of theſe thunders themſelves might be, and as it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they were intended to be ſome time underſtood, to the end that they might ſerve as a guide to direct the inquirer into the ſigns of the times, and as otherwiſe the mention of them would be uſeleſs, it is therefore very proper to examine, with modeſty, whether this part of ſacred writ may not aſſiſt us in forming a judgment of the times in which we live, that thus we may be excited to redoubled watchfulneſs, and be ready.</p>
               <p>Our firſt inquiry ſhould be, what is the meaning of thunder in the my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and figurative language of prophecy? As in the natural world the things of creation are compriſed in the heavens and the earth, and the heavens are conſidered as the nobler parts of the creation, ſo in the world politic, in prophetic language, the heavens mean thrones and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments: the ſun, moon, and ſtars, emperors, kings, princes, and great men, as well as empires, kingdoms, and ſlates; the earth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the great maſs of the common people; clouds mean multitudes; wind, haſt, ſtorm, and thunder, as well as earthquakes, ſignify wars and commotions among multitudes and nations. Thus in Iſa. xxviii. 2. when God, by his prophet, threatens to puniſh by war, the language is, "The Lord hath'a mighty and ſtrong one, which, as a tempell of hail, and a deſtroying ſtorm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, ſhall caſt down to the earth." And again, chap. xxix. 6. "Thou ſhalt be viſited of the Lord of hoſts with thunder, and with earthquake, and a great noiſe, with ſtorm and tempeſt, and a flame of devouring fire." The next verſe explains what this thunder and ſtorm is: "And the multitude of all the nations that fight againſt Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But here it will be proper to aſk, (for frequent obſervation has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me that ſuch queſtions are not altogether needleſs,) Does the reader believe that a prophecy can be fulfilled by the events which take place in his own day, and which paſs under his own obſervation, as well as by thoſe of five hundred years back, or five hundred years to come? Does he think the wars and great events of nations which have or may take place in this age, and in theſe countries of Europe, as worthy to be the ſubject of prophecy as what was foretold by Daniel, (chap. xi.), reſpecting the invaſion of Greece by Xerxes; or of the conqueſts of Alexander, and the fate of his empire; or of Egypt, and which was formed between Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, and Antiochus Theus, king of Syria, by the marriage of Berenice, the daughter of the former, with the latter, and the conſequences that followed that connection? I hope he does.</p>

On examination, the hiſtory of this century will inform us that, taking all the nations together which do or have made up the body of the Papal beaſt; and among whom the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of religious corruption, uſurpation, &amp;c. continue, (and which almoſt all allow to be the object of theſe viſions), there have been juſt ſeven of theſe thunders, or periods of war, neither more nor leſs. And it is worthy of remark, that this is the caſe whether we take into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thoſe ſtates and kingdoms only which ſprung out of the ruins of the old Roman empire, or all thoſe that compoſe the Latin church, or even the whole of Europe. We ſhall conſider thoſe wars in which all Europe have been engaged, ſo far only as the nations which are or have been ſubject to the Papacy, have been concerned in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt period of war commenced in 1700, and continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion till 1721 incluſive; for when other powers terminated their deſtructions, and huſhed the roar of war in ſome parts of Europe, by the peace of Utrecht, in 1713, and by that of Raſtadt, in 1714, then, as though alarmed leſt mankind ſhould be too happy, the madman Charles the Twelfth of Sweden rouſed himſelf from his bed of affected ſickneſs at Dometica, and proſecuted his war againſt Ruſſia, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, Pruſſia, Poland, Hanover, and Saxony, with renewed vigour. In theſe wars the following powers were engaged: Sweden, Ruſſia, Denmark, Poland, England, Holland, the Emperor, Spain, France, the Venetians, the Turks, &amp;c. This was the firſt thunder,</p>

The ſecond, though very violent while it laſted was of ſhorter du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration than the former, continuing only through the three campaigns of 1733, 1734, and 1735.

3. In 1737 the third thunder began to roll; nor did it ceaſe to lay the faireſt parts of Europe in ruins all 1748. In the wars which filled up this period of deſtruction the following powers were engaged: the Emperor, Ruſſians, and Turks, led the way; England and Spain quickly followed; France, Pruſſia and Holland, alſo united to increaſe the calamity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In 1755 commenced another period of war, which ſoon ſet all Europe in a flame. Great-Britain, France, Pruſſia, Saxony, Auſtria, Sweden, Spain and Portugal, experienced its effects. This period of wariaſted till 1763, and was the fourth thunder.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth, though extremely violent where it raged, did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend itſelf ſo wide. The parties engaged were the Ruſſians, Poles, and Turks. The French and Corſicans alſo increaſed the roar. Poland was never ſo deſolated. This commenced in 1768, and continued five years.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Peace, as uſual, was but of ſhort continuance. The diſpute of Great Britain with her American colonies, which broke out into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen rupture in 1775, was the occaſion of a ſixth general tempeſt break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the chief maritime powers of Europe, and which continued from 1778 to 1782, five years. The powers engaged were Great Britain, France; Spain and Holland.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſeventh and laſt period of war was from 1788 to 1791, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive. The parties engaged were the Ruſſians and Auſtrians againſt the Turks; the Swedes againſt the Ruſſians and Danes; the Belgians alſo, who revolted againſt the Emperor, increaſed the tempeſt. Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark ſoon became neuter; and as far as the Emperor and Swedes were concerned, peace was reſtored in 1790, but the Ruſſians and Turks continued their ſlaughter till 1791. This was the ſeventh thunder.</p>
               <p>This laſt period of war ſeems, under providence, to have been among the principal cauſes of the ſucceſs of the revolutioniſts in France; for thoſe who may be thought to have been the moſt diſpoſed to aſſiſt the French court were otherwiſe employed. This circumſtance has not been unnoticed by the writers of the day. It has been obſerved, that it happened unfortunately with reſpect to the ariſtocratical party in France, that Europe had ſeldom been, through a long courſe of years, in a ſtate leſs capable of affording the ſuccours which were now demanded by the princes, nobles, and clergy of that country, or in which the minds of the people, or the diſpoſitions of the ſovereigns, were leſs calculated for undertaking any enterpriſe, than at preſent. The mad ambition of the Emperor Joſeph, under the influence of the overwhelming power and vall deſigns of Ruſſia, to which he became ſo miſerable a dupe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ruin and ſpirit of revolt which it ſpread through his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, had, in no ſmall degree, deranged the general policy of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. And it is worthy to be obſerved, that juſt when this prince was on the eve of making peace with the Turks, and which being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, he might then have been able to turn his attention to the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his brother-in-law the king of France, he died, (Feb. 20. 1790.) His ſucceſſor, Leopold, immediately ſet himſelf to accompliſh what death prevented Joſeph from executing; but no ſooner was peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the Ottoman court, and his revolting ſubjects in Brabant brought to obedience, than he died alſo, (March 1, 1791). All theſe happily extinguiſhed juſt as it was breaking out, and the expence of
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030090_0077_0FE475D3B3B30028"/>events counteracted every inclination which the court of Vienna might have to oppoſe the progreſs of the French revolution, and gave time for its gaining ſuch a firm eſtabliſhment, that before Francis, the preſent emperor, could be prepared for the meditated attack, the people of France were become too much enlightened into the enormities of the old ſyſtem, too much informed of their rights and ſtrength, and too untted, to be eaſily frightened into a retreat.</p>
               <p>The courts of London and Madrid were occupied in a ſquabble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an object ſcarcely bearing or deſerving a name. The king of Sardinia, from the ſtate of his finances, of his army, of his fortreſſes, was not in a condition to hazard any attempt in favour of the old deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, till too late. We may add the immenſe debts, contracted in the wars of the preſent century, (originating, from the impolitic and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice of funding, which muſt in the end, and perhaps very ſoon, terminate in events the moſt calamitous to thoſe who have had reſort to ſuch unwiſe meaſures): theſe debts, I ſay, and the conſequent derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the finances of all the powers in Europe, proved highly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the cauſe of the French reformers; and however great the fears of ſome might he, reſpecting the influence of this example, or however much inclined to liſten to the ſupplications of humbled deſpotiſm, or to ſupport the cauſe of the mortified nobility and clergy, whoſe cries for vengeance filled every court and every country, yet they were ſo ſhackled by circumſtances as not to be able to yield them immediate aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Thus have the wars of this century been preparing the way for the accompliſhment of God's deſigns in the overthrow of the tenth part of the Antichriſtian city, and the deſtruction of the power of thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged orders of men, who had been its chief ſupporters, which appears to be the ſlaying of the ſeven thouſand names of men, predicted Rev. xi. 13. and which events were to be the prelude to the ſeventh trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, which is to bring thoſe judgments that are to perfect the overthrow of Papal corruption and tyranny.</p>
               <p>Seeing that God, by his ſervants the prophets, has condeſcended in various known and allowed caſes, (as may be ſeen by comparing the writings of the prophets with hiſtory) to reveal his purpoſes concerning the fate of nations, and that for the confirmation of his word, and the edification of mankind, it certainly becomes us to examine whether there be any takens or ſigns by which we may know the preſent times, leſt the judgments of God come upon us when we are not aware, and find us, inſtead of waiting for him, as his faithful ſervants, in arms againſt his providence, and in league for the ſupport of his enemies, and the enemies of his children.</p>
               <p>There never were greater or more important events, ſince the world began, than thoſe to which we are witneſſes; events apparently big with the moſt awful conſequences. Though what we have advanced reſpecting the termination of the power of the Turks in or about the year 1697, and the accompliſhment of the ſeven thunders, by the ſeven periods of war which have been ſince that time, may not, by itſelf, prove that the time is arrived for the founding of the ſeventh trumpet, and for the commencement of that woe which is to bring Antichriſtian idolatry, corruption, and oppreſſion to an end, yet, in conjuction with other prophecies and events, it is poſſible that it may form a ſtrong probability—a probability as near to a demonſtration as can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contained
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030090_0078_0FE475D54CE360A0"/>in chapter the eleventh, we are informed, that after the two witneſſes, or two deſcriptions of witneſſes, had lain politically dead in one of the ſtreets of the Antichriſtian city, the myſtical Babylon, for three prophetic days and a half, the ſpirit of life from God entered into them, and they ſtood upon their feet, and great fear fell upon them who ſaw them. This is a Jewiſh manner of deſcribing the great poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical changes of nations from bondage to liberty, as may be ſeen by comparing this place with Iſa. xxv. 6—12. xxvi. 12, 19, 21. Ezek. xxxvii. 1—14. What the prophets, in the paſſages referred to, have deſcribed as the reſurrection of the Jews from the dead, is allowed, on all hands, to be their riſing to civil and political exiſtence, when they ſhall be reſtored from their diſperſions and bondage to their own land and to liberty; and the ſpirit which is promiſed, Ezek. xxxvii. 14. to be put in them that they may live, is not that which is promiſed Jer. xxxi. 33. and Ezek. xi. 19. but the ſpirit of political and civil life, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat greater bleſſing of the renovating Spirit of God. Upon the riſing of theſe witneſſes from their ſtate of death, they heard a great voice from heaven, (ver. 12.) that is, from the Supreme Power, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto them, "Come up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>her," aſſume the privileges and rights of freemen. "And the ſame hour there was a great earthquake;" ver. 18.) or in plain language, without prophetic figure, a great national convulſion, from the ſtruggles which the ſupporters of corruption and tyranny made againſt the vindicators of the civil and religious rights of mankind. "And the tenth part of the city fell." This for ages paſt has been ſuppoſed to refer to France, the tenth part of the Antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian city, and events ſeem to verify the conjecture. This doubtleſs appears to point out one of the ten Papal ſtates or monarchies which had been the great ſupporter of the perſecution and oppreſſions of the whore of Babylon, and which was to fall ſome little time before the founding of the ſeventh trumpet for the great and deſolating woe; and no one of them has been, all through, ſo conſpicuous in her cauſe as France.</p>
               <p>"And in the earthquake"—not at the moment of the falling of the tenth part of the city, but in the earthquake which terminated in that event, "were ſlain of men ſeven thouſand;" or, of the names of men, as it ſhould be read. This has alſo, for near two centuries back, been ſuppoſed to be a prediction of the abolition of titles in France, and of the periſhing of thoſe privileged orders of men who have been the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſupporters of deſpotiſm, and the chief actors in the perſecutions which have raged againſt God's ſervants, as may be ſeen more at large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Firſt Part of <hi>The Signs of the Times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Immediately after the fall of this tenth part of the city, the third woe commences, Ver. 14. "The ſecond woe is paſt, and behold the third woe cometh quickly. And the ſeventh angel founded, and there were great voices in heaven, ſaying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt; and he ſhall reign for ever and ever." That is, thoſe judgments now commence, which are ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to effect this happy change; but Babylon the Great is to fall firſt, and this is to be accompliſhed by terrible things in righteouſneſs. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are to be angry, (ver. 18.) and oppoſe the deſigns of God; the conſequence of which will be, he will gather them together, (chap. xvi. 16. xix. 17—21.) and pour upon them his wrath, and thus deſtroy thoſe (whether ſecular or eccleſiaſtical) who deſtroy the earth.</p>
               <p>Let us now return to the ſeven thunders, and ſee whether our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of them agree with what is here predicted reſpecting the tenth
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030090_0079_0FE475DE6B7BC660"/>part of the Antichriſtian city, and the events which have taken place. The laſt thunder, or period of war, as we have ſeen, began in 1788. juſt before the earthquake in France commenced, and continued till 1791, or, if we exclude Ruſſia and Turkey, 1790. It entered far into the period of the earthquake, and was a means, under Providence, of forwarding the conſequences of that convulſion. In this part of the earthquake the names of men were Ilain, that is, the titles and diſtinctions not only of the eccleſiaſtics, but of the ſecular nobility, were aboliſhed. The titles of theſe latter were aboliſhed June 9. 1790. Their cries for vengeance excited the ſympathy and pity of the ſurrounding courts, but they were at preſent in no condition to help them.</p>
               <p>The thunder ceaſed.—Aug. 25, 1791, ſeveral potentates and princes entered into a treaty at Pilaitz, and agreed to prepare for the invaſion of France, and to unite their forces to reſtore the ancient deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, and with it the invaded rights of the nobility and prieſthood. —The affairs of France advance faſt towards a criſis.—The angel ſwears by Him who liveth for ever and ever, that delay ſhall be no longer. —Aug. 10, 1792, the monarchy falls.—The ſeventh angel founds.— The nations are angry, and God's wrath is come.</p>
               <p>Thus there hitherto appears to have been the moſt exact conformity between the repreſentations to John, and the events which we have been conſidering, eſpecially as to the riſing and ſinking of the Turkiſh power, and the periods of war which have afflicted the Latin church, to theſe weſtern parts of the world, ſince the term nation of the violence or the ſecond woe, and preparatory to the third; as well as to the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in France, and the commotions of nations which have followed the fall of the Papacy and monarchy in that country. A correſpondence this which is calculated to excite the moſt ſerious alarm on account of our preſent ſituation, and of what we have to expect. But it is happy to reflect that this is not all; it is calculated alſo to cheer the hopes of all thoſe who are waiting for the fulfilment of the promiſes of God, for the morning cometh as well as the night, and <hi>at evening time it ſhall be light,</hi> (Zech. xiv. 7.) But would we eſcape the evil, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate only in the good? The likelieſt means to inſure this, is, without delay, to withdraw from this unhappy and <hi>inauſpicoius</hi> war, and apply ourſelves to a univerſal reformation.</p>
               <p>THERE are alſo other ſigns of the times which very pointedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate what we have to expect, but which we ſhall only briefly touch upon. From comparing what Ezekiel ſays, (chap. xxvi. xxvii. and xxviii.) concerning the fall of Tyrus, and the conſequent calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, from the failure of commerce, with what is ſaid reſpecting the fall of Babylon the Great, Rev. xviii. ſerious concluſions might be deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As there might alſo, not only from that general indifference which prevails as to every thing which concerns religion, but from compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rev. xvi. 2, 13. with exiſting events. The union of Proteſtants and Papiſts, (though it muſt be ſuppoſed that they do not in general mean this,) for the ſupport of that which heretofore they thought it their firſt duty to oppoſe, and for the overthrow of which they pray i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> all their churches, is a ſingular phaenomenon.—Yes, charity obliges us
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030090_0080_0FE475E0071C1950"/>to hope that the majority of Proteſtants would revolt at the idea of leaguing themſelves with Papal tyrants, for the direct purpoſe of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Popery. I believe that this is not the idea of the people in this country, and I hope that none of our treaties will ever bind us to fight through thick and thin for the perpetual ſafety of all the ſtates of Italy. For as the day (if God's word be true) will certainly come, and, it is likely, very ſoon, when God's wrath will be poured out upon that ſeat of ſpiritual tyranny, this would involve us in an awful ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indeed, to the moſt diſtant hazard of which no wiſe Proteſtants would expoſe their king and country. They who would do this, let them abuſe the French infidels as much as they will, are deeper in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity than they. No; the people of this country, in general, think nothing about Popery, or of the policy of ſupporting it. This is not eſteemed even a ſecondary end of the war by them. But it is too evident, that the violent advocates for religious hierarchies, tithes, &amp;c. among Proteſtants, although they might approve of ſome reformation in the Gallican church, and would not have found themſelves inclined to oppoſe any alteration which might have brought it to a nearer confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to their own ſeveral ſyſtems, yet when the French reformers aboliſhed tithes, and reſtored to the people their ancient and natural right of chooſing their own paſtors, and eſpecially when they aboliſhed all religious eſtabliſhments in that extenſive country, and placed the different ſects upon an equal footing, and made all the miniſters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion dependent upon their ſeveral flocks for ſupport, who might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them in proportion to their own ability, or according to the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion entertained of their deſerts; this reduction of things to the original ſtate in which Chriſt and his apoſtles left them, was beyond bearance, and they had rather that all the abſurdities and oppreſſions of the old Papal eſtabliſhment ſhould be reſtored, than ſuch a dangerous example be ſet up in the heart of Europe. This appears evidently to be the ſentiment of thoſe who wail and howl ſo dreadfully about the contempt into which their "dear brethren in Chriſt" (the Popiſh clergy, who can no longer ſhew their mitred fronts in Parliaments) have fallen, and for the overthrow of the holy altars of the idolatrous whore of Babylon. But let us paſs on.</p>
               <p>When I read or hear the ravings of Mr. B—ke, and of ſuch like orators, who are liſtened to with admiration and wonder, while they ſo feelingly deſcribe the merits of the Papal prieſthood, the ſanctity of all religious eſtabliſhments, and the enormous impiety of touching this ark of God;—when I hear right reverend prelates of a Proteſtant church, drawing the moſt invidious compariſons between the prieſts of the bloody whore of Babylon and the diſſenting miniſters of this country, (than whom, with the whole body of Proteſtant diſſenters, there are none who are more ſincere in their loyalty to the king, in their attachment to the conſtitution, or more uniform in their obedience to the laws—but ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to corruption, and friends to civil and religious liberty);—when I hear them, before the moſt auguſt aſſemblies, breathing out nothing but brotherly love to the former, and nothing but wrath and bitterneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the latter, and all becauſe theſe differ from them in opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout tithes and religious eſtabliſhments;—while I hear them exerting all their eloquence, not only to implore our protection and pity for the exiled prieſts of France as fellow-creatures, (for that would be praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, for, <hi>if thine enemy hunger, feed him</hi>) but as our <hi>brethren, members of Chriſt, and heirs of the promiſes;</hi> "more near and dear
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030090_0081_0FE475E19A947D38"/>to us by far than ſome who, affecting to be called our Proteſtant breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, have no other title to be called Proteſtant than a Jew or a Pagan, who, not being a Chriſtian, is for that reaſon only, not a Papiſt;"—while I hear them ſoftening our renunciation of the Autichriſtian church of Rome, into an eſtrangement, and her idolatry and blaſphemous dogmas into "what we deem their errors and corruptions;"—whilſt I hear them wail over the fallen altars and violated riches of Papal idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and ſuperſtition, without one ſentence which may lead us to adore God, in the contemplation of thoſe righteous and awful judgment, by which he fulfils his word, and avenges the cauſe of the innocent;—I perceive in this unity of ſentiment between ſuch exalted Proteſtants and the church of Rome a <hi>ſign of the times</hi> which indicates no good to the friends of civil and religious liberty.—But I will leave ſuch men to the mercy of God, and the public to their own reflections.—Rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the law protects the innocent, I hope that ſuch men will never be permitted to realize their zeal in any thing beyond invective and wailing; and then, let them inveigh, let them wall.—Jeſus I know, and Paul I know; but, who are theſe?—Not the genuine friends eith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Proteſtantiſm, their country, the king, or the conſtitution, which they make their theme.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>ſigns of the times</hi> which I ſhall notice reſpects the Ottoman empire. In Dan. xi. 40—45. we have a prophecy of the calamities which the people of the fourth monarchy, or rather of the Papal church, ſhould ſuffer from the king of the South, or the <hi>Saraceas;</hi> and from the king of the North, the <hi>Tarks,</hi> who came originally from the north quarter. After enumerating the conqueſts of this laſt enemy, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſays, ver. 44. "But tidings out of the eaſt, and out of the north, ſhall trouble him; therefore ſhall be go forth with great fury to deſtroy, and utterly to make away many;" ver. 45. "yet he ſhall come to his end, and none ſhall help him." "And at that time" (xii. 1.) "ſhall Michael ſtand up, the great Prince, which ſtandeth for the children of thy people." (the Jews,) "and there ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as there never was ſince there was a nation, even to that ſame time; and at that time, thy people" (the Jews) "ſhall be delivered, every one that ſhall be written in the book." Then follows a deſcription of their political riſing, after the manner of the eaſtern ſlyle.</p>
               <p>Enemies from the eaſt, from towards Perſia or Arabia, and from the north, are to be the means of bringing the Turkiſh monſter to an end, and this is to be preparatory to the return of the Jews to their own country, which the Turks now poſſeſs, and at which time ſuch troubles will afflict the nations as have never been known.—One enemy is to come from the eaſt, and another from the north; and it is deſerving the attention of thoſe who would obſerve the progreſs of things towards the accompliſhment of God's purpoſes, that at the preſent time the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman empire is at once threatened from both theſe quarters. The new ſect of the Nchabis in Arabia, are ſaid to become more formidable. Theſe are Mahomedan infidels, and their doctrine has nothing leſs in view than the deſtruction of the whole ſyſtem of Mahometaniſm, as a ſyſtem of ſuperſtition, oppreſſion and bloodſhed. The founder of the ſect was the Shick Mahomed Jon Abduhl Vehab. This doctrine has been brooding, it is ſaid, near ſixty years, and its advocates now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>ion by force of arms. They have adherents both ſecret and revealed among the Arabians in general. They are reported to poſſeſs the greater part of the country from Medina to Baſſora, on the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030090_0082_0FE475E32E833A00"/>Euphrates, and beyond it, and 40,000 men have been found inſufficient to overpower them. The Porte is purſuing meaſures for their reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and we muſt wait the iſſue before we can form any certain opinion; but it is probable that Mahometaniſm, as well as Popery, will owe its fall to the prevalence of infidelity.—The ſecond great enemy which is to contribute to the deſtruction of the Turkiſh empire, is to come from the north, and this ſeems at preſent the moſt formidable. Ever ſince the time that we have ſuppoſed the rage of the ſecond woe to have ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, (the latter end of the laſt century) the power of the Ruſſians has been getting a bead of that of the Ottomans, and at this moment Conſtantinople trembles at the frown of the aſpiring Catharine.</p>
               <p>But here a difficulty preſents itſelf. As the Turks came originally from the neighbourhood of Mount Caucaſus, where the family of Gog was ſettled, and as they have long been in poſſeſſion of moſt of thoſe countries mentioned by the prophet Ezekiel, (chap. xxxviii. 2—6.) as the invaders of Paleſtine, after the Jews' reſtoration, it has therefore been thought that the Turks are the people to whom the prophecy refers. But, if the Turkiſh empire is to be overthrown to make way for the reſtoration of the ſeed of Abraham, how is this to be reconciled with the prediction of the prophet, and the generally-received opinion? Were I to enter into a laboured conſideration of this ſubject, it would carry me far beyond the bounds I have preſcribed myſelf. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but juſt touch upon it, and refer the reader for farther information to Well's <hi>Geography of the Old Teſt.</hi> vol. 1. chap. 3. ſect. 2.</p>
               <p>Reſpecting Gog and his aſſociates, mentioned by Ezekiel, it appears that Gog, or Magog, the ſon of Japhet, ſettled himſelf about Mount Caucaſus, and is eſteemed the farther of the Scythians, who dwelt on the eaſt and north-eaſt of the Euxine or Black Sea; Gomer and his ſon Togarmah peopled the northern track of the leſſer Aſia; Meſhech ſettled to the eaſtward of Gomer, in part of Cappadocia and Armenia, to the ſouth and ſouth-eaſt of the Black ſea; Tubal ſettled ſtill farther to the eaſtward, towards the Caſpain Sea. Theſe two latter were the near neighbours of Gog. From a colony of Tubal ſprung the Ruſſians; and the Muſcovites owe their origin to a colony of Meſhech. Dr. Wells, (vol. 1. p. 158.) treating on the origin of the Muſcovites and Ruſſians, ſays, "That the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> or <hi>Muſcovites</hi> in Europe were a colony originally of Meſhech or Moſoch, called by the Greeks Moſchi, is very probable, not only on account of likeneſs of names, but alſo of the reſpective ſituations of the Aſiatic and European Moſchi one to the other. Add to his another conſideration, that whereas in our and ſome other tranſlations the Hebrew text, Ezek. xxxviii. 2. is rendered thus: <hi>The chief prince,</hi> or (as it is in the margin of our Bibles) <hi>the prince of the chief of Meſhech and Tubal;</hi> in other tranſlations, and particularly in the Septuagint, it is thus rendered; <hi>The prince of Roſh Moſhech, and Tubal.</hi> The thing is, the Hebrew word <hi>Roſh,</hi> by ſome is taken to be an appellative, by others a proper name. The learned Bochart has obſerved from the Nubian geographer, that the river in Armenia, called by the Greeks <hi>Araxes,</hi> is by the Arabians called <hi>Roſh.</hi> And hence he not only probably infers, from other inſtances of the people that lived in the country about that river were alſo denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inated Roſh, but alſo proyes from J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſephus Bengorion, that there were a people in thoſe parts named Rhoſſi. Now the Moſchi and Roſſi be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus neighbours in Aſia, their colonies kept together in Europe, thoſe of the Moſchi ſeating themſelves in the province of Muſcovy,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030090_0083_0FE475EC9715DDC8"/>properly ſo called, that is, the parts about the city of Moſcow: thoſe of the Roſh ſeating themſelves in the parts adjoining on the ſouth. For the learned Bochart has obſerved from Tzetzes, that the people called Tauri, and from whom the Taurica Cherſoneſus took its name, were, in the days of Tzetzes, better known by the name of Ros than of Tauri. Upon the whole, therefore, it may be very probably believed, that the Muſcovites and Ruſſians in Europe were colonies of Meſhech, or elſe of Meſhech and Tubal jointly." Treating on the ſituation of Gog, as north of Tubal, &amp;c. he ſays, "This ſituation is confirmed by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture itſelf, Ezek. xxxviii. 2. <hi>Set thy face againſt Gog. in, or of, the land of Magog, the prince of Roſh, Meſhech, and Tubal, &amp;c.</hi> For hence we learn, that the <hi>land of Magog</hi> muſt be near to that of Roſh, Meſhech, and Tubal; and it could be ſo only on the north. The learned Mr. Mede has obſerved, that the rame Gog ſignifies the very ſame with Magog, the letter <hi>mem</hi> being but an heeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick letter, i. e. not a radical, but an additional letter to the radix or primitive word. And he conceives that it pleaſed the Spirit of God to diſtinguiſh thus between the land and the people of the land, by calling the people Gog, and the land the Land of Magog."</p>
               <p>Thus the Ruſſians and Muſcovites themſelves appear to be included in the enumeration of Ezekiel, and we may obſerve that they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready extended their conqueſts into the neighbourhood of the Black and Caſpian Seas, and of thoſe parts originally ſettled by Gog and their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor Tubal. The probability is, that they will extend their conqueſts ſtill farther, and be diſtinguiſhed inſtruments in the overthrow of the Turkiſh Empire. And having effected this, it is likely that, with the aſſiſtance of their newly acquired ſubjects or allies from the Caſpian to the Propontus, with the Perſians, &amp;c. (the people enumerated by Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel), they will be the invading multitude marked out by the Spirit of Prophecy.</p>
               <p>There is another <hi>ſign of the times</hi> alſo, which ought not to be entirely omitted. More than two thonſand five hundred years ago, the ten tribes of Iſrael were carried captive into Aſſyria. About a hundred and fifteen years after this Judah, and Benjamin alſo were carried away to Babylon. Theſe returned, and ſome few of the other tribes with them; but as a nation, Iſrael was never reſtored. According to Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The prophets abound with promiſes, not only reſpecting the reſtoration of Judah, (the Jews), but of Iſrael alſo. From theſe tribes not having been heard of for ſo many ages, and the improbability of ſuch a people eſcaping the notice of all travellers, the generality have been induced to conclude that they no where exiſt, as a diſtinct people, but have long ago been melted down among other nations, except thoſe that united themſelves with Judah and Benjamin, at their return from Babylon. That they ſhould ſtill exiſt, is certainly a very extraordinary circumſtance; and ſhould Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence bring them forward by and by, to act a conſpicuous part in the great ſcene which is now opening, it will doubtleſs excite great aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment: but both the event and the ſurpriſe were foreſeen and predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the prophets. They foreſaw that the re-union of Ephraim with Judah would not take place till after the great diſperſion, and their
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030090_0084_0FE475EF49646758"/>reſurrection from the long political death which they were to ſuffer for their ſins. Then are Ephraim and Judah to be one people again, (Ezek. xxxvii. 16.—22.) And Judah ſhall ſay, "Who hath brought up theſe? Behold I was leſt alone, theſe, where have they been?" (Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Independent of the prophecies, there is reaſon to conclude that this people do ſtill exiſt diſtinct from other nations. The grounds for this concluſion may be ſeen in the Aſiatic Reſearches, vol. 2. That the reader may judge for himſelf, I ſhall take the liberty of quoting the extract which we find in the <hi>Monthly Review enlarged,</hi> vol. 10. p. 502. The account is whimſical enough; but conſidering the number of ages ſince the carrying away Iſrael captive, their corrupt ſlate at that time, their miſerable condition ſince, their ignorance of printing, &amp;c. it affords as much proof as can be expected, at the firſt dawn of their exiſtence. When we are better acquainted with them, their MSS. cuſtoms, &amp;c. we may expect more light.</p>

                           <p>"The Afghans call themſelves the poſterity of Melic Talut, or king Saul.—The deſcent of the Aſghans, according to their own tradition, is thus whimſically traced:</p>
                           <p>"In a war which raged between the children of Iſrael and the Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ekites, the latter being victorious, plundered the Jews, and obtained poſſeſſion of the ark of the covenant. Conſidering this the god of the Jews, they threw it into ſire, which did not effect it; they afterwards er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to cleave it with axes, but without ſucceſs: every individual who treated it with indignity, was puniſhed for his temerity. They then placed it in their temple, but all their idols bowed to it. At length they faſtened it upon a cow, which they turned looſe in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                           <p>"When the prophet Samuel aroſe, the children of Iſrael ſaid to him, "We have been totally ſubdued by the Amalekites, and have no king. Raiſe to us a king, that we may be enabled to contend for the glory of God." Samuel ſaid, "In caſe you are led out to battle, are you deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſight?" They anſwered, "What has befallen us that we ſhould not fight againſt infidels? That nation has baniſhed us from our country and children." At this time the angel Gabriel deſcended, and delivering a wand, ſaid, "It is the command of God, that the perſon whoſe ſtature ſhall correſpond with this wand, ſhall be king of Iſrael."</p>
                           <p>'Melic Talut was at that time a man of inferior condition, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the humble employment of feeding the goats and cows of others. One day a cow under his charge was accidentally loſt. Being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his ſearches, he was greatly diſtreſſed, and applied to Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, ſaying, "I have loſt a cow, and do not poſſeſs the means of ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the owner. Pray for me, that I may be executed from this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty." Samuel perceiving that he was a man of lofty ſtature, aſked his name. He anſwered, Talut. Samuel then ſaid: "Meaſure Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut with the wand which the angel Gabriel brought." His ſtature was equal to it. Samuel then ſaid "God has raiſed Talut to be your king." The children of Iſreal anſwered, "We are greater than our king. We are men of dignity, and he is of inferior condition. How ſhall he be our king?" Samuel informed them, they ſhould know that

                           <p>'After Talut obtained the kingdom, he ſeized part of the territories of Jalut, or Goliath, who aſſembled a large army, but was killed by David. Talut afterwards died a martyr in a war againſt the infidels; and God conſtituted David king of the Jews.</p>
                           <p>'Melic Talut had two ſons, one called Berkia, and the other Irmia, who ſerved David and were beloved by him. He ſent them to ſight againſt the infidels; and by God's aſſiſtance they were victorious.</p>
                           <p>'The ſon of Berkia was called Afghan, and the ſon of Irmia was named Uſbec. Theſe youths diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the reign of David, and were employed by Solomon. Afghan was diſtinguiſhed by his corporeal ſtrength, which ſtruck terror into demons and genii. Uſbec was eminent for his leraning.</p>
                           <p>'Afghan uſed frequently to make excurſions to the mountains; where his progency, after his death, eſtabliſhed themſelves, lived in a ſtate of independence, built forts, and exterminated the infidels.'</p>
                           <p>"To this account we ſhall ſubjoin a remark of the late Henry Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſittart, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> He obſerves, that 'A very particular account of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghans has been written by the late Ha Fiz Rahmat Khan, a chief of: e Rohillas, from which the curious reader may derive much informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are Muſſalmen, partly of the Sunni, and partly of the Shiah perſuaſion. They are great boaſters of the antiquity of their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and reputation of their tribe; but other Muſſalmen entirely reject their claim, and conſider them of modern and even baſe extraction. However their character may be collected from hiſtory. They have diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their courage, both ſingly and unitedly, principals and auxiliaries. They have conquered for their own princes and for foreigners, and have always been conſidered the main ſtrength of the army in which they have ſerved. As they have been applauded for virtues, they have alſo been reproached for vices, having ſometimes been guilty of treachery, and even acted the baſe part of aſſaſſins."</p>

               <p>A ſpecimen of their language (the Puſhto) is added; and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing note is inſerted by the Preſident.</p>
               <p>'This account of the Afghans may lead to a very intereſting diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.—We learn from Eſdras, that the ten tribes, after a wandering journey, came to a country called Arſareth, where we may ſuppoſe they ſettled. Now the Afghans are ſaid by the beſt Perſian hiſtorians to be deſcended from the Jews; they have traditions among themſelves of ſuch a deſcent; and it is even aſſerted, that their families are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the names of Jewiſh tribes, although, ſince their converſion to the Iſlam, they ſtudiouſly conceal their origin. The Puſhto language, of which I have ſeen a dictionary, has a manifeſt reſemblance to the Chaldaic; and a conſiderable diſtrict under their dominion is called Hazarch, or Hazaret, which might eaſily have been changed into the word uſed by Eſdias. I ſtrongly recommend an inquiry into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature and hiſtory of the Afghans.</p>
               <p>That after the ſpace of more than 2500 years the ten tribes of Iſrael ſhould be firſt reſtored to notice juſt at this period, when ſo many ſigns indicate the approach of their reſtoration, may be deſigned as a hint to us to be ready for what is coming. Let the triſling think what they may, I am ſure that the diligent ſtudent in the writings of the prophet will be far from eſteeming this ſingular circumſtance unworthy of atten

               <p>Among other ſigns of the ſpeedy gathering and reſtoration of Iſrael, this is not the leaſt, that we are threatened with troubles ſuch as have not been ſince there was a nation. Never did ſuch animoſity prevail in any war as has manifeſted itſelf in this. And if we conſider the ſlaughter of human beings in this one campaign, beſide the wretchedneſs to which thouſands of unhappy fugitives, who had long been uſed to all the accommodations and elegancies of life, have been reduced, the proſpect is melancholy indeed, and ſeems to beſpeak ſome viſitation more than com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I acknowledge that my apprehenſions reſpecting our proſpects are not ſo much from the opinion I may entertain of the wiſdom or folly, the juſtice or injuſtice, the piety or impiety, of the preſent war, in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached view, as from the impreſſion which the general appearance of things, compared with the writings of the prophets, produce on my mind; for, did I believe the preſent war (according to the general rule of eſtimating things to be beyond all doubt, both politic and juſt, even this would not much leſſen my apprehenſion of danger. When we look back on ancient hiſtory, and trace the progreſs and fall of thoſe empires and ſtates which Inſpiration has noticed, we ſhall find that the long threatened judgments which fell upon them were not for the blame of thoſe particular wars in which they periſhed, but for the accumulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed guilt of ſucceſſive ages, and for the general corruption of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Thoſe wars might be perfectly juſt, becauſe defenſive. If we examine the predictions of the prophets which refer to the chaſtiſement of the nations and the deſtruction of Babylon the Great, in the latter days, we ſhall find that thoſe dreadful j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ments which are then to be inflicted, are to be for the ſins of centuries—for blood which has never been avenged. The ſovereigns and rulers of that day may, perhaps, be among the moſt mild and juſt that have ever exerciſed power; but we muſt be ſtrangers to the hiſtory of nations, if we do not know that this will be no certain ſecurity. To inſtance only the caſe of Iſrael: Hoſhea was the beſt prince that ever reigned over that people:—the only one that had any mixture of good; yet, in his days their ruin came. If the great body of the nation be corrupt; if we approve the deeds of our fathers, and our iniquity be full; it is not the piety, or virtue, or juſtice, of our princes and rulers that can ſecure us.</p>
               <p>But though this is the caſe, yet our obligations and our intereſt, as they reſpect both the policy and the morality of the war, remain the ſame. And if it be found that we are acting contrary to the principles both of policy and the eternal obligations of morality, we are certainly precipitating our fate, and aggravating our ruin. It becomes us then, with great ſeriouſneſs, to conſider our ways: for it is not what the French are that aſcertains the ſafety or danger of our ſituation: they may be all that they are repreſented to be, and yet our caſe be never the better: the worſe they are, the more ſit are they, in ſome reſpects, to be the inſtruments of God's threatened judgments.</p>
               <p>The wiſdom or folly, the policy, or impolicy, of the preſent war, certainly deſerves the moſt ſerious conſideration of all who deſire the proſperity of their country; but as ſo many have writen ſo ably on theſe ſubjects, it ſeems the leſs neceſſary for me to detain the reader for the inveſtigation of them. But there are two or three things which, though they may not ſo generally ſtrike the attention, at leaſt not ſo as to produce any conſiderable apprehenſion of danger, yet, if it be clear that they are connected with this war, there is ſo much moral turpitude in them, that, to thoſe who believe in the all-ſuperintending providence of the Creator, and the Divine inſpiration of the Scriptures, they muſt appear of a magnitude ſufficient to excite the extremeſt ſolicitude, and the moſt ſincere concern.</p>

Be our opinion what it may of the utility or miſchief of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious eſtabliſhments among Proteſtants, yet, is not this preferable to the ſuperſtitions and horrors of Popery? And if God in his providence ſees fit, by theſe methods, to overthrow the abominations of Rome, and thus to clear the way for undefiled religion, ſhall we be angry with his diſpenſations, or diſpute his wiſdom?

If neceſſity oblige us to maintain war, yet let us beware of harbouring in our boſoms the murderous and unchriſtian paſſions of rancour and ma levolence. If we a attacked, we have a right to defend ourſelves; and benevolence is to be exerciſed even towards enemies; and if they hunger, what are we to do? We know what the malignant ſpirit of party and worldly policy will ſay—"Starve them."—But Chriſt ſays, "feed them." If we muſt maintain war, and juſtice ſanctify it, yet let it be on thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of benevolence and magnanimity worthy of a great and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened nation, and then there might be ſome plauſible ground to hope for the favour of providence.

They bring to juſtice their oppreſſors; they diſarm them of their power, ſtrip them of their diſguiſe, overturn their old oppreſſive ſyſtems, and form ſuch new ones as they think moſt likely to inſure ſecurity and happineſs. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting all this mighty work, folly is mixed with wiſdom, and outrage miggles with juſtice. They ſolemnly declare as a nation, that they will reſpect the rights and independence of all other nations, but will vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their own.—In ſuch a ſtruggle for the general good, ſome muſt be ſuppoſed to ſuffer either real or imaginary, wrongs. Theſe plot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nation; they aſſemble in neighbouring ſtates; are encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; prepare for war, and invoke foreign aid.</p>
               <p>On Auguſt 15, 1790, the neighbouring princes and potentales held a meeting at Pilnitz; a concert of crowned heads is formed, and it is agreed to invite the other ſovereigns of Europe to join the league, and make the cauſe of the king, and of the other privileged orders of France, a common one. It is determined in the meanwhile to increaſe their armies, and prepare for the invaſion of France, the firſt favorable opportunity, that by the overthrow of the new conſtitution, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of the old deſpotiſm, and the former ſtate of things in the church, innovation may be ſmitten in the root, and in other countries, be prevented. Thus did foreign courts aſſume to themſelves dictatorial power over an independent people, and formed a concert, not only for the purpoſe of overturning the liberties of France, but as if the world were made for princes, nobles, and prieſts only, to intimidate all other nations from daring, in future, to attempt to meliorate their condition. —They have ſent forth the moſt deſpotic and bloody manifeſtos that ever diſgraced Europe. That of the Duke of Brunſwick is expreſſed in a ſtyle of ſuch undiſguiſed barbarity, that even Attila, who boaſted of himſelf as the <hi>ſcourge of God, and the terror of men,</hi> would have bluſhed to have been the author of it.—They have invaded France; and the French in return have invaded them. Enormous crimes have been committed on both ſides; but we have not yet ſeen the end.</p>
               <p>"But the concerns of the French are ſo interwoven with the concerns and intereſts of other nations; that theſe have felt themſelves injured, and their language has been ſuch as to alarm and provoke their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and we alſo have been offended." This may be true. But have we acted according to thoſe excellent principles laid down by Jeſus Chriſt, Matt. xvii. and Luke xvii. for the putting an end to ſtrife, and for the prevention of bloodſhed? Have we remonſtrated and done all that negociation could do to prevent the horrors of war; or, has the flaming ſword of deſtruction preceded the olive branch of peace, and vengeance gone before remonſtrance? Have we acted from ſober judgment and urgent neceſſity, or from the dictates of ambition, and the workings of paſſion? Our innocence or guilt, reſpecting the blood which is ſhed, and the ſorrow which is occaſioned, will depend much on the anſwer which facts give to theſe inquiries.

<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030090_0090_0FE475FFCE272370"/>heart of Europe would operate as a dangerous example, it is unjuſt. If it be on account of ſome of their fooliſh or unjuſt decrees, yet, if we have not endeavoured by negociation to prevent the ſpilling of human blood, and the accumulation of taxes, it is unjuſt; and if, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, we have ſpurned at conceſſion, as though reſolved on war at any rate, the injuſtice is increaſed. If alſo it be a war to revenge the execution of the king, or for their humbling the nobility, or deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiling the prieſthood, it is unjuſt; for who appointed us the univerſal judges and arbiters of nations?</p>
               <p>"But it was neceſſary to the prevention of a revolution, and of anarchy in this country." So ſay a certain deſcription of men. But this is not proved, not does it appear that it can be. Perhaps it would be more conformable to their true ſentiments to ſay, "We thought it neceſſary for the prevention of reformation."</p>
               <p>Let us then examine with diſpaſſionate ſeriouſneſs the principles of the war in which we are engaged, that if it be unjuſt, we may repent, and do what we legally can to waſh our hands from the ſtain of innocent blood. Men under deſpotic government may, perhaps, be ſilent and innocent; but Engliſhmen are allowed to ſpeak. Under a free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſilence is guilt. The nation called for the war; if, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thought, they find themſelves deceived, or apprehend not only its impolicy, but its injuſtice, they are bound to ſignify it, or innocent blood (that of our own people, at leaſt, ſuppoſing the blood of Fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Let us farther examine whether we are acting worthy of our character as Proteſtants and Chriſtians, who are enlightened into the true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the religion of Chriſt.

               <p>Our religion teaches us, and our fathers, the reformers, were zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in impreſſing its dictates, that Rome is the whore of Babylon, the mother of harlots, and no true church of Chriſt; that Popery is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and idolatry; a religion at once at war againſt the kingdom of Chriſt and the happineſs of mankind; a religion tyrannical, blaſphemous and diabolical, in principle, and bloody in practice. Our religion teaches us, that this ſame ſyſtem of corruption and oppreſſion, which impregnates all the governments which receives it, and all the religious eſtabliſhments which grow out of it, with its own enſlaving and corrupt principles, ſhall be brought to an end, worthy of its enormities; it has determined and delineated the ſigns for the accompliſhment, and charged us to watch their appearance and to have no alliance with them other
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030090_0091_0FE47606A1CB13C8"/>of harlots, that we partake not of her ſins, and receive not of her plagues. If the ſigns of the times indicate the approach of the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed judgments, our part is to ſtand at a diſtance and contemplate the progreſs of the awful ruin, and not ruſh into the conflict, to ſlop the uplifted arm of God's vengeance; then might be fulfilled in our favour that ſaying, (Pſal. xci. 7, 8.) "A thouſand ſhall fall at thy ſide, and ten thouſand at thy right hand, but it ſhall not come nigh thee; only with thine eyes ſhalt thou behold and ſee the reward of the wicked." But, if we join iſſue with the declared ſupporters of the whore of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and unite with them to arreſt the vengeance of Heaven, what fate have we to expect, but to ſhare in their ruin? a ruin as dreadful as it will be extenſive!</p>
               <p>Thus, my countrymen, I have endeavoured to ſet before you, in the beſt manner I am able, the ſigns of the times, and what they por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. I have endeavoured to rouſe your attention to the conſideration of your ways, and your true intereſt, that you may take ſuch meaſures as may be the moſt likely to ſecure us from the deſolations of that ſtorm which already ſhakes the greater part of Europe—a ſtorm, if our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are juſt, which will ſpeedily lay in ruins all the nations which ſhall be found oppoſing the deſigns of God in the overthrow of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian ſyſtem, ſecular and eccleſiaſtical, which has ſo long cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and deſtroyed the earth.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Let us therefore watch and repent. Reformations in governments, if attainable at any tolerable price, are very de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rable; but we deceive ourſelves, if we imagine that this will be ſufficient to enſure the general peace and happineſs of ſociety. Unleſs the great maſs of mankind are reformed and chriſtianized, every thing elſe will be inſufficient. Whilſt pride, ambition and corruption predominate; whilſt meanneſs and ſervelity on the one hand, and refratiorineſs and contempt of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on the other, prevail; whilſt the moral ſenſe of the generality of mankind is corrupt; or, as our Lord expreſſes it, whilſt <hi>the light which is in them is darkneſs,</hi> and irreligion and vice triumph, it is in vain to expect any great good. I own I am extremely deſirous of ſeeing a peace able reformation take place in the repreſentation, and in the adminuſtration of the affairs of this country, as that which might contribute much to the bettering mankind, and which alone promiſes any hope of eſcaping the calamities of a revolution, or of alleviating the other diſtreſſes which threaten us. But, if this ſhould be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and nothing but this, I confeſs my expectations are not very ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine as to the great and permanent good which would follow. As a corrupt government diffuſes its corruptions through the whole maſs of ſociety, to, ſhould a few wiſe and virtuous men effect a pure govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet, if the body of the nation remained uninformed, they would ſoon corrupt the beſt inſtitutions, and the adminiſtration of the beſt government that the human intellect could deviſe, and nothing could ſtill ſave us from the diſpleaſure of God. Let both theſe reformations,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:030090_0092_0FE47609471B4278"/>therefore, go hand in hand, and let them ſpeedily be commenced; For nothing ſhort of inſtant reformation, and an inſtant change of meaſures, can afford us any ſolid hope of ſalvation. Did God ſay, reſpecting the profligate Jews, when the whole body politic was diſeaſed from the head to the foot, "Shall not my ſoul be avenged on ſuch a nation as this?" What have the nations under the Chriſtian diſpenſation, to expect, if, like them, they become univerſally diſeaſed? Let us therefore examine ourſelves and repent.</p>
               <p>What, in a general view, is our moral character as a nation? Has our virtue, our moderation, our juſtice, our love of civil and religious liberty, and our attachment to the principles of Proteſtaniſm, kept pace with our advancement in the ſcale of nations? We are called by the name of Chriſt, and profeſs to be a religious people; but, do we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplify in our practice what we profeſs? Do we do juſtly, love mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and walk humbly with God; or, does infidelity and profaneneſs, bribery and corruption, lewdneſs and debauchery, pride and diſſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pervade all ranks of men, and threaten an univerſal diſſolution? Are the rights of conſcience revered; or, is our fondneſs for the wine of the whore of Babylon returning, and are we to judge of the temper of the nation, from the flames which bigotry kindled at Birmingham in ninety-one? We are a nation of profeſſed Chriſtians. The paſtors which we approve, whether of the eſtabliſhed Church or otherwiſe, are they the meek and humble imitators of Him whoſe ſervants they are called? Do the generality of them ſeek, not filthy lucre, but the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſouls of men? Are they faithful, to reprove and warn; or, do they preach to us ſmooth things, and ſay, Peace, peace, when there is no peace? Are they diligent in the diſcharge of their duties—labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inſtruct the ignorant, to reclaim the vicious, to comfort the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and to unite men in the bonds of charity; or, are they proud and worldly; diligent only after gain; idle ſhepherds, who care not for the ſtock, and who ſow among mankind the ſeeds of contention? Do they recommend and enforce the religion which they profeſs by the holineſs and purity, benevolence and piety of their lives; or, are they lovers of pleaſure, eating and drinking with the drunken, <hi>whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe god is their belly, and whoſe glory is in their ſhame; who mind earthly things?</hi> (Phil. iii. 19.) Are the great body of the people content to have it thus, and moved only by what affects their worldly intereſt? Should this, on examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be found to be the caſe, it ſurely calls for deep humiliation, and ſuggeſts that, without a repentance and reformation, as general as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, ſome heavy calamity muſt burſt upon us.</p>
               <p>I am well aware that there are many who will turn my ſentiments into ridicule, and that more ſtill will make light of them; for it is in all our hearts to ſay, "All things continue as they were from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the creation; the evil will not come in our days. Does the angel ſwear by him that liveth for ever and ever, that delay ſhall be no longer?" "Prepare to meet your God." Ye corrupters of the holy and benevolent religion of Jeſus, and ye oppreſſors of mankind; ye proud biaſphemers, and ye perſecutors of the ſervants of God, prepare for the day of reckoning; for behold, "The whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind; it ſhall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. The fierce anger of the Lord ſhall not return until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart. In the latter day ye ſhall conſider it." (Jer. xxv. 23,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030090_0093_0FE4760AE8963A70"/>24.) Ye who worſhip the mammon of unrighteouſneſs, and ſacrifice nations for gain; who have carried deſolation to the utmoſt bounds of the earth, and, having enſlaved mankind with filthy lucre, are inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious to invent apologies for your enormous crimes; <hi>Prepare to meet your God.</hi> "Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which ſhall come upon you.—Behold, the hire of your labourers; which is of you kept back, crieth againſt you."

Sleep on, and take your reſt—But at midnight ye ſhall hear a great cry made—"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him." Ye hireling ſhepherds, eſpecially, who have converted the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt into a ſyſtem of worldly traffic; who live in pleaſure, and, having fed yourſelves with the fat, and clothed you with the wool, abuſe, inſtead of feeding, the ſlock; prepare to meet your God; for the time of his judgments ſhall be no longer delayed, but they who have beaten their fellow-ſervants, and ate and drank with the drunken, he will cut them aſunder, and appoint them their portion with the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</p>
