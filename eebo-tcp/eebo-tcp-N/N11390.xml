            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Lord Chatham's Speech On the following Motion made by his Lordſhip, viz.
<q>"That an humble Addreſs be preſented to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, moſt humbly to adviſe and beſeech him that, in order to open a Way towards an happy Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the dangerous troubles in America by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to allay ferments, and ſoften animoſities there; and above all, for preventing, in the mean time, any ſudden and fatal cataſtrophe at Boſton, now ſuffering under the daily irritation of an army before their eyes, and poſted in their town: It may graciouſly pleaſe his Majeſty, that immediate orders be deſpatched to General Gage for removing his Majeſty's forces from the town of Boſton, as ſoon as the rigour of the ſeaſon, and other circumſtances indiſpenſable to the ſafety and accommodation of the ſaid troops, may render the ſame practicable."</q>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I RISE with vaſt aſtoniſhment to ſee theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers<note n="*" place="bottom">The whole of the American papers juſt then delivered in at the table by Lord Dartmouth, at the command of his Majeſty.</note> brought to your table in ſo late a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of this buſineſs; papers, I am ſure, the contents of which are already known, not only to every noble Lord in this Houſe, but almoſt to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon in this kingdom, who has made American affairs in the leaſt an object of inquiry; yet now, in the very tail of this buſineſs, when meaſures ſhould be long ſince determined on, we are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014406_0004_0F92650E8370E3D0"/>
with an empty parade of parchments—to tell us what? Why, what all the world knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore —that the Americans, ſore under injuries, and irritated by wrongs, ſtript of their inborn Rights and deareſt Privileges, have reſiſted, and entered into aſſociations for the preſervation of <hi>that bleſſing</hi> to which life and property are but ſecondary conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to aſk you, my Lords, how theſe aſſociations have been formed? Has the tide of corruption yet flowed in upon their elections? Have thoſe delegates been ſuborned? Or have great intereſt, great power, or great threats been uſed (as is too much the caſe in this our boaſted mother country) to crayon out what conduct they ſhould adopt? No—nothing like this has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the electors ſeem to be prompted by no other motive than that glorious, and exalted one, <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of their common Liberties</hi>; and under this idea they have been induced to appoint men competent to ſo great an undertaking; men of tried and ſound principles, embarked in the ſame great cauſe, and, from ſimilar ſentiments, taught to pity the miſeries of the whole.</p>
            <p>Inveſted then with this right (the choice of a free people) theſe delegates have deliberated with prudence, wiſdom, and ſpirit; and, in conſequence of theſe deliberations, have addreſſed the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and honor of this country. This is their fault; this is their crime; petitioning for that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which a free people cannot poſſibly exiſt;— yet, for aſking this boon, this unalienable privilege of Engliſhmen, are they reprobated, and ſtigmatiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the epithets of ingrates—traitors—and rebels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:014406_0005_0F92650F31EFA160"/>Had the early ſituation of the people of Boſton been attended to, my Lords, it would not have come to this—but the infant complaints of Boſton were literally treated like the capricious ſqualls of a child, who, it was ſaid, did not know whether it was aggrieved, or not.—But full well, my Lords, I knew, at that time, that this child, if not redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, would ſoon aſſume the courage, and voice of a man. The Boſtonians did not then complain upon ſlight, or temporary evil; but on an evil which ſapped the very vitals of their conſtitution, and reduced all the great bleſſings of life to chance, equivocation, and inſecurity. Full well I knew that the ſons of anceſtors, born under the ſame free conſtitution, and once breathing the ſame liberal air as Engliſhmen—anceſtors, who even quitted this land of Liberty, the moment it became the land of Oppreſſion, and, in reſiſtance to bigotted councils, and oppreſſive meaſures, tore themſelves from their deareſt connexions; I ſay, my Lords, full well I knew that the offspring of ſuch anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors would reſiſt upon the ſame principles, and on the ſame occaſions.</p>
            <p>It has, however, gone abroad, that the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and petitions, of the Congreſs are not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reſolutions and petitions of the ſober, reſpectable, and diſpaſſionate; but the very dregs and refuſe of the people; and to circulate this report the better, letters are handed about from ſome very reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table merchants (as they are called) from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent provinces. But well I know how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſuch merchants—little paltry, peddling fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, venders of twopenny wares, and falſhoods, who under the idea of trade, ſell every thing in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014406_0006_0F926512E704B948"/>
their power—Honor, Truſt, and Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Theſe fellows (for ſuch is the lot of humanity) are ever to be found in all countries—and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in great plenty when their country is at ſtake, who, without ever regarding conſequences, and that general ruin might enſue, preſs forward to the goal of lucre, and cut out the ſhorteſt paſſage to their own intereſts.</p>
            <p>Yet theſe are the men, who are held out to us to take a true ſtate of the country from; Men who act, upon the moſt illiberal principles, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the world; who have no fixed reſidence —no laſting attachments, but to the ſhrine of Mammon. But it is not ſuch that ever ſpeak the voice of a people—it is the proprietors, and tillers of the ground—men who have a permanent—na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right in the place—and who from being nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the boſom of cultivation, form ſtrong and honorable attachments to their country;—it is to theſe, credit and authority are to be given, and from theſe our beſt informations are to be drawn.</p>
            <p>Much, my Lords, has been ſaid about the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament in theſe caſes, and when men are driven for want of argument, they fly to this as their laſt reſource—"Acts of Parliament (ſay their advocate) are ſacred, and ſhould be impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly ſubmitted to; for if the ſupreme power does not lodge ſomewhere operatively and effectually, there muſt be an end of all legiſlation." But my Lord, they who argue, or rather dogmatize in this manner, do not ſee the whole of this queſtion on great, wiſe, and liberal grounds; for in all tree ſtates the conſtitution is fixed, and all legiſlative power and authority, wherever placed, either in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014406_0007_0F926514F04A07B0"/>
collective bodies or individually, muſt derive under that conſtitution who framed them.—Acts of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation, therefore, however ſtrong and effective they may be, when they are framed in the ſpirit of this conſtitution, yet when they reſiſt, they attack their own foundation; for it is the conſtitution, and it alone, that limits both ſovereignty and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance.</p>
            <p>This doctrine, my Lords, is no temporary doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, taken up on particular occaſions to anſwer particular purpoſes, it is involved in no metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal doubts and intricacies—but clear, preciſe, and determined. It is recorded in all our law books, it is written in the great volume of nature—it is the eſſential, unalterable right of Engliſhmen—it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords with all the principles of juſtice and civil po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, which neither armed force on the one ſide, nor ſubmiſſion on the other, can upon any occaſion whatever eradicate.</p>
            <p>It was this doctrine that was the great guide and ſpirit to the framers of the bill of rights, at the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of the glorious revolution—men of the greateſt accuracy, wiſdom, and honeſty; and, without any diſparagement to the preſent day, few ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors are now to be ſeen. Recollect, my Lords, for a moment, the arguments uſed by theſe men— and ſee how wiſe, liberal, and conſtitutional they were; turn then to their opponents, and how flim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, thin, and unprovided they appear! if then we applaud our anceſtors for obtaining ſuch liberties for us, at a time when all the rights of Engliſhmen were trampled upon, and deſpotiſm had trodden down the laws, ſurely we cannot, in reaſon, deny that portion of liberty (ſo hardly and honorably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained)
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014406_0008_0F92651677F0A9D8"/>
to our own brethren—brethren by the ſame common parent, and who are unqueſtionable heirs of the ſame glorious inheritance.</p>
            <p>The facts being then, my Lords, as I have ſtated them, what has government done? they have ſent an armed force, conſiſting of above ſeventeen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, to dragoon the Boſtonians into what is called their duty, and for the chaſtiſement of a ſmall rabble, conſiſting of the neceſſitous and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterleſs in doing an unlawful act, have involved above thirty thouſand inhabitants in the greateſt difficulty, oppreſſion, and conſternation. Is this the way to win men to their duty, and recover in them the principles of affection and Britiſh allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? Do you think, that men who could be rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to forego their profits, their pleaſures, and the peaceable enjoyment of their deareſt connections —all for the ſake of liberty, will be whipped into vaſſalage like ſlaves? Why, my Lords, this conduct in government is ſo fantaſtical and aerial in practice, that it by far exceeds the boldeſt wing of poetry; for poetry has often read pleaſing, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive leſſons to mankind; and though it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times amuſes herſelf in fiction, that fiction, to pleaſe, ſhould be founded on veriſimilitude. But in this wiſe ſyſtem there is nothing like truth, nothing like policy, nothing like juſtice, experience, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe.</p>
            <p>But, my Lords, government, ſo far from once turning its eyes to the policy and deſtructive conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this ſcheme, are conſtantly ſending out more troops; and we are told, in the language of menace, that if ſeventeen thouſand men wont do, fifty thouſand ſhall. 'Tis true, my Lords, with this
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014406_0009_0F926516B3DFE458"/>
force they may ravage the country; waſte and deſtroy as they march; but in the progreſs of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen hundred miles, can they occupy the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they have paſſed? Will not a country, which can produce three millions of people, wronged and inſulted as they are, ſtart up like Hydras in every corner, and gather freſh ſtrength from freſh oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition? Nay, what dependance can you have upon the ſoldiery, the unhappy engines of your wrath? They are Engliſhmen; who muſt feel for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of Engliſhmen; and their carrying muſkets and bayonets about them, ſurely does not exclude them the pale of civil community. Do you think that theſe men, then, can turn their arms againſt their brethren?—Surely no—a victory muſt be to them a defeat—carnage—a ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>But, my Lords, it is not merely three millions of people, the produce of America, we have to combat with, in this unnatural ſtruggle; many more are on their ſide, diſperſed over the face of this wide em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Every Whig in this country is for them. Ireland is with them to a man; nay, even thoſe Engliſhmen, who may be now temporarily inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, when they once come to be rouzed to a ſenſe of recollection; when they come to weigh the great line of right, which their brethren in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica are contending for, the ſenſe of their own danger will inſtruct them to range themſelves on their ſide.</p>
            <p>Who then, in the name of Heaven! could adviſe this meaſure? or who can continue to give this ſtrange and unconſtitutional advice? I do not mean to level at one man, or any particular ſet of men; but thus much I will declare, that if his M—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014406_0010_0F92651774A1E850"/>
to hear ſuch counſellors, he will not only be badly adviſed, but undone. He may wear his C—n indeed, it is true, but it will not be worth his wearing: Robbed of ſo principal a jewel as Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, it will loſe its luſtre, and no longer beam that effulgence which ſhould irradiate the brow of M—y. What then is become of this boaſted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of England, once ſo renowned in arts, as well as arms? What is become of her conſtitution, that has hitherto been the wonder as well as the envy of ſurrounding nations! has ſhe changed her civil power, and ſalutary laws for a military code? Or has ſhe transferred her ſeat of empire to Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople?—Has ſhe, who has often ſhed her deareſt blood in the manly reſiſtance of deſpotiſm, now not only tamely ſubmitted to it, but ſat down herſelf to forge the arbitrary chains?</p>
            <p>But our preſent governors, alas! think ſo little of this matter, that I hear General Gage has been thought to have acted too tardy in this buſineſs— that he has not been ſwift enough to execute ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and ſheath the ſword in the bowels of his countrymen. I really pity the unfortunate ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that gentleman, who has approved himſelf on many occaſions a gallant ſoldier, and humane man; for what, from being under the diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble predicament of doing his duty on the one ſide, and his own feelings of juſtice and policy on the other, what a conflict muſt he have! his ſituation, my Lords, puts me in mind of a ſimilar tranſaction in the civil wars of France, when the great Conde on one ſide, and Marſhal Turenne on the other, commanded different armies; the latter conſcious what terrible conſequences a victory muſt produce

to himſelf and country, though often in his power, avoided blows as much as poſſible. After the affair was over, the Marſhal was thus reprimanded at court for not at leaſt taking the Prince; <hi>pourquoi ne l'avez vous pas pris?</hi> but that great General ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſibly replied, <hi>parceque, Sire, ſi je l'avois fait tout Paris en revanche m'auroit pris.</hi> "Should I take him, pleaſe your Majeſty, I was afraid all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris would take me."</p>
            <p>In this alarming criſis, this diſtracted view of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, I come, my Lords, with this paper in my hand (holding out his motion) to offer you the beſt of my experience and advice, which is "to beſeech his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty that he would be graciouſly pleaſed to give im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate orders to Gen. Gage to withdraw his troops from before the town of Boſton, in order to open the way for a plan of concord and reconciliation;" and this, my Lords, upon the moſt mature and deliberate grounds, is the beſt advice I can give you at this junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Such a conduct will convince America that you mean to try her cauſe in the ſpirit ot freedom &amp; inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not in letters of blood; it will be a pledge to her that you mean nothing more than friendſhip and equity, and ſhe, I truſt, will meet you half way. But how can ſhe truſt you with the bayonet at her breaſt? Nay, how does ſhe know, but after having ſubmitted to the ſword, you mean to forge for her heavier chains, the general conſequence of ferocious victory.</p>
            <p>I have crawled, my Lords, to this houſe to day, to tell you ſo—I think it my duty to give the whole of my experience, &amp; council to my country at all times, but more particularly, when ſhe is in ſo much need of it; and having thus entered on the threſhold of this buſineſs, I will knock at your gates of juſtice, and never ſtop, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept infirmities ſhall nail me to my bed, until I
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014406_0012_0F926518EAA7F7B8"/>
have, at leaſt, tried every thing in my power to heal thoſe unhappy diviſions.</p>
            <p>There is no time to be loſt—every hour is big with danger—perhaps even whilſt I am now ſpeaking, the deciſive blow is ſtruck, which may involve millions in the conſequence; and believe me, the very firſt drop of blood that is ſpilled, will not be a wound eaſily ſkinned over—it will be <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritabile v<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lnus</hi>; a wound of that rancorous and feſtering kind, that, in all probability, will mortify the whole body.</p>
            <p>Let us then, my Lords, inſtantly begin with this buſineſs, but let us not act, as hitherto has been acted—taking it up by bits and ſcrapes, as exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies preſſed, without any regard to general rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and dependencies. What ſignifies merely repealing this, or that particular act? This is but meanly ſneaking out of one difficulty perhaps to get into a worſe, and can never anſwer the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a wiſe, amicable, and conſtitutional ſyſtem. The more annihilation of a few, little, dirty ſhreds of parchment—can never produce any laſting ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on the happineſs, and commerce of three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of people, hitherto ground down with miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and wrongs, and in hourly dread of having them occaſionally rehearſed.</p>
            <p>We muſt look on this great buſineſs in one large connected view, work on it, ſtep by ſtep, with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and liberality, and never loſe ſight of it until it is accompliſhed;—this is the way, not only to obtain confidence for the preſent, but ſolid and laſting happineſs for the future: The line thus drawn, the Americans will have ſomething to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to—and we ſhall be taught not to tranſgreſs
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014406_0013_0F926519C80F1858"/>
that line.—Thus mutual confidence will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and mutual benefit muſt follow. I know that it has been in circulation, that if the <hi>ſtamp act</hi> had never been repealed, we ſhould be at this hour in peace and quietneſs with America; and from this many people urge the danger, as well as inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of conciliating meaſures at preſent. But though I could readily confute the falſhood, and abſurdity of this aſſertion, by appealing to the very official letters from your American Govenors at that period—I ſhall wave this ground, and only mention to your Lordſhips a circumſtance, which will ſet this matter in a full clearer light, and ſhow you the temper, firmneſs, and complexion of the Boſtonians on that occaſion.</p>
            <p>Sometime after the repeal of that act, I happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in company (at the houſe of a mutual friend above 100 miles from this town) with one of the moſt conſiderable, and intelligent merchants in this country; in a converſation I had with him upon this ſubject, I begged him to be as explicit as poſſible in giving me his opinion on the repeal. This gentleman then told me, and confirmed his account by ſeveral written and reſpectable eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the people of Boſton, previous to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, waited in fullen ſilence the deliberations of the Britiſh parliament, and were p<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, if that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> victory had not been obtained, immediately to abandon the town, their reſidence, and all the benefits of commerce; to the country they were determined to retire with their families and friends, more happy to be <hi>freemen</hi> though til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the earth, than <hi>ſlaves</hi> under the greateſt proſperity. Does this reſolution look like tamely
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014406_0014_0F92651A6BDF00B8"/>
ſubmitting to indignities? Or does it ſhew that it is owing to this <hi>juſt relaxation</hi> of government, that they have been taught to act with that firmneſs, and perſeverance, they have ſince that period pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued?</p>
            <p>I would not, however, wiſh, my Lords, by this to encourage America to proceed beyond the line of right—I reprobate as much as any of you thoſe acts of violence which a few of her mobility have committed; but when her inherent, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional rights are invaded, thoſe rights ſhe has an equitable claim to the full enjoyment of, by the fundamental laws of the Engliſh conſtitution, and ingrafted on that conſtitution by the unalterable laws of nature; then I own myſelf an American; and feeling myſelf as ſuch, ſhall, to the verge of my life, vindicate her Rights. If America, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhould, at any time loſe ſight of this Line, I ſhall be an Engliſhman, and defend thoſe Rights againſt any power, under Heaven, that would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them.—</p>
