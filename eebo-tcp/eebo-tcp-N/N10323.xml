            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>☞ The firſt BOOK of the American Chronicles of the Times. CHAP. I.</head>
            <p>AND behold! when the tidings came to the great city that is afar off, the city that is in the land of Britain, how the men of Boſton, even the Boſtonites, had aroſe, a great multitude, and deſtroyed the TEA, the abominable merchandize of the eaſt, and caſt it into the midſt of the ſea:</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Lord the King waxed exceeding wroth, inſomuch that the form of his viſage was changed, and his knees ſmote one againſt the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then he aſſembled together the Princes, the Nobles, the Counſellors, the Judges, and all the Rulers of the people, even the great Sanhedrim, and when he had told them what things were come to paſs,</p>
            <p n="4">4. They ſmote their breaſts and ſaid, Theſe men fear thee not, O King, neither have they obeyed the voice of our Lord the King, nor worſhipped the TEA CHEST, which thou haſt ſet up, whoſe length was three cubits, and the breadth thereof one cubit and an half.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Now therefore make a decree that their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours be blocked up, and ports ſhut, that their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants may be broke, and their multitudes periſh, that there may be no more the voice of merchandize heard in the land, that their ſhips that goeth upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, may be ſunk in the depths thereof, and their mariners dwindle away to nought, that their cods and
<pb facs="unknown:013105_0002_0F8EC53D05A35FE8"/>
their oil may ſtink, and the whale, the great Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, may be no more troubled, for that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt thee.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And it came to paſs that the king hearkened unto the voice of theſe ſons of Belial.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Then aroſe Mordecai, the Benjamite, who was four ſcore and five years old, an aged man whom the Lord loved, a wiſe man, a ſoothſayer, an aſtrologer, in whom was wiſdom from above, and he ſaid unto the King, I pray thee, O King, let thy ſervant ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And the King commanded that he ſhould ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Then Mordecai ſpake aloud, in the preſence of all the Princes, the Nobles, the Counſellors, the Judges, and the Rulers of the people, and ſaid, O King, live for ever.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Thy throne, O King, is encompaſſed about with lies, and thy ſervants, the Bernardites and the Hutchinſonians, are full of deceit, for be it known unto thee, O King, they hide the truth from thee, and wrongfully accuſe the men of Boſton, for behold, theſe letters in mine hand witneſſeth ſore againſt them; O King, if thou art wiſe, thou wilt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe things.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And there was preſent one of the King's Counſellors, a Jacobite, a vagabond, a Wedderbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and he uſed ſoul language, and ſaid unto Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai, Thou lieſt; and Mordecai anſwered and ſaid unto him, God will ſmite thee, thou whited wall, and Mordecai departed from amongſt them.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And behold the Princes, the Nobles, the Counſellors, the Judges, and all the Rulers of the people, cried out vehemently againſt Mordecai, for they were in fear becauſe of Mordecai's wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="13">13. And they beſought the King that he would take from Mordecai his poſt, for he was in high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour before that time.</p>
            <p n="14">14. So they prevailed on the King, and he took from Mordecai his poſt and all that he had, and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai was perſecured yet more and more, but he bore it patiently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Job was his grandfather's great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father; moreover, he knew the times muſt alter, and the King's eyes would be opened anon.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb facs="unknown:013105_0003_0F8EBA6EC68EB600"/>15. Now in the ſeventh month, in the fourteenth day of the month, the Lord the King commanded Thomas, the captain of the Gageites, ſaying,</p>
            <p n="16">16. Chooſe thou the valiant men of Britain, by hundreds and by thouſands, and get ye together the ſhips, even the ſhips of war, the terror of the nations round about, and make your way towards the coaſts of the Americanites, the land of the Boſtonians, that lieth on the other ſide of the ſea weſtwards, and cut off all that piſſeth againſt the wall, and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all their cities with fire and with ſword, for they have rebelled againſt me.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Howbeit, the men of Boſton had intelligence thereof, for they kept their ſpies abroad from the eaſt to the weſt, and from the north to the ſouth; and when the tidings came of theſe things, they rent their clothes, and faſted, put on ſackcloth, and went ſoftly.</p>
            <p n="18">18. And the Boſtonites, the men of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſpake unto Jedediah, the ſcribe, that he would bring the book of the law of their fathers, which the Lord had commanded they ſhould obey.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Then Jedediah, the prieſt, brought the book of the law before the congregation, both of men and women that could underſtand it.</p>
            <p n="20">20. And he read therein in the ſtreet that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Water-gate, and in the Market-place, and at the entry of the Fiſh-gate, and in the Old-South, from the morning until the mid-day, and from the mid-day until the evening.</p>
            <p n="21">21. For Jedediah the prieſt had underſtanding of the times to know what the Americanites ought to do, and what they ought not to do, and all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren were at his commandment.</p>
            <p n="22">22. And the ears of all the people hearkened unto the book of the law, and entered into a ſolemn league and covenant, that they would obey the book of the law, and none other, both the prieſts and the Levites.</p>
            <p n="23">23. And behold when Thomas, the Gageite, was come into the land of the Boſtonites, he threatned them ſore, and ſwore by the life of Pharaoh, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſome of the old women and children lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up their voices, and wept exceedingly with bitter lamentations.</p>
            <p n="24">
               <pb facs="unknown:013105_0004_0F8EC5410684A7C8"/>24. And it came to paſs that the New-Yorkites, the Philadelphites, the Marylandites, the Virginites, the Carolinites, took pity on their brethren the Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonites, for there was like to be a famine in the land.</p>
            <p n="25">25. And they got ready their camels and their aſſes, their mules and their oxen, and laded them with their meat, their fine wheaten flour, their rice, their corn, their beeves and their ſheep, and their figs and their raiſins, and their wine and their oil, and their tobacco abundantly, and ſix thouſand ſhekels of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and threeſcore talents of gold, and ſent them by the hands of the Levites, to their brethren, and there was joy in the land.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Now this ſame Thomas, a Heathen, put forth a mock proclamation for the encouragement of piety.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Then Jedediah the prieſt, and Obadiah, and Ezekiel, and Jonathan the ſon of Ebenezer, ſtood up and ſaid, Men and brethren (the Lord knoweth our hearts, and that we fear the Lord) ye have ſeen how this Heathen maketh a mock of holy things, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneth the GOD of our fathers, this man is like unto a Phariſee, he prayeth with his windows open, and a two edged ſword at our throats. Moreover, he defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the ſabbath, in that he traineth his men on the Lord's-day, and have ye not ſeen with your eyes how he ſtoppeth the way ſide, that the congregation may not paſs, and how that he putteth the yoke of cannon upon the neck of the Boſtonites, and the people mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled and ſaid, Fye upon thee, Thomas! fye upon thee, Thomas! The Lord will avenge himſelf of ſuch abominations.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Now be of good comfort, let us ſend meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into all the coaſts of our brethren the America<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, peradventure they will commune with us, for we be one people, and ſerve one God: If ſo be they hear us, the Lord is on our ſide; but if they refuſe to hearken unto us, they and we be then ſlaves to the Gageites, and our ſubſtance and all that we have, taken from us, and we be their hewers of wood and drawers of water.</p>
            <p n="29">29. And all the people ſhouted, and ſaid with one voice, Send and commune with our brethren.</p>
            <p n="30">
               <pb facs="unknown:013105_0005_0F8EC541E12532F0"/>30. Now it came to paſs that their brethren liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened unto them, and they ſent meſſengers backwards and forwards throughout the land, from the eaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the weſt, and from the north unto the ſouth, even unto the ſea coaſt of the Georgeites.</p>
            <p n="31">31. And they aſſembled themſelves together, in a Congreſs in the great city of Philadelphia, in the houſe of the Carpenters, the builders houſe, in the land of Pennſylvania, on the ſeventh day of the ninth month, with their coaches, their chariots, their camels, their horſemen and their ſervants, a great multitude, and they communed together.</p>
            <p n="32">32. And behold while they thus communed, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Torykites, falſe prophets, and friends to the Gageites, ſaid, Let us diſtract their counſels, and ſet at nought their Congreſs, we will cauſe a lying ſpirit to go throughout their land, that the great city of the Boſtonites is burned to the ground, and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof are ſlain by the edge of the ſword, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure they will return home to inquire after their wives, their little ones, and their ſheep and their oxen, and we be then rewarded by our Lord the King.</p>
            <p n="33">33. And the rumour thereof ſpread abroad thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the land, and meſſengers were ſent day by day.</p>
            <p n="34">34. And moreover, that Thomas the Gageite, the Captain of the Heathen, came by night and ſtole away their powder, and their implements of war, and to ſeize their brethren and ſend them away captives to Babel, to be tried by the Heathen laws, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure hanged for ſuppoſed tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p n="35">35. Then aroſe Jedediah the prieſt, and Amina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab, and Obadiah, and Jeremiah, and lifted up their voices, and ſpake aloud and ſaid,</p>
            <p n="36">36. Fathers, brethren, and the children of our fathers, ye have heard of all the evil that has been brought upon our city, the city of our forefathers, the New-Canaan, the land of Promiſe, and behold this day it is deſolate, and no man dwelleth therein.</p>
            <p n="37">37. How doth the city remain ſolitary that was full of people; ſhe is as a widow: She that was great amongſt the nations, and princeſs among the provinces, is about to be made tributary, and bow down to the TEA CHEST, the God of the
<pb facs="unknown:013105_0006_0F8EC543255991B8"/>
Heathen; tell it not in Gath, nor publiſh it in the ſtreets of Aſkalon.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Now therefore, if it ſeemeth good unto you, and that it proceedeth of the Lord our GOD, we will ſend to and fro unto our brethren that are in all the land of the Americanites (for with them are Prieſts and Levites in the cities and ſuburbs thereof) that they may aſſemble themſelves unto us.</p>
            <p n="39">39. And all the congregation anſwered and ſaid, Let us do ſo, for the thing ſeemeth good in the eyes of all the people, for ſurely they will not be like the Gibeonites of Old.</p>
            <p n="40">40. And they yet ſpake unto them and ſaid, Now, therefore, we pray ye ariſe! every man of you from ſixteen to ſixty get up, be ſtrong and valiant, gird thy ſword upon thy thigh, O thou moſt mighty, are ye not the men, and are ye not the ſons of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that ſubdued the Louiſburgites?</p>
            <p n="41">41. And the young men gave a great ſhout and ſaid, Yea, verily, we have heard with our ears, and our fathers have declared unto us, the noble deeds which they did in your days, and in the Old times before us.</p>
            <p n="42">42. And Jedediah the prieſt, and Aminadab, and Obadiah, yet ſpake once more to the people and ſaid, Moreover brethren, are ye not valiant men, and ſprang from the tribes of the Oliverians, be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, nor diſmayed, the Lord is on our ſide, we fight the battles of the Lord, let us drive the heathen out of our land, for they are but as graſhoppers unto us, and all the congregation gave a mighty ſhout and ſaid, lead us on; and Caleb and his brethren, ten men in number, were ſent as ſpies.</p>
            <p n="43">43.
