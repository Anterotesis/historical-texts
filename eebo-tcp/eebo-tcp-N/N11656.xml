            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>AS, by the tyranny of GEORGE the Third, the compact of allegiance and protection between him and the good people of this Colony is totally diſſolved, and the whole power of government is by that means returned to the people at large; it is become abſolutely neceſſary to have this power collected and again repoſed in ſuch hands as may be judged moſt likely to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it for the common good.</p>
            <p>IN moſt ſtates, men have been too careleſs in the delegation of their governmental power; and not only diſpoſed of it in a very improper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but ſuffered it to continue ſo long in the ſame hands, that the <hi>deputies</hi> have, like the King and Lords of Great-Britain, at length become <hi>poſſeſſors in their own right;</hi> and inſtead of <hi>public ſervants,</hi> are in fact the <hi>maſters</hi> of the public. Our new Republics ſhould uſe the utmoſt caution to avoid thoſe fatal errors; and be ſupremely careful in placing that dangerous power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolling the actions of individuals, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that it may not counteract the end for which it was eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT may be conſidered, a <hi>depoſite</hi> of the power of ſociety in certain hands, whoſe buſineſs it is to <hi>reſtrain,</hi> and in ſome caſes to take off ſuch members of the community as diſturb the quiet and deſtroy the ſecurity of the honeſt and peaceable ſubject. <hi>This government is founded in the nature of man, and is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> of civil ſociety;</hi> "yet ſuch is the thiſt of power
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014734_0003_0F94885440300CC8"/>in moſt men, that they will ſacrifice heaven and earth to wreſt it from its foundation; to eſtabliſh a power in themſelves to tyrannize over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and properties of others." To prevent this, let every article of the conſtitution or <hi>ſett of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental rules</hi> by which even the ſupreme power of the ſtate ſhall be governed, be formed by a convention of the delegates of the people, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that expreſs purpoſe: which conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall neither be added to, diminiſhed from, nor altered in any reſpect by any power beſides the power which firſt framed it. By this means an effectual bar will be oppoſed to thoſe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing ſpirits, who have told us with much aſſurance, that after the people had made their annual or ſeptennial <hi>offering,</hi> they had no more to do with government than their cattle.</p>
            <p>A CONVENTION being ſoon to ſit in PHILADELPHIA; I have thought it my duty to collect ſome ſentiments from a certain very ſcarce book, entitled an Hiſtorical Eſſay on the Engliſh Conſtitution, and publiſh them, with whatever improving obſervations our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent circumſtances may ſuggeſt, for the peruſal of the gentlemen concerned in the arduous taſk of framing a conſtitution.</p>
            <p>"THAT beautiful ſyſtem, formed, (as Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieu ſays,) in the German woods, was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into England about the year four hundred and fifty." The peculiar excellence of this ſyſtem conſiſted in its incorporating ſmall parcels of the people into little communities by themſelves. Theſe petty ſtates <hi>held parliaments often;</hi> for whatever concerned them in common, they met together and debated in com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>; and after
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014734_0004_0F94885514D2FE60"/>due conſideration of the matter, they called a vote, and decided the queſtion, by a majority of voices. In theſe councils every man had a voice, who had a reſidence of his own in the tithing, (or townſhip) and paid his tax and performed his ſhare of the public duties. This ſalutary inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, our honorable Conference of Committees has again revived at their late ſitting.</p>
            <p>To avoid the tumult, which always muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the hearing and determining civil and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal caſes, by a popular tribunal, they had their executive courts in every townſhip; and ſtill kept the legiſlative and executive departments ſeparate, in all caſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>AMONG theſe people we find the origin of the ineſtimable trial by juries; and I am much miſtaken if our preſent Juſtices of the Peace, may not alſo trace their derivation from the ſame ſalubrious ſource.
<note n="*" place="bottom">The ancient <hi>Conſervatores,</hi> were to all valuable purpoſes <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the Peace.</note> However that may be, one thing is certain, that "they founded their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment on the common rights of mankind. They made the elective power of the people the firſt principle of the conſtitution, and delegated that power to ſuch men as they could beſt confide in. But they were curiouſly cautious in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, knowing well the degenerating principles of mankind; that power makes a vaſt difference in the temper and behaviour of men, and often converts a good man in private life to a tyrant in office. For this reaſon they never gave up their natural liberty or delegated their power for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laws, to any man for a longer time than one year."</p>
            <p>"THE object upon which our elective power acts is remarkably different from that of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014734_0005_0F948855B7865B00"/>Theirs was directed to operate in the election of their chief officers, and particularly their conſuls; or thoſe who were veſted with the executive authority whom they changed annually. But the ſenate where the principal power in their ſtate was lodged, was a more fixed body of men; and not ſubject to the elective power of the people."</p>
            <p>"OUR Saxon forefathers almoſt reverſed this principle; for they made their wittenagemot or parliament, where the principal power was lodged, annually moveable and entirely ſubject to the elective power of the people; and gave a more fixed ſtate to the executive authority. This laſt they confined within a certain ſphere of action, preſcribed by law; ſo that it could not operate to the injury of any individual, either in his perſon or property; and was controllable in all acts of ſtate, by the elective power which they veſted annually in their wittenagemot, or parliament."</p>
            <p>"THE annual exerciſe of the elective power, was the quinteſſence, the life and ſoul of the conſtitution; and the baſis of the whole fabric of their government, from the internal police of the minuteſt part of the country, to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the government of the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. This Saxon inſtitution, formed a perfect model of government; where the natural rights of mankind were preſerved, in their full exerciſe, pure and perfect, as far as the nature of ſociety will admit of."</p>
            <p>"It would be ſomething very ſurprizing to find the people of England continually diſputing about the principles and powers, veſted in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent parts of their government; did we not
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014734_0006_0F948857DBCCED98"/>know that at this day it conſiſts of a mixture of the old, or firſt eſtabliſhment, and that which took place at (and ſince) what is commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the conqueſt, by William the Firſt. Theſe two forms of government, the firſt founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the principles of liberty, and the latter upon the principles of ſlavery, it is no wonder they are continually at war, one with the other. For the firſt is grounded upon the natural rights of mankind, in the conſtant annual exerciſe of their elective power, and the latter upon the deſpotic rule of one man. Hence our diſputants, drawing their arguments from two principles, widely different, muſt of courſe differ in their conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions."</p>
            <p>"OUR Saxon forefathers eſtabliſhed their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Britain, before the tranſactions of mankind were recorded in writing; at leaſt among the northern nations. They therefore handed down to poſterity, the principles of their government, by the actual exerciſe of their rights; which became the ancient uſage and cuſtom of the people, and the law of the land. And hence it came to paſs, that when this ancient cuſtom and uſage ceaſed to act, the remembrance of the cuſtom ceaſed with it. We may add to this, that, ſince the conqueſt, our arbitrary kings and men of arbitrary principles, have endeavored to deſtroy the few remaining records, and hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal facts that might keep in remembrance a form of government ſo kind, friendly and hoſpitable to the human ſpecies. It is for theſe reaſons that we have ſuch a ſcarcity of hiſtorical evidence, concerning the principles and manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the firſt eſtabliſhment of our mode of government in this kingdom."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:014734_0007_0F948857F7EF2720"/>
"HOWEVER, notwithſtanding theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there are many cuſtoms, forms, principles and doctrines, that have been handed down to us by tradition; which will ſerve as ſo many landmarks, to guide our ſteps to the foundation of this ancient ſtructure, which, is only buried under the rubbiſh collected by time, and new eſtabliſhments. <hi>Whatever is of Saxon eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is truly conſtitutional; but whatever is Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is beterogeneous to it, and partakes of a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical ſpirit."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"FROM theſe ſources it is, that I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to draw the outlines of this ancient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of government, eſtabliſhed in this kingdom by our Saxon forefathers; where it continued to grow and flouriſh, for ſix hundred years; 'till it was overwhelmed and deſtroyed by William the Firſt, commonly call'd the Conqueror, and lay buried under a load of tyranny for one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty ſeven years. When it aroſe again, like a phoenix from its own aſhes in the reign of Henry the Third, by the aſſiſtance of many concurrent cauſes; but principally by the bravery of the Engliſh people, under the conduct and intrepidity of our ancient and immortal barons, who reſtored it, in part, once more to this Iſle. And tho' much impaired, maimed, and disfigured, it has ſtood the admiration of many ages; and ſtill remains <hi>the moſt noble and ancient monument of Gothic antiquity."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was indeed reſtored in an impaired condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as a free conſtitution muſt neceſſarily be, when attempted to be introduced among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, diſtinguiſhed by the odious difference of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Lord and Vaſſal.</p>

               <hi>The firſt eſtabliſhment of our</hi> CONSTITUTION, <hi>by the</hi> SAXONS, <hi>to what is commonly called the</hi> NORMAN CONQUEST, <hi>under the</hi> HEPTARCHY.</p>
            <p>"THE firſt principle of a government that is founded on the natural rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is the principle of annual election. Liberty and election are in this caſe ſynonimous terms; <hi>for where there is no election there can be no liberty.</hi> And therefore the preſervation of this elective power, in its full extent, is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of liberty in its full extent: and where that is reſtrained in any degree, liberty is reſtrained in juſt the ſame proportion; and where that is deſtroyed by any power in a ſtate, whether mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or civil, liberty is alſo deſtroyed by that power, whether it be lodged in the hands of one man, one hundred or one thouſand."</p>
            <p>"IT is reported by hiſtorians that our Saxon forefathers had no kings in their own country, but lived in tribes or ſmall communities, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by laws of their own making, and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of their own electing; and further, that a number of theſe communities were united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their mutual defence and protection. But by what particular bond of union they were united, I know of no hiſtorian, that hath given us any information. There were ſeven tribes of Saxons, that arrived in Britain about the ſame
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014734_0009_0F948859D9A81998"/>time, under ſo many different leaders; but as they had all the ſame intentions ſo far as to eſtabliſh the ſame form of government, I ſhall conſider them in this reſpect indiſcriminately."</p>
            <p>"THEY firſt divided the land into ſmall parts, and that divided the inhabitants upon that land; and made them a diſtinct and ſeparate people from any other. This diviſion they called a tithing. Here they eſtabliſhed a government, which was, no doubt the ſame as that under which they lived in their Mother-Country. They had two ſorts of tithings, one called a town tithing, and the other called a rural tithing. Theſe were governed upon the ſame principles, only thus diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as one is expreſſive of a town having ſuch a number of inhabitants as to make a tithing of itſelf; and the other of a tithing ſituated in the rural part of the kingdom. Thus they went on, as they conquered the country, to divide the land, till they had cut out the whole kingdom into tithings, and eſtabliſhed the ſame form of government in each."</p>
            <p>"IN this manner they provided for the internal police of the whole country, which they veſted in the reſpective tithings, who annually elected the magiſtrates that were to adminiſter juſtice to them, agreeable to the laws and cuſtoms they had brought with them from their Mother-Country. And this internal police was ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in its nature, that it hath had the encomiums of moſt authors of our hiſtory."</p>
            <p>"THEY had a legiſlative authority in every tithing, which made laws and regulations for the good government of the tithing. Beſides
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014734_0010_0F94885A4A944850"/>theſe, they had a court of law, whoſe juriſdiction was confined to the ſame limits. All which were created by the elective power of the people, who were reſident inhabitants of the tithing; and the right of election, was placed in every man who paid his ſhot and bore his lot. From hence we may eaſily perceive, that, under the eſtabliſhment of theſe tithings, by reaſon of their ſmallneſs, the natural rights of mankind might very well be preſerved in their fulleſt extent; as they could delegate their power by election without any confuſion or inconvenience to the inhabitants."</p>
            <p>"THE firſt connexion the tithings had with one another, was to form an eſtabliſhment for the military defence of the country. For this end a number of theſe tithings were united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo far as related to their military con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. This union neceſſarily created a larger di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the land, equal to the number of tith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that were thus united; and this they called a wapentake or weapontake, and might take in as many tithings as would make a Brigade under a Brigadier General. Here likewiſe they eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a court of council and a court of law, which laſt was called a wapentake court. In the court of council the chief magiſtrates of every tithing aſſembled to elect officers of the militia to their reſpective command, and regulate all matters relating to the militia; in which, every individual tithing was concerned. The court of law was to enforce theſe regulations within the juriſdiction." "Let us now conſider the third and laſt diviſion, which they made of the land. This was compoſed of a certain number of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentakes,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014734_0011_0F94885C808A1790"/>united together; which they called a ſhire or one complete ſhare or part into which they divided the land. This diviſion completed their ſyſtem of internal police; by uniting all the tithings within the ſhire into one body, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſuch laws and regulations as ſhould be made in their ſhiregemots or ſhire parliaments; for the benefit and good government of the ſhire."</p>
            <p>"As this diviſion comprehended many tithings and many people, ſo it had the greateſt court of council in England except the high court of parliament; and the chief officer was veſted with as high juriſdiction in the ſhire, as the king in the kingdom."</p>
            <p>"THEY had likewiſe a court of law, called the ſhire court; to which. I make no doubt every man might appeal who thought himſelf injured by the inferior courts in the ſhire. Theſe diviſions in the land, are what I call the ſkeleton of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution which was animated and put in motion by all theſe eſtabliſhments."</p>
            <p>"WE may conſider each ſhire as a complete government; furniſhed with both a civil and a military power within its own juriſdiction."</p>
            <p>"LET us now ſee by what mode of union, theſe ſhires became united together into a kingdom: and it will be found. I apprehend, that they purſued the ſame principles, which they had uſed in every other eſtabliſhment. That is to ſay, wherever a combined intereſt was concerned and the people at large were affected by it, the immediate deputies of the people, met together to attend the reſpective intereſts of their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents, and a majority of voices always bound the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014734_0012_0F94885D31F28F60"/>whole, and determined for any meaſure, that was ſuppoſed to operate for the good of the whole combined body. This meeting of the deputies of the people, was called by the Saxons the wittenagemote, or aſſembly of the wiſe men of the nation; which compoſed their national coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and legiſlative authority."</p>

            <head>THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION, <hi>Under the</hi> MONARCHY.</head>
            <p>"I HAVE already remarked that a number of the Saxon tribes, while in their own country, were united together for their mutual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and defence. In like manner was our Heptarchy connected; and their mode of union became a part of the conſtitution, when the ſeven kingdoms united together under one king. The matter was ſimply this: one of the ſeven kings was always choſen generaliſſimo over the whole body; and they appointed him a ſtanding coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of a certain number of deputies, from each ſtate, without whoſe advice and concurrence, it is probable he could not act."</p>
            <p>"HOWEVER I do not mean to make any obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon the powers veſted in this ſtanding council; but only to point out that body of men as the origin of our houſe of lords. Thoſe deputies who compoſed this great ſtanding coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, were appointed to their truſt by the joint
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014734_0013_0F94885F43D5EF00"/>conſent of the king and parliament of the little kingdom from whence they were ſent. And when Alfred the great, united the ſeven kingdoms into one, he undoubtedly, with the approbation of the people, incorporated this great council as a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate branch of the wittenagemote or parliament; ſo that they ſtill continued to be the king's great council, and a branch of the legiſlative authority, which they are at this day. In confirmation of which, it is obſervable, that the conſent of the parliament continued neceſſary for creating a baron of the realm about as low down as Henry the Seventh; which is the only title by which any man can obtain his ſeat in our Houſe of Lords; and not as Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, &amp;c."</p>
            <p>"IT is needleſs to mention, that after the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſeven kingdoms under Alfred, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the members to ſerve in parliament became abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe it was then impracticable, by reaſon of their numbers, for the ſame members to attend, in one parliament, that uſed to attend in ſeven, without ſuch anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and confuſion as muſt counteract the end of their meeting."</p>
            <p>"NATURE herſelf has confined, or limited the number of men in all ſocieties, that meet together to inform and be informed, by argument and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, within the natural powers of hearing and ſpeech. So that the queſtion in this caſe muſt have been how to reduce the repreſentatives of the people in parliament, to be a convenient number, to tranſact the buſineſs of the nation; and at the ſame time, to preſerve the elective power of the people
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014734_0014_0F948861510C1AF0"/>unhurt? a queſtion of no ſmall difficulty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, conſidering the various intereſts that were affected by it." <hi>And how was this effected?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR hiſtorian informs us; "they excluded from this parliament, all the repreſentatives of the rural tithings, as being a body of men the moſt numerous of any, conſidered collectively, and yet elected by the feweſt people in proportion, which, muſt be very evident, ſince the rural part of the kingdom muſt be more thinly inhabited than the towns. Beſides the town tithings or boroughs, where a great number of inhabitants are collected together, upon a ſmall compaſs of ground, were undoubtedly, the moſt conveniently ſituated, for the commodious exerciſe of the elective power of the people. And the towns, being few in compariſon of the rural tithings, and at the ſame time diſperſed over the whole country, were beſt adapted to receive the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they intended to make in their plan of forming the conſtituent parts of the new parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
            <p>"THO' the barons of the realm being great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, carried into parliament the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the intereſt of the rural part of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; yet not being elective, they were not ſuch a body of men as the conſtitution, and the ſafety of the inhabitants of the rural tithings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. And therefore, they conſtituted ſhire elections, for two members, to repreſent the ſhire in parliament, and thoſe repreſentatives were the origin of our knights of the ſhire."</p>
            <p>"The barons of the realm, and the knights of the ſhires, I conſider as two bodies of men that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014734_0015_0F9488626ABD0A40"/>were ſubſtituted, at the eſtabliſhment of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, under Alfred the Great, in place of thoſe repreſentatives that uſed to ſerve under the Heptarchy for the rural tithings. The alteration that was made with reſpect to the towns and boroughs was ſimply this: that all boroughs that uſed to ſend one member to the little parliament, to which they belonged, under the Heptarchy, ſhould for the future ſend two to the great parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England."</p>
            <p>FROM the above conciſe view of the Saxon affairs, it is plain, that in their own country, and for many years after they ſettled in England, they maintained that natural, wiſe and equal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which has deſervedly obtained the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of every civilized age and country. In their ſmall republics, they often met in council upon their common concerns; and being all equally intereſted in every queſtion that could be moved in their meetings, they muſt of courſe be drawn in to conſider, and offer their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on many occaſions. It is from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of this cuſtom among the ſavages, that they have been enabled to aſtoniſh our great law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, judges and governors, commiſſioned to treat with them, by diſplays of their ſublime policy. By Alfred's conſtitution, all occaſions for exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing theſe talents were cut off from the body of the people: the making and amending of laws, being in a manner entirely referred to that great deliverer and his ſublime council, whoſe wiſdom and honeſty were implicitly confided in by the whole nation; and at the ſame time diſtributive juſtice, was ſo uprightly adminiſtred by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014734_0016_0F9488628A831DC8"/>of the peace, that men fell into a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſtupor, and have never, to this day, thoroughly awakened, to a ſenſe of the neceſſity there is, to watch over both legiſlative and executive depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the ſtate. If they have now and then open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their eyes, it is only to ſurvey, with ſilent indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, a ſtate from whence they deſpair of being able to recover themſelves. Fixed eſtabliſhments on the one hand, rooted habits and prejudices on the other, are not eaſily got over Power, like wealth, draws many admirers to its poſſeſſor: and tho' all men will confeſs, that, without a check, it is dangerous in any community, they often flatter themſelves, that the <hi>riſing</hi> Auguſtus, having ſmiled upon them, in his early adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they <hi>(in particular)</hi> have nothing to fear from him, and therefore will not oppoſe him.

            <p>THIS Colony, having now but one order of freemen in it; and to the honor of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, but very few ſlaves, it will need but little argument to convince the bulk of an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people, that this ancient and juſtly admired pattern, the old Saxon form of government, will be the beſt model, that human wiſdom, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by experience, has left them to copy.</p>
            <p>To effect which,</p>
            <p>LET the firſt care of our approaching Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be to incorporate every ſociety of a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent extent into a Townſhip, which ſhall be a body politic and corporate by itſelf, having
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014734_0017_0F94886336908950"/>power of electing annually by ballot a town-clerk to record all the public proceedings of the townſhip, town council &amp;c.—to draw up, ſign, and iſſue warrants by order of the town-council for calling town meetings, and tranſact all ſuch public buſineſs as the laws of the colony ſhall point out as his duty.—A town council conſiſting of five or ſeven reſpectable men, the major part of whom ſhall be a quorum, inveſted with full power to manage the affairs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the town; and to order warrants to be iſſued for calling annual town meetings on ſuch days as ſhall be ſtated for that purpoſe, by law, and occaſionally, on the petition of ten or more freemen of the town, ſetting forth the cauſe of the requeſted meeting.—A town treaſurer—a town ſealer of weights and meaſures—aſſeſſors— collectors—overſeers of the poor—conſtables— pound keeper—ſealer of leather—ſurveyors of highways—fence viewers—gaugers— and all ſuch other officers as have been or may be found neceſſary and ſhall be inſtituted by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or any future convention appointed to amend the conſtitution of this colony.</p>
            <p>APPROACHING that gulph, where all former projectors have found their ſyſtems ſhipwrecked; I ſhall, with becoming diffidence, propoſe a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of conducting elections, which I preſume will be ſound a conſiderable improvement upon Harrington's plan.</p>
            <p>AFTER ſeating all the qualified electors in pews or ſquares by themſelves, let them be numbered, and a box handed round to receive nomination tickets for the officers to be choſen. Theſe
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014734_0018_0F948863F318C3C8"/>tickets being ſorted and numbered, let the clerk enter the names of the propoſed candidates; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with his, who has the higheſt number of tickets; and thus proceed 'till all are entered. Where there are ties, let one ticket of each be taken and ſhaken in a hat, to be drawn out in fair lot and regiſtered. Then in this order let the name or names, being firſt read over diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be propoſed by the Moderator, and balloted for by the bean; and if the firſt name fails of a majority of yeas, let the next in courſe be put, 'till the choice is made.</p>
            <p>To render this mode of voting as fair and convenient as poſſible, let beans, or balls of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite colors, be wrapped in ſmall pellets of the ſame ſort of paper, and one of each ſort ſerved to every voter. By opening the paper a little, the elector ſees the color; returns the paper to its former condition, and drops which he pleaſes in the bag, firſt holding it up between his thumb and finger, that the collector may ſee there is but one; by proceeding in this manner, a corrupt influence can hardly be exerciſed; which cannot be ſaid of the common cuſtom of balloting. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides very little writing is needful: and when the whole meeting is told that white is yea and black nay, every one is alike knowing in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his elective power, without having oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to recur to any man for advice or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
            <p>FOR the firſt election of a governor, deputy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governor, ſecretary &amp;c. it may be well for the Convention, to ſend out a nomination to the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective towns or diſtricts; as the preſent urgency
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014734_0019_0F948864B348CCA8"/>of public affairs requires that no time be loſt 'till an eſtabliſhed government be erected</p>
            <p>FOR the future, <hi>as all debates will undoubtedly be held in public,</hi> the conſideration of warlike matters being beſt managed by Committees, the body of the people will ſoon become acquainted with the true characters of the delegates, and will continue or withdraw their confidence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>THE judges of the ſupreme judicatory ſhould be nominated by the Governor and executive council, and balloted for by the Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Conſervatores,</hi> or juſtices of the peace ſhould, according to ancient cuſtom be again elected by the diſtricts; and to carry the ſalutary practice throughout, the juſtices thus choſen, ſhould, ſoon after their election, meet at the county town, and ballot for the judges of the county court, the clerk and <hi>ſolicitor</hi> for the peace, in the county.
<note n="*" place="bottom">This I conceive the proper title of the officer lately called King's Attorney.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ALL judiciary officers ſhould have moderate ſalaries; and that they might be encouraged to apply their minds to gain a thorough knowledge of their important buſineſs, they ſhould have in their commiſſions, an eſtate for life, provided they did not forfeit it by miſbehaviour.</p>
            <p>JUDGES of the probate of wills, regiſters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances, deputy-coroners, and officers of ſuch importance to the people, ſhould be eſtabliſhed in every convenient diſtrict; it being a great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for people in narrow circumſtances, to

            <p>SHERIFFS, coroners, county treaſurers, and all ſuch county officers, can be elected no other way, with ſo much conveniency, as to ballot by ticket, in each diſtrict, and to ſend the tickets to the townſmen of the ſhire-town by a ſworn officer, under the ſeals of the reſpective moderators, where the votes are taken. And ſhould the tickets, when ſorted and numbered, fail to afford any one name, balloted for, a clear majority of votes, that is, that one half, more by one vote, for ſome certain perſon, than all the reſt; the bench of juſtices for the whole county being for that purpoſe ſummoned by the clerk of that townſhip, ſhould meet, and for that year, ſupply the place of the officer, thus failing of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by nomination and ballot as before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
            <p>A STANDING grand jury, conducing much to the peace and good order of ſociety, twenty four members for each county ſhould be annually choſen, in the reſpective diſtricts, as the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives; having proper regard to the proportion belonging to each diſtrict, to ſerve for the whole year, and watch over the behaviour of the people.</p>
            <p>TRAVERSE juries, ſhould be drawn from a box, furniſhed annually, with the names of all non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exempt freeholders, written each fairly on a ticket, ſhaken together, and taken by lot.</p>
            <p>JURORS ſerving one year, ſhould be exempt the two following.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING it may be difficult to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014734_0021_0F948866376FFC70"/>find men properly qualified to ſuſtain every office propoſed to be eſtabliſhed in each diſtrict; yet the electors ſhould be ſupremely careful, never to heap offices or indeed confer more than one on the ſame perſon. No governor, counſellor, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, ſheriff, coroner, attorney at law, or clerk of the peace ſhould ever be a juſtice of the peace. Neither, ſhould any one in the executive departments, civil or military, have a ſeat in the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>SALARIES and fees ought to be <hi>competent:</hi> that able men may not be deterred from accepting them, nor covetous men conceive them a bait. The latter condition of ſalaries has been the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ruin of England; while thoſe Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths who have preſerved a ſtrict oeconomy in that reſpect, continue happy and flouriſhing.</p>
            <p>"IF we were to ſelect the attributes of good government, we ſhould find them to conſiſt in <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>juſtice.</hi> And if we could divide thoſe virtues, from all bad qualities, in men, and place ſuch men, and ſuch only, to rule over us, we ſhould eſtabliſh an heaven upon earth. The power of election which our government hath diffuſed thro' the whole nation, will always produce this happy effect, when left to operate according to its genuine principles. For by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the country into ſmall parts, as our tith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were, the character of every man, that was fit to bear an office, was well known amongſt his neighbours. And therefore, when the choice of an officer to preſide over them was their object of election, the concurrent ſentiments of an uninflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced majority, of a multitude of people, would
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014734_0022_0F948866F3466B48"/>naturally fall upon thoſe men only, who were moſt eminent for their wiſdom and juſtice."</p>
            <p>THE beſt conſtructed civil government that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>THE Militia is the natural ſupport of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>founded on the authority of the people only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND to render both the people and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perfectly free from any jealouſy of each other, it ſeems proper that the aſſociators ſhould have the choice of all officers immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them, incluſive of their reſpective cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains—that deputations from a convenient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of companies, conſiſting both of officers and privates, ſhould ballot for their field officers, and that the legiſlature ſhould appoint every general officer.</p>
            <p>AND at length, to come to that dangerous, but neceſſary engine of ſtate, <hi>a ſtanding army,</hi> whoſe operations muſt be conducted with all poſſible ſecrecy and diſpatch; and for that reaſon, muſt be entruſted in few hands; I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that a committee of three gentlemen be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by joint ballot of the governor, council, and aſſembly, to be called the committee of war; and to have the conducting of all military affairs, under the direction of the governor and privy council, to whom in matters of great importance, they ſhould always have recourſe: but being competent in leſſer matters, buſineſs would be leſs
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014734_0023_0F94886911CB0DC0"/>ſubject to delay. This committee being the joint choice of the whole legiſlature, and by them removeable annually, or at any time, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of miſbehaviour, would have a ſufficient confidence placed in them, and yet no power that might become dangerous to the liberty of the people.</p>
            <p>WHILE all kinds of governmental power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts annually to the people, there can be little danger of their liberty. Becauſe no maxim was ever more true than that, WHERE ANNUAL ELECTION ENDS, SLAVERY BEGINS.</p>
            <p>HAVING, in as brief and particular a manner as I was able, in the very ſhort time allotted me, deduced the general outlines of a free government from the pureſt fountain yet known to man; it may not be unintereſting to give a ſhort extract of the hiſtory of</p>

            <p>"BEFORE I proceed to obſerve the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that was made in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or mode of government, by the fatal union of the church with William of Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I muſt not forget to take notice, that I have not given the clergy a place, in the Saxon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; becauſe they were foreign to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal inſtitution, and only grafted themſelves upon it, after it was eſtabliſhed in England. But as they afterwards obtained a conſiderable ſhare, both in the legiſlative authority and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of government, it may not be amiſs to give ſome account how they came by it."</p>

"THE Roman Pontiff had already extended his plan of church power to a great degree; and the nature of the government introduced into Europe, by the northern nations, greatly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to his ſucceſs. All hiſtory is full of the dreadful conſequences, that have attended the baleful influence, which every religious hierarchy hath always had upon the bulk of mankind. And a government founded upon the elective power of the people, where their favor was the high road to riches, power and grandeur, gave a fine opportunity to ſuch an artful deſigning ſet of men by their intrigues and influence, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves or their devotees to be elected into the chief magiſtracy of the country diviſions. But this means they poſſeſſed themſelves, in a great meaſure of the legiſlative authority; and conſequently became, in proportion, the maſters of the ſtate.

            <p>"HAVING thus taken poſſeſſion, as it were of the manſion, they were not long before they began to plunder it. However they firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and ſecured the power of the church, by a variety of laws, made in her favor; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them by every eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment, that papal cunning could invent. So that they were now prepared to receive, in the name of the church, all the riches, honors and power, which they could by any means obtain. And what is more, they knew too how to keep them when they had obtained them. For according to their maxim, whatever was given to the church, was given to God, and therefore was never
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014734_0025_0F94886E28E6C3A0"/>afterwards ſubject to be taken away by any earthly power whatever."</p>
            <p>"THUS they endeavored to provide againſt all revolutions in the ſtate, that the property of the clergy might be ſafe, under the name of the church. Upon this ground, the clergy have grafted themſelves upon every ſtate in Europe. And as they are plants that will grow in any ſoil, they have taken ſuch deep root, that ſcarce any ſtate, except Holland, has been ſo unfriendly to their vegetation, as to exclude them from having ſome ſhare in government; though they have no more buſineſs with ours, as a ſeparate body of men, than the company of apothecaries or pariſh clerks."</p>
            <p>"THE church continually acquiring riches and power, and never diſcharging either, it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the clergy would, in a ſhort time, be the richeſt and moſt powerful body in any ſtate where they were thus eſtabliſhed. Such was the ſituation of this kingdom, at the death of Edward the confeſſor; when England may be ſaid to be governed by the power, and influence of the clergy. And we ſhall ſee, preſently, how theſe ſhepherds betrayed their flocks, and ſurrendered them to the Norman tyranny."</p>
            <p>"UNDER all tyranny, whether of kings, or prieſts, or both, it is the people who are to be made the ſacrifice; it is the people who are to be plundered of their property; it is the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who are to wear the yoke of ſlavery; it is they who are to be made the hewers of wood and drawers of water. But ſo long as the Engliſh government continued upon the original princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014734_0026_0F94886E772D3E80"/>upon which it was founded; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple annually exerciſed their elective power; ſo long it was out of the power, either of the king or the clergy to commit any acts of violence, with impunity."</p>
            <p>"INDEED the clergy might recommend, and the people might conſent to many things, that were wrong, and even ruinous in their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; yet the latter had always in their own hands, a correcting remedy for all their errors. It was this correcting power in the people, that hung, like a millſtone, over the pride, and riches of the clergy; and made them apprehenſive that, at ſome time or other, it would cruſh them to pieces; and put an end to all their ſchemes of authority riches and grandeur."</p>
            <p>"THE parliament in the reign of Edward the confeſſor, had given ſuch a ſpecimen of their correcting power, as was enough to ſhake the foundation of the papal chair; and that was by baniſhing Robert, Archbiſhop of Canterbury, as an incendiary and fomentor of diviſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the king and his ſubjects, and appointing one Stigand, Archbiſhop in his room. By this they ſaw there was only one way to avoid the danger, and preſerve and extend their tyranny over the people; and that was to deſtroy the elective power, and eſtabliſh an arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſtate. This, they were ſo bold as to attempt, and ſo happy as to ſee effected by William the Baſtard duke of Normandy; who in the year one thouſand and ſixty ſix, put an end to the Saxon mode of government, which
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014734_0027_0F94886F37563AB0"/>had ſubſiſted ſix hundred years from its firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is commonly called the conqueſt by William the firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"WE are now come to that period of the Engliſh hiſtory, which contaminated the purity of the Engliſh conſtitution, or mode of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a deſpotic ſpirit, which time has not been able totally to eradicate."</p>
            <p>"AFTER the death of Edward the confeſſor, there were two candidates for the crown of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, which had always been elective, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo to this laſt Saxon king. The one was Harold, an Engliſhman of great natural abilities, much merit, and vaſtly beloved by the people; who had been elected chief magiſtrate of three ſhires, Kent, Suſſex and Surry, at the death of his father earl Goodwin, who before him had held the ſame offices."</p>
            <p>"THE other was William the baſtard duke of Normandy, who was a man of a warlike genius and a very powerful prince, whoſe dominions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſituated oppoſite to our coaſt, rendered it more convenient for him, than for any other prince, to tranſport an army into England, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to enſlave the nation. For which reaſon no one who was a friend to his country, would ever think of electing a man, who would be ſo notoriouſly dangerous to it's laws, liberty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution."</p>
            <p>"INDEED the dangerous conſequence of his election was ſo apparent, that, tho' the clergy had marked William for their man, yet they could not hinder the choice of Harold; and therefore
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014734_0028_0F9488701877DEC8"/>he was elected king of England, by the wittena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemot or parliament; and was accordingly crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed next day by the Archbiſhop of York."</p>
            <p>"THE Pope, and William, finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fruſtrated in all their previous intrigues and ſecret cabals, in obtaining the crown of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, for the latter, were reſolved to obtain it by open force: but the ſtates of Normandy having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the duke an aid of money for the undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was obliged to have recourſe to ſome other means for aſſiſtance. The pope, therefore, was now obliged to pull off the maſk, and declare openly againſt England, and make a cruſading buſineſs of it; which, was done with a view to encourage individuals to engage in the enterprize. And that all men might ſee that William was the champion of the church, he firſt made the duke a preſent of a conſecrated ſtandard, with a golden <hi>agnus dei,</hi> and one of Saint Peter's hairs; and then ſolemnly excommunicated every man that ſhould oppoſe him."</p>
            <p>"THE duke on his part offered the lands of England as a prize to be fought for, and to be divided amongſt all thoſe that ſhould aſſiſt him in the conqueſt; by which means he engaged not only great numbers of his own ſubjects, but many of his neighbours to aſſiſt him. Thus the duke of Normandy was enabled to fit out a fleet and an army, with which he invaded England; and, on the 14th of October 1066, was fought the ever memorable battle of Haſtings, in which the Engliſh army was routed, and king Harold ſlain; which flung the whole nation into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014734_0029_0F9488729BA531B8"/>and ſoon after procured the crown of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to William."</p>
            <p>"MORCAR and Edwin, two brave officers who diſtinguiſhed themſelves all that day in battle, retired in the night, with the broken remains of the army to London; in hopes to recover the people from their fright and conſternation, and to apply ſome remedy to ſo preſſing an evil. Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians obſerve, that, in all probability, they would have ſucceeded, if the treacherous behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the clergy in London had not broken all their meaſures, by ſecretly caballing amongſt the people. Theſe two officers, and ſome others who were zealous friends to the liberty of their country, aſſembled the people; and repreſented to them, that the firſt thing to be done was to come out of that ſtate of anarchy and confuſion they were in, and immediately elect ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the chief command. That Edgar Atheling was upon the ſpot, and one of the family of their ancient kings; and that no man could have any juſt objection againſt his advancement to the throne. That as ſoon as he ſhould be proclaimed king, he would ſend orders to all parts of the kingdom to levy troops, and that the duke of Normandy ſhould ſoon find to his coſt, that the gaining a ſingle battle was not ſufficient to render him maſter of the kingdom. And to ſpirit up the people the more to action, they put them in mind how they had defended their country, inch by inch againſt the Danes, for a great many years; and had at laſt drove them out of the kingdom; and that there was no doubt but they would do the ſame by this new invader."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:014734_0030_0F94887682D21F48"/>
"THE clergy knew that this was the critical moment, and that if they could but keep things a little longer in confuſion, their buſineſs was done, and therefore they openly oppoſed every propoſal of reſiſtance. The declaration of the pope in favor of William was ſufficient to induce all the clergy, then in London, with the two archbiſhops at their head, to cab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> amongſt the people in order to hinder Edgar's election; which it ſo effectually did, that Morcar and Edwin ſeeing every propoſal overruled, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of ſucceſs, retired into the north to take their own meaſures."</p>
            <p>"THEY were no ſooner gone, than the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, the archbiſhop of York, the biſhop of Wincheſter, and the clergy about London, and ſome ſay prince Edgar himſelf (by their perſuaſion) went to the duke at Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamſtead and ſwore fealty to him; as if he had been already their lawful ſovereign. Hence we may juſtly ſay, that the lives, liberty, and property of the people of England, were ſurrendered into the hands of the Normans, by the baneful intereſt of the clergy. For the city of London, following the example of the clergy, ſurrendered, afterwards the whole kingdom, without any further reſiſtance."</p>
            <p>"THUS William the firſt obtained the crown of England by the favor of the clergy, and not by the power of the ſword, as, they would ſeem to intimate, by his ſurname the conqueror. A name inpoſed upon him after his death, by the clergy, in order to ſcreen the infamy of their own actions from poſterity, that future genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:014734_0031_0F9488778A6C84A0"/>might aſcribe, the miſerable ſtate of the people, to the conqueſt of William, and not to the dark treachery of a body of men, who had, under the maſk of religion, abuſed every truſt of of confidence repoſed in them; and betrayed their flocks, bound hand and foot, like ſheep to the ſlaughter."</p>
            <p>"FROM this time, civil and religious tyranny, walked hand in hand, two monſters till then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in England; which are, equally, the common enemies to mankind, and have at all times, united againſt every principle of civil and religious liberty. This is the true origin of the alliance between church and ſtate, ſo much contended for by ſome of our eccleſiaſtics; who have renounced the penances of popery, but would fain retain both its pride and its power."</p>
            <p>AND on the proceedings of Charles the firſt's parliament, in the expulſion of the biſhops, the ſame author obſerves,</p>
            <p>"THAT it was their duty, as law makers, to remove from parliament, a body of men who had, conſtitutionally, no right there; and who had invariably, directed their whole influence, againſt every principle of civil and religious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and were now particularly dangerous to the ſtate."</p>
            <p>"IT is undoubtedly the moſt abſurd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious principle, that ever was received into any ſociety of men, to permit the clergy <hi>of any denomination,</hi> to have the leaſt diſtant ſhare, or influence, upon the legiſlative authority of any nation. And had the motives of the houſe of Commons, for excluding the biſhops from the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:014734_0032_0F948878383C1E40"/>houſe of Lords been as good as their motion, they would have done this kingdom a moſt eſſential piece of ſervice; but their intent was only to pull down one nuſance, in order to eſtabliſh another al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as bad. Their buſineſs, as law makers, was to protect every man in his right of private judgment, in point of religion; and not ſuffer any ſet of men to dictate to others in a matter that merely ſubſiſts between God and a man's own ſoul" —"Had they deſtroyed all eccleſiaſtical power, they had deſtroyed an evil in the ſtate, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant matter of vexation. Had they protected all men alike, in their different modes of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, they would have taken away all juſt occaſion of offence and eſtabliſhed peace amongſt men."</p>
            <p>NOTHING can be more evident, than the miſchief that has ever followed the requiſition of a declaration of faith in doctrines acknowledged to be above human comprehenſion, as a qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for any civil truſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To believe that God is, and a rewarder according to our works;</hi> is the firm foundation of natural and revealed religion; and tho' he deigned to inform Moſes, I AM, we find him pleaſed, at that time, to make no further diſcovery of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Neither are we hitherto convinced, that any, <hi>by ſearching, have found him out to greater perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT is here, faithfully quoted or modeſtly ſuggeſted, is intended to give no offence to any man, or body of men exiſting. In matters wherein all are concerned, it is the duty of all to give notice of any thing they conceive
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014734_0033_0F948878F4196ED0"/>might be hurtful to the public, if ſuffered to paſs without examination.

            </p>
            <p>WE are happy that ſuch plain and ſalutary paths have been marked out before us. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rubbiſh has been thrown into them, ſhould be carefully removed, that, like <hi>wiſdom's ways,</hi> they may be <hi>pleaſant,</hi> and conduct us to a ſecure and virtuous PEACE.</p>
            <p>MEN entruſted with the formation of civil conſtitutions, ſhould remember they are <hi>paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for eternity:</hi> that the ſmalleſt defect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy in the ſyſtem they frame may prove the deſtruction of millions.</p>
            <p>ABOVE all things, the greateſt care ſhould be taken, that the perſons who grant the public mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ſhould of courſe have the power of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into its diſpoſal, ſhould have no hand in contracts; or any connection with perſons thro' whoſe hands the public treaſure paſſes. A houſe of commons ſhould indeed be the guardians of common right, and the intereſt of the public. Places, penſions and other emoluments, from the public treaſury having, for near a century paſt, been open to Britiſh commoners, their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of bringing peculators to account, has been of no uſe to the oppreſſed people. They have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed united with them, and formed ſuch power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful factions as have bid defiance to the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By this means, the legiſlative and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority, which our wiſe and virtuous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, carefully kept aſunder, are become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014734_0034_0F948879B3B6EFF8"/>together, in the hands of the ſame men. This has principally ariſen from another fatal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention of the people to the uſurpations of their deputies, when they took upon them to alter the firſt principle of the conſtitution by acts of parliament.</p>
            <p>"UPON this foundation, they may mould it into what ſhape they pleaſe; and in the end make us ſlaves by law. The houſe of commons are conſtituted, a body of men, merely paſſive, with regard to their creation, duration, and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and therefore have no conſent to give to their own duration, even for an hour."</p>
            <p>"THERE cannot be a more dangerous doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine adopted in a ſtate, than to admit that the legiſlative authority has a right to alter the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution."</p>
            <p>THIS ſhrewd obſervation needs little to be ſaid in proof of it. For as the conſtitution limits the authority of the legiſlature; if the legiſlature can alter the conſtitution, they can give themſelves what bounds they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore, I beg leave to repeat, that after the approaching Convention has met, and ſettled the grand outlines of a conſtitution, let the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature go on with the affairs of government, without ſenſible deviation from the obvious meaning of their digeſt; and whatever inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences may be found unprovided for, may be candidly advertiſed to the public, and amended by another Convention.</p>

               <hi>The powers of the ſeveral parts of the</hi> LEGISLATURE.</head>
            <p>THE reſpective powers of the ſeveral bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Legiſlature come next into conſideration. And it muſt be confeſſed, that on this queſtion I find the greateſt difference of opinion among the really wiſe and learned, of any pertaining to our ſyſtem. Some talk of having two councils, one legiſlative, and the other executive: ſome of a ſmall executive coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil only; which ſhould have nothing to do with framing the laws. Some would have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, an integral part of the legiſlature: others, only preſident of the council with a caſting vote.</p>
            <p>The latter opinion appears to me moſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the intentions of wiſe framers of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Governor ſhould have a ſeat in ſome part of the Legiſlature, that he might be fully acquainted with the neceſſity and reaſons for paſſing any bill into a law, and on the other hand, to prevent any one perſon from poſſeſſing too much, or a dangerous power, he ſhould have no more than a caſting vote when neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Some are ſtrenuous for only one legiſlative bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy namely, the houſe of repreſentatives: but a council will be found neceſſary for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſons.</p>
            <p>An Act, ever ſo well intended, and in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ever ſo well framed to promote the public good, will notwithſtanding, throw the ſociety into confuſion, if it can be made appear that it is founded on principles which will not bear exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>The perſons ſelected to compoſe a council,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014734_0036_0F94887F9E5D50C0"/>are of courſe always ſuppoſed to have a ſuperior degree of acquaintance with the hiſtory, laws, and manners of mankind; and by that means they will be more likely to foreſee the miſchievous conſequences, that might follow a proceeding, which at firſt view did not appear to have any thing dangerous in it, to many honeſt men, who may however, be very worthy of a ſeat in the houſe of repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>For on no circumſtance does the public peace and proſperity more immediately depend, than on the clearneſs, fullneſs and conſiſtency of the laws.</p>
            <p>The Governor ſhould be furniſhed with a ſmall privy council, to afford him their advice and aſſiſtance in the executive department; but they ſhould have no ſhare whatever in the Legiſlature.</p>
            <p>In this capacity they ſhould take cognizance of high crimes; ſuch as mal-adminiſtration of Judges in their offices; being the proper inqueſt for this purpoſe—The Aſſembly and Legiſlative Council, in like manner to enquire into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Governor and privy council, and the cauſe of complaint being found, a regular trial by the country ſhould determine all cauſes whatever.</p>
            <p>A COUNCIL, annually eligible, will endeavor to maintain their feats by the rectitude of their conduct.</p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe they can <hi>inveterate</hi> themſelves, is to ſuppoſe that mankind will forget the miſchiefs which have overſpread the world from the days of Sylla to the preſent bloody period, from the ſame tyrannic ſource.</p>
            <p>WE ſhould make all prudent proviſion for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and indeed the moſt ſalutary proviſion we can poſſibly make for them, is to enable
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014734_0037_0F94887FC86C8A38"/>them to provide for themſelves; but we ought never to run into one extreme to avoid another.</p>
            <p>THE laſt important meaſure I would propoſe, is, that, whereas the heat of war in our very neighbourhood, may well be ſuppoſed to agitate the minds of the delegates in convention, and render it impoſſible to have every proviſion made for the ſecurity of our liberties, that cool and continued reflexion would ſuggeſt, after the principal parts of the conſtitution are eſtabliſhed, an adjounment might be made to a convenient day; and mean while every man might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to give his ſentiments freely and diſcreetly upon any part of the ſyſtem he might conceive could be altered for the better.</p>
            <p>PROBABLY a decennial meeting of delegates, to examine the ſtate of the conſtitution, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the government, would not be an impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proviſion for keeping the conſtitution in health and vigor, by having an opportunity to ſee that it did not depart from its firſt principles. This would be effectually holding the ſupreme power in its <hi>only</hi> ſafe repoſitory <hi>the hands of</hi> THE PEOPLE.</p>

            <p>THE laſt and greateſt ſecurity that men can have for a permanent enjoyment of their rights, is to learn, what they are from their very elements, as they are well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by Burlamaqui and others; and beſides, to learn the art of defending them with their arms.</p>
            <p>I, ALIKE diſcommend a heedleſs inattention to the concerns of our country and poſterity; and a deſpairing anxiety, grounded on a ſuppoſition, that if ſome particular matters are not ſettled in juſt ſuch particular manners, that all will be loſt irrecoverably.</p>
            <p>THIS is a day of cool and impartial enquiry. Adverſity ſobers our ſpirits and cauſes us to give each other a patient hearing. We learn from our troubles that each man needs the advice and aſſiſtance of his neighbour: and perhaps this is not the moſt trivial leſſon.</p>
            <p>THE varying circumſtances of our ſituation, have gradually pointed out arrangements already which no man could have foreſeen ſome months ago: thoſe ſucceſſive improvements which will thence ariſe, and the advantage of ſuch a communication of ſentiments as will accrue from the eſtabliſhment of frequent town meetings among the people, will give ſuch a new face to the affairs of this colony, and raiſe up ſo many able men to improve its internal police; that as arts and manufactures have already made it their peculiar, or at leaſt principal reſidence, ſo we

            <p>The events which have given birth to this mighty revolution; and will vindicate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions that ſhall be wiſely made againſt our ever again relapſing into a ſtate of bondage and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, cannot be better ſet forth than in the following Declaration of AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:014734_0041_0F948882B31AC768"/>ſhewn, that mankind are more diſpoſed to ſuffer, while evils are ſufferable, than to right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by aboliſhing the forms to which they are accuſtomed. But when a long train of abures and uſurpations, purſuing invariably the ſame object, evinces a deſign to reduce them under abſolute deſpotiſm, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off ſuch government, and to provide new guards for their future ſecurity. Such has been the patient ſufferance of theſe colonies, and ſuch is now the neceſſity which conſtrains them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their former ſyſtems of government. The hiſtory of the preſent King of Great Britain is a hiſtory of repeated injuries and uſurpations, all having in direct object the eſtabliſhment of an abſolute tyranny over theſe ſtates. To prove this, let facts be ſubmitted to a candid world.</p>
            <p>HE has refuſed his aſſent to laws, the moſt wholeſome and neceſſary for the public good.</p>
            <p>HE has forbidden his Governors to paſs laws of immediate and preſſing importance, unleſs ſuſpended in their operation till his aſſent ſhould be obtained; and, when ſo ſuſpended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</p>
            <p>HE has refuſed to paſs other laws for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodation of large diſtricts of people, unleſs thoſe people would relinquiſh the right of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation in the legiſlature, a right ineſtimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</p>
            <p>He has called together legiſlative bodies at places unuſual, uncomfortable, and diſtant from the depoſitory of their public records, for the ſole purpoſe of fatiguing them into compliance with his meaſures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:014734_0042_0F948883780E1CE8"/>
HE has diſſolved Repreſentative Houſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly, for oppoſing with manly firmneſs his invaſions on the Rights of the people.</p>
            <p>HE has refuſed for a long time, after ſuch diſſolutions, to cauſe others to be elected; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the legiſlative powers, incapable of annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have returned to the people at large for their exerciſe; the ſtate remaining in the mean time expoſed to all the dangers of invaſion from without, and convulſions within.</p>
            <p>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of theſe ſtates; for that purpoſe obſtructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refuſing to paſs others to encourage their migrations hither, and raiſing the conditions of new appropriations of lands.</p>
            <p>He has obſtructed the adminiſtration of juſtice, by refuſing his aſſent to laws for eſtabliſhing ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary powers.</p>
            <p>He has made Judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their ſalaries.</p>
            <p>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and ſent hither ſwarms of officers to harraſs our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and eat out their ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>He has kept among us, in times of peace, ſtanding armies, without the conſent of our legiſlatures.</p>
            <p>He has affected to render the military inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of, and ſuperior to the civil power.</p>
            <p>He has combined with others to ſubject us to a juriſdiction foreign to our conſtitution, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledged by our laws; giving his aſſent to their acts of pretended legiſlation:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:014734_0043_0F948885E2EE8528"/>
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</p>
            <p>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from puniſhment for any murders which they ſhould commit on the inhabitants of theſe ſtates:</p>
            <p>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</p>
            <p>For impoſing taxes on us without our conſent:</p>
            <p>For depriving us, in many caſes, of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of trial by jury:</p>
            <p>For tranſporting us beyond ſeas to be tried for pretended offences:</p>
            <p>For aboliſhing the free ſyſtem of Engliſh laws in a neighbouring province, eſtabliſhing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, ſo as to render it at once an example and ſit inſtrument for introducing the ſame abſolute rule into theſe Colonies:</p>
            <p>For taking away our charters, aboliſhing our moſt valuable laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:</p>
            <p>For ſuſpending our own legiſlatures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring themſelves inveſted with power to legiſlate for us in all caſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>He has abdicated government here, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring us out of his protection and waging war againſt us.</p>
            <p>He has plundered our ſeas, ravaged our coaſts, burnt our towns, and deſtroyed the lives of our people.</p>
            <p>He is, at this time, tranſporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, deſolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumſtances of cruelty and perfidy ſcarcely
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:014734_0044_0F948889E0F7B280"/>paralleled in the moſt barbarous ages, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</p>
            <p>He has conſtrained our fellow Citizens taken captive on the high ſeas to bear arms againſt their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themſelves by their hands.</p>
            <p>He has excited domeſtic inſurrections amongſt us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of our frontiers, the mercileſs Indian ſavages, whoſe known rule of warfare, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhed deſtruction, of all ages, ſexes and conditions.</p>
            <p>In every ſtage of theſe oppreſſions we have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for redreſs in the moſt humble terms: Our repeated petitions have been anſwered only by repeated injury. A prince, whoſe character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</p>
            <p>Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our Britiſh brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legiſlature to extend an unwarrantable juriſdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumſtances of our emigration and ſettlement here. We have appealed to their native juſtice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to diſavow theſe uſurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connexions and correſpondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of juſtice and of conſanguinity. We muſt, therefore, acquieſce in the neceſſity, which denounces our ſeparation, and hold them, as we hold the reſt of mankind, enemies in war, in peace, friends.</p>

We, therefore, the Repreſentatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS, aſſembled, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing, to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by authority of the good people of theſe colonies, ſolemnly publiſh and declare, that theſe United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are abſolved from all allegiance to the Britiſh Crown, and that all poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical connexion between them and the ſtate of Great Britain is and ought to be totally diſſolved; and that, as FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, eſtabliſh commerce, and to do all other acts and things which INDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENDENT STATES may of right do.
