            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>II. SAMUEL, xxi. 17.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>THEN THE MEN OF DAVID SWARE UNTO HIM, SAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, THOU SHALT GO NO MORE OUT WITH US TO BATTLE, THAT THOU QUENCH NOT THE LIGHT OF ISRAEL.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>"TRULY light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for the eyes to behold the ſun." This great ſource of light was early formed by the Creator's hand. "He ſaw that it was good." It has ever ſince been the beauty and the glory of its ſyſtem. Its moſt extenſive beneficence is as neceſſary, as its ſplendor is illuſtrious. It is eſſential to the gladneſs, the guidance, and the ſupport of the various inhabitants of the globe. It is peculiarly the life and the beauty of the vegetative cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. By this the enamelled meads are dreſſed in their richeſt robes, "ſurpaſſing SOLOMON in all his glory."</p>
            <p>With great wiſdom then and propriety, did the men of Iſrael uſe the delicate and ſtrong figure of light,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035317_0005_10022B706871D608"/>
to give an idea of the ſplendor and benignity of their ruling Sovereign. The two principal ideas contained in this metaphor, are beams to <hi>guide,</hi> and rays to <hi>cheer;</hi> or, guidance and comfort. When applied to a juſt and good thing, it ſignifies that he governs with <hi>wiſdom</hi> and righteouſneſs; and to the joy and <hi>felicity</hi> of his ſubjects. DAVID himſelf uſes the ſame ſplendid figure, in the ſenſe of the text. "He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of GOD; and he ſhall be as the light of the morning, when the ſun riſeth, even a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without clouds; as the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth by clear ſhining after rain."</p>
            <p>The men of Iſrael, wiſer than many in this day, duly appreciated the bleſſings of good government, and highly tendered the precious life of their ſovereign. They trembled at his perſonal danger. They blodly oppoſed his deſign of going to battle againſt his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſon, and prevented his expoſure of himſelf. They anſwered with all the fervor of love, and the firmneſs of patriotiſm: "Thou ſhalt not go forth: For if we flee away, they will not care for us: Neither if half of us die, will they care for us: But thou art worth ten thouſand of us." What noble ſentiments are theſe! And what ſterling worth! It was for a like cauſe, and on a ſimilar occaſion, that they ſpake the words of our text.</p>
            <p>DAVID had wearied himſelf in battle, and ſpent his ſtrength. A gigantic foe ſaw his advantage, and had nearly improved it, and taken his life. ABISHAI, one of his Generals, poſſeſſed of preſence of mind, ſtepped in a moment between his prince and death; ſaved him from the hands of his huge antagoniſt, and gave the monſter the fatal thruſt. On that great occaſion, "his men," with equal reaſon, "Sware to him," ſaying, "Thou ſhalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Iſrael." How happy is ſuch a prince! How bleſſed is ſuch a People! Could I do any thing, which ſhould promote ſuch happineſs, I ſhould ſurely be happy too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:035317_0006_10022B774E4CFED8"/>
I ſuppoſe I ſhould do but little to this purpoſe, were I to ſpend time to prove that civil government is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary inſtitution, evident from the nature and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of mankind; that it is agreeable to the will of the Supreme Ruler of the world; and that it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered in ſuch a manner as to be of very various and extenſive benefit to ſociety. There is, I conceive, as little reaſon to induce me to ſhow the comparative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and defects of the ſeveral forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which different nations have adopted. By the help of all theſe, the union has formed conſtitutions, perhaps, the moſt excellent and eligible of any yet thought of. To offer to our Rulers of this State, with modeſty, and yet with zeal, ſome plain directions for an happy adminiſtration of our public affairs, is the buſineſs before us; with the reſulting duties of the People.</p>
            <p>If Rulers would be the light and joy of the People, it is eſſential that they bear a kind and parental <hi>affection</hi> to them. This is a principle animating and perſevering, and eſſential to a joyful activity in duty. Civil Rulers are in a ſtation exalted and important. The conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their conduct are of a very ſerious and weighty nature, deeply affecting the intereſts of the community; while they are ſeeking the welfare of the People, affairs may come before them of a very perplexed and intricate nature, calling for their united wiſdom, probity and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. At the ſame time, their unwearied and laboring ſervices may not receive from the People that approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they merit. The beſt meaſures of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration may be diſapproved and blamed, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured as wrong; neither calculated, nor even deſigned for the public good.</p>
            <p>Under theſe and ſimilar circumſtances, how neceſſary is that love of the People, which flows from a regard to GOD, and chriſtian principles! Here Rulers muſt riſe above preſent conſiderations, and act agreeably to their ſtations, and as accountable to GOD. They muſt view themſelves as the Fathers of the People appointed by
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035317_0007_10022B7F311DA778"/>
GOD, and reaſon to take care of their intereſts, and promote their welfare; although they ſhould prove unthankful children, perverted by ignorant men; or ſuch as are reſtleſs, diſcontented and ſeditious. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are "miniſters of GOD for good" to the People, they muſt attend to that very thing. And a ſincere aim to promote that, animated by benevolence, ſhould never be neglected a moment. A deſire to be uſeful, and bleſs mankind, ſhould rule in the hearts of all; men poſſeſſing the ſtation and influence of Rulers, ſhould greatly cheriſh it. They cannot rule us in the fear of GOD without it.</p>
            <p>But, animated by this, and guided by wiſdom, they will ſhine in their influence, as the ſun in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and enlighten and cheer all who have eyes to ſee, and ſenſibility to feel. And they may always hope this number will be large, notwithſtanding all the jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uneaſy men, who grow up ſpontaneouſly in free governments. Many will ſay of ſuch Rulers, "They are the glory and ſtability of our times." Even in this day of jarring politics, we have Rulers of whom we ſay, "Ye are worth ten thouſand of us." We have our NEHEMIAHS, for whom we pray, "LORD blot not out all their good deeds which they have done for thy people, and for the houſes of our GOD." We have our MORDECAI's, who are "great in the nation, and accepted of the multitude of their brethren, ſeeking the wealth of the People, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace to all their feed." All Rulers ſhould be like theſe, and become the light and gladneſs of the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great knowledge</hi> of the nature and duties of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is another part of that genial light, by which Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſhine, and give the People joy. This, with a connected and competent acquaintance with human nature, is eſſential, if they would rule with honor to themſelves, and advantage to the People. Should the People ſee that they are ignorant, or neglectful, of the Conſtitution, and the principal rules of adminiſtration,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035317_0008_10022B816F222980"/>
they would view them as a luminary under an eclipſe, ſhedding a tenebrious and portentous light. But, while they duly regard both theſe with a prudent reference to the genius and ſentiments of the People, they will ſhine with a pleaſing and acceptable ſplendor. For while they wiſely and faithfully attend to that Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which the united wiſdom and care of the whole People have formed and choſen, and which is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly adapted to the ſecurity and promotion of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral welfare, how can the People complain? How can they refuſe either approbation, or gratitude? They muſt ſee, that ſuch conduct ſecures their liberties and poſſeſſions; and in many ways renders the enjoyment of them greatly enhanced. Laws made by ſuch Rulers, muſt be, not only conſtitutional, but wiſe and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. They muſt be agreeable to all good citizens; and offenſive only to "the lawleſs and diſobedient," for whom they are eſpecially needful. Such rulers will ſhine in their orbits with bright and cheering rays. They muſt ſee, in a thouſand inſtances, which people in the maſs overlook, ſuch meaſures as will favour the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral welfare. They muſt be ſuppoſed to know the moſt equitable and eaſy way of levying taxes, the moſt wiſe and neceſſary laws, the moſt worthy and ſuitable men for all civil offices, the moſt eligible ways of promoting diſcoveries and improvements in arts and ſciences, and in the comforts and conveniencies of life; the moſt efficacious means of checking vice, and aiding virtue; and, in general, the beſt ways of promoting the public welfare. Such Rulers will be viewed by all the wiſe and good, as the Light and Happineſs of the People. And if one among them could be found alone to wiſh the light quenched, that the bleſſings of anarchy might ſucceed, he alone would deſerve to have his choice, and to "be filled with his own ways."</p>
            <p>If Rulers would ſhine with a genial ſplendor, and give ſolid joy to the people, they muſt attend with much care to the <hi>Laws</hi> which they make to govern
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035317_0009_10022B89CD7B3F88"/>
them. The baſis of theſe ſhould ever be juſtice and mercy. Theſe virtues ſhould always be encouraged, and the oppoſite vices checked. Rulers in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign "are not a terror to good works, but to evil." And no good and quiet man ſhould be ſlaviſhly "afraid of the power;" but aſſured, that, "doing well he ſhould have praiſe of the ſame." Juſtice is, perhaps, the brighteſt gem in the crown of a Ruler. He ſhould ever be able to ſay, "I put on righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and it clothed me: and my judgment was a robe and a diadem." This ſhould be the robe of every Magiſtrate, in every department of government. For how can a People be happy when this is not the caſe? If iniquity be framed by law, what will become of the peace and felicity of the People? And if the courſe of juſtice be ſtopped among a People by the corruption or intimidation of the judicial powers, "where can the righteous ſeek redreſs?" And how can the guilty be made afraid? Juſtice is ſo eſſential to the welfare of communities!</p>
            <p>It is in itſelf an exalted and divine virtue. In this we peculiarly reſemble the Deity. Almoſt all other virtues have a reference to ourſelves. This is gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and benevolent, extending to all mankind. GOD alone is juſt to perfection, and able to diſtribute it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and without defect. His omniſcience gives him the moſt complete view of all moral beings; and his almighty arm enables him to render to all according to their deeds.</p>
            <p>The nearer Civil Rulers (who are gods below) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Divine Model, the more truly are they the light of the People: And by a wiſe mixture of mercy and juſtice, in their adminiſtrations, they reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Deity in that raviſhing glory which is ſeen "in the face of JESUS CHRIST." Let our laws partake of theſe heavenly ingredients; and let them be truly and faithfully executed. On theſe two pillars hang all the wealth and quietneſs of the People. At leaſt they are

eſſential to their virtue and happineſs, their eaſe and tranquillity.</p>
            <p>Sumptuary and economical laws might aid the cauſe of virtue, and ſo far as the powers of government reach that way, they will be well employed to check a rage for extravagant diverſions and amuſements of all kinds. Theſe things are injurious to <hi>young</hi> Republics, and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Republics. I am aware the ſubject is delicate, and the ſpirit of the times backward to reſtraint; yet we venture to ſay, "A land of levity is a land of guilt." A People devoted to high-ſeaſoned pleaſures, and ſhowy diverſions, improved by the flowers of eloquence, are apt to form romantic ideas of happineſs, to loſe a reliſh for the ſolid duties and comforts of life, and to contract a growing diſtaſte to the better pleaſures of virtue, and the elevating hopes of religion. We are apt in this way to "ſeek a Heaven below the ſkies," and to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that which is above. The natural effect is, a carnal and worldly temper. To oppoſe the ſteps which lead to this, and to remove the temptations to it, are labours worthy of all Miniſters, civil or ſacred. Encouraging frugality, induſtry and temperance in pleaſure, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the oppoſite evils, Magiſtrates do well. In thus regarding juſtice and mercy, and ſeeking alſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of beneficial and virtuous habits of living, they will ſhine to approbation; and it will be the duty of the People to "lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty."</p>
            <p>If Rulers would be the light of the People, they muſt attend cloſely to the <hi>characters</hi> of men whom they put into <hi>authority.</hi> Every man in office ſhould be poſſeſſed of probity and firmneſs, and a friend to mankind and to righteouſneſs. The laws of a country may be wiſe and good; yet, when the actions of men are tried by them, they may be twiſted and perverted, ſo that the innocent ſhall ſuffer, and the guilty be acquitted. The laws ſhall have "a meaning never meant," owing to ſome vague expreſſions in the frame of them; or ſome
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035317_0011_10022B93ECCA4B18"/>
other handle will be made uſe of to the ſame purpoſe. Hence the importance of integrity in the judicial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments.</p>
            <p>Men in office, deſigned to keep the peace of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and promote juſtice and union among neighbours, may do eminent ſervice, acting well, and keeping the end of their appointment in view. By adviſing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to peace and friendſhip, and ſometimes relaxing their fees, they may prevent much miſchief, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote much happineſs. All "our officers ſhould be peace, and our exactors righteouſneſs;" that "our peace may be as a river." "Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation." It tends to happineſs, and procures the bleſſing of GOD, "which maketh rich." "When he giveth quietneſs who then can make trouble? And when he hideth his face who then can behold him? Whether it be done againſt a nation, or againſt a man only." Righteous men in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſhine and allure to right conduct by their example. Under them government is beloved and honoured. Beſide, when it is well known that government is juſt, and that unworthy men are excluded from poſts of honour and profit, this very thing will be an incentive to a fair and good character. And men ever known to have been ſelfiſh, and never to have ſerved the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of ſociety, will be afraid to be candidates for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant offices. The idea of diſappointment will check them; and they will dread to have their characters held up to public view, leſt they ſhould become doubly ſcandalous to them. This care to fill offices with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, will then turn out greatly advantageous to the public: For good men alſo would as readily come forward, in this caſe, as the baſe would hide themſelves.</p>
            <p>In order to prove that the Deity is on the ſide of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and that it will finally prevail, an eminent author has <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> a nation to be wholly righteous. The fame, the nature and the government of this nation, are <hi>imagined</hi> to make it the greateſt and the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py nation on earth. One ſtep, and an important one
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035317_0012_10022B9C50CF11F0"/>
towards this ſingular felicity of a people, would be an excluſive introduction of worthy men into places of authority.</p>
            <p>Senſible of this, even the unenlightened PHARAOH was wholly influenced by it in the choice of a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant officer. He ſaid to his ſervants, "Can we find ſuch a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of GOD is?" on which ROLLIN makes this good reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: "In talking thus he entirely reformed a falſe policy, which conſiders virtue and religion as unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in the government of a State, and finds an exact probity too great a check upon its views and projects. This ſtupid impiety is expoſed to eternal ſhame by an infidel King. He is convinced that the more of the Spirit of GOD a Miniſter has, the more capable he is of governing a kingdom. And the leaſt attention ſuffices to diſcover, that the oppoſite principle flows from the utter want of human underſtanding."</p>
            <p>When therefore, in any government, the vileſt men may riſe, either by ſervility or ſecondary influence, we may ſay, there is a radical defect in adminiſtration. So far ſuch a government is reduced to infamy and miſery.</p>
            <p>And as, in our happy country, the People poſſeſs the privilege of chooſing their Rulers, in the firſt inſtance it is of mighty importance that they ſhould have that knowledge and that virtue which will enable them to make a juſt and wiſe uſe of it. To this end the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of virtue and general knowledge, is greatly to be deſired and promoted. For what is a Free Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and what is it ſoon like to be, without its eſſential pillars? Even ſince the days of our independence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a People never had greater privileges, or made more rapid ſtrides in proſperity, it has coſt the nation large ſums to quell inſurrections and rebellions. But, could theſe have riſen, had the nation poſſeſſed a due ſhare of knowledge and virtue? Let us all then exert
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035317_0013_10022BA1414E07B8"/>
ourſelves to promote theſe; and let no man riſe to poſts of honour without them. For,
<q>
                  <l>When impious men bear ſway,</l>
                  <l>The poſt of honour is the private ſtation.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But this will not be the only misfortune of ſuch men bearing ſway. The body will receive detriment, and in more ways than one. The national intereſts will be neglected; merit will be diſcouraged, and vile men will rejoice, and do miſchief without fear.</p>
            <p>As the light and ſupport of the People, Rulers muſt defend them in their enjoyments, by keeping <hi>peace</hi> at home and abroad, as far as may be.</p>
            <p>In this weighty buſineſs, I confeſs, more wiſdom is required, than I have any claim to; but that internal and external peace is a bleſſing of the firſt magnitude, and accordingly to be ſought, no one will deny.</p>
            <p>To ſecure it at <hi>home,</hi> and to promote all the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to which it is favourable, is the duty of Rulers; and if theſe ends can be obtained by the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct of government, it will be happy. And, in general, we may hope for this. But if unreaſonable men will, notwithſtanding, riſe up againſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diſturb the public peace, <hi>force</hi> is then juſtly reſorted to.</p>
            <p>To ſecure us from <hi>foreign wars,</hi> it is plainly the duty of Rulers to be juſt in their conduct towards the other nations with whom they have connexions. And if miſunderſtanding take place between us and any ſuch nation, it ſeems truly juſt and wiſe, and a part of commendable policy, to try the event of upright and honorable negociation. And the importance of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting an open rupture with ſuch a nation may be ſo great as to juſtify all the ſteps of an amicable and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering</hi> negociation. Such ſteps will vindicate our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character in the eyes of all nations; bring down the bleſſing of GOD upon us; fill the people with love to government, and animate them firmly to defend
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035317_0014_10022BA5162CE528"/>
their country againſt the hoſtile attempts of ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when negociation ſhall have proved inefficient.</p>
            <p>We rejoice and bleſs GOD, that the conduct of our Rulers, to keep peace at home and abroad, is the exact reſemblance of all that we have ſaid.</p>
            <p>As the calamities of war are devoutly to be depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; ſo we pray GOD, that the meaſures taken for our juſt defence may turn out, under a benign Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the prevention of them. And as this is the aim and good deſign of our Rulers; ſo, I doubt not, they cordially approve of the ſpirit of that prayer which was offered by a great prince and warrior after a deciſive battle:
<q>
                  <l>Make wars, O LORD, by wars to ceaſe;</l>
                  <l>And let this conqueſt lead to peace.</l>
               </q>
But ſhould we, after all, be called to put the harneſs on, the <hi>juſtice</hi> of our cauſe would lead us to hope in that GOD who has ever been "the hope of our Iſrael and the Saviour of it in times of trouble."</p>
            <p>I only add, rulers will be eminently the light of the people by aiding the cauſe and promotion of <hi>learning, virtue</hi> and <hi>religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſo eſſential to the real and laſting welfare of the body, and have been ſo truly the glory of our country, that our civil heads cannot promote or eſteem them to exceſs. To encourage, and ſtill maintain, ſchools for youth, is, doubtleſs, one good means of anſwering theſe great purpoſes. And here we may alſo reckon the encouragement of uſeful <hi>diſcoveries</hi> and <hi>inventions.</hi> And if they can do any thing by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or example, to bring into a more juſt eſteem, a learned and pious <hi>Chriſtian Miniſtry,</hi> the times too lou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dly call for it. People are ſadly indifferent, in many places, or even averſe to the ſettlement and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of ſuch paſtors. With large numbers, the peace, the order, the union and edification of the churches of CHRIST, are ſmall things; and the increaſe of infidelity, or vain and imported philoſophy, on the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035317_0015_10022BAA133F0850"/>
one hand, and of diſorder in churches, and angry ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arations and deluſions, on the other, calls aloud to our Zion. With me, theſe are the moſt portentous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the day. If any men, or order of men, can be the happy inſtruments of promoting more light and love among Chriſtians, they will be eminently honoured of GOD, and equally dear to the friends of CHRIST's peaceful kingdom.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Univerſity,</hi> which has given ſo many ornaments and bleſſings both to Church and State, will receive the foſtering care of our Civil Fathers.</p>
            <p>And as they profeſs the religion of CHRIST, we hope with the greater confidence, that they will eſteem its heavenly doctrines, and obſerve its pure precepts, and be lovely examples of ſo divine a religion, in all their private deportment.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Rulers,</hi> they will act for CHRIST, who has raiſed them to ſeats of dignity; and who poſſeſſes "all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in heaven and earth." As they can ſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity <hi>ſo well</hi> in no other way, in honouring relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, this duty will be obvious to them. And as the works of <hi>Providence,</hi> in all ages, are deſigned to promote the Redeemer's kingdom and the ſalvation of ſouls, we all, and Rulers eminently, ſhould concur in that beſt deſign.</p>
            <p>And, as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they may, perhaps, advance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as much by their <hi>private life and example,</hi> as by bending all the power of their governmental ſtations that way. By firmly believing the inſpiration of the ſacred books, and defending it by its own ſtanding and convincing evidence; by honouring and comforting the Miniſters of CHRIST, many of whom want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; by attending public worſhip, and revering our holy Sabbaths; by manifeſting the pure and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent temper of the Goſpel in their daily life; by promoting the peace, union and edification of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Churches to which they belong; and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing all looſe principles and practices, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035317_0016_10022BAE1ADC82B8"/>
encouraging things oppoſite, they may do much to aid the beſt cauſe in the world, and "to ſtrengthen the things of religion which remain, and are ready to die." Behaving thus gloriouſly, they will be the light of our Iſrael, and remind us with joy of that better day of Zion, in which "Kings will be its nurſing fathers, and Queens its nurſing mothers," directing all their powers that way.</p>
            <p>From this view of the duties of Rulers, however curſory and imperfect, we yet infer thoſe of the People.</p>
            <p>If our Rulers govern us in love and wiſdom, by good laws, truly executed, and attend to our peace, and guard againſt the calamities of war; if they light the lamps of ſcience, virtue and religion, and keep them burning, we ſhould rejoice in their light, and ſay, "Bleſſed be you, and bleſſed be your fidelity, and bleſſed be GOD." Such a government is an eminent inſtrument to reſtrain the exceſſes of bad men, and to defend the good. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances had never been given, who could form an <hi>idea</hi> of thoſe crying enormities and tranſcendent cruelties, into which men would run, unreſtrained by an efficient and juſt government? But were men, for any length of time, to "do what is right in their own eyes," we could ſurely <hi>expect</hi> "no peace to him that goeth out, or to him that cometh in." To reſtrain lawleſs men, and prevent the eruption of conceived miſchief, is one grand deſign and happy effect of government. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome men, and good judges too, this is a <hi>principal</hi> end of all civil authority. This is an engine in the hands of GOD, by which he prevents ſuch a del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uge of inhuman and ungodly deeds, as would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe make the world a more complete bedlam, than ever yet it has been. Now the righteous have <hi>ſome</hi> tranquillity; otherwiſe "their ſouls would be vexed from day to day by the converſation and deeds of the wicked:" And they would, probably, be ſo diſtreſſed as to "rejoice exceedingly, and be glad to find the grave."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:035317_0017_10022BB2CCBBE728"/>
How <hi>thankful</hi> then ſhould we be for an efficient and juſt government! And how much ſhould we prize and honour the Light of our Iſrael, and pay <hi>tribute</hi> to gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment gladly! For is not <hi>that</hi> the ſecurity, not only of our farms and merchandize, but of our liberty and lives? And we ſhould <hi>obey</hi> them from the united prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of intereſt and religion. The voice of inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the People, even under infidel Rulers, is, "Submit yourſelves to every ordinance of man for the LORD's ſake: for ſo is the will of GOD, that with well-doing ye may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men." With what irreſiſtible motives is this obedience preſſed on us, whoſe Rulers are Chriſtians, and whoſe "Nobles are of ourſelves; and whoſe Governor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the midſt of us;" and by our own glad choice too! I am not ſurely pleading for "paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and non-reſiſtance;" but for a rational and eaſy obedience to a government of our own, and Rulers of our own.</p>
            <p>"But if our Rulers will not pleaſe us, and guide the political ſhip according to our <hi>better</hi> judgment, muſt we preſs our lips cloſe, nor dare condemn a mal-adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration?" Let us <hi>firſt</hi> be ſure this is the caſe; and then uſe peaceful modes of obtaining <hi>redreſs.</hi> If need be, let us not again chooſe ſuch Rulers. And, while we examine public meaſures with entire freedom, let us avoid all bad temper, and a deſire to find fault. Let us ſhun that <hi>jealouſy,</hi> which is a baneful excreſcence of envy and diſcontent; otherwiſe we may be hurried by a "trifle light as air" to cenſure the beſt meaſures of the beſt man; whoſe wiſdom, integrity and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm have been proved and honoured a thouſand times. And let us not be "unſtable as water," car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about by every wind of "ſeditious doctrine." Let us be candid and quiet till there is a cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. For, under government, have we not the moſt forcible call to this, and the beſt <hi>means</hi> of "leading quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty?" SOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OMON's
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035317_0018_10022BB950682260"/>
advice was once good: "My ſon, fear the LORD and the King, and meddle not with thoſe that are given to change."</p>
            <p>It is ſurely our reproach, if we are ever ready to complain of government, and to fret under <hi>every</hi> duty, as if a ſtrange and oppreſſive thing had happened to us. We have proſpered, above other People, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a mild and equitable government; and ſhall we be peeviſh and ever uneaſy with it? This is beneath the wiſdom and magnanimity of free men. It is too much like fretful children, who cannot be pleaſed by all the tenderneſs of their too indulgent parents. At this time it peculiarly becomes us to be the friends of government, and the ſupport of our Rulers. Let us not make their cares heavier, when the defence and happineſs of our common country call for all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and the moſt ſteady exertions. And, in the room of complaints and murmurs, let us bleſs GOD for good governments; and that we may well <hi>hope</hi> we ſhall yet be continued free from oppreſſion and deſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm on the one hand; and on the other, from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible effects of anarchy and unbounded licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Indeed, we can hardly ſet bounds to our national <hi>hopes,</hi> if we will but honeſtly and generally ſeek the public weal, acting well in our ſeveral ſtations. No doubt there are real difficulties and obſtructions in the way. But what nation was ever free from them?</p>
            <p>Let us mention ſome of the principal ones, and then ſee if we cannot raiſe an hopeful proſpect of national happineſs, notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>Some perſons are very jealous, that our Rulers will become <hi>deſpotic;</hi> and that they are actually taking the previous ſteps. But will not theſe pains be removed as ſoon as they realize the checks and balances of our governments; the circumſtances of our Rulers as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame with their own; and the change and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of their elections?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:035317_0019_10022BBC48E15C78"/>
A ſpirit of <hi>licentiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>anarchy,</hi> ſo much ſpread among us, is another enemy to public happineſs. But was not this to be expected, for a time, in ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this, and in our circumſtances? Having dearly bought our liberty, and poſſeſſed the precious boon, it was natural to expect, that many would run wild with the idea, and not ſuddenly diſtinguiſh between govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental liberty, and licentiouſneſs. But are we not coming to our ſenſes, and regarding this diſtinction more and more? And as we grow cool, and increaſe in knowledge, and experience the bleſſings of good government, ſhall we not ſoon, and generally, drop this abuſe of liberty, and be willing to be happy? Let all good patriots and intelligent men teach their connexions this wiſdom, and join in advancing political information and ſolid virtue. Thus, we may hope, the People will ſee their real intereſts, and avoid a reſtleſs and ſeditious ſpirit, which is its own tormentor.</p>
            <p>The <hi>abuſe of religious liberty,</hi> it is granted, is another obſtruction of public proſperity. This liberty is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious part of our ſingular privileges. It ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to promote love and good works: Theſe are its ſweet effects, when guided by wiſdom and piety. But when it is made "an occaſion to the fleſh," an inſtrument of miſchief, it becomes an engine fatal to the beſt pleaſures and bleſſings of ſociety. Has it not thus opened a door to infidelity, and the corruption of Chriſtian doctrines, worſhip and manners? It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have led the way to injurious diviſions and angry ſeparations among Chriſtians, and much enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm. By theſe means the peace and edification of Churches have been greatly injured; and many places have probably been thus retarded in their deſires and purſuits of ſtated and faithful paſtors.</p>
            <p>I deſire not that men ſhould be deprived of the right of private judgment in religion. I would not wound the feelings of pious perſons, however weak and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but it is grievous to wiſe Chriſtians, to ſee ſouls
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035317_0020_10022BBF64F6E7E8"/>
turned from the truth to fables; from the ſimplicity that is in CHRIST, to human fancies; from pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, to its fatal counterfeit.</p>
            <p>But has not this evil always taken place in times of civil commotions and revolutions? And, may we not hope, that time and conſideration will remove it? We have the happieſt means of knowing true religion from all its counterfeits. We have colleges, academies and ſchools, deſigned to promote general information and religious ſcience. We have many excellent teachers in the Chriſtian Miniſtry, workmen who need not to be aſhamed. Under ſuch eminent means of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let us cheerfully hope the time will ſoon come when ſeducers and novices in divinity ſhall be eaſily diſcovered and diſcarded; when the peace of the Churches ſhall be prized and maintained; and the ſolid virtue and piety of <hi>Holy Writ</hi> be preferred to ſuperſtition and enthuſiaſm. Let us all duly eſteem and improve a learned, faithful and pious Miniſtry; and acquaint ourſelves fully with the ſcriptural marks and arts of ſeducers, and avoid them. Let great care be taken in the introduction of men into the Goſpel Miniſtry; and let the peace and order of the Churches be ſacredly regarded, and ſuch as would break them be ſhunned. And who can tell how ſoon the abuſe of religious liberty, with all its ruinous effects, ſhall give way to the increaſe of love and peace, regularity and holineſs?</p>
            <p>We have alſo too much reaſon to believe, <hi>foreign intrigue</hi> has done much to divide us as a nation, and obſtruct the public weal. We have, indeed, great reaſon to believe, that this has been a capital machine, employed againſt our peace; a principal wedge, driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with ſtrong and repeated blows, to ſplit us into pieces, to the ruin of our happy Union. An excellent and patriotic writer of our own has made this matter plain; "The bleſſings of good government," ſays he, "have been moſt imminently and immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered

               <hi>Gratitude</hi> is an amiable virtue; but when we ſee with open eyes, that it has been ignorantly directed to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035317_0022_10022BC7C1A8AAD8"/>
a foreign nation, we ſhall exchange it for <hi>juſtice</hi> to ourſelves. Converts, of this happy ſort, are daily made; and, for the honour of <hi>America,</hi> we will hope and believe, their number will be enlarged; and that our union, patriotiſm and firmneſs will render our name excellent in the earth.</p>
            <p>We only add; <hi>a ſpirit of infidelity, immorality and ungodlineſs,</hi> ſpreading among us, is another obſtruction of the public welfare, and an enemy to it. But, for our comfort, we ſay, neither is this of our <hi>own ſoil,</hi> but a foreign production. The laborious and critical author, before cited, hath ſaid, "The Philoſophiſts and Revolutioniſts of <hi>France</hi> appear to have acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the maxim of THOMAS PAINE, 'that <hi>an army of principles</hi> will penetrate where an army of ſoldiers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. It is neither the Rhine (he ſays) the Channel, nor the <hi>Ocean,</hi> that can arreſt its progreſs. It will march to the horizon of the world, and it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.' In conformity to this maxim, that infamous book, ſtyled, <hi>The Age of Reaſon,</hi> was written in France (and, it is ſaid, in the houſe and under the patronage of Mr. MUNROE) printed there in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and a cargo of 15,000 copies, at one time, ſent into theſe <hi>United States,</hi> and diſpoſed of by ſale at a cheap rate, or given away. Beſides theſe imported copies, numerous editions of the ſame work (ſhame on our country!) have been printed here. The effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the extenſive circulation of theſe books, and others of the ſame caſt and tendency, in the evident ſpread of infidel and atheiſtical principles, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent deterioration of morals, evince that theſe Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of <hi>Illuminatiſm</hi> have not been unſucceſsful in their labours."</p>
            <p>It thus appears, we muſt allow, that <hi>we were too ready</hi> to receive the fatal plant, and to cheriſh it. But will a People, always uſed to reverence the GOD of Heaven, and among whom many pious ſouls remain, long be guilty of this madneſs? Rather let us hope,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035317_0023_10022BCC5AD78D30"/>
that, in an exchange of circumſtances, we ſhall, through grace, come to ourſelves; honour the GOD of our Fathers; and confeſs, with deep contrition, that we have erred, and played the fool exceedingly.</p>
            <p>Theſe are our diſeaſes. Let us hope, through GOD, they are curable; leſt we mourn, in accents of untried ſorrow, "Is there no balm in <hi>Gilead?</hi> No Phyſician there? Why then is not the health of the People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered?"</p>
            <p>We will ſpend a few moments, however, in viewing the brighter ſide of our proſpects; that we may raiſe our hopes ſtill higher of the nation's proſperity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Providences of GOD</hi> to our Fathers, and to us, have been favourable, next to a miracle. Within our remembrance, he hath done great things for us; for which we ſhould be glad, and offer due praiſe. Our revolution turned up events ſo truly gracious, that the blind ſee, and the inconſiderate adore the hand of <hi>Him</hi> "who works in all, yet who alone ſeems not to work." And ſince that day his bleſſings have deſcended in ſhowers. If I be not deceived, never was there before a People ſo numerous and ſo well-informed as this, who had entire leiſure and full opportunity, and the moſt happy means of forming Conſtitutions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for themſelves, and then of receiving them, after the moſt mature deliberation. And our happineſs, under their adminiſtration, has ſurpaſſed even our own ſanguine expectations. And this has been the caſe, notwithſtanding the many and peculiar embarraſſments which have attended ſaid adminiſtration. Never, it ſeems, was there before a young Republic ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly harraſſed in the management of its affairs. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal honour to our firm and patriotic Rulers, who have borne the burden and heat of the day. Some, better informed than myſelf, think their vigorous and firm meaſures have ſaved the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> itſelf from ſhipwreck! If ſo, what thanks are due to them, and to GOD! And what joyful hopes ariſe from hence, of our future felicity!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:035317_0024_1001FC679FE93080"/>
Bleſſed be GOD, <hi>our preſent circumſtances are ſo good and promiſing!</hi> Hitherto hath the LORD ſaved us, in the midſt of great and preſſing trials. We hope he will yet ſave us. While the State Governments, ſo generally, move happily in their reſpective ſtations, the Federal one, like the ſun in the centre of its ſyſtem, gives light and ſtrength, union and ſtability to them all. And the nation appears to be emerging from the darkneſs of trouble to the light of joy and independent felicity. A ſpirit of patriotiſm and zeal for government, have become general. A ſenſe of the public weal, as depending on <hi>ourſelves,</hi> and not on any <hi>other nation,</hi> has nobly ſpread and honoured the union. The firm and truly <hi>American</hi> ſpirit of this great Commonwealth, is a joyful conſideration. And the preſervation of the life, and eminent uſefulneſs of the PRESIDENT of the Union, and the appearance of a WASHINGTON once more at the head of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, are matters of profound gratitude to JEHOVAH, and of high joy and hope to us. Being myſelf an American, and loving the happineſs and honour of my country, I cannot eaſily omit, in this place, an eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, laconic and tranſcendant, ſaid to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by a foreigner on theſe two great Perſonages of <hi>America.</hi> A gentleman ſaid to his friend, with much ſeriouſneſs, "Do you believe there is a man on earth really poſſeſſed of all thoſe excellencies which are aſcribed to <hi>Preſident WASHINGTON?</hi>" "I never did till I ſaw <hi>JOHN ADAMS.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſimilar facts, juſtly raiſe our hopes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional felicity, and waft our thoughts forward on the wings of delightful anticipation. Many things, to the ſame purpoſe, might be added; we might enlarge on the ſituation, richneſs and reſources of this favoured country; the vigour and firmneſs with which our means of defence have been adopted, and the ſucceſs crowning them &amp;c. but I dare preſume no further on the patience of this honoured aſſembly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:035317_0025_10022A8944304018"/>
Let us then, in our ſeveral ſpheres, be animated in our duty. Let the People ſtudy to be quiet, and to do their own buſineſs; fear GOD, and honour Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and meddle not with them who are given to change. Let our Rulers prove themſelves the light of our Iſrael. Let theſe, and the Miniſters of Religion, act in ſweet agreement; let them look on each other with a benevolent eye, not mixing their powers and their intereſts with unjuſt or oppreſſive views; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibing a ſpirit of love and eſteem mutually; and aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other in the great and godlike deſign of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an happy nation. So will the LORD fulfil all our deſires, leading his choſen people by the hands of MOSES and AARON.</p>
            <p>If any thing has been delivered, unſuitable to this important and joyful occaſion, or injurious to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic weal, the candour of this intelligent audience will cover it. And may GOD bleſs a ſincere endeavour to ſerve my country, to fulfil my duty, and to aid the Redeemer's cauſe, ſo generally and ſo unhappily neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency will accept of our congratulations on the repeated ſuffrages of your country, by which you are again the firſt light of this part of our Iſrael. To pay you, Sir, an unmeaning or painful compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am not willing. But to rejoice in a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and approved in ſo exalted a ſtation, and whom an intelligent People have ſo often called to the Chief Seat of Government, is both my pleaſant duty and gratified ambition.</p>
            <p>It is our ſweet hope, that you will ſtill attend faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, with advice of <hi>Council,</hi> to the defence, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of your country. <hi>Their</hi> wiſdom and firmneſs, we truſt, will be a ſeaſonable aid to your Excellency. Your own judgment will naturally be confirmed by their's, enabling you to act with fuller ſatisfaction, and more animating hopes. That modeſty which attends
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035317_0026_10022A8DF0825D90"/>
merit will gladly receive concurring advice. And thus acting, you will do honour to yourſelf, and verify the remark of SOLOMON: "The words of wiſe men are heard in quiet, more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools."</p>
            <p>We preſume not to inſtruct your Excellency; but it is agreeable to our ſubject to ſay, you will tenderly love the People; pay a ſacred regard to the Conſtitution in your conduct; ſee that governmental proceedings are guided by wiſdom and juſtice; regard merit in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing men in office; ſeek the peace of the nation; and aid the progreſs of learning, virtue and religion. You will attend, Sir, to the removal of the cruel obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are thrown in the way of the public wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; and as readily improve the ſeaſons and means of advancing the proper and direct happineſs of the body. Your urbanity and moral virtues will eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve the general cauſe; as the manners of the great deſcend to the lower grades of men, and are caught with avidity. And as "a Chriſtian is the higheſt ſtyle of man," you, Sir, will ſhine with redoubled luſtre, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſincerely joined that to "His Excellency." With this mingled glory, Sir, we pray, that you may long be a light and a bleſſing on earth; and finally ſhine, as the ſun in the firmament, and as a ſtar for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>The Two Branches of the General Court receive our reſpect, and our cordial wiſhes for them, as men, and as Rulers. That part of them, who have long ſerved their country, and honoured their ſtations, deſerve our thanks; as they receive the approbation of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents in a light the moſt unequivocal in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated elections. May the elections of the day be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to with that deliberation, wiſdom and regard to merit, which the importance of the matter demands. As affairs of great moment may come before you in the courſe of the year, we pray GOD to give you that
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035317_0027_10022A926FAB4EE0"/>
knowledge, integrity and firmneſs, which will render you equal to them. And as real worth is proved in arduous and trying ſervices, and ſhines the more, we truſt you will be prepared to manifeſt that worth, ſhould the trial come. The poſt of honour is often the poſt of danger. Let your genuine patriotiſm, and your reſolution in duty, make you equal to every trial.</p>
            <p>Be united in your <hi>love</hi> of the country, that, with the more eaſe you may be united alſo in the <hi>means</hi> of its preſervation and happineſs. Put on candour and patience in your deliberations; and let no partial views bias your judgments, or corrupt your affections. And let me ſay, with the faireſt intention, and with all due reſpect, "Take heed, Honoured Fathers, that ye fall not out by the way." "A kingdom divided againſt itſelf cannot ſtand." You will do all in your power to prevent ſuch ruin.</p>
            <p>The times are difficult. A good old Miniſter of this country in ſuch a day, made this caution the ground of a public diſcourſe: "When we do not know what to do, we ſhould be careful not to do we know not what." Your knowledge and prudence, I hope, will ſave you always from ſuch raſhneſs. Many cauſes, and ſome of them forcible, have perplexed and divided the minds of good citizens in their ideas of government and politics. It will be your duty and honour to ſee through thoſe things which grieve and divide others; and by a conduct uniformly wiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional and benevolent, to open their eyes; and thus to convince them alſo, that our government and adminiſtration are, as they ought to be, eminently for the good of the People; and that there is a mighty difference between government, and no government; between a good one, and a corrupt one; and between their real friends, and inſidious foes. By ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct may you greatly ſerve the State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:035317_0028_10022A96B7028CD0"/>
And may this government, and every State govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo concur with a wiſe, firm and righteous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Federal Government, as that the Union ſhall be ſafely guided through its preſent ſea of perplexity and fear, to the haven of entire peace with itſelf. And may this internal peace be accompanied with peace abroad, and not diſturbed with foreign wars or foreign politics. And we alſo pray, that, on their own account, all the nations of <hi>Europe</hi> may be guided to an equitable and laſting peace; in which the peace of Zion, and the welfare of mankind may alſo be great and laſting. In all your efforts to ſhine, and be uſeful in your high ſtations, may GOD guide you by unerring wiſdom, and crown them with the deſired ſucceſs. And all the people who are wiſe and good, will receive your ſervices with gratitude; and, for your ſakes, as well as their own, they will pray, that the light of Iſrael may not be quenched. May you all be faithful in a few things, and finally be made Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers over many things, and be welcomed to your Great Maſter's joy.</p>
            <p>A principle of piety is ſo eſſential to the diſcharge of all relative duties, as well as all others, that I ſhall be juſtified in cloſing this diſcourſe by an inculcation of it.</p>
            <p>Men and Brethren, whether Rulers or ruled, we have all a part to act in this ſhort life, of importance, beyond all conception great. A future and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſcene awaits us; full of joy and glory on the one hand, and of ſhame and contempt on the other. We ſhall eſcape the latter and obtain the former, if the grace which bringeth ſalvation teach us to deny ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the preſent world. Thus ſerving GOD, and our generation by the will of GOD, we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the end of our courſe, the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of our ſouls.</p>
            <p>The worth of <hi>this</hi> is learned by <hi>one</hi> conſideration, taken by itſelf, without addition. The Miniſters,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035317_0029_10022A9D8445D770"/>
whom GOD hath provided for human happineſs, and for <hi>this</hi> eminently, afford this inſtruction. The great <hi>REDEEMER</hi> came into the world as our ſervant; "not to be miniſtered unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſom for many." The <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven are ſent forth to "miniſter to the heirs of ſalvation." <hi>Chriſtian Rulers,</hi> are "miniſters of GOD to us for good." The <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel</hi> are, in a peculiar ſenſe, "our ſervants for JESUS' ſake." They are the gift of our aſcended Head, appointed and continued "for the perfecting of the ſaints, for the work of the Miniſtry, and the edifying of the body of CHRIST, till we come to the ſtature of perfect men." To render this Miniſtry thus glorious and ſucceſsful, the <hi>HOLY SPIRIT</hi> is alſo ſent into the world. In this view he is, in the higheſt ſenſe, a Miniſter of GOD for our good. And as all Heaven is for us, rejoicing at the repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and ſalvation of one ſinner: So all Hell is againſt us, the prince of it, with his legions, walking about, ſeeking whom he may devour.</p>
            <p>If ſuch be the combat, and ſuch the combatants, what muſt the <hi>prize</hi> of the warfare be! <hi>Is our ſalvation of ſuch amazing import?</hi> Then let us ſo eſteem it! Let us adore the GOD who has made the wonderous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for it.</p>
            <p>What a creature is man, for whom the GOD of Heaven hath done ſo much! I do not know that we can think too highly of ourſelves, even in the depths of our humility, for our crimes.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Of human <hi>nature</hi> ne'er too high</l>
               <l>Are our ideas wrought;</l>
               <l>Of human <hi>merit</hi> ne'er too low</l>
               <l>Depreſs'd the daring thought."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Can we act agreeably to the dignity of this nature, and our future proſpects, unleſs we become the willing followers of CHRIST, the Light of our world, and the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035317_0030_10022AA15D4539A0"/>
Saviour of our ſouls? May his healing word dwell in us richly, and guide us in our duty to GOD, to ſociety, and to ourſelves, and make us harmleſs and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the children of GOD, without rebuke, ſhining as lights in the world. Then, with the aſſurance of hope, we may long for that day, in which the righteous ſhall ſhine as the ſun, in the kingdom of their Father.</p>
            <p>To that bleſſedneſs and glory may we all at laſt be brought, through JESUS CHRIST, our Divine Redeemer.</p>
