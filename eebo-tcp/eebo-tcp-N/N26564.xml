            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>II. SAMUEL, xxi. 17.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>THEN THE MEN OF DAVID SWARE UNTO HIM, SAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, THOU SHALT GO NO MORE OUT WITH US TO BATTLE, THAT THOU QUENCH NOT THE LIGHT OF ISRAEL.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>"TRULY light is Å¿weet, and a pleaÅ¿ant thing it is for the eyes to behold the Å¿un." This great Å¿ource of light was early formed by the Creator's hand. "He Å¿aw that it was good." It has ever Å¿ince been the beauty and the glory of its Å¿yÅ¿tem. Its moÅ¿t extenÅ¿ive beneficence is as neceÅ¿Å¿ary, as its Å¿plendor is illuÅ¿trious. It is eÅ¿Å¿ential to the gladneÅ¿s, the guidance, and the Å¿upport of the various inhabitants of the globe. It is peculiarly the life and the beauty of the vegetative cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. By this the enamelled meads are dreÅ¿Å¿ed in their richeÅ¿t robes, "Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿ing SOLOMON in all his glory."</p>
            <p>With great wiÅ¿dom then and propriety, did the men of IÅ¿rael uÅ¿e the delicate and Å¿trong figure of light,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035317_0005_10022B706871D608"/>
to give an idea of the Å¿plendor and benignity of their ruling Sovereign. The two principal ideas contained in this metaphor, are beams to <hi>guide,</hi> and rays to <hi>cheer;</hi> or, guidance and comfort. When applied to a juÅ¿t and good thing, it Å¿ignifies that he governs with <hi>wiÅ¿dom</hi> and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s; and to the joy and <hi>felicity</hi> of his Å¿ubjects. DAVID himÅ¿elf uÅ¿es the Å¿ame Å¿plendid figure, in the Å¿enÅ¿e of the text. "He that ruleth over men muÅ¿t be juÅ¿t, ruling in the fear of GOD; and he Å¿hall be as the light of the morning, when the Å¿un riÅ¿eth, even a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without clouds; as the tender graÅ¿s Å¿pringing out of the earth by clear Å¿hining after rain."</p>
            <p>The men of IÅ¿rael, wiÅ¿er than many in this day, duly appreciated the bleÅ¿Å¿ings of good government, and highly tendered the precious life of their Å¿overeign. They trembled at his perÅ¿onal danger. They blodly oppoÅ¿ed his deÅ¿ign of going to battle againÅ¿t his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Å¿on, and prevented his expoÅ¿ure of himÅ¿elf. They anÅ¿wered with all the fervor of love, and the firmneÅ¿s of patriotiÅ¿m: "Thou Å¿halt not go forth: For if we flee away, they will not care for us: Neither if half of us die, will they care for us: But thou art worth ten thouÅ¿and of us." What noble Å¿entiments are theÅ¿e! And what Å¿terling worth! It was for a like cauÅ¿e, and on a Å¿imilar occaÅ¿ion, that they Å¿pake the words of our text.</p>
            <p>DAVID had wearied himÅ¿elf in battle, and Å¿pent his Å¿trength. A gigantic foe Å¿aw his advantage, and had nearly improved it, and taken his life. ABISHAI, one of his Generals, poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of preÅ¿ence of mind, Å¿tepped in a moment between his prince and death; Å¿aved him from the hands of his huge antagoniÅ¿t, and gave the monÅ¿ter the fatal thruÅ¿t. On that great occaÅ¿ion, "his men," with equal reaÅ¿on, "Sware to him," Å¿aying, "Thou Å¿halt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of IÅ¿rael." How happy is Å¿uch a prince! How bleÅ¿Å¿ed is Å¿uch a People! Could I do any thing, which Å¿hould promote Å¿uch happineÅ¿s, I Å¿hould Å¿urely be happy too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:035317_0006_10022B774E4CFED8"/>
I Å¿uppoÅ¿e I Å¿hould do but little to this purpoÅ¿e, were I to Å¿pend time to prove that civil government is a neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ary inÅ¿titution, evident from the nature and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances of mankind; that it is agreeable to the will of the Supreme Ruler of the world; and that it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tered in Å¿uch a manner as to be of very various and extenÅ¿ive benefit to Å¿ociety. There is, I conceive, as little reaÅ¿on to induce me to Å¿how the comparative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and defects of the Å¿everal forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which different nations have adopted. By the help of all theÅ¿e, the union has formed conÅ¿titutions, perhaps, the moÅ¿t excellent and eligible of any yet thought of. To offer to our Rulers of this State, with modeÅ¿ty, and yet with zeal, Å¿ome plain directions for an happy adminiÅ¿tration of our public affairs, is the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s before us; with the reÅ¿ulting duties of the People.</p>
            <p>If Rulers would be the light and joy of the People, it is eÅ¿Å¿ential that they bear a kind and parental <hi>affection</hi> to them. This is a principle animating and perÅ¿evering, and eÅ¿Å¿ential to a joyful activity in duty. Civil Rulers are in a Å¿tation exalted and important. The conÅ¿equen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their conduct are of a very Å¿erious and weighty nature, deeply affecting the intereÅ¿ts of the community; while they are Å¿eeking the welfare of the People, affairs may come before them of a very perplexed and intricate nature, calling for their united wiÅ¿dom, probity and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. At the Å¿ame time, their unwearied and laboring Å¿ervices may not receive from the People that approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they merit. The beÅ¿t meaÅ¿ures of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tration may be diÅ¿approved and blamed, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ured as wrong; neither calculated, nor even deÅ¿igned for the public good.</p>
            <p>Under theÅ¿e and Å¿imilar circumÅ¿tances, how neceÅ¿Å¿ary is that love of the People, which flows from a regard to GOD, and chriÅ¿tian principles! Here Rulers muÅ¿t riÅ¿e above preÅ¿ent conÅ¿iderations, and act agreeably to their Å¿tations, and as accountable to GOD. They muÅ¿t view themÅ¿elves as the Fathers of the People appointed by
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035317_0007_10022B7F311DA778"/>
GOD, and reaÅ¿on to take care of their intereÅ¿ts, and promote their welfare; although they Å¿hould prove unthankful children, perverted by ignorant men; or Å¿uch as are reÅ¿tleÅ¿s, diÅ¿contented and Å¿editious. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are "miniÅ¿ters of GOD for good" to the People, they muÅ¿t attend to that very thing. And a Å¿incere aim to promote that, animated by benevolence, Å¿hould never be neglected a moment. A deÅ¿ire to be uÅ¿eful, and bleÅ¿s mankind, Å¿hould rule in the hearts of all; men poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ing the Å¿tation and influence of Rulers, Å¿hould greatly cheriÅ¿h it. They cannot rule us in the fear of GOD without it.</p>
            <p>But, animated by this, and guided by wiÅ¿dom, they will Å¿hine in their influence, as the Å¿un in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and enlighten and cheer all who have eyes to Å¿ee, and Å¿enÅ¿ibility to feel. And they may always hope this number will be large, notwithÅ¿tanding all the jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and uneaÅ¿y men, who grow up Å¿pontaneouÅ¿ly in free governments. Many will Å¿ay of Å¿uch Rulers, "They are the glory and Å¿tability of our times." Even in this day of jarring politics, we have Rulers of whom we Å¿ay, "Ye are worth ten thouÅ¿and of us." We have our NEHEMIAHS, for whom we pray, "LORD blot not out all their good deeds which they have done for thy people, and for the houÅ¿es of our GOD." We have our MORDECAI's, who are "great in the nation, and accepted of the multitude of their brethren, Å¿eeking the wealth of the People, and Å¿peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace to all their feed." All Rulers Å¿hould be like theÅ¿e, and become the light and gladneÅ¿s of the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great knowledge</hi> of the nature and duties of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is another part of that genial light, by which Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers Å¿hine, and give the People joy. This, with a connected and competent acquaintance with human nature, is eÅ¿Å¿ential, if they would rule with honor to themÅ¿elves, and advantage to the People. Should the People Å¿ee that they are ignorant, or neglectful, of the ConÅ¿titution, and the principal rules of adminiÅ¿tration,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035317_0008_10022B816F222980"/>
they would view them as a luminary under an eclipÅ¿e, Å¿hedding a tenebrious and portentous light. But, while they duly regard both theÅ¿e with a prudent reference to the genius and Å¿entiments of the People, they will Å¿hine with a pleaÅ¿ing and acceptable Å¿plendor. For while they wiÅ¿ely and faithfully attend to that ConÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which the united wiÅ¿dom and care of the whole People have formed and choÅ¿en, and which is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly adapted to the Å¿ecurity and promotion of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral welfare, how can the People complain? How can they refuÅ¿e either approbation, or gratitude? They muÅ¿t Å¿ee, that Å¿uch conduct Å¿ecures their liberties and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions; and in many ways renders the enjoyment of them greatly enhanced. Laws made by Å¿uch Rulers, muÅ¿t be, not only conÅ¿titutional, but wiÅ¿e and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ome. They muÅ¿t be agreeable to all good citizens; and offenÅ¿ive only to "the lawleÅ¿s and diÅ¿obedient," for whom they are eÅ¿pecially needful. Such rulers will Å¿hine in their orbits with bright and cheering rays. They muÅ¿t Å¿ee, in a thouÅ¿and inÅ¿tances, which people in the maÅ¿s overlook, Å¿uch meaÅ¿ures as will favour the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral welfare. They muÅ¿t be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to know the moÅ¿t equitable and eaÅ¿y way of levying taxes, the moÅ¿t wiÅ¿e and neceÅ¿Å¿ary laws, the moÅ¿t worthy and Å¿uitable men for all civil offices, the moÅ¿t eligible ways of promoting diÅ¿coveries and improvements in arts and Å¿ciences, and in the comforts and conveniencies of life; the moÅ¿t efficacious means of checking vice, and aiding virtue; and, in general, the beÅ¿t ways of promoting the public welfare. Such Rulers will be viewed by all the wiÅ¿e and good, as the Light and HappineÅ¿s of the People. And if one among them could be found alone to wiÅ¿h the light quenched, that the bleÅ¿Å¿ings of anarchy might Å¿ucceed, he alone would deÅ¿erve to have his choice, and to "be filled with his own ways."</p>
            <p>If Rulers would Å¿hine with a genial Å¿plendor, and give Å¿olid joy to the people, they muÅ¿t attend with much care to the <hi>Laws</hi> which they make to govern

them. The baÅ¿is of theÅ¿e Å¿hould ever be juÅ¿tice and mercy. TheÅ¿e virtues Å¿hould always be encouraged, and the oppoÅ¿ite vices checked. Rulers in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ign "are not a terror to good works, but to evil." And no good and quiet man Å¿hould be Å¿laviÅ¿hly "afraid of the power;" but aÅ¿Å¿ured, that, "doing well he Å¿hould have praiÅ¿e of the Å¿ame." JuÅ¿tice is, perhaps, the brighteÅ¿t gem in the crown of a Ruler. He Å¿hould ever be able to Å¿ay, "I put on righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, and it clothed me: and my judgment was a robe and a diadem." This Å¿hould be the robe of every MagiÅ¿trate, in every department of government. For how can a People be happy when this is not the caÅ¿e? If iniquity be framed by law, what will become of the peace and felicity of the People? And if the courÅ¿e of juÅ¿tice be Å¿topped among a People by the corruption or intimidation of the judicial powers, "where can the righteous Å¿eek redreÅ¿s?" And how can the guilty be made afraid? JuÅ¿tice is Å¿o eÅ¿Å¿ential to the welfare of communities!</p>
            <p>It is in itÅ¿elf an exalted and divine virtue. In this we peculiarly reÅ¿emble the Deity. AlmoÅ¿t all other virtues have a reference to ourÅ¿elves. This is gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and benevolent, extending to all mankind. GOD alone is juÅ¿t to perfection, and able to diÅ¿tribute it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and without defect. His omniÅ¿cience gives him the moÅ¿t complete view of all moral beings; and his almighty arm enables him to render to all according to their deeds.</p>
            <p>The nearer Civil Rulers (who are gods below) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Divine Model, the more truly are they the light of the People: And by a wiÅ¿e mixture of mercy and juÅ¿tice, in their adminiÅ¿trations, they reÅ¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Deity in that raviÅ¿hing glory which is Å¿een "in the face of JESUS CHRIST." Let our laws partake of theÅ¿e heavenly ingredients; and let them be truly and faithfully executed. On theÅ¿e two pillars hang all the wealth and quietneÅ¿s of the People. At leaÅ¿t they are
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035317_0010_10022B8F37A35110"/>
eÅ¿Å¿ential to their virtue and happineÅ¿s, their eaÅ¿e and tranquillity.</p>
            <p>Sumptuary and economical laws might aid the cauÅ¿e of virtue, and Å¿o far as the powers of government reach that way, they will be well employed to check a rage for extravagant diverÅ¿ions and amuÅ¿ements of all kinds. TheÅ¿e things are injurious to <hi>young</hi> Republics, and <hi>ChriÅ¿tian</hi> Republics. I am aware the Å¿ubject is delicate, and the Å¿pirit of the times backward to reÅ¿traint; yet we venture to Å¿ay, "A land of levity is a land of guilt." A People devoted to high-Å¿eaÅ¿oned pleaÅ¿ures, and Å¿howy diverÅ¿ions, improved by the flowers of eloquence, are apt to form romantic ideas of happineÅ¿s, to loÅ¿e a reliÅ¿h for the Å¿olid duties and comforts of life, and to contract a growing diÅ¿taÅ¿te to the better pleaÅ¿ures of virtue, and the elevating hopes of religion. We are apt in this way to "Å¿eek a Heaven below the Å¿kies," and to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that which is above. The natural effect is, a carnal and worldly temper. To oppoÅ¿e the Å¿teps which lead to this, and to remove the temptations to it, are labours worthy of all MiniÅ¿ters, civil or Å¿acred. Encouraging frugality, induÅ¿try and temperance in pleaÅ¿ure, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ing the oppoÅ¿ite evils, MagiÅ¿trates do well. In thus regarding juÅ¿tice and mercy, and Å¿eeking alÅ¿o the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of beneficial and virtuous habits of living, they will Å¿hine to approbation; and it will be the duty of the People to "lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineÅ¿s and honeÅ¿ty."</p>
            <p>If Rulers would be the light of the People, they muÅ¿t attend cloÅ¿ely to the <hi>characters</hi> of men whom they put into <hi>authority.</hi> Every man in office Å¿hould be poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of probity and firmneÅ¿s, and a friend to mankind and to righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s. The laws of a country may be wiÅ¿e and good; yet, when the actions of men are tried by them, they may be twiÅ¿ted and perverted, Å¿o that the innocent Å¿hall Å¿uffer, and the guilty be acquitted. The laws Å¿hall have "a meaning never meant," owing to Å¿ome vague expreÅ¿Å¿ions in the frame of them; or Å¿ome
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035317_0011_10022B93ECCA4B18"/>
other handle will be made uÅ¿e of to the Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e. Hence the importance of integrity in the judicial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments.</p>
            <p>Men in office, deÅ¿igned to keep the peace of Å¿oci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and promote juÅ¿tice and union among neighbours, may do eminent Å¿ervice, acting well, and keeping the end of their appointment in view. By adviÅ¿ing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to peace and friendÅ¿hip, and Å¿ometimes relaxing their fees, they may prevent much miÅ¿chief, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote much happineÅ¿s. All "our officers Å¿hould be peace, and our exactors righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s;" that "our peace may be as a river." "RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s exalteth a nation." It tends to happineÅ¿s, and procures the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of GOD, "which maketh rich." "When he giveth quietneÅ¿s who then can make trouble? And when he hideth his face who then can behold him? Whether it be done againÅ¿t a nation, or againÅ¿t a man only." Righteous men in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Å¿hine and allure to right conduct by their example. Under them government is beloved and honoured. BeÅ¿ide, when it is well known that government is juÅ¿t, and that unworthy men are excluded from poÅ¿ts of honour and profit, this very thing will be an incentive to a fair and good character. And men ever known to have been Å¿elfiÅ¿h, and never to have Å¿erved the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿ts of Å¿ociety, will be afraid to be candidates for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant offices. The idea of diÅ¿appointment will check them; and they will dread to have their characters held up to public view, leÅ¿t they Å¿hould become doubly Å¿candalous to them. This care to fill offices with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, will then turn out greatly advantageous to the public: For good men alÅ¿o would as readily come forward, in this caÅ¿e, as the baÅ¿e would hide themÅ¿elves.</p>
            <p>In order to prove that the Deity is on the Å¿ide of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and that it will finally prevail, an eminent author has <hi>Å¿uppoÅ¿ed</hi> a nation to be wholly righteous. The fame, the nature and the government of this nation, are <hi>imagined</hi> to make it the greateÅ¿t and the moÅ¿t hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py nation on earth. One Å¿tep, and an important one
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035317_0012_10022B9C50CF11F0"/>
towards this Å¿ingular felicity of a people, would be an excluÅ¿ive introduction of worthy men into places of authority.</p>
            <p>SenÅ¿ible of this, even the unenlightened PHARAOH was wholly influenced by it in the choice of a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant officer. He Å¿aid to his Å¿ervants, "Can we find Å¿uch a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of GOD is?" on which ROLLIN makes this good reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: "In talking thus he entirely reformed a falÅ¿e policy, which conÅ¿iders virtue and religion as unÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in the government of a State, and finds an exact probity too great a check upon its views and projects. This Å¿tupid impiety is expoÅ¿ed to eternal Å¿hame by an infidel King. He is convinced that the more of the Spirit of GOD a MiniÅ¿ter has, the more capable he is of governing a kingdom. And the leaÅ¿t attention Å¿uffices to diÅ¿cover, that the oppoÅ¿ite principle flows from the utter want of human underÅ¿tanding."</p>
            <p>When therefore, in any government, the vileÅ¿t men may riÅ¿e, either by Å¿ervility or Å¿econdary influence, we may Å¿ay, there is a radical defect in adminiÅ¿tration. So far Å¿uch a government is reduced to infamy and miÅ¿ery.</p>
            <p>And as, in our happy country, the People poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s the privilege of chooÅ¿ing their Rulers, in the firÅ¿t inÅ¿tance it is of mighty importance that they Å¿hould have that knowledge and that virtue which will enable them to make a juÅ¿t and wiÅ¿e uÅ¿e of it. To this end the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿e of virtue and general knowledge, is greatly to be deÅ¿ired and promoted. For what is a Free Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and what is it Å¿oon like to be, without its eÅ¿Å¿ential pillars? Even Å¿ince the days of our independence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a People never had greater privileges, or made more rapid Å¿trides in proÅ¿perity, it has coÅ¿t the nation large Å¿ums to quell inÅ¿urrections and rebellions. But, could theÅ¿e have riÅ¿en, had the nation poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed a due Å¿hare of knowledge and virtue? Let us all then exert
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035317_0013_10022BA1414E07B8"/>
ourÅ¿elves to promote theÅ¿e; and let no man riÅ¿e to poÅ¿ts of honour without them. For,
<q>
                  <l>When impious men bear Å¿way,</l>
                  <l>The poÅ¿t of honour is the private Å¿tation.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But this will not be the only misfortune of Å¿uch men bearing Å¿way. The body will receive detriment, and in more ways than one. The national intereÅ¿ts will be neglected; merit will be diÅ¿couraged, and vile men will rejoice, and do miÅ¿chief without fear.</p>
            <p>As the light and Å¿upport of the People, Rulers muÅ¿t defend them in their enjoyments, by keeping <hi>peace</hi> at home and abroad, as far as may be.</p>
            <p>In this weighty buÅ¿ineÅ¿s, I confeÅ¿s, more wiÅ¿dom is required, than I have any claim to; but that internal and external peace is a bleÅ¿Å¿ing of the firÅ¿t magnitude, and accordingly to be Å¿ought, no one will deny.</p>
            <p>To Å¿ecure it at <hi>home,</hi> and to promote all the bleÅ¿Å¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to which it is favourable, is the duty of Rulers; and if theÅ¿e ends can be obtained by the wiÅ¿e and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct of government, it will be happy. And, in general, we may hope for this. But if unreaÅ¿onable men will, notwithÅ¿tanding, riÅ¿e up againÅ¿t the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diÅ¿turb the public peace, <hi>force</hi> is then juÅ¿tly reÅ¿orted to.</p>
            <p>To Å¿ecure us from <hi>foreign wars,</hi> it is plainly the duty of Rulers to be juÅ¿t in their conduct towards the other nations with whom they have connexions. And if miÅ¿underÅ¿tanding take place between us and any Å¿uch nation, it Å¿eems truly juÅ¿t and wiÅ¿e, and a part of commendable policy, to try the event of upright and honorable negociation. And the importance of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting an open rupture with Å¿uch a nation may be Å¿o great as to juÅ¿tify all the Å¿teps of an amicable and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿evering</hi> negociation. Such Å¿teps will vindicate our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character in the eyes of all nations; bring down the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of GOD upon us; fill the people with love to government, and animate them firmly to defend
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035317_0014_10022BA5162CE528"/>
their country againÅ¿t the hoÅ¿tile attempts of Å¿uch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when negociation Å¿hall have proved inefficient.</p>
            <p>We rejoice and bleÅ¿s GOD, that the conduct of our Rulers, to keep peace at home and abroad, is the exact reÅ¿emblance of all that we have Å¿aid.</p>
            <p>As the calamities of war are devoutly to be depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; Å¿o we pray GOD, that the meaÅ¿ures taken for our juÅ¿t defence may turn out, under a benign Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the prevention of them. And as this is the aim and good deÅ¿ign of our Rulers; Å¿o, I doubt not, they cordially approve of the Å¿pirit of that prayer which was offered by a great prince and warrior after a deciÅ¿ive battle:
<q>
                  <l>Make wars, O LORD, by wars to ceaÅ¿e;</l>
                  <l>And let this conqueÅ¿t lead to peace.</l>
               </q>
But Å¿hould we, after all, be called to put the harneÅ¿s on, the <hi>juÅ¿tice</hi> of our cauÅ¿e would lead us to hope in that GOD who has ever been "the hope of our IÅ¿rael and the Saviour of it in times of trouble."</p>
            <p>I only add, rulers will be eminently the light of the people by aiding the cauÅ¿e and promotion of <hi>learning, virtue</hi> and <hi>religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e are Å¿o eÅ¿Å¿ential to the real and laÅ¿ting welfare of the body, and have been Å¿o truly the glory of our country, that our civil heads cannot promote or eÅ¿teem them to exceÅ¿s. To encourage, and Å¿till maintain, Å¿chools for youth, is, doubtleÅ¿s, one good means of anÅ¿wering theÅ¿e great purpoÅ¿es. And here we may alÅ¿o reckon the encouragement of uÅ¿eful <hi>diÅ¿coveries</hi> and <hi>inventions.</hi> And if they can do any thing by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or example, to bring into a more juÅ¿t eÅ¿teem, a learned and pious <hi>ChriÅ¿tian MiniÅ¿try,</hi> the times too lou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dly call for it. People are Å¿adly indifferent, in many places, or even averÅ¿e to the Å¿ettlement and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Å¿uch paÅ¿tors. With large numbers, the peace, the order, the union and edification of the churches of CHRIST, are Å¿mall things; and the increaÅ¿e of infidelity, or vain and imported philoÅ¿ophy, on the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035317_0015_10022BAA133F0850"/>
one hand, and of diÅ¿order in churches, and angry Å¿ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arations and deluÅ¿ions, on the other, calls aloud to our Zion. With me, theÅ¿e are the moÅ¿t portentous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the day. If any men, or order of men, can be the happy inÅ¿truments of promoting more light and love among ChriÅ¿tians, they will be eminently honoured of GOD, and equally dear to the friends of CHRIST's peaceful kingdom.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>UniverÅ¿ity,</hi> which has given Å¿o many ornaments and bleÅ¿Å¿ings both to Church and State, will receive the foÅ¿tering care of our Civil Fathers.</p>
            <p>And as they profeÅ¿s the religion of CHRIST, we hope with the greater confidence, that they will eÅ¿teem its heavenly doctrines, and obÅ¿erve its pure precepts, and be lovely examples of Å¿o divine a religion, in all their private deportment.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Rulers,</hi> they will act for CHRIST, who has raiÅ¿ed them to Å¿eats of dignity; and who poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es "all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in heaven and earth." As they can Å¿erve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity <hi>Å¿o well</hi> in no other way, in honouring relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, this duty will be obvious to them. And as the works of <hi>Providence,</hi> in all ages, are deÅ¿igned to promote the Redeemer's kingdom and the Å¿alvation of Å¿ouls, we all, and Rulers eminently, Å¿hould concur in that beÅ¿t deÅ¿ign.</p>
            <p>And, as <hi>ChriÅ¿tians,</hi> they may, perhaps, advance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as much by their <hi>private life and example,</hi> as by bending all the power of their governmental Å¿tations that way. By firmly believing the inÅ¿piration of the Å¿acred books, and defending it by its own Å¿tanding and convincing evidence; by honouring and comforting the MiniÅ¿ters of CHRIST, many of whom want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; by attending public worÅ¿hip, and revering our holy Sabbaths; by manifeÅ¿ting the pure and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent temper of the GoÅ¿pel in their daily life; by promoting the peace, union and edification of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pective Churches to which they belong; and by diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing all looÅ¿e principles and practices, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035317_0016_10022BAE1ADC82B8"/>
encouraging things oppoÅ¿ite, they may do much to aid the beÅ¿t cauÅ¿e in the world, and "to Å¿trengthen the things of religion which remain, and are ready to die." Behaving thus gloriouÅ¿ly, they will be the light of our IÅ¿rael, and remind us with joy of that better day of Zion, in which "Kings will be its nurÅ¿ing fathers, and Queens its nurÅ¿ing mothers," directing all their powers that way.</p>
            <p>From this view of the duties of Rulers, however curÅ¿ory and imperfect, we yet infer thoÅ¿e of the People.</p>
            <p>If our Rulers govern us in love and wiÅ¿dom, by good laws, truly executed, and attend to our peace, and guard againÅ¿t the calamities of war; if they light the lamps of Å¿cience, virtue and religion, and keep them burning, we Å¿hould rejoice in their light, and Å¿ay, "BleÅ¿Å¿ed be you, and bleÅ¿Å¿ed be your fidelity, and bleÅ¿Å¿ed be GOD." Such a government is an eminent inÅ¿trument to reÅ¿train the exceÅ¿Å¿es of bad men, and to defend the good. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances had never been given, who could form an <hi>idea</hi> of thoÅ¿e crying enormities and tranÅ¿cendent cruelties, into which men would run, unreÅ¿trained by an efficient and juÅ¿t government? But were men, for any length of time, to "do what is right in their own eyes," we could Å¿urely <hi>expect</hi> "no peace to him that goeth out, or to him that cometh in." To reÅ¿train lawleÅ¿s men, and prevent the eruption of conceived miÅ¿chief, is one grand deÅ¿ign and happy effect of government. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Å¿ome men, and good judges too, this is a <hi>principal</hi> end of all civil authority. This is an engine in the hands of GOD, by which he prevents Å¿uch a del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uge of inhuman and ungodly deeds, as would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiÅ¿e make the world a more complete bedlam, than ever yet it has been. Now the righteous have <hi>Å¿ome</hi> tranquillity; otherwiÅ¿e "their Å¿ouls would be vexed from day to day by the converÅ¿ation and deeds of the wicked:" And they would, probably, be Å¿o diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed as to "rejoice exceedingly, and be glad to find the grave."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:035317_0017_10022BB2CCBBE728"/>
How <hi>thankful</hi> then Å¿hould we be for an efficient and juÅ¿t government! And how much Å¿hould we prize and honour the Light of our IÅ¿rael, and pay <hi>tribute</hi> to gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment gladly! For is not <hi>that</hi> the Å¿ecurity, not only of our farms and merchandize, but of our liberty and lives? And we Å¿hould <hi>obey</hi> them from the united prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of intereÅ¿t and religion. The voice of inÅ¿pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the People, even under infidel Rulers, is, "Submit yourÅ¿elves to every ordinance of man for the LORD's Å¿ake: for Å¿o is the will of GOD, that with well-doing ye may put to Å¿ilence the ignorance of fooliÅ¿h men." With what irreÅ¿iÅ¿tible motives is this obedience preÅ¿Å¿ed on us, whoÅ¿e Rulers are ChriÅ¿tians, and whoÅ¿e "Nobles are of ourÅ¿elves; and whoÅ¿e Governor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the midÅ¿t of us;" and by our own glad choice too! I am not Å¿urely pleading for "paÅ¿Å¿ive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and non-reÅ¿iÅ¿tance;" but for a rational and eaÅ¿y obedience to a government of our own, and Rulers of our own.</p>
            <p>"But if our Rulers will not pleaÅ¿e us, and guide the political Å¿hip according to our <hi>better</hi> judgment, muÅ¿t we preÅ¿s our lips cloÅ¿e, nor dare condemn a mal-adminiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration?" Let us <hi>firÅ¿t</hi> be Å¿ure this is the caÅ¿e; and then uÅ¿e peaceful modes of obtaining <hi>redreÅ¿s.</hi> If need be, let us not again chooÅ¿e Å¿uch Rulers. And, while we examine public meaÅ¿ures with entire freedom, let us avoid all bad temper, and a deÅ¿ire to find fault. Let us Å¿hun that <hi>jealouÅ¿y,</hi> which is a baneful excreÅ¿cence of envy and diÅ¿content; otherwiÅ¿e we may be hurried by a "trifle light as air" to cenÅ¿ure the beÅ¿t meaÅ¿ures of the beÅ¿t man; whoÅ¿e wiÅ¿dom, integrity and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiÅ¿m have been proved and honoured a thouÅ¿and times. And let us not be "unÅ¿table as water," car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about by every wind of "Å¿editious doctrine." Let us be candid and quiet till there is a cauÅ¿e of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. For, under government, have we not the moÅ¿t forcible call to this, and the beÅ¿t <hi>means</hi> of "leading quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineÅ¿s and honeÅ¿ty?" SOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OMON's
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035317_0018_10022BB950682260"/>
advice was once good: "My Å¿on, fear the LORD and the King, and meddle not with thoÅ¿e that are given to change."</p>
            <p>It is Å¿urely our reproach, if we are ever ready to complain of government, and to fret under <hi>every</hi> duty, as if a Å¿trange and oppreÅ¿Å¿ive thing had happened to us. We have proÅ¿pered, above other People, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a mild and equitable government; and Å¿hall we be peeviÅ¿h and ever uneaÅ¿y with it? This is beneath the wiÅ¿dom and magnanimity of free men. It is too much like fretful children, who cannot be pleaÅ¿ed by all the tenderneÅ¿s of their too indulgent parents. At this time it peculiarly becomes us to be the friends of government, and the Å¿upport of our Rulers. Let us not make their cares heavier, when the defence and happineÅ¿s of our common country call for all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and the moÅ¿t Å¿teady exertions. And, in the room of complaints and murmurs, let us bleÅ¿s GOD for good governments; and that we may well <hi>hope</hi> we Å¿hall yet be continued free from oppreÅ¿Å¿ion and deÅ¿pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿m on the one hand; and on the other, from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible effects of anarchy and unbounded licentiouÅ¿neÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>Indeed, we can hardly Å¿et bounds to our national <hi>hopes,</hi> if we will but honeÅ¿tly and generally Å¿eek the public weal, acting well in our Å¿everal Å¿tations. No doubt there are real difficulties and obÅ¿tructions in the way. But what nation was ever free from them?</p>
            <p>Let us mention Å¿ome of the principal ones, and then Å¿ee if we cannot raiÅ¿e an hopeful proÅ¿pect of national happineÅ¿s, notwithÅ¿tanding.</p>
            <p>Some perÅ¿ons are very jealous, that our Rulers will become <hi>deÅ¿potic;</hi> and that they are actually taking the previous Å¿teps. But will not theÅ¿e pains be removed as Å¿oon as they realize the checks and balances of our governments; the circumÅ¿tances of our Rulers as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Å¿ame with their own; and the change and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of their elections?</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:035317_0019_10022BBC48E15C78"/>
A Å¿pirit of <hi>licentiouÅ¿neÅ¿s</hi> and <hi>anarchy,</hi> Å¿o much Å¿pread among us, is another enemy to public happineÅ¿s. But was not this to be expected, for a time, in Å¿uch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this, and in our circumÅ¿tances? Having dearly bought our liberty, and poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed the precious boon, it was natural to expect, that many would run wild with the idea, and not Å¿uddenly diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿h between govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental liberty, and licentiouÅ¿neÅ¿s. But are we not coming to our Å¿enÅ¿es, and regarding this diÅ¿tinction more and more? And as we grow cool, and increaÅ¿e in knowledge, and experience the bleÅ¿Å¿ings of good government, Å¿hall we not Å¿oon, and generally, drop this abuÅ¿e of liberty, and be willing to be happy? Let all good patriots and intelligent men teach their connexions this wiÅ¿dom, and join in advancing political information and Å¿olid virtue. Thus, we may hope, the People will Å¿ee their real intereÅ¿ts, and avoid a reÅ¿tleÅ¿s and Å¿editious Å¿pirit, which is its own tormentor.</p>
            <p>The <hi>abuÅ¿e of religious liberty,</hi> it is granted, is another obÅ¿truction of public proÅ¿perity. This liberty is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious part of our Å¿ingular privileges. It Å¿hould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to promote love and good works: TheÅ¿e are its Å¿weet effects, when guided by wiÅ¿dom and piety. But when it is made "an occaÅ¿ion to the fleÅ¿h," an inÅ¿trument of miÅ¿chief, it becomes an engine fatal to the beÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ures and bleÅ¿Å¿ings of Å¿ociety. Has it not thus opened a door to infidelity, and the corruption of ChriÅ¿tian doctrines, worÅ¿hip and manners? It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have led the way to injurious diviÅ¿ions and angry Å¿eparations among ChriÅ¿tians, and much enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iaÅ¿m. By theÅ¿e means the peace and edification of Churches have been greatly injured; and many places have probably been thus retarded in their deÅ¿ires and purÅ¿uits of Å¿tated and faithful paÅ¿tors.</p>
            <p>I deÅ¿ire not that men Å¿hould be deprived of the right of private judgment in religion. I would not wound the feelings of pious perÅ¿ons, however weak and miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but it is grievous to wiÅ¿e ChriÅ¿tians, to Å¿ee Å¿ouls
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035317_0020_10022BBF64F6E7E8"/>
turned from the truth to fables; from the Å¿implicity that is in CHRIST, to human fancies; from pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿piration, to its fatal counterfeit.</p>
            <p>But has not this evil always taken place in times of civil commotions and revolutions? And, may we not hope, that time and conÅ¿ideration will remove it? We have the happieÅ¿t means of knowing true religion from all its counterfeits. We have colleges, academies and Å¿chools, deÅ¿igned to promote general information and religious Å¿cience. We have many excellent teachers in the ChriÅ¿tian MiniÅ¿try, workmen who need not to be aÅ¿hamed. Under Å¿uch eminent means of inÅ¿truc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let us cheerfully hope the time will Å¿oon come when Å¿educers and novices in divinity Å¿hall be eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿covered and diÅ¿carded; when the peace of the Churches Å¿hall be prized and maintained; and the Å¿olid virtue and piety of <hi>Holy Writ</hi> be preferred to Å¿uperÅ¿tition and enthuÅ¿iaÅ¿m. Let us all duly eÅ¿teem and improve a learned, faithful and pious MiniÅ¿try; and acquaint ourÅ¿elves fully with the Å¿criptural marks and arts of Å¿educers, and avoid them. Let great care be taken in the introduction of men into the GoÅ¿pel MiniÅ¿try; and let the peace and order of the Churches be Å¿acredly regarded, and Å¿uch as would break them be Å¿hunned. And who can tell how Å¿oon the abuÅ¿e of religious liberty, with all its ruinous effects, Å¿hall give way to the increaÅ¿e of love and peace, regularity and holineÅ¿s?</p>
            <p>We have alÅ¿o too much reaÅ¿on to believe, <hi>foreign intrigue</hi> has done much to divide us as a nation, and obÅ¿truct the public weal. We have, indeed, great reaÅ¿on to believe, that this has been a capital machine, employed againÅ¿t our peace; a principal wedge, driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with Å¿trong and repeated blows, to Å¿plit us into pieces, to the ruin of our happy Union. An excellent and patriotic writer of our own has made this matter plain; "The bleÅ¿Å¿ings of good government," Å¿ays he, "have been moÅ¿t imminently and immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035317_0021_10022BC1A9BFB2C8"/>
by <hi>foreign intrigue.</hi> From this Å¿ource have ariÅ¿en our greateÅ¿t perils. This bane of our independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, peace and proÅ¿perity, has been operating in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways for more than twenty years paÅ¿t, in inÅ¿idious efforts to diminiÅ¿h our national limits, importance and reÅ¿ources; in keeping alive national prejudices; in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to prevent our having an efficient government; in artful Å¿tratagems to diminiÅ¿h and weaken the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers veÅ¿ted in the Executive; to deÅ¿troy the <hi>checks</hi> and <hi>balances,</hi> and to conÅ¿olidate the diÅ¿tinct and well-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined powers of the Three Branches eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in the ConÅ¿titution; in frequent interferences in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of our national concerns; in fomenting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions among us; and in patronizing and circulating publications, calculated to cheriÅ¿h and increaÅ¿e them; by calumniating our Rulers, miÅ¿repreÅ¿enting their meaÅ¿ures, and exciting murmurs, prejudices, and open and direct oppoÅ¿ition againÅ¿t the laws. In theÅ¿e, and many other ways, too numerous to detail, has foreign intrigue diÅ¿covered itÅ¿elf among us, and attempted to check our national growth, and to deprive us of the bleÅ¿Å¿ings of a free and independent government.</p>
            <p>It was by intrigues and artifices, like thoÅ¿e we have mentioned, that all the Republics of <hi>Europe</hi> have been proÅ¿trated at the feet of <hi>France.</hi> It was in the Å¿ame way that the free States of <hi>Greece</hi> were ruined, and their liberty loÅ¿t."<note n="*" place="bottom">DOCTOR MO<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Gratitude</hi> is an amiable virtue; but when we Å¿ee with open eyes, that it has been ignorantly directed to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035317_0022_10022BC7C1A8AAD8"/>
a foreign nation, we Å¿hall exchange it for <hi>juÅ¿tice</hi> to ourÅ¿elves. Converts, of this happy Å¿ort, are daily made; and, for the honour of <hi>America,</hi> we will hope and believe, their number will be enlarged; and that our union, patriotiÅ¿m and firmneÅ¿s will render our name excellent in the earth.</p>
            <p>We only add; <hi>a Å¿pirit of infidelity, immorality and ungodlineÅ¿s,</hi> Å¿preading among us, is another obÅ¿truction of the public welfare, and an enemy to it. But, for our comfort, we Å¿ay, neither is this of our <hi>own Å¿oil,</hi> but a foreign production. The laborious and critical author, before cited, hath Å¿aid, "The PhiloÅ¿ophiÅ¿ts and RevolutioniÅ¿ts of <hi>France</hi> appear to have acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the maxim of THOMAS PAINE, 'that <hi>an army of principles</hi> will penetrate where an army of Å¿oldiers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. It is neither the Rhine (he Å¿ays) the Channel, nor the <hi>Ocean,</hi> that can arreÅ¿t its progreÅ¿s. It will march to the horizon of the world, and it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.' In conformity to this maxim, that infamous book, Å¿tyled, <hi>The Age of ReaÅ¿on,</hi> was written in France (and, it is Å¿aid, in the houÅ¿e and under the patronage of Mr. MUNROE) printed there in the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and a cargo of 15,000 copies, at one time, Å¿ent into theÅ¿e <hi>United States,</hi> and diÅ¿poÅ¿ed of by Å¿ale at a cheap rate, or given away. BeÅ¿ides theÅ¿e imported copies, numerous editions of the Å¿ame work (Å¿hame on our country!) have been printed here. The effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the extenÅ¿ive circulation of theÅ¿e books, and others of the Å¿ame caÅ¿t and tendency, in the evident Å¿pread of infidel and atheiÅ¿tical principles, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equent deterioration of morals, evince that theÅ¿e ApoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of <hi>IlluminatiÅ¿m</hi> have not been unÅ¿ucceÅ¿sful in their labours."</p>
            <p>It thus appears, we muÅ¿t allow, that <hi>we were too ready</hi> to receive the fatal plant, and to cheriÅ¿h it. But will a People, always uÅ¿ed to reverence the GOD of Heaven, and among whom many pious Å¿ouls remain, long be guilty of this madneÅ¿s? Rather let us hope,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035317_0023_10022BCC5AD78D30"/>
that, in an exchange of circumÅ¿tances, we Å¿hall, through grace, come to ourÅ¿elves; honour the GOD of our Fathers; and confeÅ¿s, with deep contrition, that we have erred, and played the fool exceedingly.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e are our diÅ¿eaÅ¿es. Let us hope, through GOD, they are curable; leÅ¿t we mourn, in accents of untried Å¿orrow, "Is there no balm in <hi>Gilead?</hi> No PhyÅ¿ician there? Why then is not the health of the People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered?"</p>
            <p>We will Å¿pend a few moments, however, in viewing the brighter Å¿ide of our proÅ¿pects; that we may raiÅ¿e our hopes Å¿till higher of the nation's proÅ¿perity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Providences of GOD</hi> to our Fathers, and to us, have been favourable, next to a miracle. Within our remembrance, he hath done great things for us; for which we Å¿hould be glad, and offer due praiÅ¿e. Our revolution turned up events Å¿o truly gracious, that the blind Å¿ee, and the inconÅ¿iderate adore the hand of <hi>Him</hi> "who works in all, yet who alone Å¿eems not to work." And Å¿ince that day his bleÅ¿Å¿ings have deÅ¿cended in Å¿howers. If I be not deceived, never was there before a People Å¿o numerous and Å¿o well-informed as this, who had entire leiÅ¿ure and full opportunity, and the moÅ¿t happy means of forming ConÅ¿titutions of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for themÅ¿elves, and then of receiving them, after the moÅ¿t mature deliberation. And our happineÅ¿s, under their adminiÅ¿tration, has Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿ed even our own Å¿anguine expectations. And this has been the caÅ¿e, notwithÅ¿tanding the many and peculiar embarraÅ¿Å¿ments which have attended Å¿aid adminiÅ¿tration. Never, it Å¿eems, was there before a young Republic Å¿o exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly harraÅ¿Å¿ed in the management of its affairs. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal honour to our firm and patriotic Rulers, who have borne the burden and heat of the day. Some, better informed than myÅ¿elf, think their vigorous and firm meaÅ¿ures have Å¿aved the <hi>ConÅ¿titution</hi> itÅ¿elf from Å¿hipwreck! If Å¿o, what thanks are due to them, and to GOD! And what joyful hopes ariÅ¿e from hence, of our future felicity!</p>

BleÅ¿Å¿ed be GOD, <hi>our preÅ¿ent circumÅ¿tances are Å¿o good and promiÅ¿ing!</hi> Hitherto hath the LORD Å¿aved us, in the midÅ¿t of great and preÅ¿Å¿ing trials. We hope he will yet Å¿ave us. While the State Governments, Å¿o generally, move happily in their reÅ¿pective Å¿tations, the Federal one, like the Å¿un in the centre of its Å¿yÅ¿tem, gives light and Å¿trength, union and Å¿tability to them all. And the nation appears to be emerging from the darkneÅ¿s of trouble to the light of joy and independent felicity. A Å¿pirit of patriotiÅ¿m and zeal for government, have become general. A Å¿enÅ¿e of the public weal, as depending on <hi>ourÅ¿elves,</hi> and not on any <hi>other nation,</hi> has nobly Å¿pread and honoured the union. The firm and truly <hi>American</hi> Å¿pirit of this great Commonwealth, is a joyful conÅ¿ideration. And the preÅ¿ervation of the life, and eminent uÅ¿efulneÅ¿s of the PRESIDENT of the Union, and the appearance of a WASHINGTON once more at the head of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, are matters of profound gratitude to JEHOVAH, and of high joy and hope to us. Being myÅ¿elf an American, and loving the happineÅ¿s and honour of my country, I cannot eaÅ¿ily omit, in this place, an eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, laconic and tranÅ¿cendant, Å¿aid to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by a foreigner on theÅ¿e two great PerÅ¿onages of <hi>America.</hi> A gentleman Å¿aid to his friend, with much Å¿eriouÅ¿neÅ¿s, "Do you believe there is a man on earth really poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of all thoÅ¿e excellencies which are aÅ¿cribed to <hi>PreÅ¿ident WASHINGTON?</hi>" "I never did till I Å¿aw <hi>JOHN ADAMS.</hi>"</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e, and Å¿imilar facts, juÅ¿tly raiÅ¿e our hopes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional felicity, and waft our thoughts forward on the wings of delightful anticipation. Many things, to the Å¿ame purpoÅ¿e, might be added; we might enlarge on the Å¿ituation, richneÅ¿s and reÅ¿ources of this favoured country; the vigour and firmneÅ¿s with which our means of defence have been adopted, and the Å¿ucceÅ¿s crowning them &amp;c. but I dare preÅ¿ume no further on the patience of this honoured aÅ¿Å¿embly.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:035317_0025_10022A8944304018"/>
Let us then, in our Å¿everal Å¿pheres, be animated in our duty. Let the People Å¿tudy to be quiet, and to do their own buÅ¿ineÅ¿s; fear GOD, and honour Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and meddle not with them who are given to change. Let our Rulers prove themÅ¿elves the light of our IÅ¿rael. Let theÅ¿e, and the MiniÅ¿ters of Religion, act in Å¿weet agreement; let them look on each other with a benevolent eye, not mixing their powers and their intereÅ¿ts with unjuÅ¿t or oppreÅ¿Å¿ive views; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibing a Å¿pirit of love and eÅ¿teem mutually; and aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other in the great and godlike deÅ¿ign of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an happy nation. So will the LORD fulfil all our deÅ¿ires, leading his choÅ¿en people by the hands of MOSES and AARON.</p>
            <p>If any thing has been delivered, unÅ¿uitable to this important and joyful occaÅ¿ion, or injurious to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic weal, the candour of this intelligent audience will cover it. And may GOD bleÅ¿s a Å¿incere endeavour to Å¿erve my country, to fulfil my duty, and to aid the Redeemer's cauÅ¿e, Å¿o generally and Å¿o unhappily neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency will accept of our congratulations on the repeated Å¿uffrages of your country, by which you are again the firÅ¿t light of this part of our IÅ¿rael. To pay you, Sir, an unmeaning or painful compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am not willing. But to rejoice in a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and approved in Å¿o exalted a Å¿tation, and whom an intelligent People have Å¿o often called to the Chief Seat of Government, is both my pleaÅ¿ant duty and gratified ambition.</p>
            <p>It is our Å¿weet hope, that you will Å¿till attend faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, with advice of <hi>Council,</hi> to the defence, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineÅ¿s of your country. <hi>Their</hi> wiÅ¿dom and firmneÅ¿s, we truÅ¿t, will be a Å¿eaÅ¿onable aid to your Excellency. Your own judgment will naturally be confirmed by their's, enabling you to act with fuller Å¿atisfaction, and more animating hopes. That modeÅ¿ty which attends
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035317_0026_10022A8DF0825D90"/>
merit will gladly receive concurring advice. And thus acting, you will do honour to yourÅ¿elf, and verify the remark of SOLOMON: "The words of wiÅ¿e men are heard in quiet, more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools."</p>
            <p>We preÅ¿ume not to inÅ¿truct your Excellency; but it is agreeable to our Å¿ubject to Å¿ay, you will tenderly love the People; pay a Å¿acred regard to the ConÅ¿titution in your conduct; Å¿ee that governmental proceedings are guided by wiÅ¿dom and juÅ¿tice; regard merit in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing men in office; Å¿eek the peace of the nation; and aid the progreÅ¿s of learning, virtue and religion. You will attend, Sir, to the removal of the cruel obÅ¿truc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are thrown in the way of the public wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; and as readily improve the Å¿eaÅ¿ons and means of advancing the proper and direct happineÅ¿s of the body. Your urbanity and moral virtues will eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿erve the general cauÅ¿e; as the manners of the great deÅ¿cend to the lower grades of men, and are caught with avidity. And as "a ChriÅ¿tian is the higheÅ¿t Å¿tyle of man," you, Sir, will Å¿hine with redoubled luÅ¿tre, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿incerely joined that to "His Excellency." With this mingled glory, Sir, we pray, that you may long be a light and a bleÅ¿Å¿ing on earth; and finally Å¿hine, as the Å¿un in the firmament, and as a Å¿tar for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>The Two Branches of the General Court receive our reÅ¿pect, and our cordial wiÅ¿hes for them, as men, and as Rulers. That part of them, who have long Å¿erved their country, and honoured their Å¿tations, deÅ¿erve our thanks; as they receive the approbation of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tituents in a light the moÅ¿t unequivocal in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated elections. May the elections of the day be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to with that deliberation, wiÅ¿dom and regard to merit, which the importance of the matter demands. As affairs of great moment may come before you in the courÅ¿e of the year, we pray GOD to give you that
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035317_0027_10022A926FAB4EE0"/>
knowledge, integrity and firmneÅ¿s, which will render you equal to them. And as real worth is proved in arduous and trying Å¿ervices, and Å¿hines the more, we truÅ¿t you will be prepared to manifeÅ¿t that worth, Å¿hould the trial come. The poÅ¿t of honour is often the poÅ¿t of danger. Let your genuine patriotiÅ¿m, and your reÅ¿olution in duty, make you equal to every trial.</p>
            <p>Be united in your <hi>love</hi> of the country, that, with the more eaÅ¿e you may be united alÅ¿o in the <hi>means</hi> of its preÅ¿ervation and happineÅ¿s. Put on candour and patience in your deliberations; and let no partial views bias your judgments, or corrupt your affections. And let me Å¿ay, with the faireÅ¿t intention, and with all due reÅ¿pect, "Take heed, Honoured Fathers, that ye fall not out by the way." "A kingdom divided againÅ¿t itÅ¿elf cannot Å¿tand." You will do all in your power to prevent Å¿uch ruin.</p>
            <p>The times are difficult. A good old MiniÅ¿ter of this country in Å¿uch a day, made this caution the ground of a public diÅ¿courÅ¿e: "When we do not know what to do, we Å¿hould be careful not to do we know not what." Your knowledge and prudence, I hope, will Å¿ave you always from Å¿uch raÅ¿hneÅ¿s. Many cauÅ¿es, and Å¿ome of them forcible, have perplexed and divided the minds of good citizens in their ideas of government and politics. It will be your duty and honour to Å¿ee through thoÅ¿e things which grieve and divide others; and by a conduct uniformly wiÅ¿e, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titutional and benevolent, to open their eyes; and thus to convince them alÅ¿o, that our government and adminiÅ¿tration are, as they ought to be, eminently for the good of the People; and that there is a mighty difference between government, and no government; between a good one, and a corrupt one; and between their real friends, and inÅ¿idious foes. By Å¿uch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct may you greatly Å¿erve the State.</p>

And may this government, and every State govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Å¿o concur with a wiÅ¿e, firm and righteous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniÅ¿tration of the Federal Government, as that the Union Å¿hall be Å¿afely guided through its preÅ¿ent Å¿ea of perplexity and fear, to the haven of entire peace with itÅ¿elf. And may this internal peace be accompanied with peace abroad, and not diÅ¿turbed with foreign wars or foreign politics. And we alÅ¿o pray, that, on their own account, all the nations of <hi>Europe</hi> may be guided to an equitable and laÅ¿ting peace; in which the peace of Zion, and the welfare of mankind may alÅ¿o be great and laÅ¿ting. In all your efforts to Å¿hine, and be uÅ¿eful in your high Å¿tations, may GOD guide you by unerring wiÅ¿dom, and crown them with the deÅ¿ired Å¿ucceÅ¿s. And all the people who are wiÅ¿e and good, will receive your Å¿ervices with gratitude; and, for your Å¿akes, as well as their own, they will pray, that the light of IÅ¿rael may not be quenched. May you all be faithful in a few things, and finally be made Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers over many things, and be welcomed to your Great MaÅ¿ter's joy.</p>
            <p>A principle of piety is Å¿o eÅ¿Å¿ential to the diÅ¿charge of all relative duties, as well as all others, that I Å¿hall be juÅ¿tified in cloÅ¿ing this diÅ¿courÅ¿e by an inculcation of it.</p>
            <p>Men and Brethren, whether Rulers or ruled, we have all a part to act in this Å¿hort life, of importance, beyond all conception great. A future and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Å¿cene awaits us; full of joy and glory on the one hand, and of Å¿hame and contempt on the other. We Å¿hall eÅ¿cape the latter and obtain the former, if the grace which bringeth Å¿alvation teach us to deny ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿s and worldly luÅ¿ts, and to live Å¿oberly, righteouÅ¿ly and godly in the preÅ¿ent world. Thus Å¿erving GOD, and our generation by the will of GOD, we Å¿hall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the end of our courÅ¿e, the <hi>Å¿alvation</hi> of our Å¿ouls.</p>
            <p>The worth of <hi>this</hi> is learned by <hi>one</hi> conÅ¿ideration, taken by itÅ¿elf, without addition. The MiniÅ¿ters,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035317_0029_10022A9D8445D770"/>
whom GOD hath provided for human happineÅ¿s, and for <hi>this</hi> eminently, afford this inÅ¿truction. The great <hi>REDEEMER</hi> came into the world as our Å¿ervant; "not to be miniÅ¿tered unto, but to miniÅ¿ter, and to give his life a ranÅ¿om for many." The <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven are Å¿ent forth to "miniÅ¿ter to the heirs of Å¿alvation." <hi>ChriÅ¿tian Rulers,</hi> are "miniÅ¿ters of GOD to us for good." The <hi>MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pel</hi> are, in a peculiar Å¿enÅ¿e, "our Å¿ervants for JESUS' Å¿ake." They are the gift of our aÅ¿cended Head, appointed and continued "for the perfecting of the Å¿aints, for the work of the MiniÅ¿try, and the edifying of the body of CHRIST, till we come to the Å¿tature of perfect men." To render this MiniÅ¿try thus glorious and Å¿ucceÅ¿sful, the <hi>HOLY SPIRIT</hi> is alÅ¿o Å¿ent into the world. In this view he is, in the higheÅ¿t Å¿enÅ¿e, a MiniÅ¿ter of GOD for our good. And as all Heaven is for us, rejoicing at the repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Å¿alvation of one Å¿inner: So all Hell is againÅ¿t us, the prince of it, with his legions, walking about, Å¿eeking whom he may devour.</p>
            <p>If Å¿uch be the combat, and Å¿uch the combatants, what muÅ¿t the <hi>prize</hi> of the warfare be! <hi>Is our Å¿alvation of Å¿uch amazing import?</hi> Then let us Å¿o eÅ¿teem it! Let us adore the GOD who has made the wonderous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viÅ¿ion for it.</p>
            <p>What a creature is man, for whom the GOD of Heaven hath done Å¿o much! I do not know that we can think too highly of ourÅ¿elves, even in the depths of our humility, for our crimes.</p>

Then, with the aÅ¿Å¿urance of hope, we may long for that day, in which the righteous Å¿hall Å¿hine as the Å¿un, in the kingdom of their Father.</p>
            <p>To that bleÅ¿Å¿edneÅ¿s and glory may we all at laÅ¿t be brought, through JESUS CHRIST, our Divine Redeemer.</p>
