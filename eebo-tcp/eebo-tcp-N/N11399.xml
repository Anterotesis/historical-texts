            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>GREAT-BRITAIN's unhappy diſputes with the Engliſh American colonies claim and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a large ſhare of the public attention. The queſtion ſeems to be, whether immenſe numbers of Engliſh ſubjects, living in remote regions, who have hitherto participated of the bleſſings of the Engliſh conſtitution to which they are indiſputably intitled, ſhould be taxed by any man or what is the ſame thing any body of men, with reſpect to whom they have no right of election, no power of controul? This queſtion hath been long agitated, within the walls of the Senate-houſe and without doors; in a variety of ſhapes, on a variety of grounds; with great acuteneſs and no little acrimony on all hands. A conteſt ſo important in its nature, ſo deciſive in its conſequences, muſt naturally warm or even inflame the minds of thoſe who are intereſted in its fate. Every ſubject of the Britiſh empire who thinks or who feels muſt take a ſide. At ſuch a criſis it cannot be impertinent to lay before the public the ſentiments of a diſpaſſionate foreigner on the ſubject. Of no party, he may be admitted as a fair umpire; and if qualified in other reſpects, if poſſeſſed of adequate abilities and information, his deciſion muſt have weight.</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations account for this little pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of an extract from <hi>L'Hiſtorie philoſophique et politique des etabliſſements et du commerce des Européens duns les deux Indes.</hi> A valuable work attributed to the Abbé Reynel; to whoſe authority a kind of ſanction hath been given by its being quoted as to a certain point (if the news-papers are to be credited) by a noble Lord high in office. It would be hard
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:014417_0003_0F9263E8765F3080"/>
then to deny its weight in other matters equally within his competency. But authority is a dangerous thing; truth needs not, diſdains its protection; its wings ſerve but to ſhelter error. Let principles, let facts, let argument ſpeak.</p>
            <p>THE writer along with uncommon talents is furniſhed with ſingular information. No poſſible meaſure of theſe however can be ſuppoſed totally to exempt a man from error Some miſtakes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuracies will be found even in this ſhort extract. They will be forgiven when it is conſidered that the author's ſituation is diſtant, and that the ſubject, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and complicated in itſelf, is not ſingly and profeſſedly diſcuſſed, but merely in the courſe of a large and comprehenſive work. It was once intended to have pointed out a few inſtances of this ſort which occur; but as theſe muſt readily be detected by the attentive and intelligent reader, and as they do not affect the author's reaſoning or concluſions, this was on ſecond thoughts looked on as a ſuperfluous labour. The tranſlator hath contented himſelf with aiming at fidelity and exactneſs; even ſo far as to imitate the manner of the original, which is in general ſhort <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <head>SENTIMENTS OF A FOREIGNER, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>—THE firſt Coloniſts who peopled North-America, devoted themſelves, in the beginning, entirely to agriculture. They ſoon perceived that their exports did by no means enable them to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe what they ſtood in need of, and they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to attempt ſome coarſe manufactures. This innovation was thought to claſh with the intereſts of the mother-country. It was complained of to Parliament, where it was diſcuſs'd with all the attention it deſerved. There wanted not members bold enough to defend the cauſe of the Coloniſts. They urged, that as the labour of the fields could not give conſtant employment to the inhabitants throughout the year, it would be rank ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny to force them to waſte in inaction that portion of their time, which the ſoil did not demand; that as what they earned by agriculture and hunting was not commenſurate to their wants, to prevent their ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deficiency by a new ſpecies of induſtry, was to bind wretchedneſs upon them; in fine, that the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of manufactures had a direct tendency to raiſe the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014417_0005_0F9263EA0EA7B580"/>
price of goods in an infant ſtate, to diminiſh if not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally obſtruct the ſale of them, and to diſcourage new ſettlers.</p>
            <p>The evidence of theſe principles was incontrovertible. It prevailed after very warm debates. The Americans were permited to manufacture their own cloathing, but under ſuch reſtrictions, as betrayed the reluctance of an avaricious ſpirit thro' an exterior of equity. All com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in this reſpect amongſt the provinces was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely interdicted. They were forbid, under heavy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, to ſend from one to another any kind of wool, either raw or wrought. Some manufacturers of hats however broke thro' theſe barriers. To put a ſtop to this terrible diſorder, as it was called, Parliament had recourſe to the expedient of regulations, at once little and cruel. No workman could exerciſe his trade till after an apprenticeſhip of ſeven years; no maſter was allowed to have more than two apprentices at a time, or to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy any ſlave in his work-houſe.</p>
            <p>The mines of iron, which one would think might ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve men from all dependency, were ſubjected to reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtill more ſevere. It could only be exported to the mother-country in the rude form of pigs or bars, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out furnaces to caſt, machines to mould, or ſledges and anvils to forge it. The converting it into ſteel was yet more peremptorily prohibited.</p>
            <p>Their importations were hampered with a variety of ſhackles. No foreign veſſel, unleſs it be in evident dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſhip-wreck, or loaded with bullion, can enter any of the ports in North-America. Even Engliſh ſhips are not admitted if they come directly from a harbour of the nation. The merchantmen of the Colonies trading to Europe, muſt bring no commodities back with them, but what have been purchaſed from the capital, except the Wines of Madeira and the Azores; and what ſalt is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the fiſheries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014417_0006_0F9263EAAD5E1708"/>Formerly all their exports were to touch at England. Weighty conſiderations have ſince diſpoſed government to relax a little of this exceſſive rigour. The Colonies are now permitted to carry directly to the Southward of Cape-Finiſtere, grain, flour, rice, pulſe, fruit, ſalt-fiſh, planks and timber. All their other products go exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to the mother-country. Even Ireland, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd an advantageous out-let to the wheat, flax, and lumber of the Colonies, was ſhut up by an act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in 1766.</p>
            <p>The ſenate which repreſents the nation, inſiſts on the right of directing commerce through all the vaſt extent of the Britiſh dominions. On this principle it aſſumes the power of regulating the connections between the capital and the Colonies, of maintaining a communication, a beneficial and reciprocal re-action, amongſt the ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts of an immenſe empire. In fact, ſome one pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ought to determine, in the laſt reſort, on thoſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive circumſtances which may injure or promote the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good of the whole ſyſtem. Parliament alone can claim this tranſcendant prerogative. But Parliament ſhould exerciſe it to the mutual advantage of all the members of the ſocial confederacy. This maxim always inviolable, is peculiarly ſo in a ſtate, the movements of which have been all inſtituted and adjuſted, with a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial view to national liberty</p>
            <p>But they departed from this great principle of impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, which alone can preſerve an equality of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance among the members of a free government, when they obliged the Colonies to pour into the capital all their products, even thoſe which were not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in it; when they forced them to take from the capital all their merchandize, even thoſe which were brought into it from foreign nations. This imperious and ſterile conſtraint, loading the ſales and purchaſes of the Americans with uſeleſs charges, a mere dead loſs,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014417_0007_0F9263EB8AE09390"/>
which hath naturally and neceſſarily checked their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and of courſe hurt their circumſtances; and it is purely to enrich ſome merchants or ſome brokers of the capital, that the rights and intereſts of the Colonies are ſacrificed. Yet they owed nothing more to England for the protection ſhe had afforded them, than a preference in the ſale and importation of ſuch of their commodities as ſhe could conſume; and in the purchaſe and expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſuch merchandiſes as ſhe manufactured. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this line the ſubmiſſion of the Colonies was grateful acknowledgement; beyond it every reſtraint was down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right violence.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, Contraband was the offspring of this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. Tranſgreſſion is the firſt effect of iniquitous laws, wherever deſpotiſm hath not trampled on codes, forms and tribunals; ſole rampart, legitimate and ſacred of that independency which is the birth-right of man. In vain were the Colonies told a hundred and a hundred times that ſmuggling was contrary to the fundamental principle of their eſtabliſhment, to political wiſdom, to the expreſs intent of the laws. In vain was it proved in a variety of publications that the citizen who paid the duties was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the one who did not, and that the fraudulent trader robb'd the fair merchant, by diſappointing him of his lawful profits. In vain were precautions multiplied to prevent, and chaſtiſements to puniſh, ſuch tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The voice of intereſt, of reaſon, of equity, was an overmatch for the hundred mouths and the hundred paws of the revenue-hydra. Foreign commodities, ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled into the northern parts of Engliſh-America, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a full third of what paid the duties.</p>
            <p>A freedom of trade undefined, or only reſtrained within juſt bounds, would put a ſtop to theſe illicit prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices which excite ſuch an outcry. Then would the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies attain that meaſure of affluence, which would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them, not only to ſhake off the weight of four mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014417_0008_0F9263EC30A47FD8"/>
               <hi>Sterling,</hi> which they owe the mother-country, but to take from her annually upwards of two millions worth of merchandizes, which their preſent conſumption de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. But in place of this pleaſing perſpective, which ſhould naturally ariſe out of the Engliſh conſtitution, by what fatality is it that a claim unwarrantable in a free ſtate, hath carried under the harſh form of taxation into the centre of the Colonies, a root of trouble and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, perhaps a conſtagration by no means ſo eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed as lighted up?</p>
            <p>England had juſt concluded a war, which might be called a univerſal one, in the courſe of which her fleets had hoiſted the flag of victory in every ſea, while her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts had enlarged her dominions by an immenſe acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of territory, in both the Indies. This ſudden and unexpected growth gave her a brilliancy in the eyes of other nations, which made envy and admiration ſpeak, or aſtoniſhed them into ſilence; yet within herſelf ſhe was compelled to mourn inceſſantly over her ſplendid tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs. Cruſh'd by the preſſure of a debt of one hundred and forty eight millions, the intereſt of which amounted to four millions nine hundred and ſixty three thouſand four hundred and forty four pounds, with a revenue of ten millions ſhe could ſcarcely provide for the current expences of the ſtate; and this revenue, without a chance of increaſe, was in danger of ſinking.</p>
            <p>The Land-tax was rated higher than it had ever been in time of peace.

of ex—or importation, whether raw materials or manufactures. The curb of the Exciſe had happily check'd the abuſe of ſpirituous liquors, but at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the public revenue. A compenſation had been look'd for from one of thoſe reſources which are readily found, but not ſafely ſought, in the articles of general conſumption and greateſt neceſſity: The exciſe had laid hold of the ordinary drink of the people, of malt, cyder and porter. Every ſpring had been forced. All the muſcles of the political body ſtrain'd at once to too violent a tenſion, had ſtarted from their places. The price both of materials and of workmanſhip, had riſen ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly, that rival and even vanquiſhed nations, who till then could not withſtand the competition of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, were come the length of ſupplanting them in all markets, even in their own ports. The whole of the profits which Great-Britain derived from her commerce with every part of the globe could not be eſtimated at more than two millions and a half; and out of this balance was to be deducted the ſum of one million five hundred and ſixty thouſand pounds, payable to foreigners yearly on fifty two millions which they had in the public funds.</p>
            <p>The criſis was difficult and dangerous. The People muſt get leave to breathe. They could not be relieved by a leſſening of the public expences. Theſe were ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable, whether occaſion'd by the view of turning to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, acquiſitions purchaſed by ſo much blood, ſo much treaſure, or of curbing the reſentments of the Houſe of Bourbon irritated to the laſt degree by the diſgrace of the late war, by the ſacrifices of the late peace. In the want of every other means of inſuring preſent ſecurity, and future proſperity, the idea ſuggeſted itſelf of calling in the Colonies to the ſuccour of the capital, by obliging them to bear a part of it's burthens.

The ſecurity of the American Provinces calls for ſuch aids from them as may enable the mother-country to protect them on all occaſions. It was to deliver them from tormenting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes, that ſhe engaged in a war which hath mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied her debts; they ſhould therefore aſſiſt her in bearing or in leſſening this additional load. Safe from the enterprizes of a formidable neighbour, now happily for them removed to a diſtance, can they without injuſtice refuſe to the preſſing exigencies of their deliverer, that treaſure which the care of their preſervation hath coſt him? The encouragements which this generous protector gave for a length of time to the rich productions of their ſoil, the gratuitous advances which he ſtill laviſhes to thoſe regions which are not yet cleared; ſuch and ſo many good and kind offices, are they not intitled to a return of cordial ſympathy and eſſential ſervices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Such were the conſiderations which convinced the Britiſh government that they had a right to lay internal taxes on the Colonies. They ſeiſed the opportunity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded by the laſt war, to exhibit a claim ſo dangerous to liberty. For who ever attends to it muſt ſee, that war, whether proſperous or the reverſe, furniſhes evermore the pretext for the various uſurpations of governments, as if the rulers of belligerant nations had it infinitely more at heart to enſlave their ſubjects than to vanquiſh their enemies. The American Provinces were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ordered to provide the trooops ſent from the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal for their defence with a part of their neceſſaries. The dread of interrupting that internal harmony which is ſo eſſential in the midſt of ſurrounding enemies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to ſecond the intentions of Parliament; but with the deep policy of taking no notice of an act, which they could neither reject without exciting civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention,

nor acknowledge without endangering rights too precious not to be tenderly cheriſhed. NEW-YORK alone, ventured to refuſe all compliance. Though the tranſgreſſion was venial, ſhe was puniſhed as for obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate diſobedience, by a ſuſpenſion of her privileges. This blow given to the liberty of one colony ought, one would think, to have excited the clamours of all the others. Whether through want of attention or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, not one rais'd its voice. Their ſilence was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the reſult of fear or of voluntary ſubmiſſion. The peace which ſhould have lowered the impoſts throughout produced, in 1764, the famous Stamp-act, which laying certain duties on ſtampt paper prohibited at the ſame time the uſe of any other, in any kind of deed or public writing, whether judiciary or extra judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary.</p>
            <p>The whole of the Engliſh Colonies in the new world roſe up againſt this novelty; and their diſcontent broke out in a very remarkable manner. A kind of conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, perhaps the only kind which is ſuited to a civilized and of courſe moderate people, was entered into; a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal agreement amongſt all the Coloniſts to deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all ſorts of wares manufactured in Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, till the offenſive act ſhould be repealed. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct and paſſive mode of reſiſtance, which ſhould ſerve as a model to all nations who feel themſelves trampled on by the abuſe of power, had its effect. The Engliſh manufacturers who had ſcarce any other out-let for their goods, throughout the univerſe than the national colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, fell into that diſpair into which the want of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment muſt naturally plunge them; and their cries, which government could neither ſtifle nor elude, made an impreſſion ſalutary for the colonies. The Stamp-act was repealed after two years of a convulſive agitation, which in the days of fanaticiſm would have been a civil war.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:014417_0012_0F9263F1C8845FC8"/>But the triumph of the Colonies was of ſhort durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Parliament had not retreated without extreme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance. It was evident that they had not renounced their claims, when in 1767, by way of equivalent for what the Stamp-act was expected to have produced, they layed a tax on glaſs, lead, tea, painters colours, paſte-board and paper, exported from England to America. Even thoſe patriots who ſeemed to carry the ſupremacy, of the capital over the colonies to the greateſt length, could not help condemning a tax, the operation of which muſt ultimately recoil upon the whole nation, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to manufactures thoſe hands which it was her inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to have kept confined to agriculture. The Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts were as little duped by this innovation as by the former one. In vain was it alledged that government had an indubitable right to lay on exportations what du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they thought proper, while they did not deprive the colonies of the liberty of manufacturing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſuch goods as were ſubject to this new tax. This ſubterfuge looked like a mockery in regard to a people, who, habituated to tillage alone and reſtrained from all commerce but with the mother-country, could neither procure by their own labour nor a foreign trade, thoſe neceſſaries which were ſold to them at ſo high a price. They ſaw clearly that whether a duty was paid in the old or in the new world, words could not alter the nature of the thing, and that their liberty was equally attacked by an impoſt on wares which they could not do without, as by a tax on ſtampt paper which they were compelled to make uſe of. This enlightened people plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that government wanted to deceive them, and they did not think it their duty to be impoſed on, either by force or cunning. They rightly judged that the moſt deciſive mark of imbecillity and of meanneſs in a nation, muſt be the connivance of ſubjects at the frauds and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences employed by government to corrupt and enſlave them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:014417_0013_0F9263F3AD47B490"/>The averſion which they expreſſed for theſe new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions did not ariſe from their exceſſive weight, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they could not be eſtimated at more than ſixteen-pence a head. This was not an object to ſtartle an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe population, whoſe public expenditure hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exceeded one hundred and ſixty thouſand pounds annually.</p>
            <p>It was not the dread of finding themſelves in leſs eaſy circumſtances. The ſecurity they derived from the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions extorted from France; the increaſe of their trade with the Indians, the extenſion of their whale, cod, and ſeal fiſheries, the right to cut wood in the bay of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachy, the acquiſition of ſundry Sugar-iſlands, the greater facility of carrying on an illicit intercourſe with the Spaniſh ſettlements, to which they were become nearer neighbours; ſo many inlets of wealth were an ample compenſation for that trifle of revenue which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment wiſh'd to draw from them.</p>
            <p>It was not an apprehenſion that the colonies would be drained of what little ſpecie remained in circulation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. The pay of eight thouſand four hundred Regulars, which the capital maintains in North-Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, muſt bring in more caſh than this tax could poſſibly carry out.</p>
            <p>It was not an indifference for the parent-ſtate. The colonies, ſo far from being ugrateful, had evidenced ſuch zeal for her intereſts during the laſt war, that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from a principle of equity, remitted them very conſiderable ſums, by way of reſtitution or indemnifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Nor was it in fine, an ignorance of the duty which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects owe, or of the obligations which they ſtand under to government. Had the colonies not thought themſelves bound to contribute to the liquidation of the national debt, though perhaps they had occaſioned the greateſt part of it, they knew very well that they were bound to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014417_0014_0F9263F3E91793B8"/>
contribute to the expences of the navy, to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the different eſtabliſhments in Africa and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, in a word to all thoſe common charges which had relation to their ſafety and proſperity, as well as to thoſe of the mother-country.</p>
            <p>If the new world refuſed to ſuccour the old, it was becauſe that was exacted which it would have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to have aſked; becauſe that muſt be held on the footing of her obedience, which ſhould have only been ſolicited from her liberty. Her non-compliance was not caprice, but juſt jealouſy of her rights. Rights which ſhould not, cannot be conteſted.</p>
            <p>During the courſe of two centuries that the Engliſh have had ſettlements in North-America, their country hath ſuſtained many expenſive and bloody wars, hath been diſturbed by enterpriſing and tumultuous Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hath been governed by daring and corrupt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, ever ready to exalt the dignity and prerogative of the throne, on the ruin of the rights and privileges of the people. Yet, ambition, avarice, factions, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, all of them in their turns have recognized, all have reſpected the liberty which the colonies enjoyed of laying on themſelves every tax for the purpoſe of creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a revenue.</p>
            <p>A ſolemn contract ſupported this prerogative ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in itſelf, and ſo conformable to the fundamental end of all reaſonable aſſociation. The colonies might appeal to the charters of their eſtabliſhments which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power them to tax themſelves in the manner moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for them. Theſe compacts, it is true, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than conventions with the crown; but even allowing that the King had exceeded his powers by grants from which, moſt certainly, he derived no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate emolument, doth not a long poſſeſſion, tacitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed and recognized by the ſilence of Parliament, form a legal preſcription?</p>

It was to defend this ſacred privilege, that the nation hath ſo often deluged her fields with her own blood, that ſhe hath dethroned her Kings, that ſhe hath excited or braved ſtorms without number. Can ſhe deny to two millions of her children a bleſſing which hath coſt her ſo dear, which perhaps is the ſole baſis of her independence?</p>
            <p>In oppoſition to the colonies it is urged that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics living in England, are excluded from the right of voting, and that their lands are ſubjected to a double tax. But why, they anſwer, do the Papiſts refuſe to take that oath of allegiance which the ſtate requires? rendered by this ſuſpected, the diſtruſt which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire juſtifies the rigour which they experience. Why do they not abjure a religion ſo contrary in its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to the free conſtitution of their country, ſo cruelly favourable to the pretenſions of deſpotiſm, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of royalty on the rights of the people? Why this blind and obſtinate attachment to a church hoſtile to all others? They well deſerve the penalties which the government that conſents to tolerate them, thinks fit to lay ſuch intolerant ſubjects under. But the inhabitants of the new world would be puniſhed without having committed an offence, if they muſt ceaſe to be Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans before they can be conſidered as citizens of the empire.</p>
            <p>With ſome effrontery theſe faithful Colonies have been told, that England nouriſhes in her boſom a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſubjects that have no repreſentatives, becauſe they have not that extent of property which is requiſite to qualify them as voters for members of Parliament.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014417_0016_0F9263F8AB7B87E0"/>
On what grounds do they pretend to privileges greater than what the citizens of the parent-country enjoy? No, reply the Colonies, we aſk not a ſuperiority, we only claim an equality with our brethren. In Great-Britain, the man who poſſeſſeth a freehold of forty ſhillings a year hath a voice in taxation; and he who owns in America, immenſe tracts, ſhall not have the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative? No, what is an exception to the law, a dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from the general rule in the Capital, ſhould not be a fundamental conſtitution for the Colonies. Let the Engliſh, who wiſh to deprive the provinces of the weſtern world of the excluſive right of taxation, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for a moment the Houſe of Commons, no longer the creature of their choice, to be nothing more than an hereditary and permanent tribunal, or one arbitrarily appointed by the King; if a body thus conſtituted could levy money on the nation at large, without conſulting the public opinion or aſking the general conſent, muſt not the Engliſh, on ſuch a ſuppoſition, own themſelves to be as complete ſlaves as their neighbours? Yet five hundred men in the midſt of ſeven millions of fellow-ſubjects, would probably be kept within the bounds of moderation, if not by a principle of equity, by the well-founded dread of the public indignation, which purſues the oppreſſors of a people even beyond the tomb. But the lot of the Americans, taxed at the diſcretion of the ſenate of the capital, would be hopeleſs and forlorn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Too remote to be heard, they would be cruſhed by heavy impoſts without the leaſt attention to their complaints. Even the tyranny which cruſhed them would be decorated with the fair name of Patriotiſm. Under the pretext of relieving the mother-country, the Colonies would be loaded with impunity.</p>
            <p>This frightful proſpect will never allow them to part with the excluſive right of taxing themſelves. While they continue to regulate the public revenue, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014417_0017_0F9263FC98881720"/>
muſt be reſpected, or ſhould their rights be at any time infringed, they will obtain a ſpeedy redreſs of their grievances. But their remonſtrances will loſe all their efficacy with government, when they are no longer backed by the right of granting or refuſing their money to the exigencies of the ſtate. The power which hath uſurped the right of fixing the impoſts, will eaſily uſurp that of adminiſtring them. Sole judge of the levy it will become the arbiter of the expenditure; and funds deſtined, in appearance, to the ſafety of the people, will be employed to enſlave them. Such hath ever been the ſolemn pace of empires. No civil community hath preſerved even a ſhadaw of liberty, when it hath once loſt the privilege of voting in the ſanction and promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of revenue laws. A nation is for ever a ſlave, when it no longer boaſts an aſſembly or body of men, veſted with power to defend its rights againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of the authority which governs it.</p>
            <p>The provinces of Engliſh America have every thing to fear with reſpect to their independence. Their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpecting confidence may betray them, may deliver them up bound into the hands of the mother-country. They are inhabited by an infinity of plain and honeſt people. They do not even ſuſpect that thoſe men who hold the reins of an empire, may be carried away by paſſions unjuſt and tyrannical. Their old country they ſuppoſe under the influence of no other than thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſentiments, which accord ſo well with her true intereſts, with that love and veneration they entertain for her. With the blindneſs of theſe upright citizens, who indulge ſo pleaſing an illuſion, coincides the ſilence of thoſe who think they ſhould not diſturb their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, on account of ſome light and trival impoſts. Theſe indolent men do not diſcern that it was meant, at firſt, to lull their vigilance to repoſe by the ſmallneſs of the impoſition; that England only ſeeks an example of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014417_0018_0F9263FCCBD4BF60"/>
ſubmiſſion, to found a title on in future; that if Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament can levy one ſhilling, it may one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; and that there can be no better reaſon for limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this claim hereafter, than their is now for reſiſting it. But a claſs of men, the moſt pernicious to liberty, are thoſe ambitious people who, diſuniting their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from that of the public and of poſterity, burn with a deſire to augment their credit, their rank, and their riches. The Britiſh miniſtry, from which theſe miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants have obtained or expect advancement, finds them always ready to promote their deteſtable ſchemes, by the contagion of their luxury and of their vices, by the craft of their inſinuations, by the inſidious pliancy of their manners and addreſs.</p>
            <p>Let the genuine patriots then ſtraggle, with unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting firmneſs, againſt prejudice, indolence, ſeduction; and let them not diſpair of coming victorious out of a conflict in which their virtue hath engaged them. It may perhaps be attempted to lure their integrity, by the ſpecious offer of admitting to Parliament the Deputies of America, to regulate, in conjuction with thoſe of the capital, the national ſupplies. And in truth, ſuch are the extent, the population, the exportations, in a word the importance of the colonies, that the legiſlature of the empire cannot poſſibly ſuperintend them with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient wiſdom and ſecurity, without being enlightened by the details, and aſſiſted by the counſels of their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives. But let the Americans beware how they ever empower ſuch deputies to decide, with reſpect to the property or the contributions of their conſtituents. Their voices, feeble and few, would eaſily be overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by the multitude of the Britiſh repreſentatives; and the Provinces, of which they were the organ, would find themſelves loaded in conſequence of this claſhing of intereſts and of votes, with a ſhare of the common burthens, grievous and inequal. The right
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014417_0019_0F9263FD74ADCB48"/>
of fixing, of apportioning, and of levying their taxes, ſhould, therefore, reſide excluſively in the provincial aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the new world. They ought to be peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jealous of this eſſential right at this time, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of depriving them of it, ſeems to have been aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the conqueſts of the laſt war.</p>
            <p>The parent-country hath derived from her new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, the advantage of extending her fiſheries and of encreaſing her connections with the ſavage natives. Yet, as if all this were nothing in her eyes, ſhe is inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeating it, that ſhe had no other view in this enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of poſſeſſion and derives no other benefit from it, than the giving ſtability to the peace and ſecurity of the colonies. The colonies, on the other hand, contend that their lands, on which their wealth intirely depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have ſunk conſiderably in their value ſince this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe extenſion of territory; that their population di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing, or not advancing, their country muſt be more expoſed to the ravages of invaſion; that their provinces have found a formidable rival, the more northern ones in Canada, thoſe to the ſouthward in the Floridas. The Coloniſts enlightened, with regard to future times, by the hiſtory of the paſt, even inſiſt that the military government eſtabliſhed in the new conqueſts, that the numerous troops diſperſed through them, that the forts conſtructed in them threaten, one day, to faſten chains on countries which have flouriſhed, which have proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered but by the influence of liberty.</p>

yoke of a domination ſo wiſely combined, would be to plunge again a new continent into a chaos, from which it hath with difficulty emerged by the efforts of two ages of unremitting labour; it would be to compel the ſons of toil, who have clear'd and cultivated it, to arm themſelves in defence of thoſe ſacred rights which they hold equally by nature's charter and by ſocial compacts. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England—that people ſo paſſionately fond of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as on ſome occaſions to have protected it in regions remote from their climate and unknown to their intereſts, ſhall they abandon thoſe ſentiments which their glory, their virtue, their inſtinct, their ſafety, render it their eternal duty to adhere to? Can they ſo far betray thoſe rights which are ſo dear to them, as to aim at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing their brethren and their children to ſlavery? Should factious ſpirits however form ſo deadly a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, and in an hour of madneſs and intoxication, prevail on the mother-country to adopt it; what ought the reſolutions of the colonies to be, to ſave themſelves from falling into the moſt deteſtable dependence?</p>
            <p>Previous to their throwing their eyes forward to this ſubverſion of the political ſyſtem, let them revolve in their thoughts all the benefits which they derive from their original country. England hath ever been to them an out-work of defence againſt the potent nations of Europe. She hath ſerv'd them as a guide and a governor, to prevent or to heal thoſe civil diſſenſions, which mutual jealouſy and emulation are too apt to excite amongſt infant colonies growing up in each other's neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. To the influence of her excellent conſtitution are they indebted for that peace and proſperity which they enjoy. While the colonies continue to live under a rule ſo ſalutary and ſo gentle, they muſt go on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſively in that boundleſs career, which the vigour of their induſtry will ſtretch even to the remoteſt deſarts.</p>
            <p>Let their love of the parent-country however be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014417_0021_0F9263FEF3D499B8"/>
with a certain jealouſy reſpecting their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Let their rights be continually examined, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, diſcuſſed; let them accuſtom themſelves to cheriſh thoſe who, on every occaſion, remind them of theſe rights, as their beſt citizens. This reſtleſs and anxious ſpirit becomes all free ſtates; but it is indiſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in complicated conſtitutions, where freedom is mingled with a certain degree of ſubordination, ſuch as naturally reſults from a connection between countries ſeparated by an immenſe ocean. This vigilance muſt prove the ſureſt guardian of that union, which ſhould bind inſeparably the mother-country and her colonies together.</p>
            <p>Should adminiſtration, for ever compoſed of ambitious men, even in the freeſt ſtates, attempt to augment the power of the crowm, or the opulence of the capital, at the expence of the colonies, they ſhould oppoſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible reſiſtance to ſuch uſurpation. Every encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of government repel'd by vigorous remonſtrances, is almoſt conſtantly check'd; while thoſe grievances, the redreſs of which the people have not the courage to inſiſt on, are uniformly followed by new oppreſſions. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in general are more formed to feel than to think; they have no other idea of the legality of a power than the very exerciſe of it. Habituated to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Above all, in ſtates where the principles of legiſlation are confounded with thoſe of religion, even as one extravagant tenet, is ſufficient to introduce a thouſand other to minds already deceived, ſo the firſt encroachment of government opens a door to every ſucceeding one. Who believes the moſt believes the leaſt; who can do the moſt can do the leaſt; it is by this double abuſe of credulity and of power that
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014417_0022_0F9263FFC177DAC0"/>
all the abſurdities and iniquities in matters of religion and of politics, have crept into the world to debaſe and cruſh mankind; happily that ſpirit of toleration and of liberty which hath hitherto reign'd in the Engliſh colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, hath preſerved them from this extremity of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and of miſery. They feel the dignity of human nature ſufficiently to reſiſt oppreſſion, were it at the hazard of their lives.</p>
            <p>This enlightened people know very well that violent meaſures and the laſt appeal can only be juſtified, when every gentle means of conciliation hath been tried in vain. They know alſo that reduced to the dire alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native of ſlavery or civil war, if they muſt take up arms in defence of liberty, it is their duty to avoid fullying ſo fair a cauſe by the horrors and barbarities which are the attendants of ſedition: and that with the determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed purpoſe of never ſheathing the ſword till they have recovered their rights, they ſhould deem the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of their original their conſtitutional independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, a ſufficient fruit of their victory.</p>
            <p>And in fact we ſhould be cautious how we confound that reſiſtance which the Engliſh colonies ought to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the mother-country, with the fury of a people driven by a laſting and intolerable oppreſſion to revolt againſt their ſovereign. When once the ſlave of deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm hath burſt his chains aſunder, hath committed his fate to the deciſion of the ſword, he is obliged to maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre his tyrant, to exterminate his race and his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to change the form of that government of which he had been the victim through ſucceſſive ages. If he durſt not do all this, ſooner or later he would be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for poſſeſſing but a half-courage. The yoke would fall back upon his head with additional force and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and the feigned moderation of his tyrants would prove but a new toil in which he would find himſelf caught and entangled forever.
