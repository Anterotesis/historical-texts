            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <hi>My</hi> LORD,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Now proceed to conclude my narrative of my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to get quarters for the King's troops until I found myſelf at the end of my ſtring, and could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more.</p>
               <p>On Saturday October 15, General Gage arrived here with his officers to look to the quartering the troops himſelf. On Monday I called a Council in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and introduced the General. He told them that he was reſolved to quarter the two Regiments now here in Town, and demanded Quarters; and that he ſhould reſerve the Barracks at the Caſtle for the Iriſh Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or ſuch part of them as they would contain; which has ſince been determined to be only one Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After the General had left the Board, I ſat at it until Eight o'Clock at night; two hours after Dinner time excepted. The whole was a ſcene of Perverſion, to avoid their doing any thing towards quartering the Troops, unworthy of ſuch a Body. In the courſe of the Queſtions I put to them, they denied that they knew of any Building belonging to the Province in the Town of Boſton that was proper to be fitted up for Barracks; and they denied that the Manufactory Houſe was ſuch
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:011179_0002_0F862C6029550248"/>
a Building. This was ſo notoriouſly contrary to Truth, that ſome Gentlemen expreſſed their Concern that it ſhould remain upon the Minutes; and to induce me to conſent to its being expunged a motion was made in writing that the Governor be deſired to order the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactory Houſe to be cleared of its preſent Inhabitants that it might be fitted up for the Reception of ſuch part of the two Iriſh Regiments as could not be accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Caſtle Barracks. This was violently oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but was carried in the affirmative 6 to 5: Upon this I ordered the former anſwers to be expunged. This Reſolution amounting to an aſſignment of the Caſtle Barracks for the Iriſh Regiments effectually put an End to the Objection before made that no Quarters were due in Town until the Caſtle Barracks were filled.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be done was to clear the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Houſe, the preventing of which was a great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Sons of Liberty. For this purpoſe about ſix or ſeven Weeks before, when the Report of Troops coming here was firſt confirmed, all kinds of people were thruſt into this Building; and the Workhouſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was opened, and the People confined there were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to go into the Manufactory Houſe. This was admitted to be true in Council by one of the Board who is an Overſeer of the Poor and a principal therein. And after the Order of Council was known, ſeveral of the Chiefs of the Faction went into the Manufactory Houſe, adviſed the people there to keep Poſſeſſion againſt the Governor's Order, and promiſed them Support. And when ſome of them ſignified their Intention to quit the Houſe, they were, that if they quit the Houſe, they muſt quit the Town, for they would be killed if they ſtaid in it.</p>
               <p>I had the advice of the beſt Lawyers that according to the Law and Uſage of this Country the Owners of an Houſe occupied by Tenants at Sufferance, or wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Poſſeſſors might enter by any Means they could and turn them out of Poſſeſſion without bringing an action. It was alſo certain that the Governor and Council, when the Aſſembly was not ſitting, were perfect Owners of the Eſtates belonging to the Province, except for Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enation.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011179_0002_0F862C6029550248"/>
Upon theſe two principles I appointed the Sheriff and two of his Deputies Bailiffs of the Governor and Council for the purpoſe of removing the People out of the Manufactory Houſe. The Sheriff was refuſed admittance: upon which the Chief Juſtice went with him and adviſed them to give up the Houſe; He was anſwered that they had the Opinion of the beſt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer in the Province to keep Poſſeſſion. Upon a third attempt the Sheriff finding a Window open, entered; upon which the People gathered about him and ſhut him up; he than made a Signal to an Officer without, who brought a Party of Soldiers, who took Poſſeſſion of the Yard of the Building and relieved the Sheriff from his Confinement.—This occaſioned a great Mob to aſſemble with ſome of the Chiefs of the Faction, they were very abuſive againſt the Soldiers, but no Miſchief was done. They kept the Houſe blockaded all that Day, and beſt part of the next Day. When ſome of the Council declaring that it was not intended to uſe Force, altho' they knew it could not be done without, and the Building not being immediately wanted, the Soldiers were withdrawn on the Evening of the ſecond Day. Thus this Building belonging to the Government and aſſigned by the Governor and Council for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Uſe, is kept filled with the Outcaſt of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and the Scum of the Town to prevent it's being uſed for the accommodations of the King's Troops.</p>
               <p>After this was over there was nothing more to be done with the Council until the Soldiers were billited in the Public Houſes as far as they would go. This we knew would never be done; but it muſt be attempted; and the Council left this Buſineſs to me alone without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their aſſiſtance, which in other Caſes has been uſual, Indeed I did not aſk them, as I did not think the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs would be forwarded by my aſſociating them. I therefore ſummoned all the acting Juſtices to meet me in the Council. Twelve of them appeared; I acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that the General demanded Quarters for the 2 Regiments according to the Act of Parliament. They deſired to take it into Conſideration among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011179_0003_0F862C61782BA380"/>
I conſented, and we parted. Two Juſtices, two Days after this, attended me with an Anſwer in writing, whereby the whole Body refuſed to billet the Soldiers. But theſe Gentlemen informing me that the Juſtices had been much influenced by the Argument that the Barracks at the Caſtle ought to have been firſt filled, &amp;c. I ſhewed them the Minutes of the Council whereby the Barracks at the Caſtle were aſſigned to the Iriſh Regiments, and they muſt be conſidered as full. This was quite new to them, the Council themſelves having overlooked the Effect of their Vote. I gave them a Copy of this Vote, and returned the Anſwer deſiring them to reconſider it. Three Days after the ſame Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen informed me that they had reſolved againſt bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leting the Soldiers, but could not agree upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be aſſigned for refuſing it; but the next Day they gave me an Anſwer in writing, (a Copy of which is here incloſed) ſigned by Eight of the Juſtices; two others were againſt billeting, and gave other Reaſons for their Refuſal; two others were for billeting, but declined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by themſelves after ſo large a Majority of the whole Body had declared for the contrary Opinion.</p>
               <p>To ſhew the futility of theſe Pretences, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the Act directs the billeting to be by Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Tything Men, Magiſtrates, and other Civil Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and in their Default or Abſence by any one Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Peace. The uſual Conſtruction of this Act has been that Magiſtrates, ſhould grant the Billets, and Conſtables deliver them; and the latter being Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cannot grant Billets without a Magiſtrate or Juſtice ordering them; By Magiſtrates have been always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Magiſtrates of Corporations, and where a Town is not a Corporation, the Juſtices are the only Magiſtrates who are applied to in England, and they deliver the Billets to the Conſtables, who ſerve them upon the Public Houſes. Now in this Town of Boſton there are no Perſons come under the Denominations but Juſtices and Conſtables. As to the Seleſt-Men to whom the Juſtices are ſuppoſed to refer, they have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by themſelves, by the Council, and by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verner
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011179_0003_0F862C61782BA380"/>
to be neither Magiſtrates, nor Civil Officers; and they certainly are not, for they can neither grant nor execute a Warrant. This I explained fully to the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices before they gave their final Anſwer; but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; they being determined to refuſe at all Events. Thus we have an Act of Parliament which is become a great Favourite; for with the comments it has received here it is become in fact An Act to prevent His Majeſty's Troops being quartered in the Town of Boſton.</p>
               <p>Immediately after I held a Council, and informed the Board of the refuſal of the Juſtices to billet the Soldiers. I ſaid that I was now at the end of my Tether; for as they had declared before, that they would adhere to the Act of Parliament, and had refuſed to act in that liberal way which I thought was their Duty when the King's neceſſary Service was obſtructed, I could propoſe nothing further to them. For I foreſaw that if I propoſed to hire and fit up Houſes &amp;c. for the Troops, they would anſwer that it did not become their Buſineſs 'till the Public Houſes were full. But if any Gentleman thought it was to any purpoſe to put ſuch a queſtion I was ready to do it: this was declined by Silence. I then inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that by reaſon of this general Refuſal of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the General found himſelf obliged to hire and fit up Houſes at the Expence of the Crown for the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Troops, who now (Oct. 26) eſpecially they who were Encamped, began to feel the want of warm Quarters and as he thought the Expence would ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately fall upon the Province, he deſired that I would appoint a Commiſſary to join with and aſſiſt his Officers in providing ſuch Houſes, eſpecially with regard to the oeconomy of the Expence. I therefore deſired their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Aſſiſtance in making ſuch appointment. This, after a long Debate, was refuſed, they ſaying that if they ſhould join in ſuch Appointment it would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that the Province ought to be charged with the Expence; and I could appoint Auditors to examine the Accounts without them. I thereupon put an End to this Buſineſs, having been Employed in it from Sept. 19th to Oct. 26th in all 38 Days, without any proſpect
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011179_0004_0F862C61A393C5D8"/>
of doing any thing to purpoſe, but under an Obligation of trying every Effort before I gave it up.</p>
               <p>During this time the General, who foreſaw how this Negociation would end, had employed his Officers to hire and fit up Houſes for the Troops; ſo that by the time I had received the definitive Refuſal, compleat Quarters were provided for all the Troops. But now another difficulty aroſe; If the Soldiers ſhould be put into Barracks, tho' provided by the Crown, without the intervention of a Magiſtrate, the military Officers who placed them there would be chargeable with tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them to quarter Soldiers otherwiſe than by this Act, and being convicted of it by two Juſtices of Peace would be Caſhired ipſo facto. This Clauſe was depended upon to oblige the Soldiers to quit the Town after they had found it impracticable to get Quarters according to the Act of Parliament, and was part of the Original Plan which I mentioned to your Lordſhip very early. And it could not be expected that the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices who had refuſed to billet the Soldiers would place them in other quarters, for that would be to contradict themſelves. I therefore took upon myſelf to remove that difficulty, and by a Commiſſion, wherein I recited his Majeſty's Command to me to take every neceſſary Step for the accommodation of the ſaid Troops, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral means by which the Execution of the Act for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Quarters for the Troops was defeated, and the Obligation I was thereby put under to provide Quarters for the Troops in the beſt manner I could, I authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a perſon therein named, to place the ſaid two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſuch Buildings and Houſes as could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured at the expence of the Crown with the conſent of the Owners. Thus has ended the Buſineſs of Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two Regiments.—As for Proviſion for them at Boſton, according to the Act of Parliament, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn how the Order of Council for that purpoſe was annulled and avoided in the Origination of it. Proviſion has been made at Caſtle William by an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Council being made that the Provincial Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

ſhould take care of it. But they have refuſed to make ſuch an Order for the Troops at Boſton; and therefore it is not done nor like to be done.</p>

               <p>WHEN I received your Lordſhip's Letter No. 16. I immediately communicated it to the Lieutenant Governor; and we both agreed in Opinion, that it could not be adviſeable to lay before the Council any part of it except what related to the providing for the Troops, until the Troops were got into Quarters: as we fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that the buſineſs of quartering the Troops would occaſion a good deal of Trouble and poſſible ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſion, and it would not be adviſeable to bring on too much buſineſs at once; at leaſt until the Town was a little ſettled. This buſineſs of quartering your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will obſerve, kept me employ'd 'till October 26th, on which day I had ſummoned a General Council. On this day I had 19 Counſellors, that is all but 3: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore choſe this Time to communicate the other Parts of your Lordſhip's Letter, except what relates to the call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Aſſembly, which I had reſerved until I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived further Orders about it. I made this communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by an Extract, which after it was read I left in the Secretary's Hands, that the Gentlemen might pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe it at their leiſure: I cautioned the Secretary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuffering a Copy to be taken, but did not reſtrain him from permitting it being read. I alſo gave another
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011179_0005_0F862C63F2B6AE68"/>
Copy of the ſame extract to the firſt Commiſſioner of the Cuſtoms, engaging him to keep it in his own Hands and not let a Copy be taken.</p>
               <p>Immediately after I had an Occaſion to move a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that would ſhew their Diſpoſition to pay a proper Regard to his Majeſty's Commands. The Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had wrote to me, deſiring that I would take the Advice of Council whether they might return to Town, and reaſſume their functions, with Safety to themſelves and Officers. I communicated this Letter to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and put the Queſtion to them. This was very em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſing: If they anſwered Yea, they would be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable with adviſing the Return of the Commiſſioners: if they ſaid No, they would contradict all their Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that there was no Occaſion for Troops to ſupport the Civil Power. They therefore, for above two Hours together, uſed all kind of evaſions to avoid giving an Anſwer. I was told that they were not obliged to give Opinions: I anſwered that they were obliged to give Advice; and the Queſtion was put, whether they would adviſe me to aſſure the Commiſſioners that they might return with Safety. At laſt I was obliged to tell them that if they would not give me an Anſwer, I would take their refuſal for an Anſwer in the Negative: For if they could anſwer in the Affirmative, no Reaſon could be ſuppoſed why they ſhould not give an Anſwer; and if they could not anſwer in the Affirmative, they muſt reconcile it with their public Declarations of the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Peaceableneſs of the Town as well as they could. At length I got an Anſwer, 12 anſwering in the Affirmative, 5 declining anſwering becauſe they liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of Town, and 2 giving written Anſwers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Commiſſioners for going out of the Town, and therefore refuſing Advice about their Return, but concluding that all Perſons would be ſafe. In this Council I ſat from 11 to 9, two intermediate Hours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and all the Buſineſs might have been very well done in an Hour or Two by practicable Men,</p>
               <p>Before this Council met, I had been informed that ſome of the Board had been preparing an Addreſs to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011179_0005_0F862C63F2B6AE68"/>
the General, to remove the Troops from hence, that at this Meeting they might get a great number of Hands to it. When the Council broke up, I heard ſome of them making an Appointment to meet there the next Morning. I told them that I underſtood that they were going on with Buſineſs as a Council ſeperately from me; but I cautioned them againſt proceeding. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that they ſhould not act as a Council, but as private Gentlemen. I then deſired that they would not give their Meetings the appearance of a Council, by holding them in the Council Chamber. They met the next Day and ſettled the Addreſs, which was very much ſoftened from the firſt Draught, which I am told was much more virulent againſt the Commiſſioners. It was ſigned by 15 of the Council, among whom were the 5 who knew not enough of the Town to Vote for the ſafety of the Commiſſioners returning, but knew enough to join in an invective againſt them; 4 refuſed to ſign. It was then preſented to the General, who obſerved to them, that the Reſolves of the Town-Meeting were a ſufficient Cauſe for ſending Troops here, tho' there had been no Riots: It was anſwered that they were the productions of a few imprudent wrong-headed Men. The General replied that they were ſaid to be <hi>unanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouſly</hi> reſolved in a <hi>full</hi> Town-Meeting. The next Monday it appeared in all the public Papers, from whence I ſend your Lordſhip the incloſed Copy.</p>
               <p>I ſhall make but few Obſervations on the Writings, the Intent of it being plain enough.—1. It is well known to your Lordſhip that this Kind of Writings is deſigned for the People and not for the Perſons to whom thy are addreſſed, This is notorious in the preſent caſe: The Gentlemen who moved this Buſineſs knew very well that the General could not move the Troops from this Town, if he could have been diſpoſed to do it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſent hither by Order of his Majeſty, and not placed here by the Diſcretion of the General. The General himſelf had told them ſo, and I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated it to them again and again to induce them to aſſiſt the Quartering. As therefore they could not expect the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011179_0006_0F862C64B1379048"/>
Troops would be withdrawn, we muſt look for another purpoſe of this Addreſs; and it appears to be, as indeed it is the principal ſubject of it, the Abuſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.—2. This was ſurely very ill timed: the very day after they had been made acquainted with his Majeſty's Command and Expectation that the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners ſhould return to Boſton and reſume their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and would return without Reſiſtance and with Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to publiſh a Manifeſto againſt them, which as it had nothing new in it could only ſerve to revive the popular Prejudices againſt them, and thereby encourage Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and make their Safety precarious, is unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Men of this Rank, and inconſiſtant with their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Profeſſions of their Regard for the King's Service. —3. This is alſo very unreaſonable, it being the Day after the Commiſſioners had ſignified their Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Danger in returning to Boſton, and deſired the Advice of the Council concerning it, and the Council had given their Opinion, that they might return with Safety. For theſe Counſellors who had one Day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged their coming to Town, the very next Day to iſſue a Writing under their Hands holding them forth to the People "As Men whoſe Avarice having ſmother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Breaſts every Sentiment of Humanity towards this Province, has impelled them to oppreſs it to the utmoſt of their Power," is utterly irreconcilable with my ideas of Truth, Juſtice and Humanity, and ſhocks me the more, as I know that the Wives of two of the Commiſſioners, who have young Children, did not want to have their Fears increaſed by this Publication.</p>
               <p>It would have been unaccountable how ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſo reſpectable a Station, and many of them of a reſpectable Character, could join in ſigning ſuch a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if we did not conſider that in public and popular Proceedings the Leaders are few and the followers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and that the People called upon to ſign Papers, frequently act without Conſideration, and ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Judgment. And the virulence with which the Commiſſioners have been treated ſeems to be too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent to be the effect of public Zeal only, without the

               </opener>
               <p>AFTER I had communicated your Lordſhips Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Council, I conſidered that ſome farther Notification of it would be neceſſary in regard to what related to the preſervation of the Peace and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Officers of the revenue, eſpecially as the Commiſſioners had fixed upon this Week for their return to Boſton. A Proclamation was not thought Proper, as the Buſineſs was in a manner confined to the Town of Boſton. I therefore thought of a Letter from myſelf to the Juſtices of Boſton, and accordingly drew one up wherein I recited ſuch part of your Lordſhip's Letter as related to them, and their Buſineſs, and thereto added Injunctions and Admonitions of my own. I communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated this to the Council laſt Wedneſday, propoſing, if it had their Approbation, to call the Juſtices together, and deliver it to them by word of Mouth, and then gave them Copies of it. But tho' no exceptions were taken to particulars the whole was objected too ſtrongly for this Reaſon; that if they were to conſent to this Letter they ſhould appear to approve of the Cenſures your Lordſhip has paſſed upon the Town, which they would not admit it had deſerved. I told them that I would not enter into an Argument which might tend to impeach the Truth or Juſtice of your Lordſhip's
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011179_0007_0F862C6602FC1190"/>
Letter, but I obſerved that both of them were very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, being founded upon notorious facts, which could not be denied or undoubted.</p>
               <p>I then propoſed another method of informing the Juſtices; which was to call the Juſtices together, and after reading ſuch part of your Lordſhip's Letter as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to their Buſineſs. to give them a general Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition concerning their future Conduct. This was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to, for that an admonition implied a Cenſure. This I anſwered by ſhewing, that they really did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Cenſure, and by declaring that I would uſe them tenderly in that Reſpect. But I found that I ſhould never prevail with the Council to <hi>act</hi> in this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: that they would not <hi>adviſe</hi> to any method of notifying, enjoyning or enforcing the Orders contained in your Lordſhip's Letter; and that I could make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them but <hi>paſſive</hi> Aſſociates. I propoſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they ſhould meet in the Council the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I would of my own accord and without their Advice, order the Juſtices to attend, and would admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them as I had before propoſed. This was at length aſſented to; though not without one Gentleman's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting againſt it. I accordingly the next day aſſembled the Juſtices and in the preſence of the Council having cauſed an Extract of your Lordſhip's Letter to be read, I entered into a full Explanation of the Nature of their Office and their Duty therein; and avoiding as much as I could, cenſuring them for their former Conduct, I ſhewed what would be expected of them for the future; and I concluded that if they had a mind to retrieve the Credit of the Town, it was not to be done by denying what was paſt, but by regulating what was to come: As ſoon as I had done, a Gentleman of the Council ſaid aloud he liked this very well; and the Juſtices ſeemed ſatisfied with this proceeding; and ſeveral of them gave aſſurances that they would do the beſt to preſerve the good order of the Town.</p>
               <p>Theſe two conferences with the Council paſſed with good Humour; and in the courſe of them I had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to obſerve upon and lament the Servility, in
<pb n="13"
                      facs="unknown:011179_0007_0F862C6602FC1190"

regard to the People, with which the Buſineſs of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was now done in compariſon to what uſed to be. This was not denied; and one Gentleman ſaid, That he did not now enter the Council Chamber with that free Mind he uſed to have: But he liked to be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in public Buſineſs, and did not chuſe to quit his Place in the Council, and therefore muſt be content to hold it upon ſuch Terms as he could. So fair a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion deſerves not to be paſſed unnoticed. But I ſhould not trouble your Lordſhip with ſuch trifling Anecdotes if they did not ſeem to me to be the beſt method to convey a true Idea of the preſent State of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to point out the chief cauſes of its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, and I muſt myſelf reſort to the cauſe I am now treating of, to ſhew why I have not executed the King's Commands in as full a manner as may be expected from me. But my Lord, the Council themſelves have for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four Months paſt taken great pains to ſhew from whence the imbicility of this Government ariſes; and have brought more forcible Arguments, than any one elſe could have urged, to ſhew how neceſſary it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that the King ſhould have the Council Chamber in his own Hands.

               </opener>
               <p>I come now to conſider that part of my Orders which relates to the reforming the bench of Juſtices: This is to be done by two ways, 1. by adding new Juſtices to the preſent Bench, either by engaging Gentlemen who are already in the Commiſſion to qualify themſelves,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011179_0008_0F862C669330FAA8"/>
or by granting new Commiſſions to fit Perſons who will undertake to Act; 2. by removing ſuch Perſons in the Commiſſion who are known to be infected with princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Diſaffection to the conſtitutional Authority of Parliment. The firſt of theſe is practicable in both its Branches; the ſecond is at preſent abſolutely impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and will remain ſo while the Council make the humouring the People their chief Object.</p>
               <p>In regard to the firſt I have already made ſome At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to engage ſome Gentlemen now in the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to qualify themſelves, and ſhall purſue it; And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Undertaking is very diſcouraging, I expect I ſhall have ſome Succeſs. I have alſo made an Eſſay to appoint new Juſtices who would engage to Act, by naming one very fit Perſon. It was receiv'd very cooly by the Council and upon my aſking the Reaſon, I was told he was not popular; I replied that if he had been I ſhould not have named him. As he was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in every other Reſpect a moſt unexceptionable Man, it paſſed unanimouſly: but it gave me to know what I muſt expect if I propoſed a Man <hi>who was not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular</hi> againſt whom any Exception could be taken. But I ſhall try ſoon again.</p>
               <p>As for removing Perſons for their Oppoſition to the Authority of Parliament by means of a Council the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of which has (indirectly at leaſt) avowed the ſame Principles, and now appears to Act in Concert with that Party from whence the Oppoſition to Parliament origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, it would be an Attempt contrary to all Rules of Policy and Prudence. It would require to be done by a public Enquiry, which would receive all the Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and embarraſſment which the Chicanery of Law could invent; and if after all, full proof of Diſaffection to the Authority of Parliament ſhould be made, it would be declared not to be relevant to infer ſuch a Cenſure. It would be therefore in vain to attempt to puniſh Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection to the Authority of Parliament, until the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minality is better eſtabliſhed than it is at preſent. To ſupport this Conjecture in what manner the Council would Act in ſuch a Proceeding, I need only refer your
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011179_0008_0F862C669330FAA8"/>
Lordſhip to their Conduct and the Papers they have publiſhed within theſe two Months laſt paſt.</p>
               <p>And yet, My Lord, I would not inſinuate that we have no fit Objects for ſuch a Cenſure; the Sons of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty have not been without Magiſtrates. We have ſeen Juſtices attending at Liberty tree; One to Adminiſter an Oath to the Stamp Maſter, when he was obliged to ſwear that he would not execute his Office, Another to perform the Function of Toaſt Maſter; a third, but lately, to conſult about fortifying the Town; others to make up a Proceſſion of 45 Carriages and 92 Perſons on the 14th of Auguſt laſt. All theſe are included in two Liſts which your Lordſhip has, that of the 5 Selectmen who ſigned the Circular Letter for the Convention, of which all but the firſt are in the Commiſſion, and that of the S Juſtices who ſigned the Refuſal to Pillet the Soldiers. Now if the Cenſure of theſe Proceedings ſhould produce an Order to me to Supercede the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of theſe Gentlemen, It would be a Trial of the Power of the Governor: It ſeems at preſent that the Council would not enable me to execute ſuch an Order.</p>
               <p>It is a great Defect in this Government that the King has no Power over the Commiſſions, which are grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Name and under his Seal. He can by Order in Council diſallow a Law which has paſſed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, Council and Houſe of Repreſentatives; But yet he cannot ſupercede a Commiſſion which has been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Governor and Council. And yet the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of this Province is as much out of the Controul of the King as the Houſe of Repreſentatives is. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems as reaſonable that the King ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to correct the Miſtakes of the Governor and Council, as of the Governor, Council and Houſe. As it is, when the Governor has once ſet the King's Seal to a Commiſſion, it is for ever out of the hands of the Crown, and the Perſons who has obtained it may thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth defy the King, oppoſe his Laws and inſult his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and be in no Danger of loſing his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is true, the Governor with the Advice of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil can ſupercede him; but if he acts in a Popular Cauſe,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011179_0009_0F862C66EB0CBC98"/>
under which Oppoſition to Government finds it eaſy to ſhelter itſelf, the Council, who are themſelves the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the People, will never join with the Governor in cenſuring <hi>the overflowings of Liberty.</hi> It may be ſaid that the Governor ſhould take care not to appoint any one whoſe Character is not well known. But the Governor does not perſonally know half of thoſe whom he appoints to Offices: it is not therefore in his Power to guard againſt Impoſition, let him be ever ſo cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Beſides a man's political Caracter often does not appear 'till he is got into an Office and thereby held forth to the Public: Hence it is not unuſual for a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who has diſtinguiſhed himſelf in Political Matters, to get himſelf recommended to the Governor, as a Man well diſpoſed to Government; and as ſoon as he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Commiſſion to declare for the Party of the Sons of Liberty. The Governor may reſent the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as he pleaſes; but can't undo what he has done. Thus the Commiſſions of the King like his Cannon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another occaſion, are turned againſt him.</p>
               <p>It would ſerve to remedy this abuſe and ſtrengthen Government, if the King was enabled by Order in his Privy Council to ſupercede Commiſſions granted in his Name, and under his Seal, when they ſhall appear to be granted to improper Perſons, or made uſe of for impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per purpoſes. This muſt be done by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and I don't ſee the Impropriety of ſuch an Act; it ſeems to me to be a proper power to be veſted in the Crown; eſpecially at a time when the Crown wants to be ſtrengthened by all legal means, in this Country. And it ſeems that it would be better to be done by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Act than a partial one; for ſuch a Power may be wanted in the Royal Governments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding the Controul the King has over the Councils. For is is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible, conſidering the Spirit which now prevails, that even a Royal Council may ſupport a Popular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate againſt the Intereſt of the Crown. And if the Colonies ſhould prevail to have the Judges Commiſſions during good behaviour, which ſome of them are now very earneſt about, it might be proper that the King in
<pb n="17"
                      facs="unknown:011179_0009_0F862C66EB0CBC98"

Council ſhould be empowered to judge and determine upon ſuch Miſbehaviour as would avoid the Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>But this will not be neceſſary if the general Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of granting no Commiſſions but during Pleaſure be continued and obſerved; nor will it be neceſſary that ſuch an Act ſhould be general; It is more wanted in this Government than in all the others together: and even hear the Defect would be cured by a Royal Council.</p>

               <p>I Think it proper to inform your Lordſhip that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Council that part of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Letter N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 19, in which your Lordſhip ſignified his Majeſty's gracious Reception of the Petition of the Council, which I tranſmitted in July laſt, and added, that the Petition with my reaſoning in ſupport of it would have full Conſideration. Upon which Mr. Bowdoin who has all along taken the Lead of the Council in their late extraordinary proceedings, charged me with having miſrepreſented the purpoſe of their Petition, by taking Advantage of an Expreſſion of theirs, "drawing a Revenue from the Colonies," and there from inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating that their Objection lay not ſo much againſt the raiſing money, as the carrying it out of the Country and not expending it here. And to Juſtify this, he quoted a tranſitory Converſation he had with me on the day of the Public Commencement at the College in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laſt. I told him that if the Converſation had made ſuch an impreſſion upon him, is was a pity he had not mentioned it before. Whilſt my Memory could inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in my behalf. That at this diſtance of time 5

months, I could not recollect every trifling Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for ſuch I was aſſured this was from his Report of it. But I could be certain whether I had or had not miſrepreſented their Petition by inſpecting my own Books. And before I looked at them, I could declare that I had not.</p>
               <p>My Letter Books were at my Country Houſe, where I generally write all my Letters. As ſoon as I got at them, I had the Letter in Queſtion, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, 11. July 16. copied: And as ſoon as I returned to Town, I read that part of it which related to this Buſineſs to three or four of the Council; and I let two of them and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary read the whole Letter; they were greatly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to find it ſo very clear of Mr. Bowdoin's charge, at the next Council I produced the Letter and read the whole Paſſage referred to: from whence it appeared that in mentioning the Prayer of their Petition, I uſed their own words without adding a ſingle word of my own: and alſo that the Argument I uſed in behalf of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er went againſt Taxation in general, more than the Diſpoſal of the money: This appeared ſatisfactory to the whole Council except Mr. Bowdoin. But he ſtill perſiſting in juſtifying himſelf mentioned ſomething more of the Converſation referred to which explained the whole, and ſhowed that what I ſaid upon that occaſion was entirely in Joke. This was confirmed by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, who recollected that on that day, being a day of Feſtivity, I did joke with ſome of them upon their Petition, to the ſame purpoſe as Mr. Bowdoin quoted, but in Terms that one could not have imagined could have been taken ſeriouſly, and really were quite inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to every one elſe.</p>
               <p>This is a very trifling matter to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with: but it has already been the ſubject of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in Council, and Libels in the News-papers. It would have have alſo produced a formal Remonſtrance to your Lordſhip, which I am told was actually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Gentlemen who made the charge, if it had not been prevented by my making Communications which, but for ſaving Trouble to your Lordſhip, I

               <p>THE Council have been for a week paſt preparing Petitions to the two Houſes of Parliament againſt the American Acts of Revenue, that is, as I underſtand, againſt all the Acts impoſing Port Duties. They ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified their intention to me, and deſired that I would either join with them, or authorize their ſitting for that purpoſe. I reminded them that I had refuſed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Buſineſs in July laſt, and the impropriety of this Meaſure was much ſtronger now than then. I added, that if they would be adviſed by me, they would not purſue this intention: which could do no good and might turn to evil; that if the Parliament was diſpoſed to indulge the Americans in another Repeal, there were Petitions enough before them to ground it upon; and their Petition at beſt would be but a Makeweight; on the other hand it might contain ſomething that might give Offence, and add to the Ill humour which I fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already prevailed againſt this Province. But all this and more had no Effect: The movers of this Buſineſs
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011179_0011_0F862C6865A6AC00"/>
called the Council together ſeperatety from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in the Council Chamber according to the new me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, for which they apologized in the Petition. After ſeveral days Meeting, the Petition was ſettled and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: Upon which there was a diſpute how it ſhould be ſigned, whether by every one as private Perſons as in the Addreſs to General Gage, or by the Preſident in the name of the Body; in which latter Caſe they muſt be underſtood to act as the Legiſlative Council, there being no Preſident of the Privy Council but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. However it was reſolved it ſhould be ſignified in the latter way.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I Learned it was finiſhed, I ſent for Mr. Danforth the Preſident, and deſired to ſee it: he went and procured it for me. I found it was ſigned "in the name and by the order of a Majority of the Council S. Danforth." Mr. Danforth ſaid he was not preſent when this manner of ſigning was reſolved upon; and when he ſat his name to it, he did not ſet the word "Preſident" after his name: this was a poor Excuſe, but ſerves to ſhow how little free Agency there is in a Buſineſs of this kind: He alſo added that if he could get the Council to meet again, he was in hopes they would undo this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; for ſeveral of them had ſignified their Diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of it. But I had no ſuch Expectation; for the Council is brought under ſuch an awe of their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents by the frequent Removals of the Friends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that there is very little Exerciſe for private Judgment in popular Queſtions.</p>
               <p>If by the Majority of the Council, in whoſe name the Preſident is to ſign, they mean a Majority of the whole Board, I cannot conceive that all the Perſons who met at the ſeveral Meetings upon this Occaſion put together amount to the Number 12, which is the Majority of the whole. But if they mean a Majority of thoſe preſent when the Reſolution was formed, it may fall very ſhort of the Majority of the Body: Four Perſons will make a Majority of a Quorum of the Council. In the preſent caſe I doubt whether the Number of thoſe who really approved of this Meaſure was much more: For it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011179_0011_0F862C6865A6AC00"/>
to be rather ſubmitted to than joined in. As for the Petition itſelf, it is very lengthy, being ſix Folio Pages, but has nothing new in it, nothing I believe, but what is to be found among the Writings of the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives. It differs from the Petition to the King in this: The latter carefully avoids all Claim of Right againſt the Parliament; this is not ſo clear of it: It has indeed no poſitive Aſſertions of Right, but ſeveral Intimations of it too plain to be unnoticed. This Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is taken only from once reading it, and therefore may not be free from Miſtakes, tho' I believe it is right as to the general Idea.</p>

               <p>IN my laſt from New-York, I had the Honor to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your Lordſhip of my intention to go to Boſton; I arrived here on the 12th Inſt. And tho' Lieutenant Colonel Dairymple had done every thing in his Power previous to my Arrival to procure Quarters for the two Regiments from Hallifax, I found one of thoſe Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011179_0012_0F862C69261A97C8"/>
encamped, and the other lodged in the Market-Hall.</p>
               <p>I immediately made Application in Perſon to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor in Council, that the Troops might have Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the public Houſes, as far as they could be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated therein, and that Orders might be given for that Purpoſe to the inferior Magiſtrates: and that Out Houſes, &amp;c. might be prepared for the remainder; to which I Begged a deciſive Anſwer, that I might fall upon Meaſures to put the Troops under Cover, as the Winter approached.</p>
               <p>I ſoon found that the Council had put a Conſtruction upon the Mutiny Act for North-America, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it of no Effect, for the Purpoſes of Marching and Quartering the Troops, viz.
<q>That whatever Place in a Province the King's Troops ſhould be ordered to, they could not be Quartered in that Place, 'till all the Barracks in the Province, however diſtant from it, were firſt filled with Troops;</q> from thence the Council inferred, that no Quarters could be had in the Town, till the Barracks in Caſtle Iſland were filled; and further, that the Buſineſs of Quartering did not come properly before them, but in the laſt Inſtance, when not only the Barracks in Queſtion, but alſo the public Houſes ſhould be filled with Troops, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Magiſtrates to do, and was an affair that did not belong to them; It was in vain to ſet forth that the Barracks in Caſtle Iſland would be occupied by the Troops expected from Ireland, or to urge the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of a Conſtruction of the Act of Parliament, which annihilated the Act; as it abſolutely impeded the March of the Troops thro' the Province, as well as the King's Right to order his Troops to any Town or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage where his Service might require them to be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to</p>
               <p>The next Step to be taken was, to make Application to the Magiſtrates, to Quarter the Troops in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Houſes; and a Queſtion aroſe, who were the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates? The Select-Men refuſed being concerned, and declared they were not Magiſtrates, which was agreed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011179_0012_0F862C69261A97C8"/>
to; and it then became neceſſary to apply to the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Peace, the Difficulty then was, to find any of the Juſtices who would act in the Buſineſs of Billeting, and ſome of them were to be tried, who gave Aſſurances of their readineſs to carry on the King's Service, but ſaid it was hard, that they only ſhould be pitched upon for ſuch an undertaking, and to become the Objects of public Odium, when there were ſo many more Juſtices in the Town, to take their Share of it. This produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Reſolution to aſſemble all the Juſtices of the Town, and I attended Governor Bernard to their Meeting, where he required it of them conjunctly, and of each ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately, to Billet the Troops in the Public Houſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Act of Parliament: they deſired Time to conſider of a Meaſure which they ſaid muſt be very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the People, and might be attended with bad Conſequences. After ſome days Conſideration, they returned for Anſwer, that the Act did not require them to Quarter Troops, or words to that Effect.</p>
               <p>I relate the above Tranſactions to your Lordſhip, in a ſummary Way, leaving it to Governor Bernard to tranſmit to your Lordſhip, the particular Reſolves of his Council at their ſeveral Meetings on the Subject of providing Quarters as well as a Copy of the Reſolution of the Juſtices upon the ſame Subject.</p>
               <p>There was no Diſappointment in the bad Succeſs of theſe ſeveral Applications; it was known before hand that they would have no Effect; but it was proper to try, to get the Laws enforced. Governor Bernard therefore agreed in the Neceſſity of making Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to put the Troops under Cover, by hiring of emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Houſes, or other Buildings proper for the Purpoſe, and that a particular Account ſhould be kept of the Expences incurred therein, as alſo of all Neceſſaries required in Quartering, that the Governor may require a Reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſement of the ſame, from the firſt Aſſembly, that ſhall be Summoned to meet. But as it may be uncertain where the Expence will fall in the End, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to have every Thing prepared, with as much Frugality as poſſible, and the King's Barrack Maſter is
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011179_0013_0F862C69ED58CF78"/>
ordered to repair here from Hallifax with all the ſpare Bedding and Utenſils in thoſe Stores, and a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Coals, carried thither by the Troops from Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſbourg.</p>
               <p>The Council after ſome time, gave Governor Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard a power over the Barracks at Caſtle Iſland as well as over a public Building in the Town, called the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactory Houſe: The Barracks are ſaid to have been built, to hold one thouſand Men, but I find they were only temporary Lodgments for Soldiers during the laſt War, before they embarked, and the ſhort time they ſtaid, made it immaterial whether they were crowded or not. I find upon examination they will not hold above one Regiment, upon the preſent Eſtabliſhment, and that by putting 12 Men in a Room of 18 Feet ſquare. As for the Manufactory Houſe, there are People in it who have been ſpirited up to maintain Poſſeſſion, and ſome Meaſures were taken, tho' without Effect, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them, which occaſioned a little Diſturbance of no Conſequence, and only ſerved to ſhow a moſt obſtinate ſpirit of Oppoſition to every meaſure of Government. When the Regiments arrive from Ireland, one of them will be quartered in the Barracks in Caſtle Iſland, and the other muſt be lodged in the Town, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the two Regiments from Hallifax.</p>
               <p>Caſtle William remains garriſon'd by the Company kept up by the Province, and I find there is a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial military Eſtabliſhment ſupported there, under the Command of the Governor, of ſome Uſe and Emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him and the Lieutenant-Governor, upon that account, and not ſeeing any abſolute neceſſity for it, I have not interfered in any Matters concerning the Fort, or inſiſted on putting a Garriſon of the King's Troops into it. But if the King ſhould incline to make any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the diſpoſitions of his Forces, by ſtationing one or two Regiments in this Province for the time to come, his Majeſty may think it right to put Caſtle Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam into the Poſſeſſion of his own Troops; but as in that Caſe, I apprehend the Province would grant no Funds to maintain it, the Expence thereof will fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011179_0013_0F862C69ED58CF78"/>
the Crown. The Fort may be made to contain two or thee Companies of Foot, and a Detachment of the Royal Regiment of Artillery. But as for the Barracks near it, ſituated on a ſmall Iſland, where there is not room for Troops to move, and at ſuch a diſtance from the Town of Boſton, they will not anſwer any deſign or purpoſe of ſtationing Troops there for the ſervice of the Town. And if any Number of Troops ſhould be fixed in this Province, I would take the liberty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that Barracks ſhould be built for them within the Town, on a vacant Spot called Fort-Hill, an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Situation, whereon a Fort formerly ſtood; and Governor Bernard tells me it belongs to the Crown. A new Fort may hereafter be erected there, if his Majeſty's Affairs ſhould require it.</p>
               <p>Every Art and Evaſion has been tried by the major part of the People of every Degree, to force the Troops to quit the Town for want of Quarters, whilſt thoſe, who may have acted or made known their Sentiments in favor of Government declared they durſt not ſtay in the Town, but muſt remove with their Families and Effects, if the Troops ſhould leave it. When the Houſes where ready to receive the Troops, the Officers were threatned with the Clauſe of the Mutiny Act againſt Officers, who preſume to take upon themſelves to quarter Troops, &amp;c and to prevent their being put to any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on that account by perverting the Act in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as had been done in ſo many others, Governor Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard gave a particular Warrant to a Commiſſary, againſt. whom no Action could lye, to quarter the Soldiers in the Houſes fitted up for their Reception. I would take the liberty, my Lord, to repreſent, that the Clauſe in queſtion is by no means calculated for the Circumſtances of this Country, where every Man ſtudies Law, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets the Laws as ſuits his purpoſes, and where the Meaſures of Government are oppoſed by every Evaſion and Chicane that can be deviſed. An Officer, of Rank and long Service may be caſhiered by the management of two Juſtices of the Peace, the beſt of them the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a paltry Tavern, who ſhall find Evaſions to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011179_0014_0F862C6AB3BE3740"/>
the Clauſes of the Mutiny Act, which they diſlike, and to pervert the Senſe and Meaning of others to ſerve their Deſigns againſt him, and unhappily it might be found in ſome Places, that thoſe who ſhould reverſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous Convictions of Juſtices of the Peace, were no better than the Juſtices who ſhould have granted the Certificates of Conviction. I troubled his Majeſty's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary at War ſome time ago with ſome very unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Proceedings againſt an Officer on account of the Clauſe in queſtion, which happened to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>After other Methods had been tried to get the Troops away. I received an Addreſs from a number of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Members of the Council, in which they aim at juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the People againſt many Miſrepreſentations of their Conduct, blaming the Commiſſioners of his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's Cuſtoms, and begging the Troops may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the Town. I have the honor to tranſmit your Lordſhip the Addreſs and Anſwer thereto.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who would juſtify or rather palliate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the People here, complain, that they have been groſly miſrepreſented, and every little Diſturbance that has happened, been magnified into dangerous Riots; that the Diſturbance in March was trifling, that of the 10th of June was occaſioned ſolely by the Imprudence of the Commiſſioners: they excuſe the Reſolves made at the Town Meetings, by attributing them only to the extravagance of a few mad People, and aver that the Convention was called with no other Intent, than to take proper Meaſures, to preſerve the Peace and Tranquility of the Province.</p>
               <p>I am to obſerve upon the above, that according to the beſt Information I have been able to procure, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance in March was trifling, that conſidering what had happened reſpecting Seizures, the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms had Reaſon to act as they did, reſpecting the Seizure which occaſioned the Riots on the 10th of June which was conſiderable; and tho' I do not find that they were, at that time perſonally attacked, yet the Aſſault upon ſome of their Officers, and the threats
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011179_0014_0F862C6AB3BE3740"/>
daily thrown out againſt themſelves was certainly a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reaſon to make them apprehenſive of Danger to their own Perſons. Whether any harm would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually happened to them, had they remained in the Town, it is not poſſible to judge. With reſpect to the Reſolves procured by ſome mad People at the Town Meetings, thoſe mad People have governed the Town, and influenced the Province, a very long Time, and after Publiſhing their very dangerous Reſolves in the Town Meeting of the 13th of September laſt, carried the Motion for convening Deputies from the ſeveral Towns; and the Deputies convened accordingly. I ſhall only obſerve on this that their intentions were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious, and that I am happy, the Troops from Halifax arrived at the time they did.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms are ſtill in Caſtle William, and upon being aſked about their Return to Boſton, one of them ſaid, there were Troops now to ſupport them, but deſired to know if there was any, or what Civil Officer, who would undertake to aſk the Aſſiſtance of the Troops, if there ſhould be Occaſion for it. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but neither could be anſwerable that any Civil Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer would undertake it.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip will naturally imagine that ſince the Troops are here to ſupport the Dignity of Government and a due Execution of the Laws that the Powers of Government are reverted into the Hands, where the Conſtitution has Placed them, and that the Civil Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers would immediately avail themſelves of ſo good an Opportunity to reſtore Affairs to their proper Order, and put the Laws in Execution, againſt thoſe who ſhould dare to violate them; This is not yet the Caſe, and it is plainly ſeen even amongſt the few Magiſtrates, of whom it is ſaid, that they have a real Wiſh, and deſire to ſupport Government, and do their Duty, that there is a fear of acting contrary to the general Sentiments of their Fellow Citizens, and a deſire to maintain a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of Popularity amongſt them, which prevents them from being particular in the Execution of their
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011179_0015_0F862C6BE7A72B38"/>
Offices: All now hoped for is, that things being in a more quiet ſtate than they were, the violent Temper of the People will abate in a little time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Minds be more compoſed, when the Magiſtrates may do their Duty with leſs fear of becoming obnoxious to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the Town has been under a kind of Democratical Deſpotiſm for a conſiderable time, and it has not been ſafe for People to act, or ſpeak contrary to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ruling Demagogues; and ſurprizing as it may appear, thoſe fears are not yet annihilated.</p>
               <p>If it is aſked, why the Governor does not turn all the Juſtices of Peace out of Commiſſion, and put others in, who will do their Duty? It is anſwered, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor can neither appoint Juſtices, or turn them out, but by conſent of Council; and that the Council op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes every thing propoſed to the Governor, for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Government, that is unpopular.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid, Your Lordſhip will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is no Government in Boſton, there is in truth very little at preſent, and the Conſtitution of this Province leans ſo much to the Side of Democracy, that the Governor has not the power to remedy the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders which happen in it.</p>
