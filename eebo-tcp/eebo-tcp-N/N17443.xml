            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following pages were compiled that the Valetudinarian might exercise his reason in the choice of his aliment, or food, when he has not an opportunity of consulting his Physician or Apothecary.</p>
            <p>Many people, who are ailing, eat and drink improper things, from a want of knowing the nature and properties of what they take: to obviate this inconvenience, the different qualities, &amp;c. of our common food, are here pointed out, so far as their effects relate to the animal oeconomy.</p>
            <p>By consulting this little Treatise, every one may know what is good or bad for his constitution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Valetudinarian</hi> will find it very useful to refer to, and he who enjoys <hi>good health,</hi> may learn to preserve it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:022563_0004_0FB9563B5ADA67A8"/>The compiler has endeavoured to be as <hi>concise and useful</hi> as possible: for large, volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous works, which treat chymically and scientifically upon Diet, are frequently too abstruse, but little read, and as little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the generality of readers. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent subjects are here treated in a way simple and intelligible to every capacity.</p>
            <p>The compiler is well aware that he lays open to the criticism of the world; but hopes, that the <hi>purity of his intentions</hi> will secure him from the censures which <hi>otherwise</hi> his <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> might occasion; and however the world may condemn the <hi>manner</hi> of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilation, he trusts there will be <hi>few</hi> found to <hi>disapprove</hi> the <hi>matter of it,</hi> when he informs them, that it is founded upon the authority of a <hi>Cullen,</hi> a <hi>Buchan,</hi> &amp;c. men whose know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and abilities have never been disputed.</p>

            <head>Concise Observations ON THE NATURE OF OUR COMMON FOOD, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <div type="rules">
               <head>GENERAL RULES, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BY attention to <hi>Diet,</hi> many diseases may be prevented, and others mitigated.—It is a just observation,
<q>He who lives by <hi>rule and wholesome diet,</hi> is a physician to himself.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Weakly people should eat <hi>little</hi> and <hi>often,</hi> as, by <hi>long</hi> fasting, weak stomachs are apt to be oppressed by <hi>wind:</hi> whenever such people find an appetite for food, they should <hi>indulge</hi> it by <hi>eating</hi> moderately.</p>
               <p>Drinking <hi>little</hi> at a time, and <hi>often,</hi> is most wholesome to promote <hi>digestion:</hi> large and copious draughts distend the stomach, and pall the appetite. If a person takes a large draught of water, or any other small liquor, just before he eats, it will generally spoil the appetite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:022563_0008_0FB956444C46F990"/>Drinking <hi>cold</hi> beer after <hi>hot soup</hi> is perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as it generates <hi>wind,</hi> and hurts the tone of the stomach.</p>
               <p>Strong drinks of every kind, as is well known, are very hurtful to the stomach, nerves, and digestive faculties; but, when carried to excess, become a poison to the body, and in the event destroy it. Even the faculties of the mind fall a victim to their fatal effects.</p>
               <p>Those who are subject to <hi>bilious complaints</hi> should avoid all unripe fruits, cucumbers, new liquors, bad wines, and bad spirits, and every thing which is flatulent or <hi>windy:</hi> their <hi>food</hi> should be <hi>light</hi> and <hi>simple</hi>; they should <hi>never</hi> mix <hi>too many</hi> things together upon the stomach at <hi>any meal whatever:</hi> their <hi>drink</hi> should be <hi>moderate, nourishing,</hi> but <hi>not heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> and <hi>above all things,</hi> they should pay particular attention to <hi>keep the body open.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Cullen very justly observes, nothing affects the <hi>mind</hi> more than the state of the <hi>stomach,</hi> and nothing draws the stomach into sympathy, more than <hi>affections</hi> of the <hi>mind:</hi> the stomach has a very general consent with the whole system. Hence we see an attention to diet, &amp;c. is of the utmost importance, as the state of the stomach (consequently health) in a great measure depends upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:022563_0009_0FB9564596498D18"/>Those who have weak stomachs, or are troubled with <hi>indigestion,</hi> should observe nearly the same rules as those which are laid down for <hi>bilious</hi> constitutions; that is, they should pay a <hi>more than ordinary</hi> attention to their <hi>diet:</hi> they should eat <hi>little and often,</hi> and then of <hi>one</hi> thing only at a <hi>time.</hi> It is the <hi>improper mixture</hi> of <hi>different things</hi> which lays the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for <hi>variety</hi> of diseases; for the <hi>stomach</hi> being <hi>weak,</hi> is <hi>not</hi> able to assimilate or <hi>unite</hi> together such an <hi>heterogeneous mass</hi> as arises from a mixture of things <hi>opposite</hi> in their <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</hi> Every thing should be <hi>avoided</hi> which is <hi>flatulent,</hi> or in its nature <hi>hard</hi> of digestion. New liquors, thick beer, bad wines and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, unripe fruits, pickles, rich sauces, soups, &amp;c. (as was observed) should be avoided, as inimical to the relaxed and weakly stomach.</p>
               <p>Intemperance and excess, both in regard to eating and drinking, should be avoided as the <hi>parent</hi> of indigestion: on the contrary, <hi>exercise,</hi> (but not too soon after meals, as it would disturb digestion) and every <hi>diversion,</hi> which does not fatigue, are particularly useful.</p>
               <p>Light suppers, and early rising, are of the utmost consequence to those who are troubled with indigestion, for reasons too obvious to mention.</p>
               <p>One thing I must not omit, which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally practised, consequently its ill effects
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022563_0010_0FB95647DF6D8458"/>
are little thought of; that is, eating custards, tarts, pies, almonds, walnuts, nuts, cream, &amp;c. directly after dinner upon a full stomach; this is a very unwholesome habit, for the <hi>stomach</hi> having already received sufficient food for the nourishment of the body, and probably as much as it can well digest, the <hi>additional</hi> quantity overloads the stomach, creates a fever, and becomes prejudicial to the constitution.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion, that the same things, eaten upon an empty stomach, would be of no prejudice at all; surely, in this case, it is the <hi>quantity,</hi> more than the <hi>quality,</hi> which does the mischief.</p>
               <p>Whenever the stomach is employed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting our food, it seems to be an established law of the animal oeconomy, that there is <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less degree of fever</hi> excited during the time of digestion; necessary, indeed, in <hi>some degree,</hi> as Cullen observes; but when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to a <hi>noxious</hi> one, that is, too high, we ought to change our diet.</p>
               <p>We should always <hi>chew</hi> our food well, as by that means it will digest much easier upon the stomach: indeed, nature seems to have provided <hi>teeth</hi> chiefly for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Keeping the <hi>stomach</hi> and <hi>bowels</hi> warm, by a flannel waistcoat, or otherwise, is very wholesome, and proper for those who are
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022563_0011_0FB9564BE21E2568"/>
subject to complaints of those parts, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the winter time.</p>
               <p>Having premised these few general Rules, I shall now proceed to some concise Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the nature and properties of our common food, so far as they relate to the animal oeconomy.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="water" type="foodstuff">
               <head>On WATER.</head>
               <p>I Shall not mention its peculiar or chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal properties as an element, but chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine myself to its internal use.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Water,</hi> as a diluent, is wholesome; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes <hi>digestion,</hi> and allays thirst, perhaps more agreeably than any liquor whatever; this daily experience testifies, and to have it <hi>good</hi> is of the utmost importance.</p>
               <p>It is well known, even among the common people, that there is no means more effectual in procuring a <hi>sweat,</hi> than drinking cold water.</p>
               <p>In simple colds, from obstructed perspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a <hi>pint of cold water,</hi> drank immediately upon <hi>going to bed,</hi> is, among the common people, a very usual, and often successful remedy. In these cases, it acts by <hi>sweat,</hi> and relieves the body. But as there are ways of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022563_0012_0FB9564D10FDEE08"/>
exciting <hi>sweat</hi> with less <hi>hazard</hi> of mischief, a <hi>prudent man</hi> would <hi>prefer</hi> them. For it should be remembered, that it is very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, and may be attended with very ill consequences, if drank in inflammatory fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as the quinsey, or pleurisy, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I have no doubt but the <hi>poor,</hi> who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently can get nothing else, are oftentimes relieved in fevers by draughts of cold water.</p>
               <p>Cold water will often relieve a <hi>vomiting,</hi> where there is a great want of determination (as it is called) to the skin. This I mention from repeated experience, as well as from the testimony of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Common water,</hi> Dr. Cullen observes, when taken in considerable <hi>quantity,</hi> proves <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A large draught of water taken in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fasting, is a very wholesome custom, and frequently procures a stool.</p>
               <p>As a bath, water conduces both to health and pleasure.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="bread" type="foodstuff">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:022563_0013_0FB9564E92D987F0"/>
               <head>On BREAD, PUDDING, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I SHALL confine myself simply to its use as <hi>food.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In England, <hi>bread</hi> is sometimes made of rye, oats, and barley; but that prepared from <hi>wheat</hi> is by far the most wholesome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coarse bread,</hi> as it contains more of the <hi>husk</hi> of the grain, is more <hi>purgative</hi> than fine.</p>
               <p>Bread, <hi>not properly</hi> fermented, will cause the <hi>heart-burn,</hi> and when <hi>too acid,</hi> from <hi>over-fermentation,</hi> will <hi>purge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stale</hi> bread is more easy of digestion than <hi>new</hi>; when <hi>toasted,</hi> it is lighter and more wholesome.</p>
               <p>Home-made bread (as it is called) is most wholesome, when properly prepared, because it is not adulterated. There is no doubt but bakers use allum, or some other ingredient, to make their bread <hi>white,</hi> to please the eye of their customers: but to children's tender bowels such bread is very pernicious; biscuit-powder, as being less flatulent, is more proper.</p>
               <p>I cannot by any means agree with Dr. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogan, that plain, <hi>simple bread, well fermented,</hi> can be <hi>unwholesome:</hi> there is no doubt but that it is of the greatest <hi>use,</hi> when mixt with <hi>animal</hi> food in our <hi>ordinary meals.</hi> Indeed, <hi>bread</hi> seems designed by <hi>Providence</hi> for <hi>food,</hi> from the <hi>earliest</hi> ages of <hi>antiquity,</hi> either lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022563_0014_0FB956510754A9C8"/>
or unleavened.—I would ask, who are more <hi>hardy and healthy</hi> than our <hi>peasants,</hi> and their <hi>children,</hi> whose diet, in these dear and trying times, is <hi>almost bread alone?</hi> To see the <hi>truth</hi> of this, we need only to observe the <hi>children</hi> of the <hi>villages,</hi> as we pass along: their <hi>ruddy looks,</hi> and <hi>athletic forms,</hi> plainly tell us, that <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>simple diet</hi> point the way to <hi>health.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All pastry, pye-crust, &amp;c. are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome, hard of digestion, and apt to produce heart-burn, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plain</hi> simple <hi>puddings</hi> sit light and easy upon the stomach; but when made <hi>rich,</hi> with a variety of ingredients opposite in their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, require a <hi>strong stomach</hi> to digest them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dumplings</hi> are <hi>not</hi> so easy of digestion as light <hi>puddings:</hi> and <hi>pancakes,</hi> from being fried in an oily, greasy substance, are more indigestible than either.</p>
               <p>But, in fact, there is no laying down a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule in this case; as some stomachs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest <hi>puddings</hi> best; others, <hi>dumplings</hi>; and some few, <hi>pancakes.</hi> As an instance of this, a particular <hi>friend</hi> of mine, whose stomach is naturally <hi>weak,</hi> can digest nothing but <hi>hard dumplings:</hi> either <hi>light puddings</hi> or <hi>meat</hi> create violent pain in the stomach, and he has no ease till he is relieved by vomiting: he has several times attempted to <hi>change</hi> his <hi>diet,</hi> but was sure to suffer from it.</p>

                  <p>BEEF is <hi>not</hi> so easy of digestion as <hi>mutton,</hi> being of a more firm texture, but is equally <hi>nutritious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>lean part</hi> of <hi>fat</hi> meat is most easy of digestion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Veal</hi> is not so easy digested as <hi>beef,</hi> nor is it so <hi>nutritious.</hi>

                     <hi>Mutton</hi> is also more wholesome than <hi>lamb.</hi>

                  <p>The gravy of meat is not so unwholesome as is generally imagined.—Dripping is very prejudicial to weak stomachs.</p>
                  <p>Beef tea, mutton tea, &amp;c. (which are made by pouring boiling water upon them, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning to the palate) are good for those whose stomachs will not bear fat or oily broths, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Milk, generally speaking, is acescent, yet it frequently cares the heart-burn.</p>
               <p>Where the stomach is weak, and an <hi>acid</hi> prevails, <hi>milk</hi> coagulates. Indeed, some au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors aver, that it <hi>always</hi> coagulates previous to digestion. Be that as it may, wherever there is <hi>bile</hi> upon the stomach, <hi>milk,</hi> as being acescent, will become <hi>purgative</hi>; but is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reckoned to produce costiveness.</p>
               <p>Milk, from its <hi>animal</hi> nature, is very nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, and from its <hi>vegetable,</hi> &amp;c. easy of digestion.</p>
               <p>When milk is too <hi>heavy</hi> for a <hi>weak</hi> sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, it is much more wholesome to <hi>dilute</hi> it with <hi>water,</hi> than to <hi>skim</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Milk diet is very proper in <hi>hectic</hi> constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: if duly persevered in, it will correct, or, as it were, change the whole mass of blood.

                     <hi>Green tea</hi> is more unwholesome than <hi>bohea,</hi> and is <hi>not</hi> so <hi>proper</hi> for people of <hi>thin hectic habits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Strong coffee is said to relieve the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach: it certainly is more wholesome than <hi>tea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Coffee or tea, in most habits, weakens the tone of the stomach, and affects more or less the whole <hi>nervous</hi> system.</p>
                  <p>Plenty of <hi>milk</hi> should generally be drank with <hi>tea</hi> or <hi>coffee,</hi> except where plenty of <hi>wine</hi> has been drank just before, then it should be <hi>omitted</hi> for reasons too obvious to mention.</p>
