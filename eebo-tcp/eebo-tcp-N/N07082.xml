            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHILE Paul continued at Rome the ſaints of Philippi raiſed a gratuity for his relief, and ſent Epaphroditus to preſent it to their ſuffering apoſtle. Epaphroditus, after a dangerous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, returning home to Philippi, St. Paul ſent by him this letter of thanks to that beneficent aſſembly of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who had liberally contributed to his relief. Tho' this incident was the occaſion of this epiſtle, yet the apoſtle takes this opportunity to impart ſome good gifts to them of a ſpiritual nature, in return for their affection and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral relief. Beſides ſome elucidations and bright touches on the peculiar doctrines of the chriſtian faith, doctrines however common to the church univerſal in all ages; and beſides ſome incidental reflexions on the then preſent ſtates of the chriſtian cauſe;—he interſperſes the whole with obſervations adapted to the peculiar ſtate of things at Philippi. If we conſider this, it will very much aſſiſt us

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſeveral parts of this epiſtle. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we ſhall find the apoſtle in all his letters his a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral eye to the particular circumſtances of the church or perſon to whom he writes—and many ſentences and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are reſtricted by theſe views. His moſt extenſive deſign, in all his epiſtles, was to confirm the faithful: to which end he attentively inſpected the ſtate of the churches, and according to their different exigences, he imparted his ſpiritual advice and apoſtolic exhortation.</p>
            <p>The ſaints at Philippi were united in a good opinion of ſaint Paul, their ſpiritual father, and paid a high regard to his dictates and advice, whether given by inſpiration, or his own private judgment. And he made uſe of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, nor to aggrandize himſelf, but to ſerve the cauſe of the redeemer, by ſettling and reconciling differences and animoſities, by cultivating that fellowſhip and union; which being enlarged to the comprehenſion of a numerous body of chriſtians, was appointed to ſuccede the miraculous powers in ſupporting and diffuſing chriſtianity through the world. God's ways are conſummately wiſe. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the goſpel, the miraculous powers ſubſerved two ends, the <hi>ſupport</hi> and <hi>evidence,</hi> or verification, of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. And having, demonſtrably atteſted the cauſe, and ſupernaturally upheld it againſt all oppoſition, till it had formed ſuch an intereſt among men, as, being cemented by the noble principle of union and benevolence, it might ſupport and propagate itſelf in a natural way, theſe powers were gradually withdrawn, when effectual care had been taken for the ſecurity of the goſpel. The tranſmitting of it therefore in ſome meaſure devolved itſelf on its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, under the all-controlling, over-ruling providence of heaven. Tho' God accompliſhes his moral, as well as natural ends, by ſecondary cauſes and ſubordinate means; yet there is room for the concurrent agency of theſe cauſes—and hence we are to work together with God. The apoſtles took early care, as the number of the faithful
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009018_0004_10306DE8491AE6F0"/>
increaſed, to recommend this uſeful principle of union and benevolence, which, cementing the body of believers, ſhould in due time form an impregnable <hi>eſpirit du corps</hi> to ſuccede the ſupernatural effuſions of the divine ſpirit, and co-operate with God in carrying on and ſupporting the ſame great deſign. Even in the infancy of the churches— while being too ſmall to form reſpectable unions; and conſequently while yet they could not ſee and feel the immediate uſe which was afterwards to be made of the heavenly principles of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> taught by their divine maſter:—The apoſtles carefully watched this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, took peculiar care to implant and cultivate it, and uſed apoſtolic authority in recommending it.</p>
            <p>And as the church multiplied, they were very attentive to extinguiſh animoſities and heal differences, in one part and another: which aroſe, not from the nature of the chriſtian inſtitution, but from partial underſtanding of it, and from early imbibed prejudices, not at once to be worn off, and which the apoſtles treated with the utmoſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and wiſdom. Beſides what were incidental to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular churches there were other miſtakes of greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. The Jews were diſperſed throughout the Roman empire, and ſettled in great numbers in Greece, Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and around the Archipelago. And though chriſtianity never made any great impreſſion on the body of that people, yet a few in almoſt every place became converts. Theſe few nevertheleſs occaſioned a very capital controverſy, not eaſily ſettled by apoſtolic authority, which takes up ſome part of almoſt every book of the new-teſtament, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the evangeliſts: a controverſy, which, being different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehended by chriſtians of ſucceeding ages, has given birth to polemical divinity or controverſy on the doctrines of faith. The few Jewiſh converts did at firſt receive Jeſus Chriſt as the Meſſiah on the evidence of his <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> chiefly and other <hi>miracles,</hi> and partly in <hi>fulfilment of prophecy:</hi> but did not imagine that either <hi>circumciſion</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:009018_0005_10306DEA02B55048"/>
or the <hi>law</hi> was to be aboliſhed, They therefore uſed their endeavours to bring the Gentile chriſtians to the law; and though they received Chriſt, yet their great dependance was on the law: They accordingly truſted for acceptance and juſtification to the works of the law, of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them than that <hi>righteouſneſs which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith.</hi> There were other Jewiſh converts, who tho' they did not lay the chief ſtreſs on the deeds of the law, yet thought the obſervance of it neceſſary, truſting neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the atonement of Chriſt, and preferring the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by faith. The former were dangerous, being really enemies to the croſs of Chriſt: the latter were tolerable, and might ſafely be received into the fellowſhip of the goſpel; it was neceſſary to act in ſteady oppoſition to the one, with the utmoſt condeſcention and humanity to the other.</p>
            <p>The body of <hi>hebrew chriſtians</hi> from the beginning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>circumciſion</hi> and <hi>the law,</hi> which St. Paul had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be right for them, though not for the <hi>gentile chriſtians.</hi> With difficulty the apoſtle kept them united in his day: but ſoon after his death the Hebrew converts broke off all charity and communion with the Gentile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, becauſe the latter would not obſerve <hi>circumciſion</hi> and the <hi>law.</hi> They were long after diſtinguiſhed and known by the name of <hi>Nazarene,</hi> or circumciſed, chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The <hi>Copti</hi> chriſtians <hi>circumciſe</hi> to this day. <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> the hiſtorian is ſaid to have at laſt joined himſelf to thoſe <hi>believing Jews,</hi> who about his time broke off all communication with the <hi>believing Gentiles. Epiphanius</hi> was acquainted with them, A. D. 370, and called them <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics,</hi> "for no other reaſon that I can perceive, but that they together with their chriſtian faith, continued the uſe of <hi>circumciſion</hi> and the jewiſh <hi>law;</hi> which is a thing St. Paul never blamed in a <hi>jewiſh chriſtian.</hi>" He might have cenſured St. James and thoſe thouſands of the Jeruſalem
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009018_0006_10306DEBD8CB1B60"/>
and Galilee chriſtians for hereticks, concerning whom St. James ſaid to St. Paul, Acts 21.20. <hi>Thou ſeeſt, br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther, how many thouſands of Jews there are, which</hi> BELIEVE, <hi>and they are</hi> ALL <hi>zealous of the</hi> LAW.</p>
            <p>This controverſy had affected the church at Philippi; and perhaps Euodias and Syntiche might be Jewiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, and very much at the head of it; the apoſtle ſays, with reſpect to thoſe who were the moſt crafty and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable in proſelyting the Gentile chriſtians to the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, pompous, burdenſome inſtitution of Moſes, <hi>beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the conciſion;</hi> which plainly ſhews they were in danger from the quarter of which I have been ſpeaking. The apoſtle therefore exhorts them to beware, to take heed, to be on their guard with reſpect to thoſe teachers who enjoin circumciſion, the ceremonial rites, the obſervation of Jewiſh holy-days, new-moons, and other feſtivals, and <hi>place the eſſence of chriſtianity in theſe things.</hi> And he takes occaſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his own example in evidence—by which it appeared that he had been in every reſpect a Hebrew, ſtood com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in that righteouſneſs which was of the law: but ſince his ſoul had been enlightened with the in valuable diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus, he counted all his boaſted attainments in judaiſm as a trifle, deſiring henceforward to be found in Chriſt, not having on his own righteouſneſs, which was of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt. Having entirely broke off from judaiſm, being convinced that it was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by a more perfect and ſublime and ſpiritual inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he preſſed forward to perfection in Chriſt—and being deſirous to unite as many as poſſible with him, he was willing to walk <hi>together</hi> with his brethren the Hebrew chriſtians <hi>as far as they had attained,</hi> who ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in Chriſt, yet thought themſelves obliged to obſerve the law. If they placed their dependance on Chriſt for acceptance, they might be indulged their peculiar affection
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009018_0007_10306DF419F15F68"/>
for the obſervance of their law, provided they would be content that the Gentile converts ſhould be at liberty on theſe matters; it being far better for thoſe that agreed in eſſentials, to live in harmony and fellowſhip, than under the moſt ſpecious pretexts to reſolve themſelves into fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, undeterminable controverſy and alienation. And then the apoſtle introduces this general advice, equally appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to all, whether Jewiſh or Gentile converts, ſo far as they had attained, to walk by the ſame rule, and mind the ſame thing. This harmony would cement them into a reſpectable body, and perfect them in that benevolence and chriſtian charity, without which they were nothing.</p>
            <p>Having thus finiſhed the neceſſary illuſtration of the text; I proceed to what I had principally in view, the application of it to us, my brethren, of the <hi>congregational</hi> denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well in New-England in general, as the particular diſtrict of this colony. And in order to procede clearly, and perceive that the principle of union recommended in the text, may be applicable and take place among our churches, I ſhall</p>
            <p n="1">I. Enumerate ſome of thoſe fundamental principles of chriſtianity and eccleſiaſtical polity, in which our churches are generally agreed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall mention ſome things on which we differ in opinion, or are ſuppoſed to differ; and ſhew that this difference need not to obſtruct the general harmony and union—and that theſe ſuppoſed differences might be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſſened by benevolent and honorable conceſſions. And</p>
            <p n="3">III. Subjoin ſome reaſons, taken from the importance of the common cauſe, and the preſent ſtate of our churches, to ſhew the wiſdom and advantage of union and good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, both among the miniſters and the churches.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall enumerate ſome of the fundamental principles of revelation in which we are generally agreed. I ſhall not confine myſelf to thoſe things which congregationaliſts particularly agree in—but ſhall have occaſion to mention
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009018_0008_10306DF6392CD740"/>
ſeveral things in which we have the happineſs to agree with the proteſtant churches throughout the world; as well as others more peculiar to our own denomination.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We agree in the being and character of God. The author of the univerſe is himſelf underived and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:—a being of abſolute excellence and dignity, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy and glorious of himſelf:—a being but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly apprehended, known but in part by man:— a being in himſelf poſſeſſed of all poſſible perfection in a degree incomprehenſible by our limited apprehenſions; having beſides thoſe, whoſe illuſtrations we have the honor of perceiving, perhaps many perfections unknown to us. The diſplays of Deity to our little world lead our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations to four diſtinctions of perfection, which yet may be but one principle in the divine eſſence, I mean <hi>omnipotence, wiſdom, goodneſs, mercy.</hi> His wiſdom im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>omniſcience</hi> and perſonal rectitude with reſpect to himſelf:—With regard to the production and government of a ſuppoſed dependent creation, his infinite wiſdom muſt diſcern and project and execute the wiſeſt and beſt plan of a univerſe;—<hi>wiſeſt</hi> becauſe infinite diſcernment muſt perceive the only one, than which there is not another wiſer, and in which the moſt complicated various and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ends are accompliſhed in the ſhorteſt manner, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the feweſt ſimpleſt general laws;—<hi>wiſeſt</hi> becauſe admitting all poſſible ſubordinations and variety of action, happineſs and ſocial connexion;—therefore laſtly, <hi>wiſeſt</hi> and <hi>beſt,</hi> becauſe moſt declarative of the divine glory, and eventually productive of the greateſt quantity of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal happineſs.—I ſay, <hi>divine wiſdom,</hi> of ſyſtems poſſible, muſt chuſe that beſt one, which <hi>omnipotence</hi> prompted by infinite <hi>goodneſs</hi> might give exiſtence to and perpetuate. We view the Deity at the head of the moral ſyſtem as exerciſing a ſuperintendant moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſupreme dominion, all-controlling and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting <hi>providence.</hi> And tho' the divine complacency be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009018_0009_10306DF7F3B97098"/>
apportioned to the degrees of native or acquired excellence of every order and every individual; yet impartial equity takes place in the divine diſpenſations and conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all the ſubordinations of being from infinite to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. This ſuggeſts the idea of divine <hi>juſtice,</hi> founded in and flowing from infinite wiſdom, which, with reſpect to the unhappy beings who tranſgreſs the laws of eternal order, is exerciſed in connecting eventual puniſhment with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amending impenitence. The exerciſe of goodneſs to a revolted world is <hi>mercy:</hi>—which, as the univerſe muſt be a production very generally virtuous and right, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed that we know of towards no part of the creation, but this unhappy region which we inhabit. This general idea of the Deity and his character I ſuppoſe we are agreed in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That notwithſtanding God created this, as he did all other worlds, in order and rectitude, yet that we are now in a fallen and univerſally depraved ſtate. I truly take this principle to be very generally agreeable to the opinion of our churches—however individuals may differ as to the origin and deſert of moral evil. Some may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to vicious example, ſome to the diſorder of our external ſtate, or the animal part of man, ſome to a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of pollution born in us, and derived from Adam. But however we may vary in our opinions as to the cauſe of the preſent reigning univerſal depravity; yet two things I ſuppoſe we agree in with reſpect to it—one, that no blame is to be aſcribed to God as the author of it; the other, that it is fact. Obſervation on the ſtate of the world for 6000 years, or the review of it in hiſtory, ſhew that in fact diſorder and vicious principle are predominant and reign with great ſtrength in human nature. The univerſality of the effect ſhews a tendency and proclivity in our nature at preſent, howevever derived there; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity which may be termed a characteriſtic or general principle of our preſent nature, even on allowance of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009018_0010_10306DFAC01E4DD0"/>
the ſuppoſed exceptions, which in my opinion are not to be admitted, ſince this vicious principle has not been in fact controlled by the philoſophers or their wiſeſt moral ſyſtems, but has raged in the moſt enlightened and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved nations, more than among the ſavages themſelves. From which there is reaſon to ſuſpect that no one of the human race is deſtitute of it. Our ſouls may come out of the hands of God pure and unpolluted, and the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution take place upon our entering this ſtate. Nor is it the reſult of perſonal action alone: it may perhaps be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for an innocent and unexperienced mind, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing its infant exiſtence in a polluted world, not to be very ſoon affected with the contagion. The great Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has reſembled the infant mind to a raſa tabula, as he expreſſes it, a clean piece of paper, with no inſcriptions, tho' ſuſceptible of them. This is equally true of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal propenſities, as of acquiſitions in knowledge. Some indeed ſuppoſe or ſpeak, as if they ſuppoſed that the pure and holy God infuſed into the ſoul at its firſt creation, and on its entrance into the world, the impure and unholy propenſities both of fleſh and ſpirit, which we find to have uſurped the governing poſſeſſion of us by the time we become capable of moral action; and conſequently that our natures, as they come out of the hand of the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent creator, are corrupt, impure and unholy. But the learned preſident EDWARDS has aſſerted, that the doctrine of original ſin, according to the ſenſe and explication of the moſt orthodox divines, implies no ſuch thing:— but that, we coming pure out of the hands of God, our impurity and moral defilement is altogether conſequential upon our entrance into this world. I beg leave to ſubjoin his own words. Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſuppoſes, ſays he, <q>the doctrine of original ſin to imply that nature muſt be corrupted by ſome <hi>poſitive influence;</hi> ſomething by ſome means or other <hi>infuſed</hi> into the human nature; ſome <hi>quality</hi> or other, not from the choice of our
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009018_0011_10306DFF88C0FF50"/>
minds but like a <hi>teint, tincture</hi> or <hi>infection,</hi> altering the natural conſtitution, faculties &amp; diſpoſitions of our ſouls: —that ſin and evil diſpoſitions are implanted in the foetus in the womb.</q> 
               <q>Whereas truly our doctrine, ſays Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> neither implies nor infers any ſuch thing. In order to account for a ſinful corruption of nature, yea a total native depravity of heart, there is not the leaſt need of ſuppoſing any evil quality <hi>infuſed, implanted,</hi> or <hi>wrought</hi> into the nature of man, by any <hi>poſitive</hi> cauſe or influence whatſoever, either from God or the creature: or of ſuppoſing that man is conceived and born with a <hi>fountain of evil</hi> in his heart, ſuch as is any thing properly poſitive. I think a little attention to the nature of things will be ſufficient to ſatisfy any impartial, conſiderate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer, that the abſence of <hi>poſitive good</hi> principles, and ſo the with-holding of a ſpecial divine influence to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and maintain theſe good principles, leaving the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon natural principle of ſelf-love, natural appetite, &amp;c. (which were in man in innocence) leaving theſe, I ſay, to themſelves, without the government of ſuperior, divine principles, will certainly be followed with the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea the total corruption of the heart, without occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any poſitive influence at all: and that it was thus indeed that corruption of nature came on Adam imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on his fall, and comes on all his poſterity, as ſinning in him, and falling with him. <note n="*" place="bottom">Edwards's Anſ. to Taylor, p. 316</note>
               </q> Theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations appear to me to be very juſt. On which we may remark that this author aſſerts, that no "evil quality" is <q>
                  <hi>infuſed, implanted,</hi> or <hi>wrought</hi> into the nature of man by any <hi>poſitive</hi> cauſe or influence whatſoever, either from God or the creature:</q> And that there is no need of <q>ſuppoſing that man is conceived and born with a <hi>fountain of evil</hi> in his heart.</q> Our ſouls were all created by God pure and without ſtain, (with leſs perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on indeed than had Adam ſucceſsfully ſuſtained the faede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009018_0012_10306E030C287510"/>
trial,) but entering a corrupted and diſordered ſtate deſtitute of a poſitive propenſity to holineſs, tho' with no poſitive propenſity to ill, the latter immediately takes place in our natures, and by the time we arrive to the years of moral diſcretion, we find ourſelves one and all to have fallen a ſacrifice to pollution. Jehovah could have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in us a propenſity or tendency to virtue of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtrength to overcome the corruption of this ſtate— but he has not done it. The ſuppoſed inſtinctive love of virtue, and the impulſes of the moral ſenſe, are evidently too weak for eventual ſecurity. Why God did not infuſe a controlling propenſity to holineſs is to be reſolved into his ſovereignty and unfathomable councils; which might with great juſtice, and agreeable to the analogy of nature and daily experience, take occaſion from Adam's offence, to with-hold from his poſterity a favor which he had granted to Adam himſelf, and moſt probably had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated to his poſterity on the obedience of their faederal head. This is an intricate ſubject—the reconciling the permiſſion of moral and natural ill with the perfections of God—let it be brought about in what manner ſoever, ſince he had power to have prevented it. If therefore we ſhould differ in our manner of accounting for it, and even if we ſhould miſconceive the ſcripture account of its origin (in which I apprehend it is clearly defined), and yet agree in the fact that diſorder and moral depravity now reign in this part of God's univerſe, to a degree uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable by man, perhaps we ſhall agree in the main thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I take it that we further agree that it is beyond the power of man to recover and ſave himſelf. Methinks a little attentive view of our ſtate might convince us not only that there is no probability, but that there is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute impoſſibility of this worlds emerging from its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and recovering its original rectitude of itſelf. A ſpectator from yonder diſtant dominions of Jehovah might lock down upon this world, and pronounce it utterly loſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009018_0013_10306E04C997BFE0"/>
and undone beyond any poſſibility of ſelf-recovery. He might ſee the principle of moral rectitude, even ſuppoſe it not quite extinct, yet ſo embarraſſed as not poſſibly to regain its dominion. In this attempt the moſt enlightned and poliſhed heathen nations, Greece and Rome, as well as the modern refiners in reaſoning, have intirely failed. And as no general ſucceſsful reformation, either of the moral principle or practice, is ever to be expected from mankind conſidered as a collective body, while in a ſtate of nature unenlightened by a ſupernatural revelation; ſo there is but too much reaſon to believe the ſame thing holds true of individuals. And if we ſhould be inclined to make an exception in favor of the pagan nations, we muſt have recourſe to the effect of the diſpenſation of grace, thro' which, tho' unknown to them, the ſpirit might regenerate a principle of holineſs in them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Patten's Apolo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> 16.</note> But even this would ſhew that nature alone is utterly impotent to this great change. With reſpect therefore to the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the principle of holineſs, as well as the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the principle of pollution, our nature left to itſelf is intirely impotent.</p>
            <p>But towards our ſalvation, there is neceſſary another thing which I ſuppoſe we all agree is abſolutely beyond human power, even in full perfection, I mean rendering atonement for ſin. The oeconomy of the kingdom of grace, and the deſignation of the ſon of God to the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of this world, the introduction of the offers of grace, the exhibition of an example of perfect virtuous practice under all its embarraſſment, the opening and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up this kingdom; infinite wiſdom it ſeems ſaw could not be effected without that humiliation of the ſon of God, his mediatorial obedience and vicarious ſufferings, on which the diſpenſation of grace is meritoriouſly founded. This ſhews us that without the divine ſupernatural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition, the world was abſolutely loſt and undone. The
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009018_0014_10306E0683AFF458"/>
true nature of atonement is perhaps but imperfectly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by us:—but methinks we might all ſee that, in whatever it conſiſts, it is a thing beyond human power to render. Is it not blaſphemy for a depraved helpleſs being to ſay he can do aught of himſelf which ſhall merit pardon of an offended God? Could he be perfect for the future, nay perform an overplus of virtue of merit equal to the demerit of his offences, yet on the foot of juſtice he could have no demand on the ſovereign mercy of God. Divine juſtice is not thus to be bought and ſold. But even Adam in innocence could perform no works of ſupererrogation, or more than his duty: and ſhall his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent ſons profanely boaſt that they can atchieve a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of holineſs for the ſatisfaction of divine juſtice? And conſequently could we be ſuppoſed to have power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come holy the reſt of our lives, there remains a load of paſt ſins uncancelled, undiſcharged, whoſe penalties we are liable to.</p>
            <p>It is beyond our power then to lay the foundation of our redemption, which Jeſus Chriſt has laid in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory ſacrifice of himſelf. Equally unable are we, without the divine aſſiſtance, to thoſe terms and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appointed to be found in us, towards our receiving the atonement and becoming entitled to the bleſſings of this ſacrifice. Otherwiſe the illuminations of the holy Ghoſt had not been by infinite wiſdom judged neceſſary to accompliſh on the human mind the great work of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, repentance, faith,</hi> and <hi>regeneration.</hi> As the <hi>atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is the foundation of our diſcharge from the future penalties of moral evil; ſo <hi>faith</hi> is the appointed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of limiting the atonement to us; and <hi>renovation</hi> of nature is neceſſary to the enjoyment of the future bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs. Had I time I might enlarge on the deſcription of this divine principle, its formation and exerciſe, as it affects our ſpiritual powers and paſſions, which are directed, reſtricted to and placed upon new moral objects, new purſuits, new enjoyments.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:009018_0015_10306E0AB765ABD0"/>4. We agree that JESUS CHRIST is the great redeemer, and that he is God as well as man—in a word, we agree is the doctrines of the divinity and atonement of Jeſus Chriſt. We agree in our idea of his perſon, offices and mediation. However we may differ in explaining the myſteries of the hypoſtatic union, yet we agree in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Chriſt to all practical purpoſes—particularly in his <hi>omnipotence;</hi> and that religious honor and <hi>divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> are to be aſcribed to the ſon, believing it to be the will of heaven <hi>that all men honor the ſon, even as they do the father.</hi> We believe him according to the ſcriptures to be the ſecond perſon in the ever-adorable trinity, the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the father's glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon:—that he is the eternal ſon of God, the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of his father, full of grace and truth; for in him dwelt the godhead bodily:—that he is the eternal logos, who was in the beginning with God, and who was God, by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made that was made;—that to him is committed all power in heaven and earth, who therefore is God over all bleſſed forever:—that his ſubordination in order of trinity is conſiſtent with perfect equality to the father, that ſo he and the father are one, partaking in and enjoying the ſame eſſential glories and perfections:—that he dwelt in eternal glory with the father before the world was;—that though he laid aſide the peculiar glories of divinity which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in the boſom of the father upon his condeſcending to appear in our nature; yet when he dwelt with us, he was God manifeſt in the fleſh, the repreſentative and true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplification of Deity, particularly in his perfections of <hi>wiſdom, infallibility</hi> and <hi>omnipotence.</hi> Whence it appears that he was all-ſufficient to the great undertaking, the work of redemption.</p>
            <p>On the foreſight of the apoſtacy of man and his helpleſs ruin, the eternal ſon is repreſented as ſaying to the father, <q>Lo! here am I, ready to do thy will, O God! ready
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009018_0016_10306E0E83BE9288"/>
on the part of mankind to perform that for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, which is neceſſary to be rendered to thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice, and which they are totally unable to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;—ready to undertake, to ſuffer, and execute all that the ſovereignty of thy adminiſtration demands. both as to atoning for their revolt, and recovering them to obedience and filial ſubmiſſion to thy will.</q> In conſequence of this eternal covenant between the father and the ſon, Jeſus the great Emanuel laid aſide the glory he had with the father, humbled himſelf to appear in our nature, and performed that ſcene of illuſtrious obedience and ſuffering, which, in the counſels of heaven, was ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the meritorious foundation of deriving the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable bleſſings to the true believer. He rendered complete atonement for ſin in the ſacrifice of himſelf— brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs—publiſhed the, joyful tidings of pardon and reconciling grace—gave a moſt wiſe and heavenly inſtitution of morals—brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light through his goſpel—appointed the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal and ſacramental rites—commiſſioned his diſciples, and then aſcended to the Father's preſence, where he now exerciſes the interceſſorial part of his mediation, and will continue to exerciſe it till he ſhall return and take upon him the more open and immediate dominion of the virtuous.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We agree in the influences and operations of the ſpirit, the third perſon in the adorable trinity concerned in man's redemption, whoſe more immediate province is the application of this redemption to the ſoul. Jeſus Chriſt having begun this good work, does not deſert it. Had he forſaken it after his leaving the world, it had proved abortive. He ſowed the good ſeed in one part of the great field of the world, and leaves it to propagate and ſpread as the ſpirit breaks up the fallow ground, and prepares one nation after another to receive it. The ſame thing is to be done for individuals as for nations: Tho' evangelical truth is of a regenerating influence when
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009018_0017_10306E10487373C0"/>
brought home to the ſoul, or as Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> expreſſes it, "to our boſoms;" yet the human mind is to be firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and ſoftened to the genial impreſſions of truth, which would be inefficacious alone. By an acceſs to, and operation on, the human intellect, which we cannot define, the ſpirit, as we are informed by revelation, diſpels the miſts which becloud and darken the underſtanding, and, being duly attended to, leads us to diſcern and feel the force of the truth as it is in Jeſus. And thus he brings the ſoul, after a previous moral proceſs, to two great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, diſtinct in their nature and connexions, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably conjoined in the ſoul of a chriſtian, I mean, ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>faith</hi> and the principle of <hi>regeneration</hi> we have been ſpeaking of. By the one I mean, not the lax indefinite faith of a ſuperficial education, tho' this muſt be allowed to have had a good effect upon the world;—not the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory belief, or rather non-disbelief, of Jeſus and his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, with which debauchees and devils <hi>believe, tremble,</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> away;—and leaſt of all, not that deiſtical faith by which we aſſent equally to the dictates of Jeſus, of Plato, of Ariſtotle, of Mahomet, and Bolingbroke, and to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as ſupernaturally authorized to inſtruct and govern man:—but, beſides the honeſt and ſober belief of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in general, I mean the affiance of the ſoul in Jeſus Chriſt; that act of the human mind, by which, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of our being intirely convinced that Jeſus is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed our redeemer and king, we humbly accept and ſubmit to him as ſuch—that act by which the ſoul, from a ſenſe of its loſt ſtate and inability to ſave itſelf, full of the raviſhing views of the all-ſufficiency of Jeſus, and the benevolent invitations of the goſpel, humbly comes to Chriſt, repairs to him as the ark of ſafety, receives and embraces and lays hold on him as the only hope ſet before it, in virtue of whoſe propitiation and meritorious righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs alone it truſts for acceptance with the father. The other principle I mentioned was <hi>regeneration,</hi> in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009018_0018_10306E1212C35840"/>
which the ſoul in all its powers and affections is purified, refined and created anew in Chriſt Jeſus: a love and complacency in virtue is generated, a ſtrong prevalent and governing affection for holineſs, a prevailing tendency to moral rectitude: in a word, a ſpark of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is infuſed and lights up the principle of divine love and benevolence, that diſtinguiſhing part of the moral image of God in which he created man. Theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>regeneration,</hi> are ſupported thro' the whole courſe of the religious life, by the ſame energies of the holy ſpirit that at firſt formed them. Again,</p>
            <p n="6">6. I ſuppoſe we are further agreed in the conſequences and connexions of theſe two principles—the one in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning a holy life, and exemplifying or rather diverſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf in all the graces and ornaments of the moral behavior:—the other in our <hi>juſtification,</hi> or intitling us, not by way of merit, but according to the conſtitution of grace, to all the benefits of the mediatorial atonement.</p>
            <p>Faith is the appointed term in us which limits and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates the atonement. But it muſt be ſincere, unfeigned, and attended with a holy life. <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved.</hi> It is through faith that we become ſo united to the meritorious redeemer, as to receive and ſhare in the benefits of his moſt illuſtrious virtue:—which, beſides a diſcharge from puniſhment, entitles to ineſtimable glories, priviledges and happineſs, over and above the peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which God will graciouſly beſtow on our perſonal virtue &amp; holineſs—Theſe laſt are intirely diſtinct from the high privileges and glorious beatifying dignity and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which are derived to believers on account of their connexion with ſuch an illuſtrious perſonage in the moral world, as the eternal ſon of God. <hi>Thus they that receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> To theſe glories juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication opens the way. In the ſcriptures it is connected, not with the principle of regeneration, not with its ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009018_0019_10306E18384D19E8"/>
holy life, but with <hi>faith</hi> only: not that faith is alone, but however attended with other good principles, it is faith only with which juſtification is connected. This is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed term, which, being found in us, enſeals our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, on our part compleats our title to all the benefits of the mediatorial obedience. There are indeed ſome different apprehenſions among us on this ſubject. We all agree that Chriſt is the great propitiation:—we do not place the propitiation in <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>good works.</hi> The only queſtion then is, what is the condition and appointed term <hi>in us</hi> which entitles us to the benefits and fruits of Chriſt's righteouſneſs? It is agreed on all hands, that whatever it is, it is not however meritorious; nor is the connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this term and receiving the atonement ſo neceſſary as to preclude the ſovereignty of grace. Now to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whatever it is, as well as to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the grace of God. the ſcripture indifferently gives the appellation <hi>"juſtifying."</hi> The apoſtle Paul ſpeaking of this conditional term in us, ſays, "being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>faith:</hi>"—St. James ſpeaking of the conditional term ſays, "ye ſee then how by <hi>works</hi> a man is juſtified, and not by faith only:"—the apoſtle ſpeaking of the procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe and meritorious foundation of juſtification ſays, "being juſtified by his <hi>blood:</hi>"—ſpeaking of the ſource and origen of it in the ſovereign and free mercy of God, he ſays, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> being juſtified freely by his <hi>grace</hi> through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Jeſus Chriſt." It is to be obſerved, that the Hebrew chriſtians truſted for juſtification to the works of the law. In oppoſition to this, the apoſtles endeavoured to bring them off from this vain truſt, to place their ſole dependance on Chriſt's atonement and ſacrifice once for all—teaching them that faith was the only term of being entitled to the benefits of this atonement, without the deeds of the Moſaic law. Some Gentile converts ſeeing ſo much ſtreſs laid on <hi>faith,</hi> and neglect of the <hi>law,</hi> forgot the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between the temporary and already abrogated laws
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009018_0020_10306E19EC0A0858"/>
of Moſes, and the perpetuity of the moral law, and ſo ran into the extreme of truſting to faith alone, and by itſelf. This is the error ſaint James corrects, by ſhewing that <hi>faith being alone is dead;</hi> and that it is only ſuch a living faith as influences to virtue, which is juſtifying. Not that faith is to be truſted to as meriting juſtification, any more than the good works it produces. To rectify ſtill further this early abuſe of faith, the apoſtle calls up the chief attention to a holy life or good works, not to the works of the law, but of evangelical obedience, and ſpeaks of them as a condition of juſtification joyntly with faith. It is evident indeed that a life of good acts is preferable in point of excellence and value, to the one ſingle good act of faith: but as real faith opens the virtuous life, and determines the future tendency of the character, infinite wiſdom has ſeen fit to make it on our part the character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic condition or term of juſtification. Theſe things do not bow to our reaſon, much leſs to our revieries. The proper and indeed only queſtion is, what ſaith the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? What is the term and condition preſcribed by God? If faith, or good works, ſeparately or conjunctly—we are to ſubmit. By good works it is to be remembred we agree to underſtand a <hi>holy and godly life,</hi> a life <hi>governed by a real principle of grace;</hi> and whether this good and pious life, or the faith which is the baſis of it, be the term of juſtification is the inquiry? And the doubt in this age ariſes from the miſconception of a controverſy in the apoſtolic age. We apply what the apoſtle ſpake of the ceremonial temporary law of Moſes, to the eternal laws of moral virtue. It is granted when the apoſtle ſays, "by the deeds of the law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified" that it is equally true in ſtrictneſs both of the laws of Moſes and the laws of Jeſus—but upon the temporane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous laws of the former only he had his eye. And when he is on the other hand ſhewing that the gentiles who had never practiſed the rites of Moſes, might yet be juſtified as
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009018_0021_10306E1CC55AF0F0"/>
well as the jews, he ſays, "We conclude that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the law." The laws of Moſes are exempt in both caſes—it was juſt a matter of indifference, whether they were jews or gentiles, whether they practiced the law or not—they were all to be juſtified by faith, and not by the deeds of the law. In truth, I ſuppoſe faith alone is the condition of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as good works are of the rewards, but neither meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious. The deeds of the law which St. Paul depreciates as of no value, not only in point of juſtification, but in every other ſenſe; and which he counts as droſs and dung, are evidently not that piety and moral virtue which he univerſally inculcates. And as it is impoſſible to aſcertain the genuineneſs of faith but by revelation, or ſubſequent obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and revelations have now ceaſed;—ſo in effect, towards the moral comfort, a conſcientious and virtuous life is to be attended to and treated very much as if it was the condition of pardon. And if any truſt to good works for juſtification, in the ſame manner as others truſt to faith for juſtification, as a condition only of receiving the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is not eſſentially erroneous, ſince in either caſe the truſt and dependance, with regard to the meritorious cauſe, is in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and this only. Did our truſting to good works or to faith alone lead off our ſupreme dependence from the ſacrifice and righteouſneſs of Chriſt—ſhould we in our dependence ſubſtitute either <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>holineſs</hi> in the ſtead of Chriſt's atonement; or in the ſame ſenſe truſt to the <hi>merit of faith</hi> or <hi>holineſs</hi> for <hi>juſtification,</hi> as we all agree to truſt to the merits of Chriſt; it would be as eſſential a departure from the chriſtian method of recovery, as to truſt to jewiſh ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and the righteouſneſs which is of the law of Moſes. But there are no ſuch notions or ſentiments prevailing in this land. Indeed we are a little puzzled about the term and condition <hi>in us</hi> of our being intituled to the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but we univerſally depend on the atonement as
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009018_0022_10306E1E76C218D0"/>
the meritorious foundation of our acceptance and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Thus we have conſidered the conſequences by the grace of God connected with faith in our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The conſequences connected with the <hi>principle of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> begotten in <hi>regeneration,</hi> are firſt, the ſubſequent life of virtue, and ſecondly its rewards. This principle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the moral perfection of the ſupreme intelligence, and is the baſis of univerſal virtue and univerſal happineſs throughout the moral world. All pure intelligences of every ſubordination partake of it in their meaſure, and are actuated by it. When prevalent in man, it as neceſſarily and naturally influences and impels to a life of holineſs, as a polluted principle when prevalent impels to a life of vice. It naturally tends to perpetuate itſelf; yet through the embarraſſments of a corrupted world, it would decline and come to nothing, if it was not upheld by its divine author. Whence the perſeverance of ſaints is not to be aſcribed to the indiſſoluble perpetuity of the principle of grace, but to the promiſe and continually ſuſtaining power of God. A courſe of holy obedience and heavenly conduct is pleaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and delightful, and evidential of the reality of grace in the heart, and the ſteadineſs of our faith:—this is the preſent benefit of good works:—but beſides this, their moſt eſſential connections are the <hi>rewards.</hi> The good the gracious principle is not in any meaſure to be rewarded, like the good works it produces. Hence the book of the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion repreſents that at the final adjuſtment, men are to be rewarded, not according to their faith (this has quite a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent connexion, viz. juſtification), not according to the principle of grace, but according to the good works which flow from it:—this not of merit, but of the free, rich and ſovereign grace of God. In God's adminiſtration, <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>reward</hi> are not inconſiſtent. The final rewards of virtue are as much of grace, as the beſtowment of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication on faith, or the giving both faith, repentance, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009018_0023_10306E2338B4E050"/>
regeneration. But though theſe rewards are of grace, yet God has been pleaſed to inform us that the rule he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to himſelf, is to apportion them to the degrees of ſanctity. Thus the whole of our ſalvation is grace— <hi>by grace are ye ſaved, through faith, that not of yourſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> Hence,</p>
            <p n="7">7. We agree in inculcating and recommending a life of practical religion, a life of pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ty, holineſs and moral virtue.</p>
            <p>We earneſtly recommend private &amp; public devotion, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religion, and pious education of children—that the light of our good examples may ſhine around us, and excite others to glorify our heavenly father. We endeavour to cultivate a reverential and undiſſembled homage of the moſt high, together with unconfined, generous and diffuſive benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which ſhall render this life ſocial and pleaſant, and qualify us for the future aſſociation with the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect. And to animate us to this, we fail not to paint the glories of paradiſe and the charms of virtue, and to exhibit ſuch ſublime and exalted views of the moral government of God, as may charm and allure us to that conduct which is the ſupreme honor of our natures.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We further agree, that however impotent and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we are of ourſelves, yet if any ſinner, even in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſtate, will uſe the appointed means of recovery, he may be encouraged to hope for that further aid and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which will terminate in his final ſalvation. Not that the ſinner can regenerate himſelf:—but inſtead of ſitting down in ſloth, as if he had nothing to do, no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to labor for the meat that endureth to everlaſting life, he ought to be up and doing, and work out his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear and trembling, knowing, that on his faithful improvement of the talents and advantages he enjoys, it is God that worketh in him both <hi>to will and to do</hi> of his own good pleaſure. He ſhould uſe the appointed means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious contemplation on his ſtate, and duly attend to the eternal conſequences of moral action, whether virtuous
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009018_0024_10306E2663CAAC88"/>
or vicious: like a rational and immortal being, he ſhould deliberate on the tendency, event and iſſue of his behaviour. He ſhould conſider that, by his almighty lawgiver and judge, he is placed on this theatre of action to ſuſtain in the view of mortal and immortal beings a certain character, and that the part he acts has final connexions of the moſt important moment. He ſhould read the ſcriptures to learn the way of life, the terms of acceptance. He ſhould not neglect the duty of attending and hearing the word, and above all of humble prayer and ſupplication to the father of lights, for the illuminations of his holy ſpirit, to enlighten his mind, that he may clearly diſcern thoſe rich and attracting diſcoveries of redeeming love, which may beget faith and renovation of ſoul. He ſhould labor for ſuch juſt and affecting views of the folly of vice, and the excellency and wiſdom of virtue, as may terminate in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of the one, and a complacency in the other. From the juſt humility and ſelf-abaſement which attends a thorough conviction of ſin, there will be an eaſy and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable tranſition to that joyful and unreſerved ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery of the ſoul to God, which on our part completes the title to bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>Let no one then be diſcouraged and ſay, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray to God acceptably, or aſk in ſincerity. For though the pure and ſublime ſincerity exerciſed by a ſoul under the full raviſhing diſcoveries of the goſpel, cannot be expected in the unregenerate; yet if ever their prayers are anſwered, their imperfect ſincerity is accepted: and it is evident that they are, becauſe with the laſt humble aſpiration of the ſoul antecedent to converſion, is connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the imparting regenerating grace. In a word, God would not call upon us indiſcriminately to aſk mercy of him, if he did not indiſcriminately grant it. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between our petitions and the imparting of grace to the unregenerate, no more interferes with the ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, than the connexions of bleſſing with the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009018_0025_10306E2826C1D448"/>
of the godly. All that man receives is free, unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited grace. And if the <hi>promiſes</hi> are a peculiar favor reſerved for the ſaints; there are <hi>encouragements</hi> however to the unregenerate, to turn from their evil ways and ſeek God, who giveth grace to the humble. Jeſus Chriſt came to <hi>call ſinners</hi> to repentance; and with the gracious invitations he makes to them, he ſays, <hi>aſk and ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>— and again, <hi>whoſoever will let him come:</hi>— the ſealing the viſion and the prophecy was with an univerſal invitation to all freely to come and be happy in paradiſe, in that pathetic, earneſt and affectionate addreſs to mortals, <q>I Jeſus have ſent mine angel to teſtify unto you theſe things—and the ſpirit and the bride ſay, COME. And let him that heareth ſay, COME. And let him that is athirſt, COME. And <hi>whoſoever will</hi> let him take the water of life <hi>freely.</hi>
               </q> Come all mankind, whoſoever will let him come. Theſe invitations are not to the virtuous only, but to a whole wicked debauched world, whoſoever will let him come to Jeſus and be happy: let him come and make a humble ſurrendery of himſelf to him whoſe right it is to reign, whoſe is the ſovereignty and juſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of man, and he ſhall be accepted. Theſe invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are conceived in language as ſtrong as the promiſes. However at leaſt there are encouragements to ſinners—and the encouragements of a God are as infallible and equally to be depended upon as his promiſes.</p>
            <p>The uſe of means is neceſſary in our beginning the religious life, for our confirmation in faith, and for the ſubſequent culture in virtue.</p>
            <p n="9">9. To cloſe our agreement in doctrinal principles we believe the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the dead, the future <hi>judgment,</hi> and final retribution.

               </q> I muſt beg leave to procede a little further, and add,</p>
            <p n="10">10. That we agree in the two poſitive inſtitutions of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's-Supper.</hi> As to the communion, we do not proſtitute it to the vicious and debauched, but reſtrict it to perſons of ſobriety, faith and virtue: and for the poſture, according to the example of Chriſt and his apoſtles, we celebrate it <hi>ſitting</hi> around the Lord's table. We agree not only in the baptiſm of adult believers, but of their infant ſeed. However incapable they are of inſtruction and faith, yet Jeſus Chriſt in ſaying, <hi>of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven,</hi> as we take it, aſſerts that they are capable of enjoying the bleſſings of his ſpiritual kingdom— capable of admiſſion into it—and of conſequence capable of the initiatory ſeal by which all are to be received into his kingdom. They may be intituled to great bleſſings, tho' not by their own act, yet by the ſeal of initiation, by which they are embodied into that catholic community of the virtuous, which having the patronage of Jeſus will in the iſſue appear to be not only the moſt honorable incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this part of the moral world, but to imply intereſts and connexions of great moment. As for the mode of baptiſm we univerſally perform it by <hi>affuſion</hi> or ſprinkling —but whether it be done thus, or by <hi>immerſion,</hi> we do not hold it eſſential. And as the chief difference between the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and us is reſpecting the ſubjects, viz. Infants, on which good and ſenſible learned men have judged va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly; ſo there begins to be a good harmony and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſpondence between the catholic and charitable of both denominations, which I hope will continue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009018_0027_10306E2E1D8C21F8"/>
and this benevolence is intirely conſiſtent with our adhering to our reſpective denominations.</p>
            <p n="11">11. We agree in the belief of the inſpiration of the ſcriptures—we believe that they contain an authentic and the only infallible account of the whole ſyſtem of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made from Time to Time to mankind—and that they are a <hi>ſufficient</hi> rule of faith and practice. Our churches, God be thanked, are not yet deeply tinged with deiſm— may God preſerve them pure! And as they yet retain the popular belief of revelation, which will abide the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere ſcrutiny, ſo they accept the ſcriptures as an infallible rule. It is indeed a little unhappy, that, like others in the chriſtian world, ſome of us are fond of ſubſtituting human interpretations given by authority of councils and learned men, exacting that the ſacred ſcriptures be underſtood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſenſes fitted and defined in human teſts, which all acknowledge to be fallible. But it is to be hoped that we ſhall ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith the goſpel has made us free. There ought to be no reſtrictions on the conſcience of an honeſt and ſober believer of revelation. The right of conſcience and private judgment is unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and it is truly the intereſt of all mankind to unite themſelves into one body, for the liberty, free exerciſe and unmoleſted enjoyment of this right, eſpecially in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Not all the difference of ſentiment, not all the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous opinions that have yet been ſtarted, afford juſt um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage for its extinction, abridgement or embarraſſment. Have the proteſtant formularies ſubſerved the defence of the truth as it is in Jeſus?—Rather have they not in event proved new ſources of religious diſpute and undetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble controverſy? The churches of <hi>Geneva</hi> have long ſince had the wiſdom to drop their article of <hi>conſenſus,</hi> as the great diſturbance of the chriſtian harmony. And the clergy have found themſelves obliged to interpret the <hi>Helvoetic,</hi> and all other proteſtant confeſſions, in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſenſe, with a <hi>divinis veritatibus in hoc libro contentis

ſubſcribo.</hi>—I am ſatisfied we ſhall err leſs if we make the ſcriptures the only rule of faith, than if we depart from this, and ſubſtitute another; or as many do, who ſay they believe the ſcriptures the <hi>only</hi> rule, and yet in all their judgments on ſcripture, meaſure that <hi>only</hi> rule by <hi>another</hi> rule. Nor do ſubſtituted rules anſwer the purpoſe of detecting heretics at all better than the primary rule, ſince on experience it is found none more freely ſubſcribe and ſware to human teſts than deiſts, ſceptics and the moſt debauched. If God's incloſure will not keep out the erroneous, can it be expected that ours will? The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal pretext is a preſervation againſt hereſy. But it is to be remarked, that human teſts make more heritics than the word of God—all that the one determines to be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, is not hereſy by the ſcriptures. A man may be a very great heretic according to the one, and an excellent chriſtian according to the other at the ſame time. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was one of the greateſt heretics, and even gloried in his hereſy, and yet was one of the beſt of chriſtians. The <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were heretics. The <hi>proteſtants</hi> are all heretics with the <hi>romaniſts,</hi> according to the council of <hi>Trent.</hi> All that can be advanced for public human teſts among proteſtants, can and has been advanced with equal force for thoſe of the romaniſts: for it is not ſo much the real truth or error contained in theſe teſts and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mularies that is conteſted, as the authority by which they are impoſed, which is only human, and therefore not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory on conſcience. Though we have reaſon to be thankful that all the proteſtant formularies<note n="*" place="bottom">Harmonia Confeſſionum.</note> are ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſcripture as they are; yet they give deciſions on ſome things which the ſcripture has not determined, and on which not only the heterodox, but the moſt orthodox and learned divines have different ſentiments— and in other things they are too imperfect to be adopted by chriſtians as a ſtandard and criterion of chriſtian truth:

            <p n="12">12. Again, We agree in the ſufficiency and validity of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian ordination. This was the ordination practiſed by the apoſtles, and among the primitive chriſtians of the firſt and ſecond centuries.—This is agreeable to ſcripture:— was introduced into our churches at the beginning;—and this has continued our practice ever ſince. The <hi>apoſtolic</hi> order was appointed in virtue of a ſupernatural commiſſion and diſpenſation, which ceaſed at the death of St. John. During theſe ſupernatural communications of the holy Ghoſt, many were divinely, I mean ſupernaturally, called to the work of the miniſtry, beſides the apoſtles; and were to this end endowed with the gift of tongues and other miraculous powers. As the converts multiplied and formed into religious aſſemblies or meetings, the holy Ghoſt appointed overſeers and paſtors to inſtruct and feed the flock of God, to perform baptiſms and adminiſter the communion. And theſe were indifferently called preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters or elders, teachers, biſhops, paſtors. The elders of Epheſus are ſtiled biſhops, Acts 20.28. So the elders of Philippi are called biſhops, Philip. 1.1. The elders are to take the overſight of the flock, <hi>epiſcopountes,</hi> doing the work of a biſhop. It cannot be ſuppoſed, that the city and church of Epheſus within the firſt three years had ſundry dioceſan biſhops; and yet the apoſtle calls the elders of that church biſhops. Theſe things convince us that ſcripture biſhops, and elders or paſtors, are of the ſame
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009018_0030_10306E35C974AB68"/>
order and office. Dr. Hammond ſays, <q>there were no presbyters of an Inferior order inſtituted by the apoſtles.</q> And the learned Dr. Stillingfleet made this noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion <q>that there were no biſhops during the apoſtles life</q> meaning no dioceſan biſhops in the ſenſe of the latin church. We are confirmed in this from conſidering what this office was in the ſynagogue, from whence it was adopted into the church. The head or preſident of the ſynagogues ſuperintended the public reading and explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the law and the prophets, and performed the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic offices of devotion and preaching<note n="*" place="bottom">Lewis Antiq. Haeb. V. 2. p. 428 and Baſnage.</note>. This officer in the hebrew ſynagogues was called <hi>Chazzan;</hi> and in the helleniſtic ſynagogues <hi>Epiſcopos,</hi> a <hi>biſhop;</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Sheliach Tſibbor, angel of the church,</hi> who never had the charge of more than one congregation, ſo that there was as many biſhops as ſynagogues. In the firſt forming of a ſynagogue, the Chazzan was elected by the members, and ordained by the impoſition of hands of the elders of the ſynagogue. Afterwards the ſucceſſion obtained in the appointment of the Chuzan who ordained his ſucceſſor by impoſition of hands, an antient rite of conſecration to a religious office. It does not appear that the Chuzan was ever appointed by the Sanhedrin. Nor does it appear that the ſynagogues or their officers were of divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſince the oracular reſponſes of Urim and Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim, and the other ſupernatural communications ceaſed before their inſtitution. The ceremonies of <hi>anointing</hi> and <hi>impoſition of hands</hi> originally implied an authorative deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from heaven. The tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> was conſecrated to the levitical office, and the family of <hi>Aaron</hi> to the prieſtly office by <hi>impoſition of hands,</hi> implying an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratitive deſignation from heaven. <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were deſignated to the regal office by the ceremony of <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Oyl. Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were ſeparated to the apoſtolic office by <hi>prayer and the impoſition of hands.</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:009018_0031_10306E3C934DF0B8"/>
Theſe were ſupernatural deſignations, and clothed the reſpective officers with a proper divine authority. And theſe rites of initiation into the real and paſtoral office were retained, and probably were ſet forth as examples, and intended by God to be retained in the kingdoms and churches of ſucceeding ages, when the authorative deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was left to men. The apoſtles took early care to furniſh examples for perpetual imitation in the churches, by leaving the deſignation of the paſtors to the free elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the churches—uſing the ſame rites in ſetting apart thoſe appointed by the churches, as in conſecrating thoſe that were ſupernaturally called and appointed by heaven. There is a great difference between imitating the antient divine appointments, and acting under a direct divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. Samuel and the prophets anointed kings jure divino: but we do not now imagine that when a biſhop anoints a king in theſe ages, that he does it jure divino, or confers any divine authority on the regal character. It is but <hi>imitative</hi> of the few inſtances of extraordinary regal appointment in the jewiſh monarchy. So the impoſition of hands in the ordination of paſtors, which is held <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> in ſeveral reformed churches, implies no ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural appointment to the paſtoral office; and is in like manner <hi>imitative</hi> only of the antient ceremonies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, and the few inſtances of extraordinary appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the apoſtolic age, and at the firſt ſetting up of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. The period of extraordinary appointment to the regal office was at moſt from Samuel to the diſſolution of the hebrew monarchies in their reſpective captivities. The period for like appointment of the paſtors is limited to the few inſtances of the firſt century, or at moſt to the period of miraculous powers. Since theſe periods both have been <hi>imitative only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ceremony of paſtoral inveſtiture was from the beginning performed by co-ordinate presbyters or paſtors; with whom the apoſtles left the conferring holy orders in

Thus pure and uncorrupted antiquity is on the ſide of ordination by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal presbyters. <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> and <hi>Polycarp</hi> ſpeak of biſhops and elders as of the ſame order and office. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> and <hi>Hilary</hi> are on our ſide, by the conſent of all who are acquainted with eccleſiaſtical antiquity.

            <p>Indeed, in juſtice and candor to our proteſtant epiſcopal brethren, it muſt be acknowledged that the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>biſhops</hi> and <hi>presbyters,</hi> both as to order and powers, began early in ſome parts of the chriſtian church. And the antiquity and figure of dioceſan epiſcopacy, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for ages throughout the chriſtian church, would have been an argument invincible, were it not for the total ſilence of SCRIPTURE, and the certainty that the ſcripture ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were performed by presbyters, and its making no difference between the of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The hierarchy of the greek and latin churches after the apoſtolic age reſolved the body of eccleſiaſtics into ſubordinations unknown to the apoſtles, who left but one order of inſtructors, that of elders, with power to perpetuate themſelves in the election of the people to the ſecond coming of Chriſt.</p>

as paſtors, was in fraternal election: The twelve called the multitude unto them and ſaid, <hi>brethren look you out</hi> ſeven men, whom <hi>we</hi> may appoint or ordain—and the ſaying pleaſed the <hi>whole multitude,</hi> and <hi>they choſe</hi> Stephen <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts vi. 2.</note>. And in ordaining elders or ſtated paſtors in every city, the univerſal cuſtom was to conſecrate thoſe whom the brethren firſt elected. Nor do we ever find the apoſtles or neighbouring paſtors ever negatived a popular election; but univerſally ordained ſuch men to the miniſtry as by the choice of the congregation appeared to be men of <hi>good report.</hi> So the churches of New-England chuſe their own paſtors, who are ordained or conſecrated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> expreſſes it, "with the common conſent of the biſhops of the vicinity." And it is greatly to be deſired that all newly introduced miniſters be agreable to the paſtors of the vicinity, as a mutual harmony among <hi>fellow-labourers</hi> muſt greatly ſubſerve the common cauſe.</p>
            <p>When it is ſaid, Acts xiv. 23, <hi>they ordained them elders in every church,</hi> it is evident from the known cuſtom of the <hi>Keirotonia,</hi> in the athenian democracy, that it ought to be rendered to this effect, <hi>leading the people to the choice of elders in every church, by the lifting up of hands.</hi> The apoſtles, in the opinion of Dr. Cotton Mather, only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, and the people under their inſpection elected. This <hi>Keiretonia</hi> is the practice of our churches. The ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of conſecration was the impoſition of hands with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. This ſimple proceſs compleated the paſtoral inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and made a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The original cuſtom ſettled by the apoſtles, was not worn out in ſeveral centuries: Ignatius writing to the church in Philadelphia, tells them, that it belonged to them to chuſe their paſtor.

Even in <hi>Rome</hi> itſelf, the people elected their biſhop till the XIIth century. And popular elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of miniſters continued 'till <hi>Charlemagne.</hi> Before this time indeed the privilege was in a great meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced from ſome churches. For after the miraculous powers, the clergy encroached on this principle, eſpecially as the benefices became oppulent. But they did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the acquiſition, 'till that immenſe wealth, which they intrigued into their hands in the eccleſiaſtical revenues, gave them a weight which could no longer be reſiſted. This ſacerdotal aſcendency, and irreſiſtible influence, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from ſmall beginnings and gentle encroachments. From ſuch ſmall beginnings, as recommending the advice of neighbouring paſtors in the choice of a miniſter; they proceeded, as this cuſtom obtained, to <hi>claim</hi> and <hi>demand</hi> ſuch application for advice, as a paſtoral right; and from claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as a right, advanced to hold a negative on the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of neighbouring churches; and afterwards in the light of councils, which have proved the grand fources of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and tyranny, they beheld it for the public good and conſervation of the faith, that they ſhould be veſted with the ſole diſpoſal of paſtoral vacancies. In the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent ages of the church, thoſe who founded the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, whether ſtates or private perſons, affirmed a temporary right of nomination or preſentation to benefices. But the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009018_0039_10306E5473869CE0"/>
clergy piouſly prevailed on the founders to deſignate this power to them in their laſt wills. Thus and by mortmains which they devoutly procured in bequeſts and pious uſes, ſubjected to the direction and diſpoſal of the religious, they had intrigued <hi>two thirds</hi> of the property of ſouthern and weſtern Europe into their holy hands. Thus by the XIVth century the european churches not only loſt the liberty of paſtoral elections, but with it ſtupidly played away their property, and ſubjugated themſelves, their ſouls, bodies, and eſtates, to a plauſibly uſurped, becauſe ſpiritual domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Thus the churches at length loſt the invaluable power of paſtoral election, which they have never been able to recover. This ſhews how dangerous a thing it is to ſurrender liberty! In the reformation, the clergy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves loſt that power which they had piouſly intrigued from the people in the four preceeding centuries. For upon ſecularizing the eccleſiaſtical revenues, the proteſtant princes, nobility and oppulent founders, making appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations for the ſupport of the clergy, deemed it wiſdom to aſſume the preſentations into ſecular hands. And the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is now moſt generally in patronages in all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant churches. Thus the power which the clergy in a long ſtruggle caught from the people, is at length lodged not in the people, not in the clergy, but in ſecular patrons.</p>
            <p>The brethren and congregation have <hi>loſt their liberty,</hi> when the appointment or nomination of a paſtor is reſted, 1. In the ſovereignty, whether it reſide in a prince or a ſtate. Thus the ſtates of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the kings of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> have the excluſive nomination to paſtoral vacancies. 2. When it is in a presbytery, conſiſtory or conſociation. This was originally the caſe with the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> and <hi>reformed</hi> churches in general, and continues ſo with reſpect to ſome of the churches of <hi>Scotland.</hi> 3. When it is ſhared between the ſovereignty and conſiſtory of the clergy, as in the dutchy of <hi>Wurtemberg.</hi> In this dutchy are 450,000 inhabitants and 620 miniſters, incluſive of the

               </q> 4. When it is in patronages, whether the patrons be princes, nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, biſhops and dignified clergy, pious benefactors, or provincial governors. One or other of theſe have the advowſon of by far the greater part of epiſcopal livings in the britiſh empire, and throughout the proteſtant world. The royal <hi>conge de lire</hi> ſo reſtricts the election of the britiſh biſhops, as that their appointment may be ſaid to be in the crown. The epiſcopal livings in the province of <hi>Maryland</hi> are in the gift of the proprietary governor, who has the appointment and induction of all the clergy of the province. I am told that the collation to all epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal benefices in the plantations, excepting the miſſions, is in the King's governors. In <hi>Demnark</hi> the power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive is in the prince, nobility and other patrons. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages are alſo numerous in the church of Scotland. All theſe are total deprivations of choice in the people: in ſome inſtances they may perhaps be conſulted, but have no <hi>determining voice,</hi> and in point of power this is to have juſt nothing.</p>
            <p>The powers of the brethren, on the caſe before us, are <hi>abridged and embarraſſed,</hi> and their liberty but partial. 1. When in virtue of a public compact eſtabliſhed among a body of churches, the churches of the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity have a negative on a paſtoral choice of a deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:009018_0041_10306E581CFBE048"/>
congregation. Or 2. When in virtue of ſuch agreement the miniſters of the vicinity are inveſted with ſuch a negative. So that there being two voices in the election—the vacant congregation have one, and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring paſtors another. I do not know that this is the caſe in any part of the world. No one can diſpute but that an eccleſiaſtical community or combination of churches can form ſuch a reſolve and enforce it, tho' not in virtue of any divine power: yet the wiſdom of ſuch a meaſure may be queſtioned. 3. When the advowſon or choice is in a veſtry and church wardens, or committee choſen by the congregation—as in rectori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. This is a low ſpecies of liberty, and a reſtriction that almoſt amounts to depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But in truth the loweſt ſpecies of real genuine liberty is, when there is at leaſt a negative in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as well as in a patron or presbytery, or thoſe who ſhare part of the liberty. If there is a negative only in the latter, even the indulgence of choice in the church is no real true liberty. Again, 4. When among a body of <hi>free</hi> apoſtolic churches, a number of neighbouring church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es take upon themſelves to be diſpleaſed with the acts and election of a ſiſter church, and excommunicate or refuſe chriſtian fellowſhip with that church—if this ſhould not in the event controle the election &amp; introduce a negative on the church, yet it certainly has a tendency to it; and at leaſt ſhews, that that combination of churches are deſirous of ſpiritual dominion, and would if they had power introduce themſelves to ſuch a negative. All pretexts are foreign; the queſtion is ſolely upon the point of <hi>power</hi>—whether it is ſolely in the church? or whether it ſhall be ſhared with the churches of the vicinity? And ſuch a practice is defenſible only upon this principle, that it is beſt for the whole body of churches to have this mutual reciprocal controll upon one another. Aad this principal is a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental ſubverſion of congregationaliſm. For if the transferring the whole power of electing a paſtor to the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009018_0042_10306E5B1C27D708"/>
churches of the vicinity, would be a total deprivation of power in the particular church; then the transferring half that power, would be a partial a ſemi-deprivation. And if upon ſuch a ſurrendery, in a vicinity of 20 conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated churches, the conſent of 10 beſides the vacant church be neceſſary, that church retains but one tenth of her power, and has given up and loſt nine tenths. Thus the introducing the conſociation to a negative on paſtoral elections; is an <hi>abridgment and embarraſſment,</hi> nearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to a total deprivation of power in particular churches and congregations: and is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

provinces of Holland to purpoſes of civil government. So the thirteen provinces on this continent ſubſiſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of one another as to juriſdiction and controul over one another—yet in harmony. And one church or congregation has no more power over another, than one province over another, and yet they may all ſubſiſt in union and love. Union and harmony don't neceſſarily imply ceſſions of power, or ſubjecting to mutual juriſdiction. And as the powers, liberties and juriſdiction of each pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince may be ſaved harmleſs in a general alliance or plan of confederacy, as in the united provinces or ſwiſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons; ſo the powers, liberties and juriſdictions of each congregational church may be ſaved harmleſs in a general union and confederacy of churches. And the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples may take place in confederating a multitude of leſſer bodies, as in confederating larger bodies, ſuch as provinces, cantons, kingdoms. But to return,</p>
            <p>Our churches acknowledge no juriſdiction of ſiſter churches over them; but hold themſelves both capable, and to have power to determine all matters of difference that ariſe in a particular church. For in truth, in religion we ought all to be free; and conſequently not the religious ſpeculative opinions of a chriſtian, one that honeſtly believes revelation, ought to be deemed the ſubject of eccleſiaſtical animadverſion in a church, and little elſe beſides his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. And this every church is a complete judge of, and perhaps is ſeldom miſtaken. And if we go beyond this, neither ſingle churches, nor a body, nor oecumenical coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils can determine: as is evident from an experiment thro' the long tract of time from the council of <hi>Nice</hi> to that of <hi>Trent.</hi> It muſt be confeſſed indeed, that our churches have ſometimes taken on them the deciſion of matters, which all the power and wiſdom on earth cannot determine till the ſecond coming of Chriſt. But whatever is within the capacity of mortals to determine, reſpecting the chriſtian diſcipline, the brethren are ſufficient judges of.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009018_0045_10306E64A1012478"/>
Or if they may ſometimes be at a loſs, they have recourſe to the opinion and advice of ſuch council as they think fit to conſult, reſerving to themſelves a liberty to receive or refuſe ſuch advice when given. And with this aſſiſtance they can determine any thing and every thing that can be determined by mortals—whether they confine themſelves to what properly belongs to them; or whether they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large into things which God perhaps has nor determined for us, and never intended mortals ſhould determine for one another. And with regard to theſe laſt, the church, with the aſſiſtance of council, can reſolve and decide juſt as wiſely as the wiſeſt body of men, and ſave to themſelves the power of deciding the leſſer and yet more momentous differences which are truly the ſubjects of their deciſion. Therefore though our churches, in forming their deciſions in matters of diſcipline, make application to a council of the paſtors and meſſengers of neighbouring churches; yet the congregational churches univerſally hold a negative on the reſult of that council—or rather the deciſion of ſuch council is of no force till received and ratified by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting church: nor does it render that church obnoxious to the vicinity, if ſhe recedes from the opinion of the council. So that congregational councils are <hi>adviſory</hi> only. And in this manner have ſubſerved valuable purpoſes, not ſo much by affording any new light, as by becoming peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers in their connexions, influence and perſuaſions. Thus our churches are abſolutely free with reſpect to all foreign juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>There was indeed in the year 1705, an attempt or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal to ſubordinate the whole body of our churches to the juriſdiction of conſociation, with final appeal to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral provincial conſociation, in which all controverſies were to take an ultimate iſſue and deciſion. But theſe propoſals met with inſuperable oppoſition, from the ſpirit of liberty. Dr. Cotton Mather ſpeaking of them ſays, "there were ſome very conſiderable perſons among the <hi>miniſters,</hi> as well
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009018_0046_10306E6659A4A6C8"/>
as <hi>brethren,</hi> who tho't the <hi>liberties</hi> of <hi>particular churches</hi> to be in danger of being too much <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>infringed</hi> in them. And in deference to theſe good men, the propoſals were never proſecuted." <note n="*" place="bottom">Ratio diſciplin. p. 184.</note> To theſe propoſals of erecting ſpiritual judicatories, the reverend and learned Mr. JOHN WISE of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> made a very ſpirited reply, in a ſatyr en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled "the churches quarrel eſpouſed," in which he ſhews that the veſting of conſociations with judiciary and deciſive powers, would in the iſſue be the abolition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationaliſm. And there is no reaſon to think this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was an enemy to our churches.—It was early ſeen to be important, that our churches ſhould be <hi>conſociated;</hi> but whether for the purpoſes of <hi>harmony</hi> only, or <hi>dominion,</hi> was as early the queſtion. For it was ſeen that whatever power was ceded to the ſtanding council, juſt ſo much was taken away from particular churches; and this claſhed with the principle, that every church had power to decide its own controverſies. The conteſting this claim, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the transferring of ſpiritual dominion from the church to a ſtanding council, is the true reaſon, as I apprehend, that all our congregational churches in Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, are not reſolved into conſociations; which tho' not <hi>jure divino,</hi> are however excellent things. But to ſhew that the congregational churches are under no fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ign juriſdiction of other churches aſſembled in ſtanding or occaſional councils, we may recur to the anſwer given by our churches aſſembled in Synod, A. D. 1662, to the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the expediency and manner of conſociations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the aſſembly of Maſſachuſetts—This Synod agreed that every church or particular congregation has <note n="†" place="bottom">Reſult of 3d Synod. p. 88.</note> "full power and authority eccleſiaſtical within itſelf, regularly to adminiſter all the ordinances of Chriſt, and <hi>is not under any other eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction whatſoever.</hi>" Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to this fundamental principle is all to be interpreted in that anſwer relative the communion and conſociation of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:009018_0047_10306E6C82693FA0"/>
churches. Thus we ſee our churches are hitherto free. And the uſe they make of councils, which they occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invite, is <hi>adviſory only</hi>— "when they have done all, the churches are at liberty to judge how far their advice is to be followed."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ratio diſcpl. 173.</note> Thus ſtrictly ſpeaking, congregational councils have no power at all: and upon this principle it is conceded that "eccleſiaſtical councils, undoubtedly, have at leaſt as large rights, and as extenſive authority, in churches that are united in conſociation, <hi>as in thoſe that are not.</hi>" And this I take to be the truth of the caſe, that the confederacy was not meant to veſt the <hi>conſociated</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils with any new powers, or indeed with any power at all, but leave them as <hi>congregational</hi> councils <hi>adviſory</hi> only. As to what authority <hi>any</hi> councils have <hi>jure divino,</hi> or by <hi>divine right,</hi> I ſhall not enlarge upon in this age of liberty and light. Doubtleſs whatever power the councils have from this quarter, whether <hi>conſociated, congregational</hi> or <hi>oecumenical,</hi> is to have irreſiſtable dominion over all the churches.</p>

both, even the compilers of our platforms had for ſome reaſons of experience a diſaffection to, and our churches much more. They were willing and deſirous to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as equal ſiſter churches, not in ſubordination and ſubjection, but in univerſal proteſtant liberty and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>Having thus exhibited a ſummary view of the doctrine and polity on which our churches have a very general agreement, I procede</p>
            <p n="2">II. To mention ſome things on which there is among us ſome real or ſuppoſed difference of opinion, and to ſhew that theſe differences need not obſtruct the general harmony recommended in the text: and that theſe real and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitious differences may be leſſened by benevolent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable conceſſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One ſource of different ſentiment, were the unhappy exceſſes into which our churches have been tranſported in the late enthuſiaſm that prevailed ſince the year 1740. In the public miſtaken zeal, religion was made to conſiſt in extravagancies and indecencies, which were not according to the faith once delivered. Multitudes were ſeriouſly, ſoberly and ſolemnly out of their wits. The ſcriptures were in danger of being neglected for the indiſtinguiſhable impulſes of the ſpirit of God; ſober reaſon gave way to enthuſiaſm; the terrors of eternal damnation, inſtead of ſubſerving rational and ſober convictions, were improved to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow people into that confuſion, frenzy and diſtraction, which anfitted them for the genial illuminations of the holy ſpirit. Beſides this, the ſtanding miniſtry were aſperſed, and repreſented under abuſive ſuſpicions of being unconverted, legaliſts, arminians. And as they were thus publicly and indecently vilified, ſo it was taught as a duty to forſake their miniſtrations, and form into ſeparate aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. And as was natural to expect, our churches were hereby rent and torn and thrown into convulſions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, to the great diſhonor of the general cauſe. Much
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:009018_0050_10306E72E1D4C440"/>
of this indeed was piouſly meant, and honeſtly intended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and proceded from a zeal for the cauſe of God. Thus there was no doubt an intermixture of good, and it is to be hoped many were ſavingly converted. Our churches have now in ſome meaſure cooled and recovered themſelves, tho' the ſpirit of enthuſiaſm is not altogether extinguiſhed as yet, but operates and influences under different pretexts, and in a different form. But it is to be remarked with gratitude to the over-ruling diſpoſer of events, that amidſt the religious convulſions which threatned the ſubverſion of congregationaliſm, an augmentation of above 150 new churches has taken place in that period, founded not on the ſeparations, but natural increaſe into new towns and pariſhes. Theſe differences into which good and pious men were involved, have indeed made ſo deep an impreſſion, as not to be eaſily effaced in the preſent generation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is ſo much our intereſt to unite in love and harmony; nor can we ſo eaſily, heartily and ſincerely unite as if nothing of this nature had happened to diſturb the common benevolence. But it is to be hoped that the ſpirit of alienation will more and more ſubſide, and not be tranſmitted to ſucceeding generations. On all ſides there have doubtleſs been errors and indiſcretions, let us put on condeſcention and charity; and nobly forgive one another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another ſource of differences is that of <hi>calviniſm</hi> and <hi>arminianiſm.</hi> Many great and pious men are alarmed at a ſuppoſed prevalence of arminian principles through the churches of New-England: and others ſuppoſe calviniſm greatly erroneous. Under theſe banners they reſpectively enliſt, combat, conquer, and are conquered. The pretext of theſe names ſerves to legitimate mutual aſperſions which neither party deſerve. To me it appears that theſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies are founded almoſt intirely on miſtake: nor am I aware of any very eſſential or general alteration of the public ſentiment on what we all agree to be the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal principles of revelation. From ſome conſiderable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:009018_0051_10306E7AB8B05058"/>
with the miniſters of New-England, I cannot perceive any very eſſential real difference in their opinions reſpecting the fundamental principles of religion. I may be miſtaken—but their different manner and phraſeology in explaining the ſame principles appears to me to be their chief difference. We are apt indeed to attribute to one another conſequences of our peculiar explanations which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And yet none that I ever converſed with who are called calviniſts, by any means admit theſe conſequences from their principles. Again, thoſe reputed calviniſts ſay of thoſe reputed arminians, that their doctrine of <hi>moral free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> implies a natural power to become good and do all that heaven requires or man without the ſupernatural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and power of the divine ſpirit imparted to the ſoul—that their interpretations of <hi>original ſin</hi> implies a denial of the univerſal depravity of human nature, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal impotency and debilitation of the moral powers, and perverſion of affection, with loſs of the image and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of God—that with them <hi>election</hi> is founded on foreſeen <hi>meritorious</hi> conditions in man—that their idea of Chriſt's <hi>atonement</hi> is deſtructive of the true nature of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and atonement for ſin in the propitiation of the obedience and death of Jeſus—that they truſt to the <hi>works of the law for juſtification.</hi>—that they ſubſtitute our
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:009018_0052_10306E7CF6405610"/>
obedience inſtead of the obedience of Chriſt, for the baſis and meritorious foundation of juſtification—in a word, that their notions and ſentiments imply that man is not totally depraved, and tho' fallen, yet by Chriſt recovered to even a better ſtate at preſent than Adam in innocency was in; and that there is no need of atonement, renovation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or of the ſpirit's operation. But all reputed arminians I have converſed with ſtrenuouſly deny theſe conſequences. And I find both reputed calviniſts and arminians, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the clergy, agree in admitting the depravity of human nature in all its powers and affections—the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute inability to faith and holineſs, without the ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, aſſiſtances and operations of the ſpirit on the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind, over and above the elucidated and inſpired diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of revelation, I do not mean to reveal new truths, but to enable us to an efficacious apprehenſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of thoſe already revealed—that to his enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning energies is to be attributed the principle of <hi>regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>—that we are <hi>juſtified</hi> in the ſight of God, not for good works, but alone for the ſake of Chriſt and his atonement: tho' they may differ in defining the nature of atonement, yet all agree in making it the ſole foundation of juſtification—that the benefits of Chriſt's righteouſneſs are appropriated to believers by <hi>faith,</hi> as the condition of our receiving the atonement.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps entertain ſentiments <hi>really</hi> different on theſe important ſubjects. Their conviction however is not to be laboured by the coertion of civil or eccleſiaſtical puniſhment, but by the gentle force of perſuaſion and truth—not by appeals to the tenets of parties and great men; not by an appeal to the poſitions of Arminius or Calvin; but by an appeal to the inſpired writings. And I am perſuaded if all would freely and candidly compare their ſentiments to this rule, they would be very ſoon found not very variant.

            <p>On finding this great agreement, ſameneſs and real harmony of ſentiment, among gentlemen reputed eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially to differ, I have often wondered whence could ariſe ſuch different reputations. And without charging it to the account of art and policy to aſperſe one another's charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I have been charitably obliged to conceive this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious difference very like to that which aroſe on the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works</hi> and the <hi>covenant of grace,</hi> and produced a memorable convulſion in our churches in their infancy about 123 years ago: of which Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> has given us an account in his magnalia; where may be ſeen how the great Mr. COTTON was aſperſed and encompaſſed with the public jealouſy.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Cotton's Anſ. to Mr. Williams, p. 50.</note> Jealouſies were raiſed between the beſt of divines and the beſt of chriſtians. It is remarkable how eſſentially they tho't themſelves to differ, and thought the difference even damnable too. Mutual eccleſiaſtical anathemas were denounced, civil diſcord enſued, till a diſhonorable perſecution ſatiated the public ſpirit, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the churches for the cool retroſpect of 50 years, when they found the whole was ſurmiſe, ſuppoſition and miſtake. Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> freely declares it his opinion, that the miniſters of that day all very nearly agreed in ſentiment with Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> at the ſame time, reſpecting thoſe very points on which they unhappily tho't them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to differ—and that their jealouſies all proceded from mutual concern for the welfare of the churches, which led them to ſuſpect and be alarmed at every thing that had
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:009018_0054_10306E823636E800"/>
the aſpect of tendency to their hurt. Poſterity may make the ſame judgment concerning us.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are unaccountable in human nature—but have been facts in paſt ages—may be ſo in the preſent. The only way is to examine our ſentiments by ſcripture; then candidly and benevolently inquire how far we are agreed in reality; to walk together by the ſame amiable rule ſo far as we have attained to think alike; and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear real differences in love, where there appears a ſincere love of truth, candor and piety. Remembering we all have the unalienable right of private judgment in religion; and that liberty of thinking and chuſing our religion, <hi>liberty of conſcience</hi> was the great errand of our pious fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers into America. And as to real differences, I believe we might amicably adjuſt them by honorable and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conceſſions, by ſtudying and comparing the written word which we all agree to be a ſufficient rule, inſtead of human ſyſtems on which we all juſtly differ. In the ſearch after truth it ſhould be our perpetual motto, <hi>"nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius addictus jurare in verba magiſtri."</hi> For after all, the queſtion ought not to be what is <hi>calviniſm,</hi> or what <hi>armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm?</hi>—what was the opinion of <hi>calvin,</hi> or what the opinion of <hi>arminius?</hi> but what is real chriſtianity? what is the truth as Jeſus and his inſpired apoſtles delivered it?</p>

            <p>In the firſt ſettlement of this country our churches were free, independent and unſubordinate to one another. But though it was an agreed point that each church had of itſelf plenary power in deciding all its controverſies, and iſſuing
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:009018_0055_10306E89EF1256B8"/>
all matters of diſcipline: yet they alſo agreed in conſulting and adviſing with the churches of the vicinity, repreſented and aſſembled in council on application of the conſulting church. The adviſory reſults of which councils had, as they juſtly ought to have, conſiderable weight in healing differences. In time it became the opinion of many of the clergy, that it was beſt for the conſervation of the faith and public order, that the adviſory influence of councils ſhould be extended into juridical authority. There have been formed two <hi>platforms</hi> for church diſcipline and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:—one in 1647, before the notions of increaſing or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of giving any authority at all to councils began; the other not 'till 1708, when they run high. The firſt was made at a general ſynod aſſembled at Cambridge, conſiſting of the paſtors and meſſengers of ſeveral churches. The latter at a ſynod conſiſting of the paſtors and meſſengers aſſembled at <hi>Saybrook,</hi> previouſly elected and delegated from the four county conventions of the churches of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut. After theſe platforms were made, they were tranſmitted to the churches for their approbation. Thoſe of Connecticut, except perhaps 14 or 15 churches, have acced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at length to the Say-brook agreement: in what ſenſe, with reſpect to the authority of councils, we ſhall afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. The reſt of the congregational churches in New-England generally regulate themſelves on this point, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the congregational platform, which is commonly called the congregational platform, or rather on the purely ſcriptural model. Now the difference of ſentiments reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the authority of councils, is almoſt intirely founded on ſome very ſtrong expreſſions in both platforms, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the powers and independency of diſtinct unſubordinate churches; and other ſtrong expreſſions, eſpecially in the Say-brook platform, importing the ſubjugation of our chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the final juriſdiction and authority of councils. It may facilitate our underſtanding this matter, as well as the eccleſiaſtical polity of our churches in general, to conſider
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:009018_0056_10306E8BE0B323B8"/>
the ſentiments of the compilers of theſe platforms, the public ſpirit of liberty at the times of their reſpective for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and the ſenſe in which they were received by the ſmall body of churches at firſt, and laſtly the ſenſe in which they are received and adopted by the preſent large body of churches; moſt of which have been gathered ſince theſe regulations and agreements of our anceſtors. But before I proceed, let me juſt obſerve that our eccleſiaſtical polity, at leaſt ſo far as relates to councils, whatever it is, like the polities and ſocial confederacies of all other proteſtant churches, takes origin and is founded in <hi>human</hi> wiſdom, human agreement and confederacy, having no claim to <hi>divine</hi> authority. It is only a wiſe meaſure which the churches accede to for harmony, fellowſhip and union. Antecedent to which agreement and confederacy the churches were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n full life, in full poſſeſſion of all eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical power: and if they have imparted or delegated all or part of this power to councils, the councils received juſt ſo much as the churches covenanted to impart and no more:—which the ſucceding acts of the churches may reſume, limit or continue.</p>
            <p>In order to enter into the ſpirit of the <hi>congregational</hi> platform which we are firſt to conſider, it may be obſerved what is well known, that the firſt miniſters and churches were partly <hi>presbyterian,</hi> partly <hi>congregational</hi>—both <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent.</hi> There ſeem to have been three opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the miniſters. Three or four were for having the whole rule transferred and ceded from the fraternity to a ſtanding elderſhip; the authorative act and concurrence of the brethren to be taken in no caſes but the choice of elders, and in ratifying the ſentence of excommunication. But of this opinion the churches could never be perſuaded. Moſt of the miniſters were for an elderſhip elected by the fraternity, with a negative on the church; and ſo all church acts to procede on the concurrence of the elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and brethren in a mixt adminiſtration. Some few
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:009018_0057_10306E8D9B00A0D0"/>
churches acceded to this: and this is the higheſt ſenſe in which presbyterianiſm ever obtained among our churches. Others of the paſtors agreed with the almoſt univerſal ſenſe of the brethren in the true and proper unmixt idea of a congregational church, viz. that all diſciplinary power veſted in the fraternity. All agreed in receiving the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as their only rule in religion:—all very much agreed in their interpretation of the doctrinal parts of ſcripture: —differing in their notions of diſcipline in little more than this, viz. that <hi>power of the keys,</hi> which the <hi>presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> would have veſted in the elderſhip, the <hi>congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaliſts</hi> would have to veſt and reſide in the body of the fraternity. Both agreed in the independency of each church. Nor were the presbyterians i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>clined to the mode of the Scottiſh or Holland claſſical presbytery. While they were for the excluſive power of elders in admiſſions to communion and diſciplinary acts, that is for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of presbytery in a particular church; they agreed in diſclaiming the authority of a presbytery out of the church, that is the juriſdiction of the eccleſiaſtical presbyteries of the vicinity. The congregationaliſts retained all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the hands of the brethren conjunctly. Both agreed that the power of the keys was in the church, whether exerciſed by the elders alone, or by the whole church. This is a fundamental principle from which the churches never ſuppoſed themſelves to have departed. On theſe general principles the plan of union or confederacy was conceived by the ſynod, A. D. 1646. aſſembled on the recommendation of the legiſlature of Maſſachuſetts. The ſynod thereupon appointed two gentlemen of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, and one of the colony of Plymouth, to draught each of them a model of diſcipline and polity for the choice of the ſucceding ſeſſion. The compilers were the reverend meſſieurs <hi>John Cotton</hi> of Boſton, <hi>Richard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of Dorcheſter, and <hi>Ralph Partridge</hi> of Duxbury. Mr. <hi>Mather</hi>'s model is ſaid to have been choſen. Mr.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:009018_0058_10306E8F50A89278"/>
               <hi>Norton</hi> reviſed it, and with ſuch further amendments as the ſynod thought proper, it was finiſhed. Now the ſentiments of theſe gentlemen are well known to have been presbyterian in the ſecond ſenſe above defined. I imagine they were nearly in the ſame ſentiments: unleſs perhaps Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>'s notions of the authority and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of councils might be lower than the others, as that pious and learned man had ſuſtained an implied or oblique animadverſion in the ſynod of 1637. So far as I can learn, their notions of eccleſiaſtical polity were thus, that every church ſhould be furniſhed with a presbytery conſiſting of a <hi>paſtor, teacher</hi> and one or more <hi>ruling elders,</hi> all elected by the church, in whoſe hands ſhould be the diſcipline and governing, as well as inſtruction of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. That in matters of difficulty this presbytery might adviſe with a council conſiſting of ſuch a number of the triumvirate elderſhips in the vicinity or elſewhere, as they ſhould invite to aſſemble. That the churches properly congregational, and which had no triumvirate, ſhould inſtead of an elderſhip appear in council by their paſtors and meſſengers, as they had done in the ſynods of 1637 and 1646. That the paſtors, elders and meſſengers aſſemble in council in the capacity of delegates from the churches—and as <hi>pares</hi> or equals in council:—not that an occaſional council or oecumenical ſynod ſhould conſiſt of two eſtates, the clergy for one, and the lay-delegates for another; and ſo have diſtinct acts, as in the upper and lower houſes of convocation. That as an oecumenical council might aſſemble at the invitation of the legiſlature; ſo an occaſional council might be aſſembled on the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the church when a difficulty ſubſiſted, not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively to decide and determine the difficulty, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the church how to decide and determine it. That they ſhould be aſſembled only on ſuch occaſions as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church thought proper, and conſider ſuch matters only as the church laid before them, &amp; would be adviſed in.

That the aſſemblings of provincial ſynods and of ordinary councils, be neither of them ſtated, but both pro re nata occaſional.</p>
            <p>It is well known, as I have ſaid, that however fond our fathers in the miniſtry were of the power of presbyteries in churches, and of the advice of councils, they were how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever very oppoſite to the powers of councils, claſſes or ſynods out of the church. In oppoſition to this extraneous foreign juriſdiction, many of them wrote largely, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the reverend Mr. <hi>Cotton:</hi> ſo alſo the rev. Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi> in his anſwer to the rev. Mr. <hi>Paget</hi> of <hi>Holland:</hi> ſo alſo the rev. Mr. Richard Mather, one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers of the platform wrote againſt Mr. <hi>Herle</hi> in 1644. in confutation of Mr. <hi>Herle</hi>'s <q>four arguments for the government of ſynods over particular congregations.</q> Hence theſe gentlemen were intirely againſt the deciſive authority of councils and ſynods when aſſembled: or that they ſhould be veſted with power to enforce their decrees with a penalty of non-communion to be declared by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves authoritatively as a council or ſynod. They would have them <hi>adviſory</hi> only, to give their opinion and adviſe on difficult caſes, as readers of divinity in the univerſity, or men learned in the uſages and cuſtoms of the churches. They were to the churches, if I may borrow an illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from high example, what the privy council are to the king. On the matters laid before them they draw up their judgment and reſult, which is remitted to the church, —if the church received it, it had force; not through the authority of the council or of the churches repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in council, but of the church which receives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it, and which has a plenary power of governing itſelf, and deciding all its controverſies. In like manner the reſult of an oecumenical council or ſynod being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the churches, by the reception of the voting receiving churches to have authority, and among theſe to have force over thoſe only that explicitly receive it. Nor was any church to be hereticated for not approving or

receiving the reſult of a ſynod or council. On the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular caſe of cenſuring a church as a church (whether any thing of this nature be con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tent with the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal independency and unſubordinate equality of churches, or not) it was the opinion of the fathers that a ſynod as ſuch, much leſs an ordinary occaſional council conſiſting of a few churches, had no authority, and ought not to be veſted with any, to excommunicate that offending ſiſter church. But that the ſynod or oecumenical council conſiſting of a repreſentation of the whole body of the churches, recommending non-communion in their reſult, excommunication ſhould procede on the acts of particular churches, and be performed, not by the ſynod <hi>jure ſynodali,</hi> but by the churches themſelves to whom the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory reſult ſhould be remitted, or by ſo many as ſhould ſee cauſe for the reaſons aſſigned in the reſult to withdraw communion:—that no church or churches were obliged to vote this reſult on the penalty of non-communion<note n="*" place="bottom">Non tamen ſub paeca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cenſurae eccleſiaſticae. Norton ad Apollon. p. 110.</note>:— that ſo far as this ſentence of non-communion proceeded in the churches, the particular offending church ſhould be and remain excommunicate till it ſhould render ſubmiſſion to the acceptance of each church reverſing the ſentence: —that if the act of non-communion paſſed in all the churches, ſaid church was abſolutely and intirely excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; if in 20 only, it was excommunicate with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe 20 only and no more, and remained in order and regular ſtanding with thoſe churches from which it was not cut off by an expreſs act. Thus in the opinion of theſe gentlemen, the higheſt act of eccleſiaſtical cenſure, viz. excommunication, was to be guarded.</p>
            <p>This I take to be a juſt ſummary of the opinion of the fathers on eccleſiaſtical polity in general, and the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of councils in particular—as may be collected from their writings, eſpecially Mr. <hi>Cotton's</hi> book <hi>of the keys,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Norton's</hi> anſwer in the name of all the New-England paſtors, to the queſtions on church polity ſent over

This anſwer was wrote the year before the ſynod, which aſſembled firſt in 1646, again 1647, and laſtly in October 1648, when they preſented the platform to the legiſlature to be by them recommended to the churches. Mr. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in his elegant preface to Mr. Norton's anſwer. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the eccleſiaſtical juriſdictions in the Holland and New-England churches, ſums up his opinion on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thus, <q>Synodos nos unà vobiſcum, cum opus fuerit, &amp; ſuſcipimus &amp; veneramur—actus regiminis quos vos à ſynodis <hi>peragi</hi> velletis, eos à ſynodis <hi>porrigi</hi> eccleſiis et <hi>ab eccleſiis</hi> ex ſynodali <hi>diorthoſei peragi</hi> peteremus.—Petimus et illud etiam ut regimen omne eccleſiaſticum adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur à presbyteris cujuſque eccleſiae in eccleſiae facie; nec inſcia nec invita eccleſia.

Preſident <hi>Oakes</hi> was a great advocate for the ballancing power of elders in mixt congregationaliſm, and for <q>councils and ſynods, and the <hi>deciſive power</hi> thereof, <hi>as it hath been ſtated by the leaders</hi> of the congregational way both in Old and New-England.</q> Though he had no notion that <q>the rule and authority of the elders ſhould be rendered an inſignificant thing—as in the way of the <hi>Browniſts;</hi>

This part of presbyterianiſm, viz. the elders admitting to communion, without the explicit concurrence of the church, never obtained among the firſt churches. Several churches in compliance with the ſentiments of their paſtors, had the <hi>ruling</hi> and <hi>teaching</hi> elders at firſt, as Well as the <hi>paſtor:</hi> yet they at length diſuſed the <hi>ruling</hi> elder; and the <hi>teaching</hi> elder as diſtinct from <hi>paſtor</hi> is now dropt. The authority of this triumvirate never roſe high; ſome few of our pious fathers early put in high claims for it, that it ſhould be veſted with ſupreme rule and ſole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. But the ſpirit of the churches would not bear this. The generality of the clergy, not merely from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention, and being overpowered by the prevailing ſpirit of liberty, but I believe from honeſt perſuaſion that it was the ſcripture model, were for dividing all acts of rule and diſcipline between the <hi>elderſhip</hi> and <hi>fraternity,</hi> and rendering the concurrence of both neceſſary. And here the churches cloſed, only being at liberty to have, or not to have an elderſhip beſides the paſtor. Tho' the churches would not bear an actual negative of the elderſhip, whether in a ſingle perſon or more. Nothing of moment was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from the beginning, without the explicit conſent of the fraternity. Nor had they the leaſt notion of ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this priviledge, much leſs of ſuffering ſiſter church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es either diſtinctly or conjunctly to have any juriſdiction over them.

               </gap>ches, held to be the leſſer act.</p>
            <p>Having taken this ſurvey, we are prepared to judge on the platform itſelf, the ſenſe in when it was conceived, the amended ſenſe in which it paſſed the ſynod of 1648, and the ſenſe in which it was, through the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the general aſſembly, received by the churches, and laſtly the ſenſe in which, by act of legiſlature, it in effect became the eccleſiaſtical provincial eſtabliſhment of <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Connecticut.</hi> For by acts of legiſlature in theſe provinces parochial contracts for the ſupport of the congregational clergy are enforcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at law. And theſe acts having received the royal ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſtitute congregationaliſm a <hi>legal</hi> eſtabliſhment. As to the platform itſelf, it is evident that it leaves the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the ſole rule of faith, ordinances and diſcipline. As to what relates to authority and polity, tho' the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers hoped to have introduced a triumvirate presbytery in each congregation to the reception of the churches, yet the authority of ſuch presbytery was confined to ſuch churches as received it, all being at liberty to uſe it or diſuſe it. That while the diſcipline and rule ſhould at leaſt in part veſt in the elderſhip of the preſbyteriated churches, the whole ſhould veſt in the fraternity of the congregational ones. And that no power ſhould be ceded to councils as ſuch. Accordingly the platform leaves each church with plenary unceded power, making the councils and ſynods adviſory only and pro remata or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional:—not excepting the extraordinary caſe of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating a whole church, for this is not to be done by the council, but to obtain only upon the acts of particular churches. In the third way of communion, the judgment of the ſynod or council for declaring non-communion againſt an offending church is of no efficacy, but by <q>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular churches approving and accepting the judgment
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:009018_0065_10306EA8CBAA6B70"/>
of the ſynod<note n="*" place="bottom">Platform.</note>,</q> and reſpectively declaring the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of non-communion in each church. Thus at length with a multitude of interſperſions ſecuring the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and uncontrolable power of the churches, it was paſſed and received as the plan of public confederacy, which united the <hi>presbyterians</hi> and <hi>independents</hi> under the one common title of congregationaliſts, before agreeing in doctrine, mode of worſhip, ordinances, and the ſelf-government of churches. This union did not introduce either to a juriſdiction over one another, but left them the full poſſeſſion of their unceded peculiarities. They agreed that admiſſions ſhould be by the voice of the brotherhood —differing in this, that the rule and government ſhould be divided between the elders and brethren in the one, and veſt wholly in the brotherhood of the other: and that the ceremonies of paſtoral inveſtiture might be performed by the elders of the one, and by delegated brethren of the other. The enjoyment of both theſe peculiarities was covenanted to remain to both reſpectively, without breach of charity or the union. It was a fundamental principle of the union, that every voluntary aſſembly of chriſtians had power to form, organize and govern themſelves, and in imitation of the apoſtolic churches to gather and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate themſelves by a public covenant, and to elect and ordain all their public officers. They held communion with all proteſtant churches; yet held a peculiar fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the churches of their peculiar way and order: and thence the matters of principal moment, ſuch as the gathering of churches and ordinations of paſtors, they tranſacted in the preſence of the delegates of other church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, whom they invited and called in as <hi>witneſſes</hi> of their ſaith and order. The eſſence of paſtoral ordination they held to conſiſt in the election and public covenant between the paſtor and the church. The ceremony of paſtoral inſtitution they held to be the leſſer act, which yet ought to be performed as the gathering of a church with faſting
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:009018_0066_10306EAC651BB1E0"/>
and prayer. The conducting of which religious ceremony was left to the elders in the presbyterian churches—in churches where there was no elder, the platform recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the calling in and employing of the neighboring paſtors to aſſiſt in ordination; yet with an explicit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion that even this might be performed <q>by brethren orderly choſen out of the church for this purpoſe.</q> This inſertion with others ſhews the popular ſenſe of liberty in our churches at that time: and the ſubſequent practice ſuggeſts the true idea of ordination councils, as uſed in theſe churches.</p>
            <p>The ſenſe in which the platform was received may be further collected from the effect with which it has obtained. The popular ſenſe was too ſtrong for the plan conceived by the clergy. The churches were really congregational from the beginning, and never fond of a presbytery for rule and government, nor were they ever pleaſed with the idea of a mixed congregationaliſm deviſed by our wiſe fore-fathers, in which the power was divided between the elders and the brethren. Nor did the diſtinction of pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian and independent, and differences thereon ſubſiſt ſo much among the churches, as between the churches and the miniſters—the miniſters were for presbytery, the churches for congregationaliſm unmixt. It was natural then for them, being left at liberty, to uſe it. Hence the diſtinctions have long ſince been loſt in the one common name of congregationaliſts. The <hi>lay-elder</hi> (if this be not a ſoleciſm) is almoſt intirely droped<note n="*" place="bottom">Some few churches have two ruling elders, and ſome twelve.</note>; and the <hi>teaching elder</hi> as diſtinct from <hi>paſtor</hi> has long ſince been diſuſed. Truly neither of theſe ever obtained in many of our churches after the firſt generation. Two officers of the triumvirate ceaſing, the diſciplinary authority of conſequence veſts in the fraternity: unleſs perhaps in the few churches originally mixt (for I know of none, or not more than one of the firſt churches purely presbyterian) where the paſtor may
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:009018_0067_10306EB0F96CE998"/>
continue to retain a negative on the church, or in the language of our anceſtors, where the power of rule is in the elder, and the power of priviledge only in the brethren. And under the umbrage of thoſe clauſes ſecuring this power to the elders of presbyteriated churches, the paſtors of ſome churches purely congregational have claimed and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed this power. But according to the true principles of congregationaliſm, the paſtor, beſides being moderator of church meetings, or preſident of the chriſtian fraternity, has but the authority of a private brother in the rule and government of the church. The platform happily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded in preventing lay-ordinations. And as to councils, they ſtand juſt as the platform provided at the invitation and election of the particular church, and in their deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>adviſory</hi> only. This is the polity on which the body of the New England churches now ſtand, except a few who have formed themſelves on the true presbyterian model according to Scotland, conſiſting chiefly of acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the preſent century, and a number of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut churches.</p>
            <p>Having conſidered the nature of <hi>congregational councils.</hi> I procede to ſhew the origin and nature of <hi>conſociated councils,</hi> which obtain in Connecticut. So early as 1662 there were propoſals in the ſynod at Boſton drawn up by Mr. Shepard, for reſolving the whole body of the churches into conſociations, that is, that each diſtrict of neighboring churches ſhould by their paſtors and meſſengers aſſemble annually in a ſtanding council to hear and give judgement on eccleſiaſtical controverſies. But this propoſal dropt, not being acceded to by the churches, but ſtrongly oppoſed by them, as they judged themſelves poſſeſſed of ſufficient power to govern themſelves. A few years after this, the miniſters of ſeveral vicinities had formed themſelves into aſſociations or paſtoral meetings for prayer on occaſion of the indian wars<note n="*" place="bottom">THE ASSOCIATIONS begun about A. D. 1670: the firſt CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOCIATIONS A. D. 1709.</note>: theſe aſſociations having continued
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:009018_0068_10306EB3CB72ADE8"/>
about 30 years, began to be deſirous of aſſuming the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated form—which might eaſily be done if the churches could be prevailed on to delegate ſome of the brethren to accompany the miniſters and ſit with them in their paſtoral meeting, and withal prevail on the churches to refer their difficulties to this annual or biſannual aſſembly. Several of the miniſters had urged all the ſpecious arguments, but without ſucceſs. The early anticipated danger of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing what might finally terminate in foreign juriſdiction, prevented the churches from acceding to the propoſals of 1662. In 1700 theſe propoſals were ripened into a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal plan for erecting the <hi>aſſociations</hi> into <hi>conſociations</hi> or ſtanding councils with the moſt abſolute power and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the churches; admitting appeals only to a <hi>general conſociation</hi> compoſed of delegates from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral particular conſociations, and veſted with a definitive binding ſentence. This plan begun to paſs the aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in 1705, as a previous ſtep to its being recommended and adopted by the churches. But the oppoſition it met with from moſt of the aſſociations, and the yet unaſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated paſtors again prevented its being recommended to the churches, where it would have met with ſtill greater oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition through the ſpirit of liberty. Though it failed in the Maſſachuſetts, yet two years after, it was reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and carried into execution among the churches of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, which at this time were, as I take it, univerſally congregationaliſts, tho' ſeveral of the principal miniſters were inclined to the presbyterian rule and government of church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. There were at this time about 40 churches in that colony. On the recommendation of the provincial legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, which bad been previouſly procured, <note n="*" place="bottom">Very much through the influences of the honorable Gordon Salton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governor of the colony, a learned divine, who had been formerly one of the paſtors.</note> the <hi>paſtors</hi> and <hi>meſſengers</hi> of the churches in the four counties aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in four ſeparate conventions, and draughted or paſſed four prepared models of church diſcipline, as nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:009018_0069_10306EB584575018"/>
that of 1705 as the ſpirit of the churches and paſtors would admit, for ſeveral of the principal paſtors were truly congregational. Theſe ſeparate conventions delegated each perhaps two or more paſtors with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective meſſengers, to meet in a general convention, and compoſe out of the ſeveral remitted models a plan of diſcipline for public eſtabliſhment. Theſe delegates from the county conventions aſſembled at <hi>Saybrook</hi> in 1708, to the number of perhaps 10 or 12 paſtors, and perhaps twice as many meſſengers. This ſynod adopted the <hi>Savoy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Formed and agreed to by 120 congregational churches in England, aſſembled by their meſſengers in the Savoy London 1658.</note> with the <hi>heads of agreement,</hi> which happily unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the presbyterian and congregational brethren in <hi>England.</hi> Had they ſtopt here, the liberty of the churches had been ſecure. They alſo from the public ſenſe collected as above, compoſed <hi>articles for the adminiſtration of church diſcipline.</hi> I have been told that the model from New Haven coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſaid to have been draughted principally by the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end Mr. <hi>James Pierpoint,</hi> was that which with ſome amendments paſſed the ſynod. The ſynod having thus combined together the <hi>confeſſion, heads of agreement,</hi> and <hi>articles for diſcipline,</hi> as an eccleſiaſtical conſtitution; it was recommended by the general aſſembly of the colony, and received by moſt of the churches. A ſubſequent act of the general aſſembly has declared ſuch churches as accede to this conſtitution, to have a <hi>legal eſtabliſhment</hi> in that colony, not however excluſive of congregationaliſm, which has equally a legal eſtabliſhment. Thus there are three forms of religion eſtabliſhed in the german empire. In virtue of this agreement and conſtitution, the acceding churches were reſolved into four conſociations, which are now increaſed to nine. Theſe conſociations conſiſt of two eſtates, the <hi>miniſters,</hi> and <hi>meſſengers,</hi> in effect ſeparate in their acts; for though they ſit, deliberate and vote to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in council, yet their acts are of ſeparate import;
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:009018_0070_10306EB74603B410"/>
for being two diſtinct bodies in point of cognizance &amp; juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, they are ſo veſted with a negative on each other, that the concurrence of both in a certain new manner is neceſſary to complete an act of council<note n="*" place="bottom">This platform by implication veſts a miniſter with a negative on his church in all her acts. And in council it has thrown a very great ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of power into the hands of the miniſters, even to more than a negative on the meſſengers. For a majority of the paſtors with ſo many of the meſſengers as make a majority of the council make a vote: but not a majority of the meſſengers and ſo many of the paſtors as make a majority of council. On the preſent footing, the churches have not an equal active repreſentation in council: they may indeed ſend as many meſſengers as they pleaſe, and this is the only way left them to retrieve the balance of power they loſt in 1708. Thus in a council of 20 paſtors and 20 churches, if the 20 church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſend but one meſſenger each, then 15 paſtors and 6 meſſengers may make an act contrary to the ſenſe of 14 churches. This agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then poſſibly ſubjects three quarters of the churches to the deciſion of the paſtors and one quarter of the churches. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the balance it is neceſſary to ſend three meſſengers at leaſt from each church. On the ſubject of power we are to conſider all the poſſible chances. Now though the churches have right to ſend three or more, yet it was eaſily foreſeen that there was no probability of their ſending more than two, and generally but one. Now on the whole two queſtions occur, whether the paſtors are veſted with this particular degree of power and influence in the rule of the churches by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? and whether this particular plan of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and conſtitution of councils is preſcribed in the ſcriptures? If not, the whole is a human agreement and confederacy, not at all partaking of the nature of a divine inſtitution: and though it may ſubſerve valuable purpoſes, is not to be conceived as an ordinance of God.</note>. There at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubſiſts a difference of ſentiment among worthy and pious men, who are real friends to the churches, reſpecting the <hi>powers of churches,</hi> and the powers of <hi>conſociations,</hi> which ſhall ſubordinate when in competition. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of ſentiment I take to be very little among the churches, nor between the paſtors and churches in general, but chiefly among the venerable clergy. The churches is I take it make no queſtion with reſpect to their own plenary and uncontrollable power. The preſent
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:009018_0071_10306EB90E2ED048"/>
difference among the paſtors might be healed by charity and amicable condeſcentions, with the retention of their reſpective judgments as was done the laſt century upon the differences between the presbyterian and congregational paſtors as to church power. The litigation of paſtoral controverſies uneſpouſed by the churches, eſpecially on the ſubject of the paſtoral powers, excepting thoſe with which they are evidently inveſted by the great head of the church, is peculiarly unhappy in the preſent rapid increaſe of our churches, when it is our true intereſt for both paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and churches to be cemented by benevolence and union. The pretext on one ſide is hereſy: but hereſy is to be encountered in this age by reaſoning and appeals to the ſacred oracles, not by the deciſions of uninſpired coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. If councils were by the explicit voluntary act of the churches veſted with ten times more authority than is claimed for them by their warmeſt advocates, they could never decide the point. The ſcriptures are the only rule of proteſtants.</p>
            <p>But whatever be the pretexts on either ſides, the powers of the conſociations being not known in the ſcriptures, are to be determined by an appeal to the platform that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes them. And in order to judge of this we muſt enter into the ſenſe and deſign with which it was conceived, and that in which it was adopted by the churches—that we may reconcile thoſe parts of it which interfere with, if they do not contradict, one another. Taken literally, it in the firſt place ſtipulates the abſolute unſubbordinate power of particular churches. It afterwards veſts the <hi>conſociated council</hi> with authorative final deciſion on all matters of diſcipline ſubmitted to it by the churches of the circuit. It at length veſts the council with general and original juriſdiction on "all occaſions eccleſiaſtical." It ſhould ſeem alſo by ſome expreſſions, that it is veſted with the <hi>power of the keys,</hi> the power of declaring non-communion on a particular church, Now the queſtion is,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:009018_0072_10306EBFC2F37288"/>
whether this amounts to transferring the power out of the churches into the council, in which they are thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented? If it does, then there is a contradiction. And the next queſtion is, upon a competition, which ſhall looſe their power, the <hi>particular churches,</hi> or the <hi>conſociation?</hi> The <hi>deciſive power</hi> when aſſembled, and the power to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble uncalled upon <hi>"all occaſions eccleſiaſtical,"</hi> if bona fide ceded by the churches, amounts in my opinion to an intire and abſolute ſurrendery of all power and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the churches, and may in time be claimed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. For with ſuch power the conſociations may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict any eccleſiaſtical proceſs in the churches on any eccleſiaſtical matter, and with ſuch prohibition remove it out of the hands of a particular church into the council. There remains then but one w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in which the liberties of the churches are by this conſtitution ſecured, and if this be cloſed, their power and privilege is a cypher, viz. that the ſtanding council have no power but when called, and on the matters only ſubmitted by the church—even this would be a ſurrendery of more power than is ceded to <hi>congregational councils,</hi> which are <hi>adviſory</hi> only in their reſults; whereas the <hi>conſociated councils</hi> are <hi>deciſive</hi> in matters ſubmitted by the churches. Whatever was the ſenſe of the churches in adopting it, it is pretty evident that the platform itſelf is interlined with a clauſe veſting the conſociation, not only with the deciſion when called by the inviting church, but with original juriſdiction upon "all matters eccleſiaſtical," unleſs the phraſe all occaſions eccleſiaſtical" be limited to diſcipline, or interpreted in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to the fundamental principle of the union, the uncontrollable power of particular churches.</p>
            <p>Let us then conſider the ſenſe in which it was received by the churches. And here we are to remark that the platform itſelf provides and ſtipulates that <q>none of our particular churches ſhall be ſubordinate to one another, each being endowed with equality of power from Jeſus
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:009018_0073_10306EC176654330"/>
Chriſt: and that none of the ſaid particular churches, their officer or officers ſhall exerciſe power or have any ſuperiority over any other church or their officers.</q> This was the baſis of the union—ſecuring this they agreed to unite in ſocial confederacy and fellowſhip. If any ſubſequent expreſſions intermixed in the articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould ſeem to interfere with and contradict this principle, ſo as to transfer eventually the power out of the particular church in its individuate capacity—is it to be ſuppoſed the churches ratified them? rather is it not to be ſuppoſed the they interpreted them in a ſenſe ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the firſt principle?</p>
            <p>If the council has juriſdiction on all matters, whether ſubmitted or not; then the churches in their individual and ſeparate capacities may poſſibly have none at all, becauſe the council may poſſibly take cognizance of all. But if the council can take cognizance of one matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the church; then in that one caſe the church has no power. If it was firſt agreed that each in their ſeparate and individual capacities ſhould take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance and determine all matters within the church: and afterwards it was reſtricted to their repreſentation in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, would not this ſubvert the firſt principle? Was the thing ſo apprehended by the churches? Or can it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the churches power and conſociations do not interfere, when the latter without the conſent of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer take a matter out of her hands and determine it? If the church puts it into the conſociation, her power is given up—ſhe has no deciſion of her own, but muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the deciſion of the council, unleſs ſhe applied to the council for advice only, and not for a judicial decree. This is a great ſurrendery. But to veſt a foreign body with power to come and take a matter regularly depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and iſſuable in the church, and determine upon it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſenſe of the church, is a ſtill greater, even an intire ſurrendery of all power, or at leaſt ſubmitting to
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:009018_0074_10306EC331B1B1E8"/>
hold it of the conſociation. And was this the ſenſe of the churches—of the 30 that firſt received it—and of the perhaps 100 new ones that have adopted it ſince? Is not this effectually to ſubordinate particular churches to one another? and enabling a number of churches and their officers to exerciſe power and have ſuperiority over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther church and her officers? Or was it meant that truly one church ſhould not exerciſe dominion over another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe could gain a number of her ſide, and then indeed ſhe might? And was it indeed the deſign of the churches to ſubordinate a particular church to the body? Would not each embodied church thus derive an acceſſion of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in her united capacity, and thus become veſted with an unavoidable ſuperiority? And does not this mutual acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of power deſtroy the individual equality of churches, and effectually ſubordinate them to one another as well as to the body? If A B and C equal and unſubordinate, veſt one another with a controlling power, ſo that A can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act without the conſent of B or C, and ſo for all— this is a mutual transferring of power; in which transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or modeled power A B and C equally partake, and thus become <hi>equal</hi> in power. But does not this equality of acceſſional and interchangeable power deſtroy the <hi>firſt equality?</hi> and is not this peculiarly modelled equality a mutual ſubordination of the whole? It is moſt certainly. If ſo, the firſt or laſt muſt be given up. Liberty may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer equality of power; all equalities of power do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer liberty. But if A B and C covenant that they will not act without the advice of one another, with reſervation of power to act contrary to advice, liberty and equality are ſaved. If they covenant that when they ſubmit a matter to one another it ſhall be final, and retain the power of ſubmitting, the <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>equality</hi> are preſerved. It is the laſt ſenſe only in which the ſtipulated equality and liberty of the churches can be retained upon the Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook platform. <hi>In all other ſenſes, equality may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:009018_0075_10306EC637F42C48"/>
but the liberty is loſt.</hi> Equality of power to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and aſſiſt in inſlaving others, remains when the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſelf-government is loſt. But it is better to looſe our liberty into domeſtic than foreign hands. There are degrees in vaſſalage or ſubjection as well as of liberty. The fathers ſtipulated for the churches the moſt <hi>perfect</hi> liberty. It is poſſible in time there may be one or more provincial confederacies or generalities here, and an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or common <hi>council of ſtate</hi> for civil adminiſtration ſtanding on free provincial elections, Even the <hi>conſulate</hi> and <hi>ſenate</hi> of the roman empire ſubſiſted a long time on elections, and theſe not ſeptonnial or triennial but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual. There would be an eſſential difference between ſubordinating the provinces to the reſolutions of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme council of ſtate, tho' of their own electing; between this I ſay, and their reſerving to themſelves a power to ratify or annual thoſe reſolutions. Even the firſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to foreign appointments, and in a ſenſe may be ſaid to be a valuable liberty and privilege: but true ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine liberty conſiſts only with the laſt. The united pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Holland have found they can ſubſiſt in this manner: and after all that has been ſaid, this form of polity is not more liable to convulſions and revolutions than any other. But however it may be in other reſpects, it is certain that with reſpect to LIBERTY, the provinces will prefer that plan of confederacy which reſerves to them in their ſeparate capacities the approbation or diſapprobation of the plans or political meaſures conceived and remitted to them from the ſupreme common council. And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the fundamental baſis of ſuch a union, was the <hi>equality, uncontrollable power</hi> of ſelf government in each province, and that no province or provinces, or their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſhall have any power over any other province or its officers; And ſuppoſing while defining the buſineſs of the common council, as how that it is to take cognizance of <hi>"all matters political"</hi> in any or all the provinces,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:009018_0076_10306ECB64A370B8"/>
with power to aſſemble on "all occaſions political," there ſhould alſo be intermixed ſome ſtrong general expreſſions reſpecting the power of the council amounting in their literal ſenſes and perhaps in the intended ſenſe of thoſe who inſerted them, to an abſolute power and irreſiſtable dominion: And after the council was introduced to the reception of the provinces, chiefly thro' the ſtipulated ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of liberty; the council ſhould undertake de novo to enforce ſome of their reſolutions by the unnoticed and liquidated clauſes of the conſtitution: I ſay ſuppoſing all this, would not the provinces feel their liberty touched? And would it not be wiſdom for them all to unite in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, unleſs the council dropt their claims? Would not this be the event, unleſs the ſpirit of liberty was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed or embarraſſed by management?—If this <hi>council of ſtate</hi> be by conſtitution veſted with the judicial deciſion of all matters of difficulty <hi>ſubmitted</hi> to it by any of the provinces of the union, it will nearly reſemble the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations.</hi> If the <hi>council of ſtate</hi> only deliberate for the public good and remit ſuch deliberations to the provinces, and on application of a province upon difficult emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies give their definitive ſentence, i. e. the reſult of their opinion and advice, it will nearly reſemble the <hi>congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional councils.</hi> If the <hi>council</hi> have abſolute power over "all matters political" in all the provinces, and in virtue of this can interdict all lower proceſſes, and remove all cauſes before it, without the conſent of the province, and even contrary to it take a matter out of its hands and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially determine it, and enforce this judicial deciſion on the province, on penalty of ejecting it from the union; it will nearly reſemble the <hi>conſociations</hi> in the ſenſe of ſome of the worthy paſtors.</p>
            <p>The churches felt the importance of reſerving to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſubmiſſion of cauſes to the conſociation. They at once perceiv'd, that if the conſociation could of their own motion aſſemble upon a church and authoritatively

take out of her hands the judicial deciſion of cauſes, their liberty was gone. Accordingly, when April 13, 1709 the churches of New Haven county, by their patters and meſſengers firſt formed themſelves into a conſocia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on, in conſequence of the Saybrook agreement, they acceded to the agreement upon certain reſtricting explanations, which ſhew as well the public ſpirit of liberty, as the ſenſe in which they adopted the platform. In theſe explanations it was ſtipulated that a majority, both of meſſengers and paſtors was neceſſary to an act—that the ſentence of non communion was not definitive, nor to be declared till it had paſſed the approbation of particular churches—that <q>churches may call a council before they procede to cenſure, but without their allowance no particular perſon ſhall have a council before excommunication:</q> Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially agreeable to that fundamental principle of their union, "that none of our particular churches ſhall be ſubordinate to one another, "nor excerciſe power, or have any ſuperiority over any other church, or their officers," No ſubſequent expreſſions to be taken in a ſenſe ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of this, becauſe in themſelves null and void.</p>
            <p>On the whole, it ſeems to appear that however the power and ſubordinate equality of churches is ſecured in the beginning of the platform, yet there are afterwards ſuch inſertions, which, if taken literally, would ſubvert the firſt indiſpenſable principle. In conſequence and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the umbrage of which it is demanded as a right that each conſociation, charged with the inſpection of its churches, have power to arraign and depoſe a paſtor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and even contrary to, the conſent of his church,— take "all cauſes eccleſiaſtical" out of the hands of the church, and judicially decide them—and if the church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies this power and juriſdiction, to arraign the whole church, deciſively judge upon her, and enforce their decree with the ſentence of non-communion. In this ſenſe it ſhould ſeem that the conſtitution has eſtabliſhed two powers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:009018_0078_10306ED3350B8F30"/>
in exerciſe, the <hi>uncontrolled power</hi> of particular churches, and the <hi>controlling power</hi> of the conſociations. And if the ſpirit of liberty did not prevent, it may become a rule for the conſociations in virtue of the clauſe, <q>all occaſions eccleſiaſtical, <note n="*" place="bottom">The extenſive juriſdiction of the High Commiſſion ſubſiſted on a like comprehenſive clauſe, "all affairs eccleſiaſtical." The force and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of which was felt by the holy and venerable <hi>Cotton, Norton, Hooker.</hi> See <hi>Hume</hi>'s Hiſtory of Britain, Vol. i. p. 37.</note>
               </q> to iſſue prohibitions to the churches (which has been tried in one inſtance) to remove ſuch cauſes as they the conſociation think proper, out of the hands of the churches, by a <hi>certiorari</hi> into the ſupreme eccleſiaſtical tribunal. But this was not the ſenſe of the churches, when they received the platform. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal alteration which they deemed was this, that whereas the congregational councils were elected promiſcuouſly from the churches, the churches were now limited to the conſociated council as a ſtanding council on matters of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which they veſted with a deciſive power on matters which they ſubmitted to them—and which they might on all other matters repair to, adviſe with and conſult as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational councils. A hiſtory of the conſociations from the beginning to this time, and the uſe which the churches have made of the conſociations, would abundantly evince this. It is further to be remembered, that they never once thought of any alterations reſpecting ordination coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and leaſt of all, that the conſociation excluſive ſhould have the power of ordination in the circuit, as appears from the uninterrupted uſuage of the churches for the firſt 40 years after the platform, in which I ſuppoſe there was not a ſingle inſtance of <hi>conſociated</hi> ordinations. All theſe claims are of modern date, and defenſible only upon thoſe novel interpretations which are ſubverſive of the firſt grand fundamental principle of the union. The Connecticut churches remain at liberty to chuſe what miniſters they pleaſe, to ordain their paſtors elect, and what churches they
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:009018_0079_10306ED7E6E5A828"/>
pleaſe for a fraternal witneſs of the ſolemnity, and from whom alſo to aſk and receive the <hi>right hand of fellowſhip.</hi> For the right hand of fellowſhip may either upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of chriſtianity, or the platform, be as regularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the congregational churches, as the conſociated ones, even by the conſociated churches themſelves, as has been repeatedly the fact. The fellowſhip and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is indiſcriminately held among both. The paſtors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with the conſent of the electing church, ordain the paſtor elect; and in the name of themſelves and the churches, give the right hand of hand of fellowſhip, to denote their willingneſs to walk together in paſtoral and church communion.</p>
            <p>As the platforms are ſuppoſed to receive great efficacy from their becoming provincial eſtabliſhments, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to conſider this alſo. Antecedent to the platforms, the three colonies of Plymouth. Maſſachuſetts and Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut, made and continued to make pariſhes by acts of their reſpective aſſemblies, and veſted them with power to tax themſelves for the ſupport of ſuch paſtors and teachers as they ſhould elect. The ſame thing was continued after the platforms were adopted by the reſpective acts of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature as provincial eſtabliſhments, and eſpecially after the preſent charters. Which acts in the provinces of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts and New-Hampſhire, receiving the Royal ſanction after the revolution, as fully eſtabliſh congregationaliſm in thoſe two provinces, as the acts of parliament and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſtabliſh epiſcopacy in South Britain, and presbytery in North Britain. And the aſſembly of Connecticut being veſted by royal charter with plenary legiſlative power, the religious eſtabliſhment of that colony is compleat, as all her other legiſlative acts are, without the royal ſanction: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as it is an eſtabliſhment of the ſame thing which has received the royal approbation in the neighbouring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, which gives a declared conſtruction of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar law or act, as not being contrary to the acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:009018_0080_10306ED9D0970260"/>
eſpecially this is conſentancous to that part of the act of union which eſtabliſhes a ſimilar religious inſtitution for Scotland. Now all the force which a particular form of religion receives from a civil eſtabliſhment, whether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or provincial, is from the temporalities and civil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities annexed by the legiſlature. With regard to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and public ſecular offices, all religious, protaſtant ſects are equally privileged in New-England. But the legal power to tax a ſociety for the maintenance of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and other parochial charges, belongs to but one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral denomination, the <hi>congregationaliſts,</hi> under their ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what different forms, excepting that the epiſcopalians in Connecticut, under certain limitations, have power to tax themſelves. And legally thoſe churches or aſſemblies that are independent presbyterians, or Scotch presbyterians, or congregationaliſts truly ſuch, or laſtly congregationaliſts on the Saybrook model, are congregational only in law. The law conſiders them, not is churches purely,<note n="*" place="bottom">The churches, as diſtinct from the congregation, are bodies corporate to the purpoſe of receiving and improving benefactions, and hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The legal efficacy of their acts reſults, not from the religious form, but from the paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial powers with which they are endowed. The pariſhes are to certain purpoſes incorporate, bodies known in the law; the efficacy of parochial contracts all iſſue from the parochial powers; and the contracts with paſtors depend not at all for their validity in law upon any of the forms of ordination, whether performed by elders in a church and paſtors out of the church, or whether indeed there be no ordination at all. For I ſuppoſe if a pariſh in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial corporate capacity ſhould contract with an unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained preacher at an annual ſtipend for life, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:009018_0081_10306EDB8823BD80"/>
of his performing divine ſervice every Lord's-day, that it would be equally valid in law as if he was ordained, or equally valid as if made with a ſchool-maſter for life or during good behavior. And this ſeems ſtill more evident, not only from the nature of parochial powers, but from hence, that the paſtoral contract of legal validity antecedes ordination in all caſes. Unleſs the parochial call and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance be deemed only preparatory to the public enſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ratification of the contract; yet even here, the tranſaction which induces legal obligation is only that part of ordination in which the call and acceptance is publicly ratified—and yet as this is a covenant only between the paſtor and church, and not explicitly between the paſtor and congregation, which is only eccleſiaſtical, it ſhould ſeem that that which has legal efficacy on the inhabitants of the pariſh or congregation as ſuch, is the antecedent contract. But ſuppoſing it depends on ordination, and that the legal covenant is not perfected till the ſolemnities of the inveſtiture: yet by the univerſal practice of our churches, the ordination may be performed by whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the church deſire to do it. And in inſtallments in particular, it is indifferent whether this antecedent ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation has been performed by congregational paſtors, or by thoſe who have had ordination according to the church of Scotland. All paſtors have the power of ordination, and can confer holy orders on whomſoever they judge qualified, and at the deſire of a particular church can give him the paſtoral charge of that church—when ſuch paſtor is ordained, and ſuch church organized with a paſtor to all purpoſes civil as well as eccleſiaſtical. And though it is always deſirable that there ſhould be a harmony among the churches, and though perhaps it would not be prudent for the church to deſire it, or the paſtors to perform it upon the ſure proſpect of diſunion, yet when it is done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agreeable or diſagreeable to ſiſter churches and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, the parochial immunities are unhurt, and the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:009018_0082_10306EDD44FB11F8"/>
procedure valid both eccleſiaſtically and legally, ſo far as the law takes any notice of it. This was early and all along the practice of our churches, and the platforms have induced no alterations in it.</p>
            <p>The whole religious eſtabliſhment of New England is congregationaliſm, except in the colony of Rhode Iſland, where the legiſlative eſtabliſhment is univerſal proteſtant liberty, but without annexing parochial privileges to any ſect. Here no religious congregations or ſocieties are bodies known in the law, and all benefactions, regularly ought to be made to <hi>ſeoffees in truſt.</hi> In The three other New England governments, all parochial congregations are bodies corporate. The legiſlature of Connecticut in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular have enacted, <q>that the inhabitants of any town or ſociety or pariſh conſtituted by this aſſembly who are preſent at a town or ſociety meeting legally warned, ſhall have power by the major vote of thoſe ſo met to call and ſettle a miniſter or miniſters among them</q>— and <q>that the miniſter ſo called and ſettled ſhall be the miniſter of ſuch town or ſociety.</q>
               <q>—and all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—made by the major part of the inhabitants— with ſuch miniſter or miniſters reſpecting his or their ſettlement, &amp;c. ſhall be binding and obligatory on all the inhabitants of ſuch town or ſociety—and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</q> And again, <q>all ſuch towns and ſocieties or pariſhes by their proper votes or acts ſhall annually— grant a tax for the purpoſe aforeſaid, to be levied on their inhabitants according to their reſpective liſts.</q> From hence it appears, that all which induces legal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations is to be done by the inhabitants or members of the congregation—the act of the church in paſtoral electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as diſtinct from the congregation is not neceſſary, though I ſuppoſe univerſally practiced, except in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The churches as ſuch are legal bodies for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and holding eſtates, but not for regulating the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of paſtors. In this the laws univerſally conſider the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:009018_0083_10306EE189543EA0"/>
parochial inhabitants in a congregational capacity, whether the church in the pariſh be <hi>congregational, conſociated, presbyterian</hi> or <hi>ſcriptural.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a pariſh church on the congregational platform ſhould for reaſons renounce it for the Saybrook, or laſtly ſhould renounce both for the purely ſcriptural model; the pariſh is the ſame pariſh, amidſt all the mutations of its church, enjoying the ſame civil and legal immunities and powers, and is treated by the legiſlature as all other pariſhes of the congregational platform. And however the churches may have confederated among themſelves and may be affected by the deciſions of council; yet the pariſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or the churches conſidered as part of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial congregation are unaffected—if in its eccleſiaſtic capacity it is affected, in its congregational it is not: its ſpiritualities may be touched, but not its temporalities. Whenever theſe ſhall be connected—the affecting the one will ſenſibly affect the other. But as the caſe now ſtands, if the conſociation aſſume even the deciſion with which by the platform it is veſted (much more, ſhould it happen to aſſume an unſurrendered conſtitutional juriſdiction) and decree contrary to the ſenſe of the <hi>congregation</hi> and the pariſh <hi>church;</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> is not touched—and one vote which they have power to make among themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws the <hi>latter</hi> from this juriſdiction, without the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to her temporalities or eccleſiaſtical liberty:—as has been repeatedly done: nay, if even excommunicated by the whole body of churches, yet has ſhe the ſame legal privileges as all the others. When a church and congregation have become large, they often on differences divide: the minor or withdrawing part form by ſpontaneous voluntary act into a congregation, and gather a church, and elect a paſtor, whom they requeſt ſome of the neighbouring paſtors to ordain and confer holy orders upon. All this is done or may be done, for it has been often done from the beginning, antecedent to the aſſembly's forming them
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:009018_0084_10306EE56A8A4DF8"/>
into a pariſh. Now whenever it has received pariſh pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it is in all reſpects ſecure as to its temporalities, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the church be in followſhip with the body of church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or not. A new pariſh may be erected in the old pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial bounds on the application of aggrieved brethren: but the ſtanding party remain and continue a pariſh, and even the firſt pariſh and church as they hold under the firſt, and not a ſubſequent appointment. And in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in Connecticut but one, the two pariſhes formed within the ſame parochial bounds are of different forms as to their churches. And the act of aſſembly incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating a new pariſh into a body known in the law, does not deſtroy the firſt pariſh, nor affect its antecedent acts and agreements "made by the major vote of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants." This whether the firſt pariſh church be conſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, congregational, or presbyterian; whether this year the one, or by vote of itſelf the next year another.</p>
            <p>This being the ſtate of the religious eſtabliſhments in New-England, and in Connecticut in particular, it appears that all claims of councils or conſociations, with reſpect to juriſdictions and deciſions in oppoſition to the ſenſe of particular churches and parochial congregations, may be fruitleſs and to little purpoſe, beſides a temporary em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiling of the churches. Beſides, that through ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy principles reſpecting the terms of communion and the qualification of communicants, by which multitudes of ſober, pious and virtuous chriſtians are deterred from the ordinances, our churches are often but a ſmall part of the parochial congregations. And it is the congregation in its parochial congregational capacity that the law conſiders: And this as ſuch does not enough partake of an eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical nature to be ſubject to eccleſiaſtical juriſdictions; or to have the validity of any of its acts dependent on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of an eccleſiaſtical council. And even at to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of theſe deciſions on the churches as ſuch. they perhaps had better be left as thoſe of the congregational
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:009018_0085_10306EE851C79708"/>
councils <hi>adviſory</hi> only, according to the ſenſe in which it is probable that the Connecticut churches received their platform. All that is beyond this, till the public ſpirit be ſubdued, muſt endanger conteſts and oppoſitions, in which the public benevolence and liberty may ſuffer. And it is to be remarked, that even conſociated churches have often called in congregational councils to adviſe on difficulties; which ſhews that they did not underſtand themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted to the conſociated councils. And it is further to be remarked, that the churches of the apoſtolic age knew nothing of conſociated or congregational councils, nor their powers; but ſubſiſted in the full enjoyment of unembar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed liberty. No apoſtolic church had authority over another, either in an individual or aggregate capacity. The claims of authority in conſociated councils over the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, are not only contrary to the primitive pattern, but probably will not prevail in New-England, unleſs the legiſlatures enact that no congregational churches ſhall have benefit of the laws. It is ſaid that there are ſeveral churches in Connecticut which have not acceded to the platform, moſt of which are congregational; and yet have the ſame immunities and privileges with the others. And any may renounce the platform when they pleaſe, as has been done in ſome inſtances, and yet are in full charity and communion with the conſociated churches. It might be happy if they could all walk together on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated form, as they probably would do in time, if the conſociation ſubſiſted for fellowſhip only, and not for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, which eſſentially interferes with the ſtipulated equality of churches. Nor can the conſociations regularly, I mean conſiſtently, declare non-communion with one of theſe congregational churches, unleſs they do with all— If the cauſe or crime be only their denial of their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, becauſe they well know that all congregational churches agree in denying this juriſdiction. Nor was it originally deſigned by the Saybrook council, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:009018_0086_10306EEA2214F1F0"/>
Aſſembly, or laſtly by the receiving churches, that all or any of the uncomplying congregational churches, ſhould for this be hereticated, or held under the ſentence of non-communion. Nor that every church acceding to the union ſhould be obliged to ſend delegates to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation in all cauſes: as to this, they were at their liberty. And the churches have frequently omitted this, as I am told. Nor can a conſociation regularly by the platform declare non-communion jure ſynodali, for this, or a real crime in the church ſuppoſed offending, eſpecially in New-Haven county, becauſe the churches of that circuit, at their firſt forming into a conſociation in 1709, expreſly covenanted that the ſentence of non-communion ſhould be referred back to the particular churches of the circuit, and obtain on their particular acts. Hence half a dozen churches may for preſent reaſons decline ſending their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and meſſengers to a conſociation for ſuch time as they pleaſe, and yet continue members of the union, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main upon the platform, and may afterwards reſume their rights, till ſuch time as they voluntarily renounce the union, or are excommunicated by the acts of the particular churches of the circuit. In which laſt caſe, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they pleaſe, they may meet by their delegates and form a new conſociation, and become a true conſociation of a new circuit, and regular upon the platform—not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the conſociation of another circuit—unleſs in ſome future pregreſs of alteration in the policy, all the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation ſhould be ſubjugated to the controll of a general conſociation. In which caſe the new conſociation might ſubſiſt a ſovereignty of itſelf, denying the juriſdiction of all foreign powers. New-Haven conſociation, when firſt formed, conſiſted of but <hi>five</hi> churches.</p>
            <p>The eſſential laws of eccleſiaſtical fellowſhip and the Saybrook platform require that, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> excommunications, whether of perſons or churches, this meaſure is not to be gone into without giving opportunity to the perſons or
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:009018_0087_10306EF04D35C660"/>
churches to be hereticated to make their defence, and ſhew their reaſons to the church or churches of the vicinity, that they may act on their own knowledge and judgment, and not the report of others. If then they ſuſtain excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, they revert to the ſtate of congregational churches; out of union indeed with the conſociated churches of the circuit, but holding all the privileges of the legal eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and remaining in union and fellowſhip with only the greateſt body of churches in New-England, I mean thoſe on the Cambridge platform, if not perhaps with thoſe of the other conſociated circuits, that is, they will or may poſſibly be in unity, with about 400 churches, and out of unity with 100. perhaps not above 50. All this is ſaid upon ſuppoſition that the ejected church or churches be the ſame as to doctrine and manner of worſhip with the generality of the churches, and that the denial of foreign eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction be the <hi>only</hi> reaſon of non-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. As was the caſe in the only inſtance of hereticating a church in New-England.</p>
            <p>This is the caſe as matters now ſtand. We have ſeen what efficacy the platforms have received from the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive regulations about religion. And that in effect they have not entered into any of the diſtinctions, but conſider all only as different ſpecies of congregationnaliſm. All that is done is only to incorporate the congregation—the congregations model themſelves as they pleaſe. No tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities or immunities are annexed to any unions or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined cluſters of churches, or to any public reſolutions iſſuing from ſuch combination. Perhaps it would be well if all our churches were reſolved into friendly conſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations for mutual aid and fellowſhip. All unions indeed forming an aggregate of powers, are liable, and too apt to terminate in juriſdictions. Not that theſe coalitions are abſolutely neceſſary. The apoſtolic churches ſubſiſted without either—as I have ſaid they knew not either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations or claſſes or their powers—and whenever they
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:009018_0088_10306EF3597935B0"/>
take place they muſt obtain on other preſcriptions than thoſe particularly ſpecified by the apoſtles, or our common Lord. But though the cantoning a body of churches into generalities and circuits, be not abſolutely neceſſary, and in no wiſe ſcriptural, yet it may ſubſerve valuable purpoſes. Many of theſe things, not entering into the eſſence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are left to human diſcretion. The late reverend Dr. COLMAN was a friend to conſociations of churches, but not in a ſenſe ſubverſive of congregationaliſm, for he looked upon them not the deſtruction, but the "very ſoul and life of the congregational ſcheme"—Now they would prove the death of the congregational ſcheme if the churches be ſubordinated to their juriſdictions, <hi>for of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought in bondage</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. ii. 19.</note>, and this even <hi>while they promiſe themſelves liberty.</hi> Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and benevolence, not dominion, was the great characteriſtic of this venerable divine, whoſe praiſe is in all the churches. He patronized the moſt congregational act which was ever practiſed in theſe churches, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which poſterity may ſee the wiſdom of imitating. And he was too well acquainted with antiquity not to be ſenſible that the grand defection of the latin church took origin in thoſe artfully deforced ceſſions which ſubverted the liberty, independence and plenary power of churches So long as the power continued in the hands of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, undelegated to repreſentation by perpetual decree or binding conſtitution, they were ſafe as the apoſtles planted and left them:—but this ceded and given up, they paſſed into an inteſtine oppreſſion, more barbarous than the pagan perſecutions.</p>

Never ſuffer the united force and power of the churches to be at the call, eſpecially at the command of a ſtanding body of men, even if part ſubſiſt on conſtitutional delegates from the churches. The ends of civil and eccleſiaſtical polity are ſo widely different, that however this may be expedient in the one, it is by no means ſo in the other. If the united force of the churches can be conſtitutionally col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and directed to ſuch objects and ends as a ſtanding council (liable to corruption and undue influence) ſhall command, without and contrary to the conſent of individual churches, whether the policy be a monarchy, or an oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy, it is indifferent—liberty is gone, tyranny and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine oppreſſion may be the fate of ſucceeding genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Our churches have not as yet given up their powers and liberty into foreign hands, at leaſt the main body have not, and it is queſtionable whether any have deſignedly and bona fide done it. Let them be taught to ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt has made them free. Heaven is giving us an opportunity to plant a noble body of free churches in America, and has charged us with a part to act for poſterity.

            <p>The body of the clergy in New-England might eaſily adopt a ſyſtem of eccleſiaſtical management, which in a century or two, with moderation and attention to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirit, would gently gain the ſubmiſſion of the churches, and inſenſibly ſteal away their liberty. But I rejoice to believe they are not inclined to it.

That the ſpirit of diſunion is attended with more fatal prejudices in the ſwift growth of a body of churches, than when they are arrived to maturity. To which we may add, 8. That many conſiderable errors, if let alone, will correct themſelves in time on free inquiry, deliberate and unheated diſquiſitions.</p>
            <p>But if different uſages and cuſtoms in eccleſiaſtical po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are finally ſettled in different churches, agreeing in the eſſentials of chriſtian doctrine and worſhip: this need not diſturb the general harmony.

All proteſtant churches have different models under the general profeſſion, and yet we have charity for all. We are in full charity with churches which have loſt all their liberty, yet are ornaments to the chriſtian profeſſion. And among ourſelves, let it not break our communion if any of our churches give up all their liberty, or retain it all in their own hands. If the great end is an anſwered of making men virtuous and good, let us rejoice, though the means are diverſified. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly let us of the congregational communion in New-England, under the different forms of our churches, culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate a venerable regard for one another; rejoice that we are ſo well agreed in purity of doctrine and worſhip, and walk together by the ſame rule, <hi>ſo far as we are agreed:</hi> and for the reſt, let us endeavour to hope and think and ſpeak the beſt of one another, in all our differences, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on forbearance, charity and a condeſcending benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I come now at length to conſider the expediency of harmony and union, eſpecially among the congregational churches in New-England. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt argument may be taken from the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the cauſe in itſelf conſidered, its purity, its friendly aſpect on the public religious liberty, and its utility to the ſtate. I am perſuaded from a very thorough diſquiſition and ſearch, that there is no body of churches in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant world more nearly recovered to the ſimplicity and purity of the apoſtolic age. We need indeed ſome further purifications and amendments; which will doubtleſs take
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:009018_0095_10306F05C7CA6A50"/>
place in proceſs of time on free inquiry and univerſal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to the prevailing of which it is already impoſſible to put a ſtop. But in general our churches appear to me to be nearly on the ſame footing with the primitive chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as left by the apoſtles, who doubtleſs left them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely inſtituted. Moſt other proteſtant churches are under embarraſſments from which we are free. If there be more liberty for free inquiry at preſent in ſome of them, it does not flow from the nature of their policy, but from the laudable moderation of their clergy, or other leſs honorable motives—And beſides, the avenues to this liberty are embarraſſed with diſhonorable compliances and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. Any embarraſſments in our churches procede not from the nature of their policy, but from the ſpirit of the times, which muſt and will alter. If there be any true way of worſhipping the deity, the ſupreme Lord of nature, it may be in our manner: even deiſts muſt confeſs that our way is or may be natural and rational. And being poſſeſſed of the precious jewel of religious liberty, a jewel of ineſtimable worth, let us prize it highly, and eſteem it too dear to be parted with on any terms; leſt we be again entangled with that yoke of bondage <note n="*" place="bottom">STAR-CHAMBER and HIGH COMMISSION.</note> which our fathers could not, would not. and God grant we may never ſubmit to bear. The leſſer differences among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which will at times unavoidably ſpring up in this imperfect militant ſtate, and afford a temporary diſturbance to the beſt conſtituted churches, will again ſubſide, and finally terminate in defining the limits of power, and in more accurately aſcertaining the terms of communion and univerſal benevolence. Providence has planted the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh America with a variety of ſects, which will unavoidably become a mutual balance upon one another. Their temporary colliſions, like the action of acids and alcalies after a ſhort ebullition, will ſubſide in harmony and union, not by the deſtruction of either, but in the friendly coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:009018_0096_10306F0D6FFCAB00"/>
of all. An antecedent fermentation may take place, as it his done in the philoſophic world, but generous inquiry and liberal diſquiſition will iſſue all in this. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent and all-prevailing TRUTH will terminate the whole in univerſal harmony. All ſurreptitious efforts and attempts on the public liberty will unavoidably excite the public vigilance of the ſects, till the terms of general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion be defined and honorably adjuſted. The notion of erecting the polity of either ſect into univerſal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion to the deſtruction of the reſt, is but an airy viſion —may ſerve to inflame a tempory enthuſiaſm—but can never ſuccede—all the preſent ſects will ſubſiſt &amp; increaſe into diſtinct reſpectable bodies, continuing their diſtinctions for a long time yet to come in full life and vigor. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed mutual oppreſſion will more and more ſubſide from their mutual balance of one another. Union may ſubſiſt on theſe diſtinctions, coaleſcence only on the ſameneſs of public ſentiment, which can again be effected in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world only by the gentle, but almighty power of truth. It has been effected in paſt ages, but can never be effected again on the former meaſures—ſo great an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made among mankind by ſcience and letters. The ſects cannot deſtroy one another: all attempts this way will be fruitleſs—they may affect a tempory diſturbance, but cannot produce a diſſolution—each one ſubſerves the mutual ſecurity of all. The advantages taken by any one ſect over the ſecurity and indolence, or inteſtine broils of another, will ſoon e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o' awaken its ſenſibility or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and excite the ſpirit of ſelf-defence—and ſo for the whole. Such is human nature, eſpecially enlightened with the pure light of revelation and ſciences. Nothing however will content us but actual experiment—this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment will be made in one century, and then perhaps we ſhall be ſatisfied. But to return from this digreſſion.</p>
            <p>In order to perceive what particular ſect is moſt friendly to the public liberty, we need only take a ſurvey of the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:009018_0097_10306F107A36A620"/>
religious eſtabliſhments in the ſeveral britiſh provinces on this continent. That civil eſtabliſhment is friendly to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which either veſts all ſects with equal immunities, or ſecures each ſect from being obliged directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to contribute to the public ſupport of others beſides themſelves. Where all ſects are equally eſtabliſhed there is properly no <hi>toleration,</hi> all partaking in the benefit of the eſtabliſhment. Where one ſect is inveſted with power to enforce taxes on themſelves for the ſupport of their clergy, and all others exempted from ſuch tax, there is a true and proper toleration, but perfectly eaſy as ſuch diſſenters are exempted from miniſterial taxes. Where the eſtabliſhed clergy are ſupported by a branch of provincial revenues appropriated, and diſſenters are not exempted from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing, and yet ſhare no part of ſuch appropriation, ſuch diſſenters are tolerated in the loweſt ſenſe, viz. on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their payment to the eſtabliſhed clergy. And it may ſo happen that the ſame ſects may be eſtabliſhed, or diſſenters in different provinces. So a ſcots presbyterian is a diſſenter in England, and an epiſcopalian a diſſenter in Scotland. Let us now take a view of the provincial eſtabliſhments. In <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> it is epiſcopacy, tho' the public believe it to be equal proteſtant liberty. In <hi>New-Hampſhire, Maſſachuſetts</hi> and <hi>Connecticut,</hi> made under the influence of congregationaliſts, it is <hi>congregationaliſm</hi>— but all other ſects are exempted from taxes for the ſupport of the congregational clergy. The miniſterial taxes of this ſect are enforceable at law—this is the principal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they enjoy above the diſſenters in thoſe provinces. In <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> it is univerſal equal proteſtant liberty, no ſect being enabled to enforce their miniſterial contracts at law. In <hi>New-York</hi> epiſcopacy is eſtabliſhed for the four firſt counties, where all diſſenters, miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are obliged to pay to the eſtabliſhed clergy, except ſo far as the Dutch churches in virtue of an original ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation gained an exemption and eſtabliſhment. For the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:009018_0098_10306F134D6A6708"/>
other counties of that province it is univerſal liberty. The religious eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Jerſies</hi> and <hi>Penſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> is univerſal liberty as in <hi>Rhode-Iſland.</hi> In <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Virginia</hi> it is <hi>epiſcopacy,</hi> with appropriations of large revenu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from tobacco for the eſtabliſhed clergy only. And tho' a very conſiderable part of thoſe two provinces, according to Dr. Douglaſs and others, are presbyterian and other diſſenters, who contribute proportionably to this ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical revenue, yet they are not allowed to ſhare the leaſt part of its appropriation. As to the three ſouthern provinces, their climate not ſuiting european conſtitutions, they will not figure as to numbers for perhaps yet a centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or more, untill the preſent race is hardned and get the better of a noxious region. Epiſcopacy however is in effect their eſtabliſhment, or perhaps will be in time: But with this only difference at preſent, that the epiſcopalians in South Carolina have gained of the legiſlature an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of certain duties on leather and ſkins. Excepting their proportion in this, the other proteſtant ſects are not yet obliged to contribute to the ſupport of the epiſcopal clergy in thoſe three provinces.</p>
            <p>From this view it appears, that in virtue of the religious eſtabliſhment in the three provinces of Penſylvania, the Jerſeys and <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> there are no diſſenters, but all enjoy the ſame common immunities; excepting that ſome few Dutch and perhaps other churches in the Jerſies are created bodies corporate by patents obtained from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors. But the happy policy of eſtabliſhing one ſect without infringing the eſſential rights of others is peculiar to the three New England provinces, where <hi>congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaliſm</hi> is the eſtabliſhment, <note n="*" place="bottom">CONGREGATIONALISTS are not DISSENTERS in New England.</note> with reſpect to two of which It is ſaid to be confirmed by the royal aſſent. Now tho' our churches and congregations are endowed with parochial immunities, yet all not of our denomination, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the epiſcopalian, are exempted from parochial taxes to
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:009018_0099_10302EA665296998"/>
the eſtabliſhed clergy—for what is collected of epiſcopali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in parochial aſſeſſments is paid to the epiſcopal incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent—a favor which our numerous brethren the diſſenters at home have never gained. Nor is any ſuch favor grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our brethren the presbyterians in Maryland and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, whoſe religious eſtabliſhment was made under epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal influence.—But where we have power we grant li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſo abundantly, that even in thoſe parts of New England where congregationaliſm is the legal eſtabliſhment, other ſects ſcarcely know that they are tolerated diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo happy and mild in our dominion. When by the eſtabliſhment all the members of a community are by law obliged to contribute to the ſupport of the clergy of one ſect, whether in parochial taxes or <hi>appropriated revenues,</hi> all the other ſects ſuffer in their eſſential liberties. When every ſect is free of one another, or proportionably ſhare the public revenues and offices, their eſſential liberties are intire. Congregationaliſm being endowed with parochial powers over its own members only, does not in the leaſt interfere with the eſſential liberties of the other ſects. And further it is to be obſerved, that the peculiar tenets of any religious proteſtant ſect is not made a religious teſt of holding civil or military offices in Penſylvania, the Jerſies and New England.</p>
            <p>Hence it appears, that congregationaliſm is friendly, I will not ſay more ſo, but as friendly as any other ſect to the public liberty civil and religious; and does not in the leaſt interfere with the liberty and eſſential rights of other ſect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

And beſides, our peculiar forms do not prevent our diſtinguiſhed loyalty to our ſovereign—for we may boldly ſay his majeſty has not a body of more loyal and well affected ſubjects in his dominions. All the New England ſects are loyal; but the principles of loyalty to the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſe of Hanover are inculcated on the people by the congregational clergy with peculiar ſincerity, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and conſtancy.</p>

               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:009018_0100_10302EA976944A40"/>Again, our churches are well calculated for the good of a chriſtian ſtate. There are two ends of churches in a ſtate, <hi>inſtruction in chriſtianity,</hi> and the <hi>public offices of religion.</hi> Both theſe, and eſpecially the former, are as well performed in New England as in any part of the proteſtant world. And perhaps the numerous body of our denomination may be juſtly diſtinguiſhed for the popular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the ſacred writings, &amp; knowledge both of the hiſtories and great doctrines of revelation. Our clergy are not expenſive, nor are our people burdened with tenths, nor have we intrigued the eccleſiaſtical appropriation of enormous impoveriſhing revenues. The landed eſtate in England is computed at 20 millions per annum: of which 14 millions per annum were dependent on the clergy at the reformation. In the time of <hi>Louis</hi> XIV. the eccleſiaſtical revenues of France were 26 millions ſterling, when at the ſame time the civil revenue did not exceed 13 millions. The leſs expenſive the clergy, if a people be well inſtructed and the publick offices of religion faithfully and decently performed, the better for a ſtate, becauſe the richer the people: and it is eaſier to raiſe a ſum for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic exigencies on an opulent people, than on an opulent hierarchy. Beſides, eccleſiaſtical opulence gives the clergy a weight, which is apt to affect the civil adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>It gives me peculiar pleaſure that notwithſtanding their many imperfections, our churches afford ſuch an agreeable review with reſpect to <hi>purity, liberty,</hi> and <hi>utility.</hi> For the firſt, we are nearly recovered to the purity of the primitive apoſtolic churches—for the ſecond, we oppreſs no other ſect—for the laſt, the popular knowledge of revelation, the decency and ſolemnity of our public offices of religion witneſs for us. And our imperfections admit amendment on our preſent polity. We have reaſon to bleſs God, that when the church was intirely corrupted in the papacy, he raiſed up and ſpirited the reformation. But to me it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that he has reſerved the honor of a moſt purified

reformation for our churches in New-England. It is truly important that this vine, which God hath planted with a mighty hand in this american wilderneſs, ſhould be cultivated into confirmed maturity. You are very ſenſible, that there is a formal attempt on the chaſtity and order of our churches, which is vigilantly to be guarded againſt, at preſent, till our churches grow into one cemented, large, pure, defenſible body. It is incumbent upon u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atch and guard their infancy with a paternal godlike fidelity. God has betruſted us with a part to act for poſterity and the public; let us not ſupinely deſert it, but act it well, conſecrate and tranſmit the purity of religion to generations yet unborn. It is evident nothing tends more to enervate and moulder down our cauſe, than differences and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities: nothing tends to ſtrengthen and font it to defenſible maturity like union and benevolence. If we have any public benevolence, any bowels of compaſſion, any tender affection for pure and undefiled religion—by the tender mercies of Jehovah! by the love of Jeſus!—let us bury and lay aſide our trifling differences, and harmoniouſly unite in carrying on and perfecting the one ſame great and noble work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond argument for union may be taken from the preſent ſtate of our churches. There is no body of chriſtians on earth in ſuch a rapid increaſe, and in ſo flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing a ſtate, as the congregationaliſts of New-England. The preſent ſtate of our denomination as to numbers, for the year 1760, is nearly this—in Maſſachuſetts are above 300 congregational churches—in Connecticut 170—in New-Hampſhire 43—which, with thoſe in this colony, form a body of about 530 churches, In 1650 there were about 36 churches already founded, ſeveral of which were ſmall beginnings, requiring many years to fill up. In 1696 were but 130 congregational churches in all New-England. And being A. D. 1760 increaſed to 530. the proportion of doubling is once in 30 years. A. D. 1613 there had

E. p. 31.</note>. Since that time more have gone from us to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, than have arrived from thence hither. The preſent inhabitants therefore of New-England, are juſtly to be eſtimated a natural increaſe by the bleſſing of heaven on the firſt 21,000 that arrived by the year 1643.</p>
            <p>In new ſetled countries the tranſplanted colonies, by an eſtabliſhed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

At the beginning of this increaſe the period of doubling is very ſhort, and the augmentation rapid—afterward the period of doubling is extended till it gradually ceaſes, and is ſucceeded with a diminution, ſlow at firſt, but rapid at laſt. The period of <hi>patrial maturity,</hi> as well as of <hi>patrial doubling</hi> doubtleſs in ſome meaſure correſponds to the nature of the climate:—the former in our climate may have been about 1000 or 1200 years; the latter 20 or 25 years. The period of rapid patrial doubling in 25 years may reach its akme in one third of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the final Akme of increaſe. The ratio of patrial doubling continues equable for 3 or 400 years, when in conſequence of another law of nature, this ratio begins at once to be greatly extended. Poſterity alone can more accurately aſcertain theſe things. If we look into hiſtory we may perhaps be inclined to judge the period of patrial maturity about 800 or 1000 years, perhaps more than leſs. It is probable that the colonies tranſplanted from Shinar into Egypt—and from Egypt afterwards into Greece, came to the maturity of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> liteſt ages about this period. The ſame obſervation may hold of the Tyrian colonies at Carthage. Rather more certainly we know that the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives from Troy peopled Italy at this period. The few trojan exiles, who were tranſported in ſeven ſmall ſhips, arrived into Italy, according to Livy about 430 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the foundation of Rome. And it is probable the Romans had their akme of natural increaſe before U. C. 650, that is within about 1100 years after their firſt plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in Italy. But moſt certainly of all, we know that the 70 ſouls, which ſprang from JACOB's loins, when tranſplanted into Egypt grew and multiplied in about 215 years to 603,550 ſenſible men of 20 years and upwards, excluſive of the levites: which, conſidering the young men under 20 years, may imply above 3 million ſouls, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe on 70 ſouls only in 215 years. It is true, this public cenſus was made above a year after the exodus, but we are given to underſtand that there was no increaſe in the wilderneſs. This is an unparralleled increaſe! the period of doubling being about 14 years.</p>
            <p>Joſeph was 17 years old when he was ſold into Egypt. He was 30 at his advancement: 8 years after this Jacob came into Egypt with his family; after which Joſeph lived 72 years and died at the age of 110. Iſrael came out of Egypt 143 years after Joſeph's death and 215 after Jacob's coming into Egypt. Moſes was born 63 or 64 years after Joſeph's death, ſpent 40 years at Pharaoh's court and 40 years in exile in Midian; and at his return muſt have found Iſrael increaſed in 40 years from about 400,000 to about 3 millions. Upon the view of the hoſts of Iſrael after his return from exile <q>thy fathers went down into Egypt with three ſcore and ten perſons; and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the ſtars of heaven for multitude.</q> All the ſouls that came out of Jacob's loins, excluſive of his ſon's wives, were 70 at his arrival and ſettlement in Egypt. If the period of doubling continued equable during the whole term of 215 years, the numbers of increaſe may be thus exhibited,

Infinite wiſdom however ſaw fit to take occaſion from the ſins of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, to put a ſtop to it, perhaps at the time they had arrived at the akme of rapid doubling: ſo that but about the number of the Exodus entered on the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the promiſed land—three million of people pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in the wilderneſs.

            <p>Iſrael not increaſing in the wilderneſs for 40 years, about the ſame number entered Canaan that went out of Egypt. About 430 years after the entrance into Canaan, Joab by order of David numbered the people. And tho' the amount of the cenſus which he returned and reported to David was but 1,300,000 fenſible men, 800,000 for Iſrael and 500,000 for Judah: yet the true amount was for the former 1,100,000. for the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Accurate ſearches ſhew that former general eſtimates have been greatly too large</note> implies 7,850,000 ſouls excluſive of Benjamin and Levi. Tho' the memorable barbarity of the Benjamites coſt them the loſs of 25,100 men, and almoſt the extinction of the tribe; yet we find that in about 60 years after David they had recovered and increaſed to 280,000 fighting men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying 1,400,000 ſouls for that tribe; which if not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by Joab may augment the above numbers to 9,250,000 ſouls. The males of the tribe of Levi were 22,000 at the exodus, and ſo the whole tribe about 40,000 (the males of 30 aet. were 38,000 in David's time)—which if augmented with the common national increaſe, and added to the preceding numbers, may give 9 millions and an half for the total of ſouls of the Hebrews about the times of David and Solomon. And perhaps they never exeeded this. Though their numbers might continue much the ſame till beyond Jehoſaphat's times, and eſpecially during Solomon's reign when the nation was at its ſummit of glory, both for numbers, riches, policy and union: yet it is probable they had reached the akme or height of patrial increaſe even before David. Hence we ſee that they doubled not twice after the exodus; and that the period of doubling was extended from 14 to 2 or 300 years. The ſeven nations of Palaeſtine were ſaid to be "greater and mightier" than Iſrael on their arrival thither. They
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:009018_0107_10302EB759F5C468"/>
were ſo numerous and powerful as to ſubjugate Iſrael 40 years, ſo long after their entrance into Canaan as the times of Sampſon. But tho' the Philiſtines might be 3 million at firſt, yet by exile and conqueſt they were ſo diminiſhed, that when <q>Solomon numbered all the ſtrangers that were in the land of Iſrael—they were found 153,600 only:</q> which however implies three quarters of a million of ſouls even in his time. Yet theſe with the children of Iſrael to the total amount of 10 million of ſouls were ſubſiſted in affluence upon a territory, according to Dr. <hi>Pococke,</hi> not larger than the three governments of <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, Connecticut</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Iſland.</hi>

            <p>In more things than one, that of exile, our New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land churches may reſemble God's antient choſen people. I apprehend God has great things in deſign for this vine which his irreſiſtable arm has planted: and that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to make of us a great people and a pure and glorious church. To be ſure he has already wonderfully bleſſed the emigration of our fore-fathers into this wilderneſs, and cauſed it to multiply abundantly. The Spaniſh and French emigrations into America, for a well known rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, do not much increaſe upon the firſt ſettlers, perhaps diminiſh:—the eſtimated total of the Spaniards in South America, according to <hi>Don Ullaö,</hi> not exceeding ſome of the britiſh provinces. The Dutch in <hi>Batavia</hi> have, it is ſaid, from ſmall beginnings increaſed to two millions:— unhappy for them and their happily reformed churches, if heaven ſhould take occaſion from their late public per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy to blaſt their poſterity, and ſet them forth a public example in conjunction with antient Iſrael for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.

yet remain, by which time thro' the bleſſing of heaven we may become many Millions. After this we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to increaſe in extended periods of doubling for 7 or 800 years, till we ſhall have reached the Summit of the patrial increaſe in 11 or 1200 years from the firſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of America: which, as it may have then advanced us into the millennial times, preceding examples of the riſe and decline of empire may not be further applicable. And here I cannot but remark that the maxim holds good of communities as of individuals "quo ſemel eſt imbuta recens ſervabit odorem—teſta diu"—that they receive their turn, their genius, their manners, their political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, very much from their infant education, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and maxims infuſed in the infancy of the ſtate: which ought therefore to be carefully attended to. This is eſpecially true of public bodies of Mankind that grow up faſt and in ſuch quick ſucceſſions, as not eaſily to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ingrafting of capitally new cuſtoms.

            <p>In order to form an idea of the future growth of New England, it will be neceſſary to take a retroſpect on the paſt. For the firſt 15 years from A D 1628 to 1643— "the number of ſhips that tranſported paſſengers in this ſpace of time is computed at 298—"Men, women and children paſſing over this wide ocean as near as at preſent can be gathered, is alſo ſuppoſed to be 21,200 or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts."<note n="*" place="bottom">Wonder-working Providence of Sion's Savior in N.

Indeed at the reſtoration, on the ejection of 2000 miniſters at the memorable black Bartholomew A. D. 1662, ſome few families with 14 miniſters repaired hither; not enough
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:009018_0110_10306FB135455828"/>
however to balance the returns from hence. It was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in the year 1670 that of 94 miniſters which came over, 31 were then living, 36 had died in the country, and 27 returned to europe. And in this term went back many others, beſides miniſters. The principal foreign augmentation ſince was by a body of proteſtants from the north of Ireland about A D 1730 and onwards. This might be an acceſſion of ſo few Families. <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. FRANKLIN ſays, "in fact there has not gone from Britain to our colonies theſe 20 years paſt to ſettle there, ſo many as 10 families a year."</note> It is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered that part of the firſt planters ſettled on Long Iſland, and that conſiderable numbers ſince 1731 have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of New England to the confines of New York: a number of families alſo removed into New Jerſey about A D 1695. So that on the whole the amount of the public cenſus A D 1755, taken by order from the lords commiſſioners for trade and plantations, may be eſtimated not to excede the natural increaſe of the original planters in the reign of Charles the firſt.</p>
            <p>Dr. Cotton Mather ſays, that A D 1696, in all New England were 100,000 Souls. It is ſaid there were A D 1691 about 16,000 militia which may imply 100,000; according to the implication of a like account by governor <hi>Shute,</hi> who A D 1722 reported to the board of trade, that in the province of the Maſſachuſetts were 94,000 people, whereof 15,000 were in the training liſt. The alarum liſt, containing the fencible men, may be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated at a third more. A. D. 1708, Mr, Thomas Brat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eſtimated for all New-England 100 or 120,000 ſouls, and 20 or 25,000 fighting men. In 1735 the provincial valuation for Maſſachuſetts was 35,427 polls, whites of 16 aet. and upwards. In 1742 the valuation of whites was 41,000 polls. The ſame year the rateable polls of the province of New-Hampſhire were 6000. In the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of 1755, the colony of Connecticut amounted to 133,000

ſouls, whites. In the cenſus of 1730, the cenſus of the colony of Rhode-Iſland and Providence plantations amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to 15,302 whites. The cenſus within the ſame limits in 1755 amounted to 31,029; and for the whole colony, incluſive of the annexed towns, 35,939 ſouls whites, the militia being about a ſeventh part. Not having the cenſus of 1755 for Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, I can only eſtimate them. I have been told that Maſſachuſetts then amounted to between 234 and 240,000. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial numbers A. D. 1755 may have been nearly thus;

The omiſſion in the cenſus of 1755 of thoſe at ſea and others, and the increaſe on thoſe omiſſions will more than balance the extraordinary loſs of the war the laſt five years.<note n="*" place="bottom">At the end of the campaign 1760, it was computed that about 21,000 had periſhed in the war on this continent, from General <hi>Braddock</hi>'s defeat in 1755 to 1760 incluſive. Of which perhaps 7000 were New England provincials.</note> We ſhall not be miſtaken then if we aſſume the number of inhabitants at half a million in the year 1760. We now commence an increaſe of 14,000 a year, which in 25 years will be augmented to 28,000 a year: and if providence continues our increaſe for 50 years, we ſhall have arrived to an annual increaſe of about 56,000.</p>
            <p>It will be more difficult to eſtimate the proportion of the ſects. Let it ſuffice that I eſtimate all but the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationaliſts to their full amount. There may be about 70 ſouls of Jews in all New-England, and as many <hi>Moravians.</hi>

From the moſt accurate account that I can collect the <hi>epiſcopalians</hi> do not exceed 2100 families, or 12,600 ſouls, in all New-England. There are 27 miſſions, incluſive of two itinerancies: the 27 miſſionaries, with three other miniſters, officiate in 47 churches and places of divine ſervice. Six or ſeven of theſe congregations are large; and 30 that are not equal to half of a common presbyterian congregation a-piece: and ſeveral that do not excede 15 and 20 families each. Not exceding in the whole 30 common presbyterian congregations, which I eſtimate at 80 and 100 families, and yet at a mean they contain 140 families each. Though we have ſome under 50 and 60, yet we have many above 200 to 250, and ſome above 300. From ſeveral eſtimates procured from the <hi>friends.</hi> I take their denomination to be about 16,000 ſouls in the four governments: though I am aſſured by a very ingenious and obſervant friend that this eſtimate is too large. From like eſtimates procured of the baptiſts I take their deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to be about 22,000 ſouls in the four govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Theſe eſtimates cannot be ſuppoſed perfectly accurate, but I believe they are nearly the truth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe are to be reckoned about 10 000 reducible to no claſs. The total amount of 60,000 ſubducted from half a million, the preſent total of inhabitants in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, leaves 440,000 ſouls for the denomination of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationaliſts.</hi>

            <p>The difficulty of breaking the anceſtorial religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the public enthuſiaſm be excited, appears not only from the ſmall impreſſion made on the ſects here, where the amount of changes may not perhaps excede 5000 among all the ſects: but alſo from the ſmall impreſſions made on the ſects in Germany and other parts of the proteſtant world with regard to their general forms—and particularly on the Iriſh catholics, when the reſult of the labors of a much longer period is ſaid not to have gained 200,000 proteſtants, excepting the north of Ireland Scots preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians.

            <p>At preſent the congregationaliſts have about 515 churches already gathered, which double in leſs than 30 years. <note n="*" place="bottom">According to Dr. Douglaſs the Number of our Churches A.

The aged miniſters now living, have in their day ſeen 130 churches increaſe to 530. In a century from this time we may have 5000 churches, even with allowances for emigrations to new provinces. But in order to this the love of liberty, and a zeal for pure and undefiled religion muſt be diffuſed and propagated with unremitted fidelity and vigilance. Should our inteſtine diſſentions unhinge the minds of the riſing generations, and diſengage or render them indifferent to the cauſe, it might be attended with unhappy conſequences. Union and diffuſive harmony are truly important, during this infancy of the churches, and this period of rapid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.

Let our children be often taught to read the ſixth, ſeventh, eighth, and ninth verſes of the twenty-ſixth chapter of Deuteronomy with parallel application to the hiſtory of our anceſtors.

                  <p>The plantation of Plymouth colony conſiſted of 300 ſouls A.

About 16 churches planted by the time of the firſt ſynod 1637, at which were preſent 25 miniſters. I have obſerved that there were arrived by A.

D 1644 the militia of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts conſiſted of 26 bands, or perhaps 2600 ſoldiers, which if but a ſeventh part, imply but about 16 000 ſouls: but probably the militia bore a greater proportion, if the males exceded the females. The reſtoration of the ballance of the ſexes might require that the firſt 15 or 20 years increaſe, ſhould conſiſt chiefly of female children. From ſeveral computations of this nature I have been inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the firſt 4000 planters did not imply above 15,000 ſouls to have arrived by A. D. 1643; which were cantoned into 34 churches by A. D 1645. increaſed to about 40 churches by A. D. 1650—when they contained 7750 communicants.

In 115 years we have increaſed 500 churches upon 34.—This is the LORD's doings, and it is marvellous in our eyes! Perhaps the multiplication of the primitive churches did not excede this in the firſt 130 years from the crucifixion And it is to be remembered, that of the firſt planters two churches are not reckoned, which were ſettled on <hi>Long-Iſland.</hi> The numbers of the planters might be accurately aſcertained by having recourſe to the records of the firſt 30 or 40 towns. I have obſerved, that as we are above 500 churches at preſent, ſo we may by the bleſſing of heaven become above 1000 in 30. and 2000 in 60 years The renowned church of Scotland conſiſts of 938 churches— thoſe of the Dutch and Walloon, A.

half a million of men, being near half the kingdom of Iſrael which fell in one day, the greateſt battle that hiſtory records. Even Judah forſook the <hi>law of the Lord;</hi> and within five years after the death of Solomon, the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he introduced in complaiſance to foreign wives, had overſpread the empire—ſo fatal is the ill example of princes. Judah alſo <hi>"built them high places and images, and graves, on every high hill and under every green tree:"</hi> on which Shiſhak, with the Egyptian and Ethiopian army, penetrated even to Jeruſalem, and carried off the treaſures of the temple and the king's houſe, the opulence amaſſed by Solomon. What proſperity attended God's people when they turned to the Lord and united in his ways? The whole treatment of divine providence towards that people from Moſes to this day, has been exactly according to the 28th chapter of Deuteronomy. And excepting in one thing, there may be an analogy between the divine treatment of this and all other ſtates, eſpecially his conduct towards that kingdom wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs. We may then reap great advantage in conſulting and duly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that hiſtory, which may be in ſome meaſure typical of our own. In a word, we have in the ſacred and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hiſtories of providence aſſiſtance to become aſſured in what point of view the PUBLICK VIRTUE and UNDEFILED RELIGION appear to the ſovereign mind. If we conform ourſelves to theſe notices and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernal aſſurances, we may depend with abſolute certainty on the ſmiles and defence of Jeſus our omnipotent patron.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved that our churches, in a diſtinguiſhed ſenſe from almoſt all the proteſtant world, are founded on the bible. Our worthy and venerable anceſtors (be their memories dear to poſterity) did not like other proteſtant patrons, form a ſyſtem of what they thought and judged to be the true ſenſe of revelation, and eſtabliſh this for the truth:—no—it was eno' for them that the bible was the inſpired rule, and this they made the only rule.

And as our churches were thus planted in very great purity, ſo we ſee they are in a very flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate conſidering their infancy. The computations with reſpect to their future growth depend, by the leave of providence, in ſome meaſure, on the ſuppoſition that we have room to extend our ſettlements. Agriculture and the rural life are peculiarly friendly to increaſe. Ten thouſand families (not of an old, but even of a new race, which makes a great difference) with means of affluent ſubſiſtence, dwelling together in a populous herd, kept from vices but employed in handycraft induſtry; will by no means equal the increaſe, which the ſame number of families would afford if turned forth and diſperſed in the wide world and employed in agriculture in a new climate: there is a difference from the employments, but the chief difference is from change of climate, diſſipation and the rural air. Farmers find it neceſſary to change their ſeed-corn, and ſhift their herds and ſtocks. Hillocks of corn planted near together yield not half the increaſe, as when planted at proper diſtances on the ſame ground. The preſent bounds of New England (the greater part of which is yet a wilderneſs) permit an increaſe of ſeven millions. If providence ſhould complete the reduction of Canada and an honorable peace annex it to the britiſh crown, we may extend our ſettlements into new provinces, or to the weſtern part of thoſe provinces which by the charters croſs the continent to the pacific ocean.

Well might our fathers die with pleaſure, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice their lives with joy to lay the foundation of ſuch a name, of ſuch a peculiar people whoſe numbers ſo ſoon increaſe like the ſand of the ſea, or the ſtars of heaven, and what is more, whoſe GOD is the LORD.</p>
            <p>Thus I have conſidered the ſecond argument for union taken from the ſtate and circumſtances of the churches. I might have enlarged upon the unhappy conſequences of contentions and diſunion, by ſhewing more particularly how they muſt, or might terminate in the utter ſubverſion of the congregational intereſt; which might ſhew in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrong light the wiſdom of coalition and harmony. To ſum up this argument—if we love the cauſe; if it gives us pleaſure to be embarked in a cauſe which has Jeſus Chriſt for its head and omnipotent patron, and which under him we can foreſee is riſing into diſtinction; ought we not with ſincere affection to unite and harmonize, ſince this union is the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> of its riſing into reſpectable figure?</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly. I juſt add a laſt reaſon for union, which more immediately affects every one in his individual capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,

that it will afford a field for the exerciſe of angelic benevolence and complacency. We can look upon the cauſe, upon the ſtate of the churches, with a complacency, which cannot be felt in ſurveying inteſtine confuſion. How good &amp; pleaſant a thing is it for brethren to dwell together in unity. Living in peace and harmony tends irreſiſtably to humanize and ſoften the mind to the moſt generous and god-like feelings—delights unknown to ſectarian contention or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine variance. It is a very happy circumſtance to be ſituated among a friendly ſocial people, we are inſenſibly caught of the benevolence which union and peace diffuſes. The public love and harmony will enable us with ſerenity and more ſacred ſatisfaction to celebrate the offices of piety and devotion. Our religious addreſſes and joyful homage undiſturbed, unpolluted with the reluctant feelings of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, ſhall aſcend as incenſe holy and acceptable to the Moſt High. And in common life, inſtead of broken friendſhips, and family alienations, we ſhould become united brethren in the higheſt ſenſe, harmoniouſly travelling along together, and ſweetning the trials of life with the animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complacency of ſocial virtue. Religious conteſts are apt to ſour the temper, which is greatly unhappy in a ſtate preparatory to the communion of angels and glorious beings above. The complacency and love for virtuous minds, like all other moral affections are formed, at leaſt ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by previous diſcipline. If we have lived in ſerenity and aſſociated with the good here, we ſhall have acquired the principle of ſpiritual delight in good beings, which qualifies the ſoul to be gathered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It is greatly deſirable towards our own feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, to ſee the churches in peace, to dwell together in love</p>

proſpect, and feaſt them with beautiful cluſters of churches on this flouriſhing vine which God almighty hath planted. Let us accuſtom ourſelves to take an annual view, and carefully attend to the public exigencies of the churches in the progreſs of increaſe or decline. Let us often tell theſe things to our children, that with their own eyes they may ſee and admire the wonder-working provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od. That when they are convinced from an inſpection of the ways of God, that the cauſe they are embarked in flouriſhes and is ſecure, and appears evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emerging ſuperior to all oppoſition, they may give glory to God and take courage, never deſert the cauſe, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here firm and unmoved. I am in no doubt, as I have before ſaid, but that the conſtitution and general form of our churches is very nearly apoſtolical. And tho' there are imperfections remaining—yet they are much more eaſily amended than in any other proteſtant church, as amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would not be encountered with the like oppoſition of authorities and unwieldy temporalities. If we oppreſs any, it is ourſelves only; our churches, and the ſecular power too much at their command, formerly adopted thoſe oppreſſive meaſures, which are always recollect with regret, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation <note n="*" place="bottom">Such were the meaſures of 1637, 1656, 1692.</note>. But even the lower ſecular oppreſſions of other ſects have long ſince been at an end. And as by our principles we are not led to perſecute others, ſo let us entertain a manly charity for our proteſtant brethren of all denominations, rejoicing that they are to a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree reformed: and as we believe they reſpectively judge themſelves, each more than others reformed to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rule; ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> extenſive charity and comprehenſive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, is no ways inconſiſtent with our given the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>congregationaliſm.</hi> We rejoice that men may become good and holy in all communions:—it will be admitted that in different communions there may be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent advantages for virtue and piety; and though we
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:009018_0125_10306FDF7B6CE7E8"/>
think that our churches have the preference in this, as well as in being reſembled to primitive ſcripture model as to the ordinances and forms of worſhip—yet we doubt not the pious dying from every communion will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to glory. We are not ſo bigotted as to think that the tender mercies of the Lord are limited to us, and that none can be ſaved out of our churches. We rejoice to ſee men of virtue and true goodneſs; and it gives us plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to view thoſe perſons as ornaments of the communions to which they belong, though different from ours. Inſtead of wiſhing the extirpation of any ſect, we wiſh them all well and to abound in the knowledge and practice of chriſtianity, and to ſubſiſt on truth and honor. We ſtand firm and faſt to the conſtitution of liberty in our churches —and as we do not oppreſs others, ſo we hope not to be oppreſſed by others. On the footing of equality and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal liberty we are friends to all, but ſubmit not to be ſubordinate to any. Having ſecured and fortified our own cauſe, we may ſit down full of a joyful ſelf-complacency, and look around on our chriſtian brethren of the other ſects, not with a view of ſowing the ſeeds of diſcord, not to avail ourſelves of their differences, leaſt of all to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute and oppreſs them; but to exerciſe good-will and ſincere chriſtian love to them, to let off the emanations of benevolence towards all that fear God and work righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>We ſee my brethren, the arguments are ſtrong for the congregational union in every point of view. There are ſome peculiar reaſons why the congregational brethren and churches in this colony ſhould be united. Our cauſe is one, and a cauſe not in decline, not in diſrepute, but in honor and a moſt flouriſhing proſperity. Let us be cemented together by forbearance, fellowſhip, union. Let us, my reverend FATHERS in the miniſtry give faithful attention to the paſtoral labors, and feed the flock of God, the churches over which the holy Ghoſt hath <hi>made us over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers.</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="unknown:009018_0126_10306FE14C1E95B8"/>
Let us teach for doctrines not the inſtitutes of men, but the pure word of God, that our congregations may grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. It will be our wiſdom to be united ourſelves, and to that end to avoid every thing by which we may unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily offend one another. Paſtoral alienations are too often accompanied with alienations among the churches. Our paſtoral <hi>conventions</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Firſt formed in this Colony Auguſt 25, 1756.</note> tend to harmony, and ſhew that we are agreed in the principal matters, and willing to walk together. Let the ſpirit of harmony extend to our church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and congregations, among whom let us be careful to cultivate the principles of harmony and goodwill to all: that our denomination may be diſtinguiſhed by an <hi>unbigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, generous</hi> and <hi>diffuſive charity to others.</hi> Let us ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate them with annual accounts of the ſtate of the churches, and with this view let us keep our eyes on the public ſtate. We ſhall thus act the part aſſigned us by providence under the general dominion of the mediator. We ſhould account ourſelves happy in being charged with the miniſtry of reconciliation under the prince of peace. Let us make full proof of our miniſtry:—be the glory of God in the reconciliation of men the great object of our attention. Let our perſonal ſanctity and public utility be animated by conſidering that the more we have been inured in cultivating piety and love among men, the better ſhall we be prepared to join the extenſive plans of order and happineſs on high. And having in this manner been long employed in doing good, and become uſeful in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting peace and virtue on earth; we may not only reflect on our paſt lives with ſerenity and triumph, but adopt with aſſurant hope and confidence thoſe divine promiſes made from the great Lord of the univerſe the head of the church, in which our future reward is repreſented under the idea of receiving a kingdom, being appointed to a heavenly miniſtration, being inveſted with a larger ſphere

of action and power, and honored with more talents, more opportunities of doing good; in a word, of being aſſigned to affairs of more extended benevolence. Be our fidelity then inſpired by the realizing anticipation of the future honors, when <q>they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the firmament, and they that TURN MANY TO RIGHTEOUSNESS, as the ſtars forever and ever.</q>

               <p>In the year 1760 died 10 of the paſtors; 18 ordained, including one inſtalment; and 6 new churches gathered, whoſe pariſhes are included in this liſt. At the end of the year, I think there are 15 of theſe parochial congregations whoſe churches are not formed, viz. 10 for Maſſachuſetts, and 5 for Connecticut. So that while the total of parochial congregations is 530, the total of churches is 515 for the end of the year 1760. If the total of churches in 1749 was but 407, as Dr. Douglaſs aſſerts, we have multiplied 108 churches in 12 years.</p>
