            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE general deſign of theſe pages is to offer ſome curſory remarks on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of religion among a great part of the polite and the faſhionable; not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong that deſcription of perſons who, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from diſbelief, or whatever other cauſe, avowedly neglect the duties of Chriſtianity; but among that more decent claſs alſo, who, while they acknowledge their belief of its truth by a public profeſſion, and are not inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to any of its forms, yet exhibit little of its ſpirit in their general temper and conduct:
<pb facs="unknown:029103_0004_0FDF9B049B570DD0"/>
to ſhew that Chriſtianity, like its divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, is not only <hi>denied</hi> by thoſe who in words diſown their ſubmiſſion to its authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but <hi>betrayed</hi> by ſtill more treacherous diſciples, even while they ſay, <hi>Hail, Maſter</hi>!</p>
               <p>For this viſible declenſion of piety, various reaſons have been aſſigned, ſome of which however do not ſeem fully adequate to the effects aſcribed to them. The author of a late popular pamphlet <note n="*" place="bottom">Hints to an aſſociation, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note> has accounted for the increaſed profligacy of the <hi>common people,</hi> by aſcribing it, very juſtly, to the increaſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs of their ſuperiors; and who will deny what he affirms—that the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of high and low receives a deep tincture of depravity from the growing neglect of public worſhip? I muſt however take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to diſſent from his opinion as to the cauſe of that neglect; and to ſuſpect that the too common deſertion of perſons of rank from the ſervice of the Eſtabliſhment is not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, in general, by their diſapprobation of the Liturgy; but that the far greater part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> them are deterred from going to church by motives far removed from ſpeculative ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and conſcientious ſcruples.</p>
               <p>Far be it from me to enter the unpleaſant and boundleſs fields of controverſy; an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize for which it would be hard to ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have leſs ability or inclination. Far be it from me to ſtand forth the fierce champion of a Liturgy, or the prejudiced advocate of

forms and ſyſtems. A ſincere member of the Eſtabliſhment myſelf, I reſpect its inſtitutions without idolatry, and acknowledge its imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections without palliation.</p>
               <p>But the difference of opinion here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Beſides, there is one teſt which is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unequivocal—it is never read at all in the <hi>afternoon,</hi> any more than the Litany (another great ſource of offence); and yet, with all theſe multiplied reaſons for their attendance, that is a ſeaſon when the pews of the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able world are not <hi>remarkable</hi> for being crowded.</p>

On the contrary, is it not pretty evident that the general quarrel (with ſome few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions) of thoſe who habitually abſent themſelves from public worſhip, is not with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be alſo abridged. Cut, and pare, and prone the ſervice of the Church ever ſo much, ſtill Chriſtianity itſelf will be found full of formidable objections. With ſuch objectors, it would avail but little that the Church ſhould give up her abſtruſe creeds, unleſs the Bible would expunge thoſe rigorous laws, which not only prohibit ſinful actions, but corrupt inclinations. And, to ſpeak honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I do not ſee how ſuch perſons as habitually infringe the laws of virtue and ſobriety, and who yet are men of acute ſagacity, accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on other ſubjects to a conſiſtent train of reaſoning; who ſee conſequences in their cauſes; who behold practical ſelf-denial ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily involved in the ſincere habit of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious obſervances—I do not ſee how, to ſuch men, any doctrines reformed, any redundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies lopped, any obſcurities brightened, could effect this author's very benevolent and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian wiſh.</p>
               <p>For religious duties are often neglected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more conſiſtent grounds than the friends of religion are willing to allow. They are often diſcontinued, not as repugnant to the underſtanding, not as repulſive to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029103_0007_0FDF9B3A364A1628"/>
but as hoſtile to a licentious life. And when a prudent man, after entering into a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn convention, finds that he is living in a conſtant breach of every article of the treaty he has engaged to obſerve; one cannot much wonder at his getting out of the hearing of the heavy artillery which he knows is planted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and againſt every one who lives in an allowed infraction of the covenant.</p>
               <p>A man of ſenſe, who ſhould acknowledge the truth of the doctrine, would find himſelf obliged to ſubmit to the force of the precept. Is it not eaſy to be a comfortable ſinner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trying, at leaſt, to be a confirmed unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. The ſmalleſt remains of faith would embitter a life of libertiniſm; and to him who retains any impreſſion of Chriſtianity, the wildeſt feſtivals of intemperance will be converted into the terrifying feaſt of Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: the ſuſpended ſword may every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fall.</p>
               <p>That many a worthy nonconformiſt is kept out of the pale of the Eſtabliſhment by ſome of the cauſes noticed in the pamphlet in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot be doubted; and that many candid members of that Eſtabliſhment regret the cauſes which exclude the others, cannot be denied. But theſe are often ſober thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, ſerious enquirers, conſcientious reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; whoſe object is truth, and who ſpare no pains in ſearch of what they take to <hi>be</hi> truth. But that the ſame objections baniſh the great
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029103_0008_0FDF9B0D1E48F1E8"/>
and the gay, is not equally evident. Thanks to the indolence and diſſipation of the times, it is not dogmas or doctrines, it is not abſtract reaſoning or puzzling propoſitions, it is not perplexed argument or intricate metaphyſics, which can now diſincline from Chriſtianity; ſo far from it, they cannot even allure to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. Infidelity itſelf, with all that ſtrong and natural bias which paſſion and appetite have in its favour, if it appear in the grave and ſcholaſtic form of ſpeculation, argument, or philoſophical deduction, may lie almoſt as quietly on the ſhelf as its moſt able antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt; and the cobwebs are almoſt as ſeldom bruſhed from Hobbes as from Hooker. No: prudent ſcepticiſm has wiſely ſtudied the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the times, and ſkilfully felt the pulſe of this relaxed and indolent age. It prudently accommodated itſelf to the reigning charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when it adopted ſarcaſm inſtead of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, and preferred a ſneer to an argument. It diſcreetly judged, that, if it would now gain proſelytes, it muſt ſhew itſelf under the bewitching form of a profane bonmot; muſt be interwoven in the texture of ſome amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hiſtory, written with the levity of a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and the point and glitter of an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram: it muſt embelliſh the ample margin with ſome offenſive anecdote or impure allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and decorate impiety with every looſe and meretricious ornament of a corrupt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: it muſt break up the old flimſy ſyſtem into little miſchievous aphoriſms, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

               <p>If therefore, in this voluptuous age, when a frivolous and relaxing diſſipation has infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our very ſtudies, infidelity will not be at the pains of deep reſearch and elaborate inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation, even on ſuch ſubjects as are conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial to its affections, it is vain to expect that chriſtianity will be more engaging, either as an object of ſpeculation, or a rule of practice, when its evidences require attention to be comprehended, its doctrines humility to be

received, and its precepts ſelf-denial to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.</p>
               <p>Will it then be uncharitable to pronounce, that the leading evil, not which thins our churches (for that is not the evil I propoſe to conſider) but which pervades our whole character, and gives the colour to our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conduct, is <hi>practical irreligion</hi>? an irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion not ſo much oppoſed to a ſpeculative faith, as to that ſpirit, temper, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which chriſtianity inculcates.</p>
               <p>On this practical irreligion it is propoſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> a few hints. After attempting to ſhew, by a compariſon with the religion of the great in preceding ages, that there is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible decline of piety among the higher ranks —that even thoſe more liberal ſpirits who neglect not many of the great duties of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, yet hold the ſeverer obligations of piety in no eſteem—I ſhall proceed, though perhaps with two little method, to remark on the notorious <hi>effects</hi> of the decay of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principle, as it corrupts our mode of education, infects our domeſtic conduct, ſpreads the contagion downwards among ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and inferiors, and influences our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, habits, and converſation.</p>
               <p>But what it is here propoſed principally to inſiſt on is, that this defect of religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples is almoſt equally fatal, whether it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the open contempt of all ſacred inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, or under the more decent veil of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal obſervances, unſupported by ſuch a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029103_0011_0FDF9B3DA20DC600"/>
conduct as is analogous to the chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall proceed with a few remarks on a third claſs of faſhionable characters, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to acknowledge chriſtianity as a perfect ſyſtem of morals, while they deny its divine authority: and conclude with ſome ſlight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverſions on the opinion which theſe maintain, that morality is the whole of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, however, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and principles act reciprocally on each other; and are, by turns, cauſe and effect. For inſtance—the increaſed relaxation of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, produces the increaſed neglect of infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing religious principles in the education of youth: which effect becomes, in its turn, a cauſe; and in due time, when that cauſe comes to operate, helps on the decline of manners.</p>

Thoſe who make a fair compariſon muſt allow, that however the preſent age may be improved in other impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and valuable advantages, yet that there is but little appearance remaining among the great and the powerful of that "righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which exalteth a nation;"—that there has been a <hi>moral revolution</hi> in the national manners and principles, very little analagous to that great <hi>political</hi> one of which we hear ſo much; that our public virtue bears little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our public bleſſings, and that our religion had decreaſed in a pretty exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our having ſecured the means of enjoying it.</p>
               <p>That the antipodes to wrong are hardly ever right, was very ſtrikingly illuſtrated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the laſt century, when the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029103_0013_0FDF9B3FD55CA4A8"/>
fiery and indiſcreet zeal of one party was made a pretext for the profligate impiety of the other; who, to the bad principle which dictated a depraved conduct, added the bad taſte of being proud of it:—when even the leaſt abandoned were abſurdly apprehenſive that an appearance of decency might ſubject them to the charge of fanaticiſm, a charge in which they took care to involve real piety as well as enthuſiaſtic pretence; till it became the general faſhion to avoid no ſin but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, to dread no imputation but that of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs, and to be more afraid of a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation than of every vice which ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               <p>It was not till piety was thus unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought into diſrepute, that perſons of condition thought it made their ſincerity, their abilities or their good breeding queſtionable, to appear openly on the ſide of religion. A ſtrict attachment of piety did not ſubject from a great reputation.

This indeed is the boaſted period of free enquiry and liberty of thinking, and a noble ſubject of boaſting it is. But it is the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar character of the preſent age, that its miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs often aſſume the moſt alluring forms: and that the moſt alarming evils not only look ſo like goodneſs, as to be often miſtaken for it; but are ſometimes mixed up with ſo much real good, as often to diſguiſe, though never to counteract, their malignity. Under the beautiful maſk of an enlightened philoſophy, all religious reſtraints are ſet at nought; and ſome of the deadlieſt wounds have been aimed at chriſtianity, in works written in avowed vindication of the moſt amiable of all the chriſtian principles<note n="*" place="bottom">See particularly <hi>Voltaire ſur la Tolerance.</hi> This is a common artifice of that engaging but inſidious author. In this inſtance he has made uſe of the popularity he obtained in the fanatical tragedy at Thouloſe (the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Calas) to diſcredit, though in the moſt guarded manner, chriſtianity itſelf: degrading martyrdoms, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the truth of the Pagan perſecutions, &amp;c. &amp;c. And by mixing ſome truths with many falſehoods, by aſſuming by an amiable candour, and profeſſing to ſerve the intereſts of goodneſs, he treacherouſly contrives to leave on the mind of the unguarded reader, impreſſions the moſt unfavouroble to chriſtianity.</note>. Even the prevalence of a liberal and warm philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy, is ſecretly ſapping the foundation of chriſtian morals, becauſe many of its champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons allow themſelves to live in the open vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the ſeverer duties of juſtice and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,

while they are contending for the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tler ones of charity and beneficence.</p>
               <p>The ſtrong and generous bias in favour of univerſal toleration, noble as the principle itſelf is, has engendered a dangerous notion that all error is innocent. Whether it be owing to this, or to whatever other cauſe, it is certain that the diſcriminating features of the chriſtian religion are every day growing into leſs repute; and it is become the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, even among the better ſort, to evade, to lower, or to generalize, its moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing peculiarities<note n="*" place="bottom">There is ſo little of the author of chriſtianity left in his own religion, that an apprehenſive believer is ready to exclaim, with the woman at the sepulchre, "They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him." The locality of Hell, and the exiſtence of an evil Spirit, are annihilated, or conſidered as abſtract ideas. They are never named without ſome periphraſis or circumlocution; as if the very names, inſtead of being awful and terrible, were only vulgar and illiberal.</note>.</p>
               <p>Having wiſely and happily freed ourſelves from the trammels of human authority, are we not turning our liberty into licentiouſneſs, and wantonly ſtruggling to throw off the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> authority too? Freedom of thought is the glory of the human mind, while it is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within its juſt and ſober limits; but though we are accountable for <hi>opinions</hi> at no earthly tribunal, yet it ſhould be remembered, that thoughts as well as actions are amenable to the bar of God: and though we may rejoice that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029103_0017_0FDF9B4698A524A0"/>
the tyranny of the ſpiritual Procruſtes is ſo far annihilated, that it is no longer thought a proof of the orthodoxy of one man's opinions, that he lop or lengthen thoſe of another till they fit his own meaſure; yet there is ſtill a ſtandard by which not only actions are weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but opinions are judged, and every ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is clearly inconſiſtent with the revealed will of God, is as much throwing off <hi>his</hi> dominion, as the breach of any of his moral precepts.</p>
               <p>There is then ſurely one teſt by which it is no mark of intolerance to try the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of men, namely, the <hi>Law and the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony</hi>: and it is impoſſible not to lament, that while a more generous ſpirit governs our judgment, a purer principle does not ſeem to regulate our lives. May it not be ſaid, that while we are juſtly commended for thinking charitably of the opinion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of others, we ſeem, in return, as if we were deſirous of furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with an opportunity of exerciſing their candour, by the laxity of principle in which we indulge ourſelves? If the hearts of men are as firmly united to each other by the bond of charity, as ſome pretend, they could not fail of being united to God alſo, by one common principle of piety, the only certain ſource of all charitable judgment, as well as of all virtuous conduct.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of abiding by the ſalutary precept of <hi>judging no man,</hi> it is the faſhion to exceed our commiſſion, and to fancy every body to

be in a ſafe ſtate. But, in forming our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we have to chooſe between the Bible and the world, between the rule and the practice. Where theſe do not agree, it is left to the judgment, of believers at leaſt, by which we are to decide. But we never act, in religious concerns, by the ſame rule of common-ſenſe and equitable judgment which governs us on other occaſions. In weighing any commodity, its weight is determined by ſome generally-allowed ſtandard; and if the commodity be heavier or lighter than the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard weight, we add to or take from it: but we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <head>CHAP. II. Benevolence allowed to be the reigning virtue, but not <hi>excluſively</hi> the virtue of the preſent age. Benevolence not the whole of religion, though one of its moſt characteriſtic features. Whether benevolence proceed from a religious principle, will be more infallibly known by the general diſpoſition of time, fortune, and the common habits of life, than from a few occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional acts of bounty.</head>
               <p>TO all the remonſtrances and invectives of the preceding chapter, there will not fail to be oppoſed that which we hear every day ſo loudly inſiſted on—the decided ſuperiority of the preſent age, in other and better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. It will be ſaid, that even thoſe who neglect the outward forms of religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit however the beſt proofs of the beſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; that the unparalleled inſtances of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, of which we are continual witneſſes; that the many ſtriking acts of public boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the various new and noble improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this ſhining virtue, juſtly entitle the preſent age to be called, by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, <hi>the age of benevolence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is with the livelieſt joy I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the delightful truth. Liberality flows with a full tide through a thouſand chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029103_0020_0FDF9B1BDE482E98"/>
There is ſcarcely a newſpaper but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords ſome meeting of men of fortune for the moſt ſalutary purpoſes. The noble and numberleſs ſtructures for the relief of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, which are the ornament and the glory of our metropolis, proclaim a ſpecies of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence unknown to former ages. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, not only to hoſpitals, but to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious other valuable inſtitutions, are obtained almoſt as ſoon as ſolicited. And who but muſt with that theſe beautiful monuments of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence may become every day more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and more extended?</p>
               <p>Yet with all theſe allowed and obvious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, it is not quite clear whether ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too much has not been ſaid of the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the preſent age, in a comparative view with that of thoſe ages which preceded it. A general alteration of habits and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners has at the ſame time multiplied public bounties and private diſtreſs; and it is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a paradox to ſay, that there was probably leſs miſery when there was leſs munificence.</p>
               <p>If an increaſed benevolence now ranges through, and relieves a wider compaſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; yet ſtill if thoſe examples of luxury and diſſipation which promote that diſtreſs, are ſtill <hi>more</hi> increaſed, this makes the good done bear little proportion to the evil promoted. If the miſeries removed by the growth of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fall, both in number and weight, far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe which are cauſed by the growth of vice and diſorder; if we find, that though
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029103_0021_0FDF9B4A03C96FC8"/>
bounty is extended, yet, that thoſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which make bounty ſo neceſſary, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, alſo, almoſt beyond calculation; if it appear that though more objects are reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our money, yet incomparably more are debauched by our licentiouſneſs—the balance perhaps will not turn out ſo decidedly in favour of the times as we are willing to imagine.</p>
               <p>If then the moſt valuable ſpecies of charity is that which prevents diſtreſs by preventing or leſſening vice, the greateſt and moſt inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cauſe of want; we ought not ſo highly to exalt the bounty of the great in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, in preference to that broad ſhade of protection, patronage, and maintenance, which the wide-ſpread bounty of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers ſtretched out over whole villages, I had almoſt ſaid whole provinces. When a few noblemen in a county, like a few of their own ſtately oaks (paternal oaks! which are not often ſet upon a card), extended their ſheltering branches to ſhield all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood of the foreſt—when there exiſted a kind of paſſive charity, a negative ſort of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, which did good of itſelf; and without effort, exertion, or expence, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the beſt functions of bounty, though it did not aſpire to the dignity of its name— it was ſimply this:—great people ſtaid at home; and the ſober pomp, and orderly magnificence of a noble family, reſiding at their own caſtle great part of the year, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029103_0022_0FDF9B1E113E17D0"/>
in the moſt natural way to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the poor; and in a good degree prevented that diſtreſs, which it muſt how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be thankfully confeſſed it is the laudable object of modern bounty to relieve. A man of fortune might not then, it is true, ſo often dine in public, for the benefit of the poor; but the poor were more regularly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably fed with the abundant crumbs which then fell from the rich man's table. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it cannot be denied that the prevailing mode of living has pared real hoſpitality to the very quick: and, though the remark may be thought ridiculous, it is a material diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the poor, that the introduction of the modern ſtyle of luxury has rendered the remains of the moſt coſtly table but of ſmall value.</p>
               <p>But even allowing the boaſted ſuperiority of modern benevolence, ſtill it will not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the object of the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to enquire whether the diffuſion of this branch of charity, though the moſt lovely off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of religion, be yet any poſitive proof of the prevalence of religious principles: and whether it is not the faſhion rather to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der benevolence as a ſubſtitute for chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than as an evidence of it.</p>
               <p>For it ſeems to be one of the reigning er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors among the better ſort, to reduce all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into benevolence, and all benevolence into alms-giving. The wide and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive idea of chriſtian charity is compreſſed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029103_0023_0FDF9B514E8C51C8"/>
into the ſlender compaſs of a little pecuniary relief. This ſpecies of benevolence is indeed a bright gem among the ornaments of a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; but by no means furniſhes all the jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of his crown, which derives its luſtre from the aſſociated radiance of every chriſtian grace. Beſides, the genuine virtues are all of the ſame family; and it is only by being ſeen in company with each other, and with Piety their common parent, that they are certainly known to be legitimate, for there are ſuch things as even ſpurious virtues.</p>
               <p>But is this the property of the <hi>chriſtian</hi> virtues, that, like all other amiable members of the ſame family, while each is doing its own particular duty, it is contributing to the proſperity of the reſt; and the larger the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily the better they live together, as no one can advance itſelf without labouring for the advancement of the whole: thus, no man can be benevolent on chriſtian principles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſelf-denial; and ſo of the other virtues: each is connected with ſome other, and all with religion.</p>
               <p>I already anticipate the obvious and hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed reply, that "whoever be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whatever be the motive of bounty, ſtill the poor are equally relieved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end is the ſame." And it muſt be confeſſed, that thoſe compaſſionate hearts, who cannot but be earneſtly anxious that the diſtreſſed ſhould be relieved at any rate, ſhould not too ſcrupulouſly enquire into any
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029103_0024_0FDF9B222FF33138"/>
cauſe of which the effect is ſo beneficial. Nor indeed will candour ſcrutinize too curiouſly into the errors of any life, of which benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence will always be allowed to be a ſhining ornament, while it does not pretend to be an atoning virtue.</p>
               <p>Let me not be miſrepreſented, as if I were ſeeking to detract from the value of this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able feeling; one does not ſurely lower the practice by ſeeking to ennoble the principle; the action will not be impaired by mending the motive: and no one will be likely to give the poor leſs, becauſe he ſeeks to pleaſe God more.</p>
               <p>One cannot then help wiſhing that pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary bounty were not only practiſed, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enjoined too, as a redeeming virtue. In many converſations, I had almoſt ſaid in many charity ſermons, it is inſinuated as if a little alms-giving could pay off old ſcores contracted by favourite indulgences. This, though often done by well-meaning men to advance the intereſts of ſome preſent pious purpoſe, yet has the miſchievous effect of thoſe medicines which while they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a local complaint, are yet undermining the general habit.</p>
               <p>That great numbers who are not influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſo high a principle as chriſtianity holds out, are yet truly compaſſionate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hypocriſy, and without oſtentation, who can doubt? ſince there are by nature many tender hearts; for did not God make them?
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029103_0025_0FDF9B535A8D3208"/>
and is he not the Author of all that is good in nature, as well as in grace?</p>
               <p>But who that feels the beauty of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, can avoid being ſolicitous, not only that its offerings ſhould comfort the receiver, but return in bleſſings to the boſom of the giver, by ſpringing from ſuch motives, and being accompanied by ſuch a temper as ſhall redound to his eternal good? For that the benefit is the ſame to the object, whatever be the character of the benefactor, is but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable view of things to a real chriſtian, whoſe compaſſion reaches to the ſouls of men. Such an one longs to ſee the charitable giver as happy as he is endeavouring to make the object of his bounty; but ſuch an one knows that no happineſs can be fully and finally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed but on the ſolid baſis of chriſtian piety.</p>
               <p>For as religion is not, on the one hand, merely an opinion or a ſentiment; ſo neither is it, on the other, merely an act or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, but it is a diſpoſition, a habit, a temper: it is not a name, but a nature: it is a turning the whole mind to God; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centration of all the powers and affections of the ſoul into one ſteady point, an uniform de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to pleaſe <hi>Him.</hi> This deſire will naturally and neceſſarily manifeſt itſelf, in our doing all the good we can to our fellow-creatures in every poſſible way; for it will be found that neither of the two parts into which practical religion is divided, can be performed with any degree of perfection but by thoſe who
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:029103_0026_0FDF9B250655CBB0"/>
unite both: as it may be queſtioned if any man really <hi>does</hi> "love his neighbour as himſelf," who does not firſt endeavour to "love God with all his heart." As genius has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to be ſtrong general powers of mind ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally determined to ſome particular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; ſo piety may be denominated a ſtrong general diſpoſition of the heart to every thing that is right, breaking forth into every excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent action, as the occaſion preſents itſelf. The temper muſt be ready in the mind, and the whole heart muſt be prepared and train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every act of virtue to which it may be called out. For religious principles are like the military exerciſe; they keep up an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſtate of preparation for actual ſervice; and by never relaxing the diſcipline, the real chriſtian is ready for every duty to which he may be commanded. Right actions beſt prove the exiſtence of religion in the heart; but they are evidences, not cauſes.</p>
               <p>Whether therefore a man's charitable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions proceed from religious principle, he will be beſt able to aſcertain by ſcrutinizing into what is the general diſpoſition of his time and fortune; and by attending to ſuch an habitual regulation of his pleaſures and expences as will enable him to be more or leſs uſeful to others.</p>
               <p>For it is in vain that he may poſſeſs, what is called by the courteſy of faſhion <hi>the beſt heart in the world</hi> (a character we every day hear applied to the libertine and the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal),
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029103_0027_0FDF9B550E1FD840"/>
if he ſquander his time and eſtate in ſuch a round of extravagant indulgences, and thoughtleſs diſſipation, as leaves him little money and leſs leiſure for nobler purpoſes. It makes but little difference whether a man is prevented from doing good by hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parſimony or an unprincipled extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance; the ſtream is equally cut off.</p>
               <p>The mere <hi>caſual</hi> benevolence of any man can have little claim to ſolid eſteem; nor does any charity deſerve the name which does not grow out of a ſteady conviction that it is his bounden duty, which does not ſpring from a ſettled propenſity to obey the whole will of God; which is not therefore made a part of the general plan of his conduct; and which does not lead him to order the whole ſcheme of his affairs with an eye to it.</p>
               <p>He therefore who does not habituate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to certain interior reſtraints, who does not live in a regular courſe of ſelf-renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will not be likely often to perform acts of beneficence, when it becomes neceſſary to convert to ſuch purpoſes any of that time or money which appetite, temptation or vanity ſolicit him to divert to other purpoſes.</p>
               <p>And ſurely he who ſeldom ſacrifices one darling indulgence, who does not ſubtract one gratification from the inceſſant round of his enjoyments, when the indulgence would obſtruct his capacity of doing good, or when the ſacrifice would enlarge his power, does not deſerve the name of benevolent. And
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029103_0028_0FDF9B26B5771E58"/>
for ſuch an unequivocal criterion of charity to whom are we to look, but to the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious chriſtian? No other ſpirit but that by which he is governed, can ſubdue ſelf-love: and where ſelf-love is the predominant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, benevolence can have but a feeble, or an accidental dominion.</p>
               <p>Now if we look around and remark the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of luxury, the coſtly diverſions, and the intemperate diſſipation in which numbers of profeſſing chriſtians indulge themſelves, can any ſtretch of candour, can even that tender ſentiment by which we are enjoined "to hope" and to "believe all things," enable us to hope and believe that ſuch are actuated by a ſpirit of chriſtian benevolence, merely becauſe we ſee them perform ſome caſual acts of charity, which the ſpirit of the world can contrive to make extremely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with a voluptuous life, and the coſt of which, after all, bears but little proportion to that of any one vice, or even vanity?</p>
               <p>Men will not believe that there is hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one human good quality which will know and keep its proper bounds, without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining influence of religious principle. There is, for inſtance, great danger leſt a conſtant attention to ſo right a practice as an invariable oeconomy ſhould incline the heart to the love of money. Nothing can effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally counteract this natural propenſity, but the chriſtian habit of devoting thoſe retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expences to ſome good purpoſe; and then
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029103_0029_0FDF9B5759A31088"/>
oeconomy, inſtead of narrowing the heart, will enlarge it, by inducing a conſtant aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of benevolence with frugality. An habitual attention to the wants of others, is the only wholeſome regulator of our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and carries with it a whole train of virtues, diſintereſtedneſs, ſobriety, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. And thoſe who live in the cuſtom of levying conſtant taxes on their vanities for ſuch purpoſes, ſerve the poor ſtill leſs than they ſerve themſelves, by cultivating ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits as make the beſt qualification for their final happineſs.</p>
               <p>Thus when a vein of chriſtianity runs through the whole maſs of a man's life, it gives a new value to all his actions, and a new character to all his views. It tranſmutes prudence and oeconomy into chriſtian vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and every offering that is preſented on the altar of charity, becomes truly conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when it is the gift of obedience, and the price of ſelf-denial. Piety is the fire from heaven, which can alone kindle the ſacrifice, and make it acceptable.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, when any act of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is performed by way of compoſition with one's Maker, either as a purchaſe, or an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of unallowed indulgences; though even in this caſe, God, (who makes all the paſſions of men ſubſervient to his good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes) can make the gift equally beneficial to the receiver; yet it is ſurely not too ſevere to ſay, that to the giver ſuch acts are an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded dependance, a deceitful refuge, a broken staff.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. The neglect of religious education both a cauſe and conſequence of the decline of chriſtianity. No moral reſtraints—Religion only inciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally taught, not as a principle of action. A few of the cauſes which diſpoſe the young to entertain low opinions of religion.</head>
               <p>LET not the truly ſerious be offended, as if, in the preſent chapter, which is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to treat of the notorious neglect of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious education, I meant to confine the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of chriſtianity to merely mechanical ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and to ſuppoſe that piety muſt be the natural and inevitable conſequence of early inſtitution. To imply this, would be indeed to betray a lamentable ignorance of human nature, of the diſorder ſin has introduced, of the inefficacy of human means, and entirely to miſtake the genius of our religion. It would be to ſuppoſe that God was to depend upon <hi>our</hi> goodneſs, and not upon <hi>his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet it muſt be allowed that the Supreme Being works chiefly by means; and though it is confeſſed that no defect of education, no corruption of manners, can place any one out of the reach of the divine influences (for it is under ſuch circumſtances, perhaps, that the moſt extraordinary inſtances of divine grace have been manifeſted); yet it muſt be
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:029103_0031_0FDF9B5CDB716018"/>
owned, that early ſobriety, early knowledge of religion, and early habits of piety, are the moſt probable means of ſecuring the favour of God. To acquire theſe, is putting our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the way in which he himſelf has told us his bleſſing is to be found.</p>
               <p>But religion is the only thing in which we ſeem to look for the end, without making uſe of the means: and yet, it would not be more ſurpriſing if we were to expect that our children ſhould become artiſts and ſcholars, without being bred to arts and languages, than it is to look for a chriſtian world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a chriſtian education.</p>
               <p>The nobleſt objects can yield no delight, if there be not in the mind a diſpoſition to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them, ariſing from an intelligence of their nature, and a reverence for their value, which can only ſpring from long habit and early acquaintance. For to produce any capacity of enjoyment, there muſt be a congruity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the mind and the object. To the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician demonſtration is pleaſure; to the philoſopher the ſtudy of nature; to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous the gratification of his appetite; to the poet the pleaſures of his imagination. Theſe objects they all reſpectively purſue as their proper buſineſs, as pleaſures adapted to that part of their nature which they have been accuſtomed to indulge and cultivate.</p>
               <p>Now, as men will be apt to act conſiſtently with their general views and habitual tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, would it not be abſurd to expect that
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:029103_0032_0FDF9B2CCEAAAF38"/>
the philoſopher ſhould look for his ſovereign good at a ball, or the ſenſualiſt in the pleaſures of intellect or piety? None of theſe ends are anſwerable to the general views of the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purſuer; they are not correſponding to his ideas; they are not commenſurate to his aims. The ſublimeſt pleaſures can afford lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle gratification where a previous taſte has not been cultivated. A clown, who ſhould hear a ſcholar or an artiſt talk of the delights of a library, a picture gallery, or a concert, could not gueſs at the nature of the pleaſures they afford, nor would his being introduced to them give him much clearer ideas, becauſe he would bring to them an eye blind to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, an underſtanding new to ſcience, and an ear deaf to harmony.</p>
               <p>Shall we expect then, ſince men can only be ſcholars by ſedulous labour, that they ſhall be chriſtians by mere chance? Shall we be ſurpriſed if thoſe do not fulfil the offices of religion, who are not trained to an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them? And will it not be obvious, that it muſt be ſome other thing beſides the abſtruſeneſs of creeds and opinions, which makes chriſtianity unfaſhionable?</p>
               <p>For it will not probably be diſputed, that in no age have the paſſions of youth been ſo early freed from the <hi>muzzle of reſtraint</hi>; in no age has the paternal authority been ſo contemptuouſly treated, or every ſpecies of ſubordination ſo diſdainfully trampled on. All the ſhades of diſcrimination in ſociety
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029103_0033_0FDF9B5EC75BD1D0"/>
ſeem to be melting into each other. In no age has imprudent fondneſs been ſo injuriouſly laviſh, or the ſupernumerary expenſes of the college and the ſchool (that prolific ſeed of corruption) been ſo prodigally augmented. In no age have the appetites been excited by ſuch early ſtimulants, and anticipated by ſuch premature indulgences. Never was the ſhining gloſs, the charming novelty of life ſo early worn off from the enjoyment by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive uſe. Never had ſimple, and natural, and youthful pleaſures ſo early loſt their power over the mind; nor was ever one great ſecret of virtue and happineſs the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of being cheaply pleaſed, ſo little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>A taſte for coſtly, or artificial, or tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleaſures cannot be gratified, by their moſt ſedulous purſuers, at every moment; and what wretched management is it in the oeconomy of human happineſs ſo to contrive, as that the enjoyment ſhall be rare and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and the intervals long and languid! Whereas real and unadulterated pleaſures oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur perpetually to him who cultivates a taſte for truth and nature, and ſcience and virtue. But theſe ſimple and tranquil enjoyments cannot but be inſipid to him, whoſe paſſions have been prematurely excited by agitating pleaſures, or whoſe taſte has been depraved by ſuch as are debaſing and frivolous; for it is of more conſequence to virtue than ſome good people are willing to allow, to preſerve
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:029103_0034_0FDF9B2F8A1AE230"/>
the taſte pure, and the judgment ſound. A vitiated intellect has no ſmall connection with depraved morals.</p>
               <p>Since amuſements of ſome kind are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to all ages (I ſpeak now with an eye to mere human enjoyment), why ſhould it not be as proper to tether men as other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals? Why ſhould not he too be confined, in different ſtages of life, to certain reſtricted limitations? ſince nothing but experience ſeems to teach him, that if he be allowed to anticipate his future poſſeſſions, and trample all the flowery fields of real, as well as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary and artificial enjoyment, he not only induces preſent diſguſt, but defaces and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all the rich materials of his future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſ; and leaves himſelf, for the reſt of his life, nothing but ravaged fields and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſtubble.</p>
               <p>But the great and radical defect, and that which comes more immediately within the preſent deſign, ſeems to be, that in general the characteriſtical principles of chriſtianity are not early and ſtrongly infuſed into the mind: that religion is rather taught inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, as a thing of ſubordinate value, than as the leading principle of human acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the great animating ſpring of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conduct. Were the high influential principles of the chriſtian religion anxiouſly and early inculcated, we ſhould find that thoſe lapſes from virtue, to which paſſion and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029103_0035_0FDF9B60F5C1B030"/>
temptation afterwards too frequently ſolicit, would be more eaſily recoverable.</p>
               <p>For though the evil propenſities of fallen nature, and the bewitching allurements of pleaſure, will too often ſeduce even thoſe of the beſt education into devious paths, yet we ſhall find that men will ſeldom be <hi>incurably</hi> wicked, without that internal corruption of principle, which knows how to juſtify iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and confirm evil conduct, by the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of corrupt reaſoning.</p>
               <p>The errors occaſioned by the violence of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be reformed, but ſyſtematic wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs will be only fortified by time; and no decreaſe of ſtrength, no decay of appetite, can weaken the power of a pernicious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He who commits a wrong action in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, puts himſelf out of the path of ſafety; but he who adopts a falſe principle, not only throws himſelf into the enemy's country, but burns the ſhips, breaks the bridge, cuts off every retreat by which he might hope one day to return into his own.</p>
               <p>Surely it will ſubject no one to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of bigotry or enthuſiaſm, if he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to enquire whether the genuine doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of chriſtianity are made the ſtandard by which our young men of faſhion are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taught to try their principles, or to weigh their actions; or whether ſome more popular ſtandard, of cuſtom, or faſhion, or worldly opinion, be not too frequently allowed to ſuperſede them? Whether ſome idol of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:029103_0036_0FDF9B314318DCA8"/>
falſe honour be not conſecrated for them to worſhip? Whether even among the better ſort, reputation be not held out as a motive of ſufficient energy to produce virtue, in a world where yet the greateſt vices are every day practiſed openly, which do not at all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the reception of thoſe who practiſe them into the beſt company? Whether reſentment be not ennobled, and pride, and many other paſſions, erected into honourable virtues—vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues not leſs repugnant to the genius and ſpirit of chriſtianity, than obvious groſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Will it be thought impertinent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire if the awful doctrines of a perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent Deity, and a future righteous judgment, are early impreſſed, and laſtingly engraven, on the hearts and conſciences of our high-born youth?</p>
               <p>Perhaps, if there be any one particular in which we fall remarkably below the politer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of antiquity, it is in that part of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which has a reference to purity of mind and the diſcipline of the heart.</p>
               <p>For the great ſecret of religious education, and which ſeems baniſhed from the preſent practiſe, conſiſts in training young men to an habitual interior reſtraint, an early goverment of the affections, and a courſe of ſelf-controul over thoſe tyrannizing inclinations, which have ſo natural a tendency to enſlave the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart. Without this habit of moral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, which is one of the fundamental laws of chriſtian virtue, though men may, from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:029103_0037_0FDF9B62A92E86B8"/>
temper, often <hi>do</hi> good, yet it is perhaps impoſſible that they ſhould ever <hi>be</hi> good. Without the vigorous exerciſe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling principle, the beſt diſpoſitions, and the moſt amiable qualities, will go but a little way towards eſtabliſhing a virtuous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. For the beſt diſpoſitions will be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overcome by the concurrence of paſſion and temptation, in a heart where the paſſions have not been accuſtomed to this wholeſome diſcipline: and the moſt amiable qualities will but more eaſily betray their poſſeſſor, unleſs the yielding heart be fortified by repeated acts, and long habits, of reſiſtence.</p>
               <p>In this, as in various other inſtances, we may bluſh at the ſuperiority of Pagan inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Were the Roman youth taught to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine themſelves always in the awful preſence of Cato, in order to habituate them betimes to ſuppreſs baſe ſentiments, and to excite ſuch as were generous and noble? And ſhould not the chriſtian youth be continually reminded, that a greater than Cato is here? Should they not be trained to the habit of acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conſtant impreſſion, that <hi>He</hi> to whom they muſt one day be accountable for intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as words and actions, is witneſs to the one as well as the other; that he not only is "about their paths," but "under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands their very thoughts?"</p>
               <p>Were the diſciples of a Pagan<note n="*" place="bottom">Pythagoras.</note> leader taught that it was a motive ſufficient to compel their
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029103_0038_0FDF9B684A54DDF0"/>
obedience to any rule, whether they liked it or not, that it had the authority of their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's name? were the bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> words, <hi>the maſter hath ſaid it,</hi> ſufficient to ſettle all diſputes, and to ſubdue all reluctance? And ſhall the ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of a more divine teacher, who have a code of laws written by God himſelf, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a lower rule, or abide by a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er authority? And is any argument drawn from human conſiderations likely to operate more forcibly on a dependant being, than that ſimple but grand aſſertion, with which ſo many of the precepts of our religion are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced—Becauſe, THUS SAITH THE LORD?</p>
               <p>For it is doing but little, in the infuſion of firſt principles, to obtain the bare aſſent of the underſtanding to the exiſtence of one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power, unleſs the heart and affections go along with the conviction, by our conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that power as intimately connected with ourſelves. A feeling temper will be but little affected with the cold idea of a <hi>geometrical</hi> God, as the excellent Paſcal expreſſes it, who mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adjuſts all the parts of matter, and keeps the elements in order. Such a mind will be but little moved, unleſs he be taught to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his Maker under the intereſting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing repreſentation which revealed religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gives of him. That "God is," will be to him rather an alarming than a conſolatory idea; till he be perſuaded of the ſubſequent propoſition, that "he is the rewarder of all ſuch as diligently ſeek him." Nay if natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

religion does even acknowledge one, aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attribute, that "God is juſt;" it will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe the terror of a tender conſcience, till he learn, from the fountain of truth, that he is, "the juſtifier of all who believe on him."</p>
               <p>But if the great ſanctions of our religion are not deeply engraven on the heart, where ſhall we look for a more adequate curb to the fiery ſpirit of youth? For, let the elements be ever ſo kindly mixed in human compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let the natural temper be ever ſo ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſtill whenever a man ceaſes to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an accountable being, what motive can he have for reſiſting a ſtrong temptation to a preſent good, when he has no dread that he ſhall thereby forfeit a greater future good?</p>
               <p>But it will be objected, that this deep ſenſe of religion would interfere with the general purpoſes of education, which is deſigned to qualify men for the buſineſs of human life, and not to train up a race of monks and aſceties.</p>
               <p>There is however ſo little real ſolidity in this ſpecious objection, that I am firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that if religious principles were more deeply impreſſed on the heart, even the things of this world would be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter carried on. For where are we to look for ſo much punctuality, diligence, application, doing every thing in its proper day (the great hinge on which buſineſs turns), as among men of principle? Oeconomy of time,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:029103_0040_0FDF9B6A5580C2C0"/>
truth in obſerving his word, never daring to deceive or to diſappoint—theſe are the very eſſence of a man of buſineſs; and for theſe to whom ſhall we moſt naturally look? Who is ſo little likely to be "ſlothful in buſineſs," as he who is "fervent in ſpirit?" Will not he be moſt regular in dealing with men, who is moſt diligent in "ſerving the Lord?"</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, allowing that religion does not neceſſarily ſpoil a man of <hi>buſineſs,</hi> yet it would effectually defeat thoſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, and counteract that fine breeding, which eſſentially conſtitute the <hi>gentleman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This again is ſo far from being a natural conſequence, that, ſuppoſing all the other real advantages, of parts and education, to be equally taken into the account, there is no doubt but that, in point of true polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a real chriſtian would beat the world at its own weapons, the world itſelf being judge.</p>
               <p>For though it muſt be confeſſed, that, in the preſent ſtate of things, other wickedneſs has made diſſimulation neceſſary; and that being the caſe, there is ſcarcely any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention for which we are more obliged to mankind than for that of politeneſs, as there is perhaps no ſcreen in the world which hides ſo many ugly ſights: yet while we allow that there never was ſo admirable a ſupplement to real goodneſs, as good breeding; it is however certain that the principles of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity put into action, would neceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029103_0041_0FDF9BB32370B160"/>
more genuine politeneſs than any max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims drawn from motives of human vanity or convenience. If <hi>love, peace, joy, long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gentleneſs, patience, goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> may be thought inſtruments to produce ſweetneſs of manners, theſe we are expreſsly told are "the fruits of the ſpirit." If mourning with the afflicted, rejoicing with the happy, if "to eſteem others better than ourſelves;" if "to take the loweſt room;" if "not to ſeek our own;" if "not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have ourſelves unſeemly;" if "not to ſpeak great ſwelling words of vanity"—if theſe are amiable, engaging and polite parts of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; then would the documents of Saint Paul make as true a fine gentleman as the <hi>Courtier of Caſtiglione,</hi> or even the <hi>Letters of Lord Cheſterfield</hi> himſelf. Then would ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, and diſſimulation, and all the nice ſhades and delicate gradations of paſſive and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive deceit, be rendered ſuperfluous; and the affections of every heart be won by a ſhorter and a ſurer way, than by the elegant obliquities of this late popular preceptor; whoſe miſchiefs have outlived his reputation; and who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the preſent juſt declenſion of his fame, has helped to relax the general nerve of virtue, and has left a taint upon the public morals, of which we are ſtill ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>That ſelf-abaſement then, which is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from chriſtianity, and the external ſigns of which good breeding knows ſo well
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029103_0042_0FDF9B6C88C84A80"/>
how to aſſume; and thoſe charities which ſuggeſt invariable kindneſs to others, even in the ſmalleſt things, would, if left to their natural workings, produce that gentleneſs which it is one great object of a polite education to imitate. They would produce it too without effort and without exertion; for being inherent in the ſubſtance, it would naturally produce itſelf on the ſurface.</p>
               <p>For however uſeful the inſtitutions of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſociety may be found, yet they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alter the eternal difference between right and wrong; or convert appearances into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities; they cannot transform decency into virtue nor make politeneſs paſs for principle. And the advocates for faſhionable breeding, ſhould be humbled to reflect, that every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of artificial manners was invented not to <hi>cure,</hi> but to <hi>conceal,</hi> deformity: that though the ſuperficial civilities of elegant life, tend to make this corrupt world a more tolerable place than it would be without them; yet they never will be conſidered as a ſubſtitute for truth and virtue by HIM who is to paſs the definitive ſentence on the charracters of men.</p>
               <p>Among the many prejudices which the young and the gay entertain againſt religion, one is, that it is the declared enemy to wit and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. But, ſays one of its wittieſt champions<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. South</note>, "Piety enjoins no man to be dull:" and it
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029103_0043_0FDF9BB55B172A58"/>
will be found, on a fair enquiry, that though it cannot be denied that irreligion has had able men for its advocates, yet they have never been the moſt able. Nor can any learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, any department in letters or in ſcience, produce a champion on the ſide of unbelief but chriſtianity has ſtill a greater name to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it; philoſophers themſelves being judges.</p>
               <p>But while the young adopt an opinion, from one claſs of writers, that religious men are weak; they acquire, from another, a notion that they are ridiculous: and this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by mixing itſelf with their common no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and deriving itſelf from their very amuſements, is the more miſchievous as it is received without reſiſtance or ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>One common medium through which they take this falſe view is, thoſe favourite works of wit and humour, ſo captivating to youthful imaginations, were no ſmall part of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's ſucceſs perhaps has been owing to his dexterouſly introducing a pious character, with ſo many virtues, that it is impoſſible not to love him, yet tinctured with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abſurdities, that it is impoſſible not to laugh at him. The reader's memory will furniſh him with too many inſtances of what is here meant. The ſlighteſt touches of a witty malice can make the beſt character ridiculous. It is effected by any little auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, abſence of mind, an obſolete phraſe, a formal pronunciation, a peculiarity of geſture. Or if ſuch a character be brought,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029103_0044_0FDF9B6E38CA6038"/>
by unſuſpecting goodneſs, and truſting honeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, into ſome fooliſh ſcrape, it will ſtamp an impreſſion of ridicule ſo indelible, that all his worth ſhall not be able to efface it: and the young who do not always ſeparate their ideas very carefully, ſhall ever after, by this early and falſe aſſociation, conceive of piety as having ſomething eſſentially ridiculous in itſelf.</p>
               <p>But one of the moſt infallible arts, by which the inexperienced are engaged on the ſide of irreligion, is, that popular air of candour, good nature, and toleration, which it ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invariably puts on. While, on the one hand, ſincere piety is often accuſed of moroſeneſs and ſeverity, becauſe it cannot hear the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, on which it founds its eternal hopes, derided without emotion; indifference or unbelief, on the other hand, purchaſe the praiſe of candour at an eaſy price, becauſe they neither ſuffer grief, nor expreſs indignation, at hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt awful truths ridiculed, or the moſt ſolemn obligations ſet at nought.</p>
               <p>The ſcoffers whom young people hear talk, and the books they hear quoted, falſely charge their own injurious opinions on chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and then unjuſtly accuſe her of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the monſter they have made. They dreſs her up, with the ſword of perſecution in one hand, and the flames of intolerance in the other; and then ridicule the ſober-minded for worſhipping an idol which their miſrepreſentation has rendered as malignant as Moloch. In the mean time they affect
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029103_0045_0FDF9BBA77CF5E68"/>
to ſeize on benevolence with excluſive appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation as their own cardinal virtue, and to accuſe of a bigotted cruelty, that narrow ſpirit which points out the perils of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and the terrors of a future account. And yet this benevolence, with all its tender mercies, is not afraid nor aſhamed to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at ſnatching away from humble piety, the comfort of a preſent hope, and the bright proſpect of a felicity that ſhall have no end. It does not however ſeem a very probable means of adding to the ſtock of human hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by plundering mankind of that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, by the deſtruction of which friendſhip is robbed of its bond, ſociety of its ſecurity, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of its motive, morality of its foundation, integrity of its reward, ſorrow of its conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, life of its balm, and death of its ſupport.</p>
               <p>It will not perhaps be one of the meaneſt advantages of a better ſtate, that as the will ſhall be reformed, ſo the judgment ſhall be rectified; that "evil ſhall no more be called good," nor the "churl liberal;" nor the plunderer of our beſt poſſeſſion, our principles, benevolent. Then it will be evident that greater violence could not be done to truth and language, than to wreſt benevolence from chriſtianity, her moſt appropriate and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar attribute. If benevolence be "good-will to men," it was that which angelic meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were not thought too high to announce, nor a much higher being than angels to teach by his precepts, and to illuſtrate by his death:
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029103_0046_0FDF9B7309CA5518"/>
it was the criterion, the very watch-word as it were, by which he intended his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and his followers ſhould be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. "By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples if ye love one another." Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is the very genius of chriſtianity to extirpate all ſelfiſhneſs, on whoſe vacated ground, benevolence naturally and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily plants itſelf.</p>
               <p>But not to run through all the particulars which obſtruct the growth of piety in young perſons, I ſhall only name one more. They hear much declamation from the faſhionable reaſoners, againſt the contracted and ſelfiſh ſpirit of chriſtianity—that it is of a ſordid temper, works for pay, and looks for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>But this jargon of French philoſophy, which prates of pure diſintereſted goodneſs acting for its own ſake, and equally deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing puniſhment and diſdaining recompence, indicates as little knowledge of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as of chriſtian revelation, when it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes man as a being made up of pure intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, without any mixture of paſſions, and who can be made happy without hope, and virtuous without fear.</p>
               <p>A creature hurried away by the impulſe of ſome impetuous inclination, is not likely to be reſtrained (if he be reſtrained at all) by a cold reflection on the beauty of virtue. If the dread of offending God, and the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his everlaſting diſpleaſure, cannot ſtop
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029103_0047_0FDF9BBCE4149280"/>
him, how ſhall a weaker motive do it? When we ſee that the powerful ſanctions which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> holds out, are too often an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: to think of attaining the ſame end by feebler means, is as if one ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to make a watch go the better by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the main ſpring; nay, as abſurd as if the philoſopher who inculcates the doctrine, ſhould undertake with one of his fingers to lift an immenſe weight, which had reſiſted the powers of the crane and the lever.</p>
               <p>On calm and temperate ſpirits, indeed, in the hour of retirement, in the repoſe of the paſſions, in the abſence of temptation, virtue does ſeem to be her own adequate reward; and very lovely are the fruits ſhe bears, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving health, credit, and fortune. But on how few will this principle act! and even on them, how often will its operation be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! and though virtue for her own ſake, might have captivated often hearts, which almoſt ſeem caſt in a natural mould of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet no motive could, at all times, be ſo likely to reſtrain even theſe, under the preſſure of temptation, as this ſimple aſſertion —<hi>For all this God will bring me into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is the beauty of our religion, that it is not held out excluſively to a few ſelect ſpirits; that it is not an object of ſpeculation or an exerciſe of ingenuity, but a <hi>rule of life,</hi> ſuited to every condition, capacity, and temper. It is the glory of the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:029103_0048_0FDF9B75453BC860"/>
to <hi>be,</hi> what it was, the glory of every pagan inſtitution <hi>not</hi> to be, the <hi>religion of the people</hi>; and that which conſtitutes its charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic value, is its ſuitableneſs to the genius, condition, and neceſſities of all mankind.</p>
               <p>For with whatever obſcurities it has pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to ſhadow ſome parts of his written word, yet he has graciouſly ordered, that whatever is neceſſary ſhould be perſpicuous alſo: and though "clouds and darkneſs are the habitation of his throne," yet they are not the medium through which he has left us to diſcover our duty. In this, as in all other points, it has a decided ſuperiority over all the ancient ſyſtems of philoſophy, which were always in many reſpects imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable and extravagant, becauſe not framed from obſervations drawn from a perfect knowledge "what was in men." Whereas the whole ſcheme of the goſpel is accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to real human nature; laying open its moral diſeaſe, preſenting its only remedy; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting rules of conduct, often difficult indeed, but never impoſſible; and where the rule was ſo high that the practicability ſeemed deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, holding out a living pattern, to eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the doctrine, and to illuſtrate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In ſhort, whoever examines the wants of his

               <p>This is the religion with which the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous hearts of youth ſhould be warmed, and by which their ſpirits, while pliant, ſhould be directed.

               <head>CHAP. IV. Other ſymptoms of the decline of chriſtianity— No family religion—Corrupt or negligent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſuperiors—The ſelf-denying and evangelical virtues held in contempt—Neglect of encouraging and promoting religion among ſervants.</head>
               <p>IT was by no means the deſign of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent undertaking to make a general invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive on the corrupt ſtate of manners, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to animadvert on the conduct of the higher ranks, but inaſmuch as the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that conduct, and the depravation of thoſe manners, appear to be a natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the viſible decline of religion.</p>
               <p>Of the other obvious cauſes which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to this decline of morals, little will be ſaid. Nor is the preſent a romantic attempt to reſtore the ſimplicity of primitive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. This is too literally an age of gold, to expect that it ſhould be ſo in the poetical and figurative ſenſe. It would be unjuſt and abſurd not to form our opinions and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from the preſent general ſtate of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. And it would argue great ignorance of the corruption which commerce, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and riches, and arts, neceſſarily intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into a ſtate, to look for the fame ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermindedneſs, ſimplicity, and purity among
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:029103_0051_0FDF9BC0CC8AC8F0"/>
the <hi>dregs of Romulus,</hi> as the ſevere and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple manners of elder Rome preſented.</p>
               <p>But though it would be an attempt of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hardihood, to controvert that maxim of the witty bard, that
<q>To mend the world's a vaſt deſign;</q>
yet to make the beſt of the times in which we live; to fill up the meaſure of our own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, particular, and individual duties; and to take care that the age ſhall not be the worſe for our having been caſt into it, ſeems to be the bare dictate of common probity, and not a romantic flight of impracticable perfection.</p>
               <p>But is it then ſo very chimerical to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the benevolent can be ſober-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? It is romantic to deſire that the good ſhould be conſiſtent? Is it abſurd to fancy that what has once been practiſed, ſhould not now be impracticable.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible then not to help regretting that it ſhould be the general temper of many of the leading perſons of that age which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates to itſelf the glorious character of the <hi>age of benevolence,</hi> to be kind, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and compaſſionate, every where rather than at home: that the rich and the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhould be zealous in promoting religious, as well as charitable inſtitutions abroad, and yet diſcourage every thing which looks like religion in their own families: that they
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:029103_0052_0FDF9B792A4EE308"/>
ſhould be at a conſiderable expence in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the poor at a diſtance, and yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit piety among their own ſervants—thoſe more immediate objects of every man's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention whom Providence has enabled to keep any; and for whoſe conduct he will be finally accountable, inaſmuch as he has helped to corrupt it.</p>
               <p>Is there any degree of pecuniary bounty without doors which can counteract the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of a wrong example at home; or attone for that infectious laxity of principle, which ſpreads corruption wherever its influence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends? Is not he the beſt benefactor to ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety who ſets the beſt example, and who does, not only the moſt good, but the leaſt evil? Will not that man, however liberal, very imperfectly promote virtue in the world at large, who neglects to diſſeminate the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of it within the immediate ſphere of his own perſonal influence, by a ſober con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and a blameleſs behaviour? Can a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous but profligate perſon attone by his purſe for the diſorders of his life, or expect a bleſſing on his bounties, while he defeats their effect by a profane couverſation?</p>
               <p>In moral as well as political treatiſes, it is often aſſerted, that it is a great evil to do no good: but it has not been perhaps enough inſiſted on, that it is a great good to do no evil. This ſpecies of goodneſs is not oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentatious enough for popular declamation; and the value of this abſtinence from vice is
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:029103_0053_0FDF9BC6B753C5C8"/>
perhaps not well underſtood by chriſtians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it wants the oſtenſible brilliancy of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al performance.</p>
               <p>But as the <hi>principles</hi> of chriſtianity are in no great repute, ſo their concomitant <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> the evangelical virtues, are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably diſeſteemed. But thoſe ſecret habits of ſelf-controul, thoſe interior and unobtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive virtues, which excite no aſtoniſhment, kindle no emulation, and extort no praiſe, are yet the moſt difficult, and the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, and, if chriſtianity be true, will be the moſt graciouſly accepted by <hi>him</hi> who witneſſes the ſecret ſtruggle and the ſilent victory: while the ſplendid deeds, which have the world for their witneſs, and immortal fame for their reward, ſhall perhaps coſt him who atchieved them, leſs than it coſts a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious chriſtian to ſubdue one irregular incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; a conqueſt which the world will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know, and if it did, would probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe.</p>
               <p>For though great actions performed on human motives are permitted, by the great Diſpoſer, to be equally beneficial to ſociety with ſuch as are performed on purer princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; yet it is an affecting conſideration, that, at the final adjuſtment of accounts, the politician that <hi>raiſed</hi> a ſtate, or the hero who <hi>preſerved</hi> it, may miſs of that favour of God, which, if it was not his motive, will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not be his reward. And it is awful to reflect, as we viſit the monuments juſtly
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029103_0054_0FDF9B7DDF0B99F0"/>
raiſed by public gratitude, or the ſtatues properly erected by well-earned admiration, on what may be now the unalterable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the illuſtrious object of theſe deſerved honours; and that he who has ſaved a ſtate, may have loſt his own ſoul.</p>
               <p>A chriſtian life ſeems to conſiſt of two things, almoſt equally difficult; the adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good habits, and the exciſion of ſuch as are evil. No one ſets out on a religious courſe with a ſtock of native innocence, or actual freedom from ſin; for there is no ſuch ſtate in human life. The natural heart is not a blank paper, whereon the divine ſpirit has nothing to do but to ſtamp characters of goodneſs; but many blots and defilements are to be eraſed, as well as freſh impreſſions to be made.</p>
               <p>The vigilant chriſtian therefore, who acts with an eye to the approbation of his Maker, rather than to that of mankind; to a future account, rather than to preſent glory, will find, that, diligently to cultivate the "un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weeded garden" of his own heart; to mend the ſoil; to clear the ground of its indigenous vices, by practiſing the painful buſineſs of extirpation; will be that part of his duty which will coſt him moſt labour, and bring him leaſt credit: while the fair ſlower of one ſhewy action, produced with little trouble, and of which the pleaſure is reward enough, ſhall gain him more praiſe

than the eradication of the rankeſt weeds which over-run the natural heart.</p>
               <p>But the Goſpel judges not after the manner of men; for it never fails to make the abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent virtues a previous ſtep to the right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the operative ones; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhing what is wrong to be a neceſſary prelude to the performance of what is right. It makes "ceaſing to do evil" the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable preliminary to "learning to do well." It continually ſuggeſts that ſomething is to be laid aſide as well as to be practiſed. We muſt "hate vain thoughts" before we can "love God's law." We muſt lay aſide "malice and hypocriſy," to <hi>enable</hi> us "to receive the engrafted word."—Having "a conſcience void of offence;" "abſtaining from fleſhly luſts," "bringing every thought into obedience"—theſe are actions, or rather negations, which, though they never will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain immortality from the chiſel of the ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, the declamation of the hiſtorian, or the panegyric of the poet, ſerve however to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the true chriſtian temper, to promote heavenly mindedneſs, and to procure the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour.</p>
               <p>And for our encouragement, it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that a more difficult chriſtian virtue generally involves an eaſier one. An habit of ſelf-denial in permitted pleaſures eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a victory over ſuch as are unlawful. And to ſit looſe to our own poſſeſſions, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:029103_0056_0FDF9B80F6269838"/>
includes an exemption from covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe of others; and ſo on of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Will it be difficult then to trace back to that want of early reſtraint noticed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding chapter, that licence of behaviour which, having been indulged in youth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards reigns uncontrouled in families; and having infected education in its firſt ſprings, taints all the ſtreams of domeſtic virtue? Nor is it ſtrange that that ſame want of religious principle which corrupted our children ſhould corrupt our ſervants.</p>
               <p>We ſcarcely go into any company without hearing ſome invective againſt the increaſed profligacy of this order of men; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is made with as great an air of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if the cauſe of the complaint were not as viſible as the truth of it. It would be endleſs to point out inſtances in which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed diſſipation of their betters (as they are oddly called) has contributed to the growth of this evil. But it comes only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the immediate deſign of the preſent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, to inſiſt on the ſingle circumſtance of the almoſt total extermination of religion in faſhionable families, as a cauſe, adequate of itſelf, to any conſequence which depraved morals can produce.</p>
               <p>Is there not a degree of injuſtice in perſons who diſcover ſtrong indignation at thoſe crimes which crowd our priſons, and furniſh our inceſſant executions, and yet diſcourage not an internal principle of vice; ſince thoſe
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:029103_0057_0FDF9BCA1FC53D60"/>
crimes are nothing more than that principle put into action? And it is no leſs abſurd than cruel in ſuch of the great as lead diſorderly lives, to expect to prevent vice by the laws they make to reſtrain or puniſh it, while their own example is a perpetual ſource of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to commit it. If by their own practice they demonſtrate that they think a vicious life is the only happy one, with what colour of juſtice can they inflict penalties on others, who, by acting on the ſame principle, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſame indulgence?</p>
               <p>And indeed it is ſomewhat unreaſonable to expect very high degrees of virtue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity from a claſs of people whoſe whole life, after they are admitted into diſſipated fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, is one continued counteraction of the principles in which they have probably been bred.</p>
               <p>When a poor youth is tranſplanted from one of thoſe excellent inſtitutions which do honour to the preſent age, and give ſome hope of reforming the next, into the family, perhaps, of his noble benefactor, who has provided liberally for his inſtruction; what muſt be his aſtoniſhment at finding the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life to which he is introduced diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to that life, to which he has been taught that ſalvation is alone annexed! He has been trained in a wholeſome terror of gaming: but now his intereſts and paſſions are forcibly engaged on the ſide of play, ſince the very profits of his place are made <hi>ſyſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:029103_0058_0FDF9B82A89AAB28"/>
to depend on the card-table. He has been taught that it was his bounden duty to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly thankful for his own ſcanty meal, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of barley bread; yet he ſees his noble lord ſit down every day,</p>
               <q>Not to a dinner, but a hecatomb;</q>
               <p>To a repaſt for which every element is plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and every climate impoveriſhed; for which nature is ranſacked, and art is exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; without even the formal ceremony of a ſlight acknowledgment. It will be lucky for the maſter, if his ſervant does not happen to know that even the pagans never ſat down to a repaſt without making a libation to their deities; and that the Jews did not eat a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fruit, or drink a cup of water, without an expreſſion of devout thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Next to the law of God, he has been taught to reverence the law of the land; and to reſpect an act of parliament next to a text of Scripture: yet he ſees his honourable protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, publicly in his own houſe, engaged in the evening in playing at a game expreſsly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the laws, and againſt which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he himſelf had aſſiſted in the day to paſs an act.</p>
               <p>While the contempt of religion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to wits and philoſophers, the effect was not ſo ſenſibly felt. But we cannot congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate the ordinary race of mortals on their emancipation from old prejudices, or their indifference to ſacred uſages; as it is not at all viſible that the world is become happier
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:029103_0059_0FDF9BCC53FAC2E8"/>
in proportion as it is become more enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We might rejoice more in the boaſted diffuſion of light and freedom, were it not apparent that bankruptcies are grown more frequent, robberies more common, divorces more numerous, and forgeries more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive—that more rich men die by their own hand, and more poor men by the hand of the executioner — than when chriſtianity was practiſed by the vulgar, and countenanced, at leaſt, by the great.</p>
               <p>Is it not to be regretted therefore, while the affluent are encouraging ſo many admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſchemes for promoting religion among the children of the poor, that they do not like to <hi>perpetuate</hi> the principle, by encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in their ſervants alſo? Is it not pity, ſince theſe are ſo moderately furniſhed with the good things of this life, to rob them of that bright reverſion, the bare hope of which is a counterpoiſe to all the hardſhips they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo here—eſpecially ſince, by diminiſhing this future hope, we ſhall not be likely to add to their preſent uſefulneſs?</p>
               <p>Still allowing, what has been already grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that abſolute infidelity is not the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, and that ſervants will perhaps be more likely to ſee religion neglected than to hear it ridiculed; would it not be a merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kindneſs, in families of a better ſtamp, to furniſh them with more opportunities of learning and practiſing their duty? Is it not impolitic indeed, as well as unkind, to refuſe
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:029103_0060_0FDF9B84DCD93548"/>
them any means of having impreſſed on their conſciences the operative principles of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity? It is but little, barely not to <hi>oppoſe</hi> their going to church, or doing their duty at home, unleſs their opportunities of doing both are facilitated, by giving them, at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeaſons, as few employments as poſſible that may interfere with both. Even when religion is by pretty general conſent baniſhed from our families, that only furniſhes a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger reaſon why our families ſhould not be baniſhed from religion in the churches.</p>
               <p>But if theſe opportunities are not made eaſy and convenient to them, their ſuperiors have no right to expect from them a zeal ſo far tranſcending their own, as to induce them to ſurmount difficulties for the ſake of their duty. Religion is never once repreſented in ſcripture as a light attainment; it is never once illuſtrated by an eaſy, a quiet, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent allegory. On the contrary, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited under the active figure of a combat, a race; ſomething expreſſive of exertion, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, progreſs. And yet many are unjuſt enough to think that this warfare can be fought, though they are perpetually weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vigour of the combatant; this race be run, though they are inceſſantly obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the progreſs of him who runs by ſome hard and interfering command. That that compaſſionate judge who cannot but be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly touched with the feeling of <hi>their</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, will tenderly allow for their trials,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:029103_0061_0FDF9BD0632DDC00"/>
and be merciful to their failings, can never be doubted; but what portion of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs he will extend to thoſe who lay on their virtue hard burdens "too heavy for them to bear," who ſhall ſay?</p>
               <p>To keep any immortal being in a ſtate of ſpiritual darkneſs, is a poſitive diſobedience to <hi>His</hi> law, who when he beſtowed the Bible, no leſs than when he created the material world, ſaid, <hi>Let there be light.</hi> It were well for both the advantage of maſter and ſervant, that the latter ſhould have the doctrines of the Goſpel frequently impreſſed on his heart, that his conſcience ſhould be made familiar with a ſyſtem which offers ſuch clear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible propoſitions of moral duty. The ſtriking interrogation, "how ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?" will perhaps operate as forcibly on an uncultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind, as the moſt eloquent eſſay, to prove that man is not an accountable being. That once credited promiſe, that "they who have done well ſhall go into everlaſting life," will be more grateful to the ſpirit of a plain man, than that more elegant and diſintereſted aphoriſm, that <hi>virtue is its own reward.</hi> That "he that walketh uprightly walketh ſurely," is not on the whole dangerous or a miſleading maxim. And "well done, good and faithful ſervant! I will make thee ruler over many things," though offenſive to the liberal ſpirit of philoſophic dignity, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſupport to humble and ſuffering pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:029103_0062_0FDF9B8BEAE045C8"/>
That "we ſhould do to others as we would they ſhould do to us," is a portable and compendious meaſure of ſocial duty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at hand, as always referring to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within himſelf, not amiſs for a poor man to carry conſtantly about with him, who has neither time nor learning to ſearch for a better. All Seneca's arguments againſt the fear of death, never yet reconciled one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to its approach, half ſo effectually as the humble believer is reconciled to it by that ſimple perſuaſion, "I know that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth."</p>
               <p>While the modern philoſopher is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the boundaries of human knowledge, by undertaking to prove that matter is eternal; or enlarging the ſtock of human happineſs, by demonſtrating the extinction of ſpirit: it can do no harm to an unlettered man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that "heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but God's word ſhall not paſs away." While the former is indulging the profitable enquiry why the Deity made the world ſo late, or why he made it at all, it will not hurt the latter to believe that "in the beginning God made the world," and that in the end "he ſhall judge it in righteouſneſs." While the one is criticiſing the creed, he will be no loſer by encouraging the other to keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>For it is a very valuable part of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that though it is an entire and perfect ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem in its deſign; though it exhibits one great plan, from which complete trains of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029103_0063_0FDF6D26F4FF5648"/>
argument, and connected ſchemes of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be deduced; yet, in compaſſion to the multitude for whom this benevolent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was in a good meaſure deſigned, and who could not have comprehended a long chain of propoſitions, or have embraced re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote deductions; the moſt important truths of doctrine, and the moſt eſſential documents of virtue, are detailed in ſingle maxims, and compriſed in ſhort ſentences; independent of themſelves, yet making a neceſſary part of a conſummate whole, from a few of which ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary principles, the whole train of human virtues has been deduced, and many a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect body of ethics has been framed.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. The negligent conduct of chriſtians, no real ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt chriſtianity.—The reaſon why its effects are not more manifeſt to worldly men, is, becauſe believers do not lead chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian lives.—Profeſſors differ but little in their practice from unbelievers.—Even real chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are too diffident and timid, and afraid of acting up to their principles.—The abſurdity of the charge commonly brought againſt ſerious people, that they are too ſtrict.</head>
               <p>IT is an objection frequently brought againſt chriſtianity, that if it exhibited ſo perfect a ſcheme, if its influences were as ſtrong, if its effects were as powerful, as its friends pretend, it muſt have produced more viſible conſequences in the reformation of mankind. This is not the place fully to anſwer this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which, (like all the other cavils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our religion) continues to be urged juſt as if it never <hi>had</hi> been anſwered.</p>
               <p>That vice and immorality prevail in no ſmall degree, in countries profeſſing chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we need not go out of our own to be convinced. But that this is the caſe only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this benign principle is not ſuffered to operate in its full power, will be no leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to all who are ſincere in their enquiries. For, if we allow (and who that examines im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:029103_0065_0FDF9BD4A10C7300"/>
can help allowing?) that it is the natural tendency of chriſtianity to make men better, then it muſt be the averſion to receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and not the faults of the principles, which prevents them from becoming ſo.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are acquainted with the effects it actually produced in the firſt ages of the church, when it <hi>was</hi> received in its genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine purity, and when it <hi>did</hi> operate without obſtruction, from its <hi>followers</hi> at leaſt, will want no other proof of its inherent power and efficacy. At that period, its moſt decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and induſtrious enemy, the emperor Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, could recommend the <hi>manners</hi> of the Galileans to the imitation of his pagan high prieſt; though he himſelf, at the ſame time, was doing every thing which the moſt inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate malice, ſharpened by the acuteſt wit, and backed by the moſt abſolute power, could deviſe, to diſcredit their doctrines.</p>
               <p>Nor would the efficacy of chriſtianity be leſs viſible now, in influencing the conduct of its profeſſors, if its principles were hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and ſincerely received. They would operate on the conduct ſo effectually, that we ſhould ſee morals and manners growing out of principles, as ſpontaneouſly and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as we ſee other conſequences grow out of their proper and natural cauſes. Let but this great ſpring have its unobſtructed play, and there would be little occaſion to declaim againſt this exceſs, or that enormity. If the ſame ſkill and care which are employed
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:029103_0066_0FDF9B8F5F1CB8C0"/>
in curing ſymptoms, were vigorouſly level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the internal principle of the diſeaſe, the moral health would feel the benefit. If that attention which is beſtowed in lopping the redundant and unſightly branches, were devoted to the cultivation of a ſound and uncorrupt root, the effect of this labour would ſoon be diſcovered by the excellence of the fruits.</p>
               <p>For though, even in the higheſt poſſible exertion of religious principle, and the moſt diligent practice of all its conſequential train of virtues, man would ſtill find evil propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities enough, in his fallen nature, to make it neceſſary that he ſhould counteract them, by keeping alive his diligence after higher attainments, and to quicken his aſpirations after a better ſtate; yet the prevailing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per would be in general right, the will would be in a great meaſure rectified; and the heart, feeling and acknowledging the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, would apply itſelf diligently to the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy. For though even the beſt men have infirmities enough to deplore, commit ſins enough to keep them deeply humble, and feel more ſenſibly than others, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of that veſſel in which their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly treaſure is hid: theſe however have the internal conſolation of knowing that they ſhall have to reckon with one who "know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whereof they are made;" who will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of faith and repentance inſtead of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:029103_0067_0FDF9BD78C574958"/>
perfection, and of humble ſincerity in lieu of entire holineſs.</p>
               <p>All the heavy charges which have been brought againſt religion, have been taken from the abuſes of it. In every other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the injuſtice of this proceeding would be notorious: but there is a general want of candour in the judgment of men on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which we do not find them exerciſe on other occaſions; that of throwing the fault of the erring or ignorant profeſſor on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion itſelf.</p>
               <p>It does not derogate from the honourable profeſſion of arms, that there are cowards and braggarts. If any man loſe his eſtate by the chicanery of an attorney, or his health by the blunder of a phyſician, it is commonly ſaid, that the one was a diſgrace to his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and the other was ignorant of it; but no one therefore concludes that law and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic are contemptible profeſſions.</p>
               <p>Chriſtianity alone is obliged to bear all the obliquy incurred by the miſconduct of its followers; to ſuſtain all the reproach excited by ignorant, by fanatical, by ſuperſtitious, or hypocritical profeſſors. But whoever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes it of a tendency to produce the errors of theſe profeſſors, muſt have picked up his opinion any where rather than in the New Teſtament, which being the only authentic hiſtory of chriſtianity, is that which candour would naturally conſult for information.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:029103_0068_0FDF9B9193C49F88"/>
But as worldly and irreligious men do not draw their notions from that pure fountain, but from the polluted ſtream of human prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; as they form their judgment of divine truth from the conduct of thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be enlightened by it; ſome charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble allowance <hi>muſt</hi> be made for the contempt which they entertain for chriſtianity, when they ſee what poor effects it produces in the lives of the generality of profeſſing chriſtians. What do they obſerve there which can lead them to entertain very high ideas of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which give birth to ſuch practices?</p>
               <p>Do men of the world diſcover any marked, any decided difference between the conduct of nominal chriſtians, and that of the reſt of their neighbours who pretend to no religion at all? Do they ſee, in the daily lives of ſuch, any great abundance of thoſe fruits by which they have heard believers are to be known? On the contrary, do they not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in them the ſame anxious and unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed purſuit after the things of the earth, as in thoſe who do not profeſs to have any thought of heaven? Do not they ſeem then to labour as ſedulouſly in the intereſts of a debaſing and frivolous diſſipation, as thoſe who do not pretend to have any nobler object in view? Is there not the ſame eagerneſs to plunge into all ſorts of follies themſelves, and the ſame unrighteous ſpeed in intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing their children to them, as if they had never entered into a ſolemn engagement
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029103_0069_0FDF9BDD3370C708"/>
to renounce them? Is there not the ſame ſelf-indulgence, the ſame luxury, and the ſame paſſionate attachment to the things of this world in them, as is viſible in thoſe who do not look for another?</p>
               <p>Do not thoughtleſs neglect, and habitual diſſipation, anſwer, as to ſociety, all the ends of the moſt decided infidelity? Between the barely decent, and the openly profane, there is indeed this difference; that the one, by making no profeſſion, deceives neither the world, nor his own heart; while the other, by intrenching himſelf in forms, fancies that he does ſomething, and thanks God that "he is not like the publican." The one only ſhuts his eyes upon the danger which the other deſpiſes.</p>
               <p>But theſe unfruitful profeſſors would do well to recollect, that, by a conduct ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worthy of their high calling, they not only violate the law to which they have vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience, but occaſion many to diſbelieve or to deſpiſe it; that they are thus in a great meaſure accountable for the infidelity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of courſe will have to anſwer for more than their own perſonal offences. For did they in any reſpect live up to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they profeſs; did they adorn the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of chriſtianity by a life in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree conſonant to their faith; did they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit any thing of the "beauty of holineſs" in their daily converſation; they would then give ſuch a demonſtrative proof, not only
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:029103_0070_0FDF9B97F2258640"/>
of the ſincerity of their own obedience, but of the brightneſs of that divine light by which they profeſs to walk, that the moſt determined unbeliever would at laſt begin to think there muſt be <hi>ſomething</hi> in a religion of which the effects were ſo viſible, and the fruits ſo amiable; and might in time be led to "glorify," not <hi>them,</hi> not the imperfect doers of theſe works, but "their Father which is in heaven." Whereas, as things are at preſent carried on, the obvious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion muſt be, either that chriſtians do not believe in the religion they profeſs, or that there is no truth in the religion itſelf.</p>
               <p>For will he not naturally ſay, that, if its influences were ſo predominant, its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences muſt be more evident? that, if the prize held out were really ſo bright, thoſe who truly believed ſo would ſurely <hi>do</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and <hi>ſacrifice</hi> ſomething, to obtain it?</p>
               <p>This ſwells the amount of the actual miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief beyond calculation. And there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing terrible in the idea of this ſort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite evil, that the careleſs chriſtian can never know the extent of the contagion he ſpreads, nor the multiplied infection which <hi>they</hi> may communicate in <hi>their</hi> turn, whom <hi>his</hi> diſorders firſt corrupted.</p>
               <p>And there is this farther aggravation of his offence, that he will not only be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for all the poſitive evil of which his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is the cauſe; but for the omiſſion of all the probable good which might have been

called forth in others, had <hi>his</hi> actions been conſiſtent with his profeſſion. What a ſtrong, what an almoſt irreſiſtible convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would it carry to the hearts of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, if they beheld that characteriſtic dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the manners of chriſtians, which their profeſſion gives one a right to expect! if they ſaw that diſintereſtedneſs, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, ſober-mindedneſs, temperance, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and ſincerity, which are the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable fruits of a genuine faith!</p>
               <p>But, while a man talks like a ſaint, and yet lives like a ſinner; while he profeſſes to believe like an apoſtle, and yet leads the life of a ſenſualiſt; talks of an ardent faith, and yet exhibits a cold and low practice; boaſts himſelf the diſciple of a meek maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yet is as much a ſlave to his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as they who acknowledge no ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; while he appears the proud pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of an humble religion, or the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate champion of a ſelf-denying one: ſuch a man brings chriſtianity into diſrepute; confirms thoſe in error who might have been awakened to conviction; ſtrengthens doubt into diſbelief; and hardens indifference into contempt.</p>
               <p>Even among thoſe of a better caſt, and a purer principle, the exceſſive reſtraints of timidity, caution, and that "fear of man, which bringeth a ſnare," confine, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtifle the generous ſpirit of an ardent exertion in the cauſe of religion. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity

may pathetically expoſtulate, that it is not always "an open enemy which diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours her," but her "familiar friend." And, "what doſt thou more than others?" is a queſtion which even the good and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſhould often aſk themſelves, in order to quicken their zeal; to prevent the total ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of unexerted principles, on the one hand; or the danger, on the other, of their being driven down the gulf of ruin, by the unreſiſted and confluent tides of temptation, faſhion, and example.</p>
               <p>In a very ſtrict and mortified age, of which a ſcrupulous ſeverity was the predominant character, precautions againſt an exceſſive zeal might, and doubtleſs would, be a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and prudent meaſure. But in these times of relaxed principle and frigid indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, to ſee people ſo vigilantly on their guard againſt the imaginary miſchiefs of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, while they run headlong into the real oppoſite perils of a deſtructive licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, puts one in mind of the one-eyed animal in the fable, who, living on the banks of the ocean, never fancied he could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed any way but by drowning: but, while he kept that one eye conſtantly fixed on the ſea, on which ſide he concluded all the peril lay, he was devoured by an enemy on the dry land, from which quarter he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuſpected any danger.</p>
               <p>Are not the miſchieſs of an enthuſiaſtic piety inſiſted on with as much earneſtneſs as
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029103_0073_0FDF9BE0AA157BB8"/>
if an extravagant devotion were the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propenſity? Is not the neceſſity of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration as vehemently urged as if an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate zeal were the epidemic diſtemper of the great world? As if all our apparent danger and natural bias lay on the ſide of a too rigid auſterity, which required the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and conſtant counteraction of an oppoſite principle? Would not a ſtranger be almoſt tempted to imagine, from the frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt extreme ſtrictneſs, that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction from the world, and a monaſtic rage for retreat, were the ruling temper; that we were in ſome danger in ſeeing our places of diverſion abandoned; and the enthuſiaſtic ſcenes of the <hi>Holy Fathers of the deſert</hi> acted over again by the frantic and uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able devotion of our young perſons of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p>It is ſeriouſly to be regretted, in an age like the preſent, remarkable for indifference in religion and levity in manners, and which ſtands ſo much in need of lively patterns of firm and reſolute piety, that many who real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are chriſtians on the ſobereſt convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould not appear more openly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidedly on the ſide they have eſpouſed; that they aſſimilate ſo very much with the manners of thoſe about them (which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they yet ſcruple not to diſapprove;) and, inſtead of an avowed but prudent ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs, which might draw over the others, appear evidently fearful of being thought
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029103_0074_0FDF9B9B70178600"/>
preciſe and over-ſcrupulous: and actually ſeem to diſavow their right principles, by conceſſions and accommodations not ſtrictly conſiſtent with them. They often ſeem cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly afraid of <hi>doing too much,</hi> and <hi>going to far</hi>; and the dangerous plea, the neceſſity of <hi>living like other people,</hi> of <hi>being like the reſt of the world,</hi> and the propriety of <hi>not being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi> is brought as a reaſonable apology for a too yielding and indiſcriminate confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p>But, at a time when almoſt all are ſinking into the prevailing corruption, how beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a rare, a ſingle integrity is, let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Lot and Noah declare. And to thoſe with whom a poem is an higher autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than the Bible, let me recommend the moſt animated picture of a righteous ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity that ever was delineated, in

               <p>Few indeed of the more orderly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent have any objection to that degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which is compatible with their general acceptance with others, or the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:029103_0075_0FDF9BE2DCCD98A0"/>
of their own pleaſures. For a formal and ceremonious exerciſe of the outward du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of chriſtianity, may not only be kept up without exciting cenſure, but will even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a certain reſpect and confidence; and is not quite irreconcileable with a voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſſipated life. So far many go; and ſo far "as godlineſs is profitable to the life that <hi>is,</hi>" it paſſes without reproach.</p>
               <p>But as ſoon as men begin to conſider re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exerciſes not as a decency, but a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; not as a commutation for a ſelf-denying life, but as a means to promote a holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and a virtuous conduct: as ſoon as they feel diſpoſed to carry the effect of their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into their daily life: as ſoon as their principles diſcover themſelves, by leading them to withdraw from thoſe ſcenes, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from thoſe actions, in which the gay place their ſupreme happineſs: as ſoon as ſomething is to be <hi>done,</hi> and ſomething is to be <hi>parted with</hi>; then the world begins to take offence, and to ſtigmatize the <hi>activity</hi> of that piety, which had been commended as long as it remained <hi>inoperative,</hi> and had only evaporated in <hi>words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when religion, like the vital princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, takes its ſeat in the heart, and ſends out ſupplies of life and heat to every part; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes motion, ſoul, and vigour, through the whole circulation; and informs and animates the whole man: when it operates on the practice, influences the converſation, breaks
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:029103_0076_0FDF9B9DA4FBDD70"/>
out into a lively zeal for the honour of God, and the beſt intereſts of mankind; then the ſincerity, or the underſtanding, of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will become queſtionable: and it muſt be owing to a very fortunate combination of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances indeed, if he can at once preſerve the character of parts and piety.</p>
               <p>But it is a folly to talk of being too holy, too ſtrict, or too good. Where there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to appear ſome foundation for the charge of enthuſiaſm (as there are indeed too often in good people eccentricities which juſtify the cenſure), we may depend upon it, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from ſome defect in the judgment, and not from any exceſs in the piety; for in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there is no exceſs: and it is as prepoſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſay that any one is too good, or too pious, as that he is too wiſe, too ſtrong, or too healthy; ſince the higheſt point in all theſe is only the perfection of that quality which we admired in a lower degree. There may be an <hi>imprudent,</hi> but there cannot be a <hi>ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> goodneſs. An ardent imagination may miſlead a rightly turned heart; and a weak intellect may incline the beſt intentioned to aſcribe too much value to things of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively ſmall importance. Such an one not having diſcernment enough to perceive where the force and ſtreſs of duty lie, may innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcredit religion by a too ſcrupulous exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in points of ſmall intrinſic value.</p>
               <p>And even well-meaning men, as well as hypocrites, may think too much is done when
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:029103_0077_0FDF9BE9C99AC168"/>
their "mint" and "aniſe" are rigorouſly tithed.</p>
               <p>But in obſerving the "weightier matters of the law," in the practice of univerſal holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the love of God, there can be no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of exceeding while there is no limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the command. We are in no danger of loving our neighbour <hi>better</hi> than ourſelves; and let us remember, that we do not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, but fall ſhort of our duty, while we love him <hi>leſs.</hi> If we were commanded to love God with <hi>ſome</hi> of our heart, with <hi>part</hi> of our ſoul, and a <hi>portion</hi> of our ſtrength, there would then be ſome colour for thoſe perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cavils about the <hi>proportion</hi> of love, and the <hi>degree</hi> of obedience, which are due to him. But as the command is ſo definite, ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, ſo comprehenſive, ſo entire; nothing can be more abſurd than that unmeaning, but not unfrequent charge brought againſt ſerious perſons, that <hi>they are too ſtrict.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The foundation of this ſilly cenſure is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly laid in the firſt principles of education, where an early ſeparation is ſyſtematically made between duty and pleaſure. One of the firſt baits held out for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of children, is, that when they have done their <hi>duty,</hi> they will be entitled to ſome <hi>pleaſure</hi>; thus forcibly disjoining what ſhould be conſidered as inſeparable. And there is not a more common juſtification of that idle and diſſipated manner in which the ſecond half of the Sunday is commonly ſpent, even
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:029103_0078_0FDF9BA3C73B8060"/>
by thoſe who make a conſcience of ſpending the former part properly, than that, "now they have done their duty, they may take their pleaſure."</p>
               <p>But while chriſtian obſervances are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as taſks, which are to be got over to entitle us to ſomething more pleaſant; as a burthen which we muſt endure in order to propitiate an inexorable Judge who makes a hard bargain with his creatures, and allows them juſt ſo much amuſement in pay for ſo much drudgery; we muſt not wonder that ſuch low views are entertained of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that a religious life is reprobated as ſtrict and rigid.</p>
               <p>But to him who acts from the nobler mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of love, and the animating power of the chriſtian hope, the exerciſe is the reward, the permiſſion is the privilege, the work is the wages. <hi>He</hi> does not carve out ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable pleaſure, and ſtipulate for ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre diverſion, to pay himſelf for the hard per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his duty, who in that very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance experiences the higheſt pleaſure, and feels the trueſt gratification of which his nature is capable.</p>
               <p>This reprobated ſtrictneſs therefore, ſo far from being the ſource of diſcomfort and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, as is pretended, is in reality the true cauſe of actual enjoyment, by laying the axe to the root of all thoſe turbulent and uneaſy paſſions, the unreſerved and yet imperfect gratification of which does ſo much more
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:029103_0079_0FDF9BEB84F4CC80"/>
tend to diſturb our happineſs than that ſelf-government chriſtianity enjoins.</p>
               <p>But all precepts ſeem rigorous, all obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances are really hard, where there is not an entire conviction of God's right to our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and an internal principle of faith and love to make that obedience pleaſant. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious life is indeed a hard bondage to one immerſed in the practices of the world, the fleſh, and the faſhion. To a perfect chriſtian, it is "perfect freedom." He does not now abſtain from ſuch and ſuch things, merely becauſe they are forbidden (as he did in the firſt ſtages of his progreſs,) but becauſe his ſoul has no longer any pleaſure in them. And it would be the ſevereſt of all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to oblige him to return to thoſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, from which he once abſtained with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and through the leſs noble principle of fear.</p>
               <p>There is not therefore perhaps a greater miſtake than that common notion entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the more orderly part of the faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world, that a little religion will make peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple happy, but that an high degree of it is incompatible with all enjoyment. For ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>that</hi> religion can add little to a man's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which reſtrains him from the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a wrong action, but which does not pretend to extinguiſh the bad principle from which the act proceeded. A religion which ties the hands, without changing the heart; which, like the hell of Tantalus, ſubdues not
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:029103_0080_0FDF9BA5852FC628"/>
the deſire, yet forbids the gratification, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an uncomfortable ſtate. Such a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though it may gain a man ſomething on the ſide of reputation, will give him but little inward comfort, if his heart be ſtill left a prey to that temper which produced the evil, even though terror or ſhame may have prevented the outward act.</p>
               <p>That people devoted to the purſuits of a diſſipated life ſhould conceive of religion as a difficult and even unattainable ſtate, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to believe. That they ſhould conceive of it as an unhappy ſtate, is the conſummation of their error and ignorance: for that a <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal</hi> being ſhould have his underſtanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened; that an <hi>immortal</hi> being ſhould have his views extended and enlarged; that a <hi>help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> being ſhould have a conſciouſneſs of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; a <hi>ſinful</hi> being the proſpect of pardon; or a <hi>fallen</hi> one the aſſurance of reſtoration, does not ſeem a probable ground of unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and on any other ſubject ſuch reaſoning would not be admiſſible.</p>

               <head>CHAP VI. A ſtranger, from obſerving the faſhionable mode of life, would not take this to be a chriſtian country.—Lives of profeſſing chriſtians exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by a compariſon with the Goſpel.— Chriſtianity not made the rule of life, even by thoſe who profeſs to receive it as an object of faith.—Temperizing divines contribute to low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the credit of chriſtianity.—Looſe harangues on morals not calculated to reform the heart.</head>
               <p>THE chriſtian religion is not intended, as ſome of its faſhionable profeſſors ſeem to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to operate as a charm, a taliſman, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation; and to produce its effect by our pronouncing certain myſtical words, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at certain conſecrated places, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming certain hallowed ceremonies: but it is an active, vital, influential principle, operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the heart, reſtraining the deſires, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the general conduct, and as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating our commerce with the world, our buſineſs, pleaſures, and enjoyments, our converſations, deſigns and actions, as our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in public worſhip, or even in private devotion.</p>

life is utterly deſtructive of ſeriouſneſs. To inſtance only in one particular amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is generally thought inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, and is in effect ſo vapid, that one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wonders how it can be dangerous: it would excite laughter, becauſe we are ſo broke into the habit, were I to inſiſt on the immorality of paſſing one's whole life in a crowd. But thoſe promiſcuous myriads which compoſe the ſociety, falſely ſo called, of the gay world; who are brought together without eſteem, remain without pleaſure, and part without regret; who live in a round of diverſions, the poſſeſſion of which is ſo joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, though the abſence is ſo inſupportable, theſe, by the mere force of inceſſant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminate aſſociation, weaken, and in time wear out, the beſt feelings and affections of the human heart. And the mere ſpirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation, thus contracted from invariable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, even detached from all its concomitant evils, is in itſelf as hoſtile to a religious ſpirit, as more poſitive and actual offences. Far be it from me to ſay that it is as criminal; I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſt that it is as oppoſite to that heavenly mindedneſs which is the eſſence of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian temper.</p>
               <p>We know that in the mingled maſs which celebrate the orgies of diſſipation, are many amiable and well-inclined hearts, whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the tyranny of faſhion could have driven thither. But let us ſuppoſe an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unprejudiced ſpectator, who ſhould
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029103_0083_0FDF9BEF6DD5BFD8"/>
have been taught the theory of all the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the globe, brought hither from the other hemiſphere. Set him down in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteſt part of our capital, and let him deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, if he can, except from what he ſhall ſee interwoven in the texture of our laws, and kept up in the ſervice of our churches, to what particular religion we belong. Let him not mix entirely with the moſt flagitious, but only with the moſt faſhionable; at leaſt, let him keep what they themſelves call <hi>the beſt company.</hi> Let him ſcrutinize into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, cuſtoms, converſations, habits, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, moſt in vogue, and then infer what is the eſtabliſhed religion of the land.</p>
               <p>That it could not be the Jewiſh, he would ſoon diſcover; for of rites, ceremonies, and external obſervances, he would trace but ſlender remains. He would be equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it could not be the religion of old Greece and Rome; for that enjoined re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the gods, and inculcated obedience to the laws. His moſt probable concluſion would be in favour of the Mahometan faith, did not the exceſſive indulgence of ſome of the moſt diſtinguiſhed, in an article of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance prohibited even by the ſenſual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of Arabia, defeat that conjecture.</p>
               <p>How would the petrified enquirer be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, if he were told that all theſe were of a religion meek, ſpiritual, ſelf-denying; of which poverty of ſpirit, a renewed mind,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029103_0084_0FDF9BA969B38598"/>
and non-conformity to the world, were ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific diſtinctions!</p>
               <p>When he ſaw the ſons of men of fortune, ſcarcely old enough to be ſent to ſchool, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be ſpectators of the turbulent and unnatural diverſions of racing and gaming; and the almoſt infant daughters, even of wiſe and virtuous mothers (an innovation which faſhion herſelf forbad till now,) carried with moſt unthrifty anticipation to the frequent and late-protracted ball; would he believe that we were of a religion which has requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from theſe very parents, a ſolemn vow that theſe children ſhould be bred up "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord?"</p>
               <p>When he beheld thoſe nocturnal clubs, ſo ſubverſive of private virtue and domeſtic hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, would he conceive that we were of a religion which in expreſs terms "exhorts young men to be ſober-minded?"</p>
               <p>When he ſaw thoſe magnificent and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illuminated ſtructures which decorate and diſgrace the very precincts of the royal reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (ſo free itſelf from all theſe pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;) when he beheld the nightly offerings made to the demon of play, on whoſe cruel altar the fortune and happineſs of wives and children are offered up without remorſe; would he not conclude that we were of ſome of thoſe barbarous religions which enjoin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſacrifices, and whoſe horrid deities are appeaſed with nothing leſs than human victims? If any thing could add to his aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029103_0085_0FDF9BF473E124A8"/>
it muſt be to obſerve, in ſome more private temples of this demon, that the fair ſacrifice is often a voluntary one, ſelf-offered, and at once both prieſteſs and victim.</p>
               <p>Now, ought we not to pardon our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary ſpectator, if he ſhould not at once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that all the various deſcriptions of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, above noticed, profeſſed the chriſtian religion; ſuppoſing him to have no other way of determining but by the conformity of their manners to that rule by which he had undertaken to judge them? We indeed our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves muſt judge with greater latitude, and candidly take the preſent ſtate of ſociety into the account; which, in ſome few inſtances perhaps, muſt be allowed to diſpenſe with that literal ſtrictneſs, which more peculiarly belonged to the firſt ages of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But as this is really a chriſtian country, profeſſing to enjoy the pureſt faith in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt form; it cannot be unreaſonable to go a little farther, and enquire whether chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, however firmly eſtabliſhed, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſed in it, is really practiſed by that order of faſhionable perſons, who, while they are abſorbed in the delights of the world, and their whole ſouls devoted to the purſuit of pleaſure, yet ſtill arrogate to themſelves the honourable name of chriſtians, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally teſtify their claim to this high cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, by a general profeſſion of their belief in, and a decent compliance with, the forms of religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="unknown:029103_0086_0FDF9BAFAF422CD0"/>
This enquiry muſt be made, not by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the ſtate of chriſtianity in other countries (a mode always fallacious, whether adopted by nations or individuals, is that of comparing themſelves with thoſe who are ſtill worſe;) nor muſt it be made from any notions drawn from cuſtom, decency, or any other human ſtandard; but from a ſcripture view of what real religion is; from any one of thoſe ſtriking and comprehenſive repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of it, which may be found condenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſo many ſingle paſſages of the ſacred writings.</p>
               <p>Whoever then looks into the Book of God, and obſerves its prevailing ſpirit, and then looks into that part of the world under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, will not ſurely be thought very cenſorious, if he pronounce that the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between them does not ſeem to be <hi>very</hi> ſtriking; and that the one does not very evidently appear to be dictated by the other. Will he diſcover that the chriſtian religion is ſo much as pretended to be made the <hi>rule of life,</hi> even by that decent order who profeſs not to have diſcarded it as an object of faith? Do even the more regular, who neglect not public obſervances, conſider chriſtianity as <hi>the meaſure of their actions</hi>? Do even what the <hi>world</hi> calls religious perſons employ their time, their abilities, and their fortune, as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents for which they however confeſs they believe themſelves accountable: or do they in any reſpect live, I will not ſay up to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029103_0087_0FDF9BF6C21B8148"/>
(for what human being does ſo?) but in any conſiſtency with it, or even with an eye to its predominant tendencies? Do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in general of this deſcription ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the peculiar doctrines of the Goſpel as any thing more than a form of words, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary indeed to be repeated, and proper to be believed? But do they conſider them as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be adopted into a governing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of action?</p>
               <p>Is it conſiſtent to declare in the ſolemn aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies that they are "miſerable offenders," and that "there is no health in them," and never in their daily lives to diſcover any ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of that humility which ſhould naturally be implied in ſuch a declaration?</p>
               <p>Is it reaſonable, or conſiſtent with good ſenſe, earneſtly to lament having "followed the deſires of their own hearts," and then deliberately to plunge into ſuch a torrent of diſſipations as clearly indicates that they do not ſtruggle to reſiſt <hi>one</hi> of them? I dare not ſay this is hypocriſy, but ſurely it is inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</p>
               <p>"Be ye not conformed to this world," is a leading principle in the book they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as their guide. But after unreſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly aſſenting to this, as a doctrinal truth, at church; how abſurd would they think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one who ſhould expect them to adopt it into their practice! Perhaps the whole law of God does not exhibit a ſingle precept more expreſsly, more ſteadily, and more uniformly
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029103_0088_0FDF9C1A5F354200"/>
rejected. If it mean any thing, it can hardly be conſiſtent with that mode of life emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now would it be much more abſurd (for any other reaſon but becauſe it is not the cuſtom) if our legiſlators were to meet one day in every week, gravely to read over all the obſolete ſtatutes, and reſcinded acts of parliament; than it is for the order of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the above deſcription to aſſemble eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sunday, to profeſs their belief in, and ſubmiſſion to, a ſyſtem of principles, which they do not ſo much as <hi>intend</hi> ſhall be bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their practice?</p>
               <p>But to continue our enquiry.—There is not a more common or more intelligible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of human duty, than that of "Fear God, and keep his commandments." Now, as to the firſt of theſe inſeparable precepts, can we, with the utmoſt ſtretch of charity, be very forward to conclude that God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally "very greatly feared," in ſecret, by thoſe who give too manifeſt indications that they live "without him in the world? And as to the latter precept, which naturally grows out of the other—without noticing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the flagrant breaches of the moral law, let us only confine ourſelves to the allowed, general, and notorious violation of the fourth commandment, and then enquire what apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy can be offered for this, by believers at leaſt, who ſcruple not to allow the authority
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029103_0089_0FDF9C0E670FF060"/>
of that book, which declares, among many other alarming denunciations, that the wilful and habitual offender in any one point is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the breach of the whole law.</p>
               <p>Shall we have reaſon to change our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, if we take another divine repreſentation of the ſum and ſubſtance of religion, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it as a touchſtone in the preſent trial— "Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c. and thy neighbour as thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?" Now, judging by inference, do we ſee many public proofs of that heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which would be the inevitable effect of ſuch a fervent and animated dedication of all the powers, faculties, and affections of the ſoul to him who gave it? And, as to the great rule of ſocial duty expreſſed in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond clauſe, do we obſerve very much of that conſiderate kindneſs, that pure diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtedneſs, that conſcientious attention to the comfort of others, eſpecially of dependants and inferiors, which might be expected from thoſe who enjoy the privilege of ſo unerring a ſtandard of conduct? a ſtandard which, if impartially conſulted, muſt make our kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to others bear an exact proportion to our ſelf-love: a rule in which chriſtian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, operating on human ſenſibility, could not fail to decide aright in every ſuppoſable caſe. For no man can doubt how he ought to act towards another, while the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuggeſtions of conſcience and feeling concur in letting him know how he would
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029103_0090_0FDF6D2D590793D8"/>
wiſh, in a change of circumſtances, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould act towards him.</p>
               <p>Or ſuppoſe we take a more detailed ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, by a third rule, which indeed is not ſo much the principle as the effect of piety.— "True religion, and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to viſit the fatherleſs and widows in their affliction, and to keep himſelf <hi>unſpotted from the world.</hi>" Now if chriſtianity inſiſts that obedience to the latter injunction be the true evidence of the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe who fulfil the former, is the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the faſhionable world <hi>very</hi> ſtrikingly illuſtrated by this ſpotleſs purity, this exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the pollutions of the world, which is here declared to be its infallible ſymptom?</p>
               <p>But if I were to venture to take my eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with a view more immediately evangel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical; if I preſumed to look for that genuine chriſtianity which conſiſts in "repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt," to inſiſt that, whatever <hi>natural</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and <hi>faſhionable</hi> religion may teach, it is the peculiarity of the <hi>chriſtian</hi> religion to humble the ſinner and exalt the Saviour; to inſiſt that not only the groſsly flagitious, but that <hi>all,</hi> have ſinned; that <hi>all</hi> are by nature in a ſtate of condemnation; that <hi>all</hi> ſtand in need of mercy, of which there is no hope but on the Goſpel terms; that eternal life is promiſed to thoſe <hi>only</hi> who accept it on the offered conditions of "faith, repentance, and renewed obedience,"—if I were to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029103_0091_0FDF9C114584DF50"/>
on ſuch evidences of our chriſtianity as theſe; if I were to expreſs theſe doctrines in plain ſcriptural terms, without lowering, qualifying, diſguiſing, or doing them away; if I were to inſiſt on this belief, and its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and correſponding practices; I am aware that, with whatever condeſcending pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience this little tract might have been ſo far peruſed, many a faſhionable reader would here throw it aſide, as having now detected the palpable enthuſiaſt, the abettor of "ſtrange doctrines," long ago conſigned over by the liberal and the polite to bigots and fanatic. And yet, if the Bible be true, this is a ſimple and faithful deſcription of chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>After having, however, juſt ventured to hint that ſuch are indeed the humbling doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the Goſpel, to which alone eternal life is promiſed; I ſhall, in deep humility, forbear enlarging on this part of the ſubject, which has been exhauſted by the labours of wiſe and pious men in all ages. Unhappily, however, the moſt awakening of theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not the favourite gueſts in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets of the more faſhionable chriſtians; who, when they happen to be more ſeriouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed than ordinary, are fond of finding out ſome middle kind of reading, which recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends ſome half-way ſtate, ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween paganiſm and chriſtianity, ſuſpending the mind, like the poſition of Mahomet's tomb, between earth and heaven: a kind of
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:029103_0092_0FDF9BF8726CC488"/>
reading which, while it quiets the conſcience by being on the ſide of morals, neither awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens their fears, nor alarms their ſecurity. By dealing in general, it comes home to the hearts of none; it flatters the paſſions of the reader, by aſcribing high merit to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of certain right actions, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance from certain wrong ones; among which, that reader muſt be very unlucky in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed who does not find ſome performances and ſome forbearances of his own. It at once enables him to keep heaven in his eye, and the world in his heart. It agreeably repreſents the readers to themſelves as amiable perſons; guilty indeed of a few faults, but never as condemned ſinners under ſentence of death. It commonly abounds with high encomiums on the dignity of human nature; the good effects of virtue on health, fortune, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; the dangers of a blind zeal, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of enthuſiaſm, and the folly of being "righteous over much;" with various other kindred ſentiments, which, if they do not fall in of themſelves with the corruptions of our nature may, by a little warping, be eaſily accommodated to them.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the too ſucceſsful practices of lukewarm and temporizing divines, who have become popular by blunting the edge of that heavenly tempered weapon, whoſe ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary keenneſs, but for their "deceitful hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling," would oftener "pierce to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit."</p>

But thoſe ſeverer preachers of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who diſguſt by applying too cloſely to the conſcience; who probe the inmoſt heart, and lay open all its latent peccancies; who treat of principles as the only certain ſource of manners; who lay the axe to the root, oftener than the pruning knife to the branch; who inſiſt much and often on the great lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truths, that man is a fallen creature, who muſt be reſtored, if he be reſtored at all, by means very little flattering to human pride —ſuch as theſe will ſeldom find acceſs to the houſes and hearts of the more modiſh chriſtians; unleſs they happen to owe their admiſſion to ſome ſubordinate quality of ſtyle; unleſs they can captivate, with the ſeducing graces of language, thoſe well-bred readers, who are childiſhly amuſing themſelves with the garniſh, when they are periſhing for want of food; who are ſearching for poliſhed periods, when they ſhould be in queſt of alarming truths; who are looking for elegance of compoſition, when they ſhould be anxious for eternal life.</p>
               <p>Whatever comparative praiſe may be due to the former claſs of writers, when viewed with others of a leſs decent order, yet I am not ſure whether ſo many books of frigid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, exhibiting ſuch inferior motives of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch moderate repreſentations of duty, have not done religion much more harm than good; whether they do not lead many a reader to enquire what is the loweſt degree
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029103_0094_0FDF9BFAA7829408"/>
in the ſcale of virtue with which he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf, ſo as barely to eſcape eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; how much indulgence he may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low himſelf, without abſolutely forfeiting his chance of ſafety; what is the uttermoſt verge to which he may venture of this world's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, and yet juſt keep within a poſſibility of hope for the next: adjuſting the ſcales of indulgence and ſecurity with ſuch a ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous equilibrium, as not to loſe much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet not incur much penalty.</p>
               <p>This is hardly an exaggerated repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and to theſe low views of duty is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing ſo much of that bare-weight virtue with which even chriſtians are ſo apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves: fighting for every inch of ground which may poſſibly be taken within the pales of permiſſion; and ſtretching thoſe pales to the utmoſt edge of that limitation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which the world and the Bible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
               <p>But while the nominal chriſtian is perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelf that there can be no harm in going <hi>a little farther,</hi> the real chriſtian is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways afraid of going too far. While the one is debating for a little more diſputed ground, the other is ſo fearful of ſtraying into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of unallowed indulgence, that he keeps at a prudent diſtance from the extremity of his permitted limits, and is as anxious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricting as the other is in extending them. One thing is clear, and it may be no bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication by which to diſcover the ſtate of a
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:029103_0095_0FDF9C18A83578E8"/>
man's heart to himſelf: while he is contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this allowance, and ſtipulating for the other indulgence, it will ſhew him that, whatever change there may be in his life, there is none in his heart; the temper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains as it did; and it is by the inward frame rather than the outward act, that he can beſt judge of his <hi>own</hi> ſtate, whatever may be the rule by which he undertakes to judge of that of another.</p>
               <p>It is leſs wonderful that there are not more chriſtians, than that chriſtians, as they are called, are not better men: for if chriſtianity be not true, the motives to virtue are not high enough to quicken ordinary men to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extraordinary exertions. We ſee them do and ſuffer every day, for popularity, for cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, for faſhion, for the point of honour, not only more than good men do and ſuffer for religion, but a great deal more than reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion requires them to do. For her <hi>reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice</hi> demands no ſacrifices but what are ſanctified by good ſenſe, ſound policy, right reaſon, and uncorrupt judgment.</p>
               <p>Many of theſe faſhionable profeſſors even go ſo far as to bring their right faith as an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for their wrong practice. They have a commodious way of intrenching themſelves within the ſhelter of ſome general poſition of unqueſtionable truth. Even the great chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian hope, becomes a ſnare to them. They apologize for a life of offence, by taking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in the ſupreme goodneſs they are abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:029103_0096_0FDF9C0048932508"/>
That "God is all merciful," is the common reply to thoſe who hint to them their danger. This is a falſe and fatal appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a divine and comfortable truth. Nothing can be more certain than the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, nor more deluſive than the inference: for their deduction implies, not that he is merciful to ſin repented of, but to ſin conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in. But it is a moſt fallacious hope to expect that God will violate his own cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or that he is indeed "all mercy," to the utter excluſion of his other attributes of perfect holineſs, purity, and juſtice.</p>
               <p>It is a dangerous folly to reſt on theſe vague and general notions of uncovenanted mercy; and nothing can be more deluſive than this indefinite truſt in being forgiven in our <hi>own</hi> way, after God has clearly revealed to us that he will only forgive us in <hi>his</hi> way.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, no one does truly truſt in God, who does not endeavour to obey him. For to break his laws, and yet to depend on his favour; to live in oppoſition to his will, and yet in expectation of his mercy; to viol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his commands, and yet look for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, would not, in any other inſtance, be thought a reaſonable ground of conduct; and yet it is by no means as uncommon as it is inconſiſtent.</p>
               <p>But the life of a diſſipated chriſtian ſeems to be a perpetual ſtruggle to reconcile impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities: it is an endeavour to unite what God has for ever ſeparated, peace and ſin;

unchriſtian practices with chriſtian obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; a quiet conſcience and a diſorderly life; a heart full of this world, and an unfounded dependance on the happineſs of the next.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. View of theſe who acknowledge chriſtianity as a perfect ſyſtem of morals, but deny its divine authority—Morality not the whole of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</head>
               <p>AS in the preceding chapter notice was taken of that deſcription of perſons who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to receive chriſtianity with great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as a matter of faith, who yet do not pretend to adopt it as a rule of conduct; I ſhall conclude theſe ſlight remarks with ſome ſhort animadverſions on another ſet of men, and that not a ſmall one, among the decent and the faſhionable, who profeſs to think it exhibits an admirable ſyſtem of morals, while they deny its divine authority; though that alone can make the neceſſity of obeying its precepts binding on the conſciences of men.</p>
               <p>This is a very diſcreet ſcheme: for ſuch perſons at once ſave themſelves from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit of having their underſtanding impoſed upon by a ſuppoſed blind ſubmiſſion to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and authorities; and yet, prudently enough, ſecure to themſelves in no ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the reputation of good men. By ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this middle kind of courſe, they contrive to be reckoned liberal by the <hi>philoſophers,</hi> and decent by the believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:029103_0099_0FDF9C1C961C4B28"/>
But we are not commonly to expect to ſee the pure morality of the Goſpel very carefully transfuſed into the lives of ſuch objectors. And indeed it would be unjuſt to imagine that the precepts <hi>ſhould</hi> be moſt ſcrupulouſly obſerved by thoſe who reject the authority. The influence of divine truth, muſt neceſſarily beſt prepare the heart for an unreſerved obedience to its laws. If we do not depend on that pardon and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which chriſtianity offers, we ſhall want the beſt motive to the actions and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances which it enjoins. A lively belief <hi>muſt</hi> therefore precede a very hearty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete obedience. We are told, on the very beſt authority, that truth ſanctifies the heart: and the ſame authority adds, that, the "word of God is truth." That cammand therefore, for inſtance, to ſet "our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on things above," will operate but faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till that ſpirit from which the command proceeds, touches the heart, and convinces it that no human good is worthy of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire affection of an immortal creature. An unreſerved faith in the promiſer muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede our worthy performance of any duty to which the promiſe is annexed.</p>
               <p>But as to a ſet of duties enforced by no other motive than a bare acquieſcence in their beauty, and a cold conviction of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, but impelled by no obedience to his authority who impoſes them; though we know not how well they might be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029103_0100_0FDF9C0466227B50"/>
by pure and impeccable beings, yet we know how they commonly <hi>are</hi> performed by frail and diſorderly creatures, fallen from their innocence, and corrupt in their very natures.</p>
               <p>Beſides, nothing but a conviction of the truth of chriſtianity can reconcile thinking beings to the extraordinary appearances of things in the Creator's moral government of the world. The works of God are an enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, of which his word alone is the ſolution. The dark veil which is thrown over the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpenſations in this lower world, muſt naturally ſhock thoſe who conſider only the ſingle ſcene which is acting on the preſent ſtage; but is reconcileable to him who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learnt from revelation the nature of the laws by which the great Author acts, truſts confidently that the cataſtrophe will ſet all to rights. The confuſion which ſin and the paſſions have introduced; the triumph of wickedneſs, the ſeemingly arbitrary diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of human conditions, accountable on no ſcheme but that which the Goſpel has opened to us—have all a natural tendency to withdraw from the love of God the hearts of thoſe who erect themſelves into critics on the divine conduct, and yet will not ſtudy the plan, and get acquainted with the rules, ſo far as it has pleaſed the Supreme Diſpoſer to reveal them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:029103_0101_0FDF9C20C81D1E30"/>
Till therefore the word of God is uſed as "a lamp to their paths," men can neither truly diſcern the crookedneſs of their own ways, nor the perfection of that light by which they are directed to walk. And this light can only be ſeen by its own proper brightneſs; it has no other medium. Till therefore "the ſecret of the Lord" is with men, they will not truly "fear him;" till he has "enlarged their hearts" with the knowledge and belief of his word, they will not very vigorouſly "run the way of his commandments." Till they have acquired that "faith without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God," they will not attain that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without which no man can ſee him.</p>
               <p>And indeed if God has thought ſit to make the goſpel an inſtrument of ſalvation, we muſt own the neceſſity of receiving it as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, before it is likely to operate very effectually on the conduct. The great Creator, if we may judge by analogy from natural things, is ſo wiſe an oeconomiſt, that he always adapts, with the moſt accurate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, the inſtrument to the work; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laviſhes more means than are neceſſary to accompliſh the propoſed end. If therefore chriſtianity had been intended for nothing more than a mere ſyſtem of ethics, ſuch a ſyſtem ſurely might have been produced at an infinitely leſs expence.

of ſaints, to ſay nothing of the great and coſtly ſacrifice which the goſpel records, might ſurely have been ſpared. Leſſons of mere human virtue might have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by ſome ſuitable inſtrument of human wiſdom, ſtrengthened by the viſible autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of human power. A bare ſyſtem of morals might have been communicated to mankind with a more reaſonable proſpect of advantage, by means not ſo repugnant to human pride. A mere ſcheme of conduct might have been delivered, with far greater probability of ſucceſs, by Antoninus the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, or Plato the philoſopher, than by Paul the tent-maker, of Peter the fiſherman.</p>
               <p>Chriſtianity, then, muſt be embraced en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, if it be received at all. It muſt be taken, without mutilation, as a perfect ſcheme, in the way in which God has been pleaſed to reveal it. It muſt be accepted, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> exhibiting beautiful parts, but as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting one conſummate whole, of which the perfection ariſes from coherence and dependence, from relation and conſiſtency. Its power will be weakened, and its energy deſtroyed, if every caviller pulls out a pin, or obſtructs a ſpring, with the preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous view of new modelling the divine work, and making it go to his own mind. There is no breaking this ſyſtem into portions of which we are at liberty to chooſe one, and reject another. There is no ſeparating the evidences from the doctrines, the doctrines

from the precepts, belief from obedience, morality from piety, the love of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour from the love of God. If we profeſs chriſtianity at all, if we allow the Divine Author to be indeed unto us "wiſdom and righteouſneſs," he muſt be alſo "ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and redemption."</p>
               <p>Chriſtianity, then, is aſſuredly ſomething more than a mere ſet of rules; and piety, though it never pretended to be the ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute for a good life, is indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to its acceptance with God. The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel never offers to make religion ſuperſede morality, but every where clearly proves that morality is not the whole of religion. Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not only neceſſary as a <hi>means,</hi> but is itſelf a moſt important <hi>end.</hi> It is not only the beſt principle of moral conduct, but is an indiſpenſable and abſolute duty in itſelf. It is not only the higheſt motive to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of virtue, but is a prior obligation; and abſolutely neceſſary, even when detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its immediate influence on practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal goodneſs. Religion will ſurvive all the virtues of which it is the ſource; for we ſhall be living in the nobleſt exerciſes of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when we ſhall have no objects on which to exerciſe many human virtues. When there will be no diſtreſs to be relieved, no injuries to be forgiven, no evil habits to be ſubdued; there will be a Creator to be bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and adored, a Redeemer to be loved and praiſed.</p>

Benevolence allowed to be the reigning virtue, but not <hi>excluſively</hi> the virtue of the preſent age. Benevolence not the whole of religion, though one of its moſt characteriſtic features. Whether benevolence proceed from a religious principle, will be more infallibly known by the general diſpoſition of time, fortune, and the common habits of life, than from a few oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional acts of bounty. 17</item>

The negligent conduct of chriſtians, no real ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt chriſtianity.—The reaſon why its effects are not more manifeſt to worldly men, is, becauſe believers do not lead chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an lives.—Profeſſors differ but little in their practice from unbelievers.—Even real chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are too diffident and timid, and afraid of acting up to their principles.—The abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the charge commonly brought againſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people, that they are too ſtrict. 62</item>
