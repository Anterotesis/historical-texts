            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Advantages <hi>and</hi> Diſadvantages OF THE MARRIAGE-STATE, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SINCE Viſion and Prophecy are ſealed up, and no Man has Liberty to add any Thing to the Words of the Book of the Revelation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> all Dreams, Omens, Signs, Tokens, pretended Viſions, and Revelations, or any kind of Prognoſtications whatſoever, and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon them, are to be eſteemed nothing at all but Deluſions of the Devil; whereby the Prince of Darkneſs deceives weak Minds, who are ſeeking more after the Chaff than the Wheat.</p>
            <p>But tho' the moſt High God ſeverely reproves all ſuch as pretend to Predictions or Knowledge of Secrets, by Interpretations of Dreams; yet as Men dream, they may lawfully tell their Dreams to one another, without any Deſign to deceive by them. I ſhall therefore take Liberty to relate the following one.</p>
            <p>I fancied myſelf travelling in the Eaſtern Parts of the World; and, at laſt, coming to the City
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040891_0004_101A0B95DA8F02E0"/>of <hi>Old Babylon,</hi> where I was much amuſed in view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Curioſities of the Place, as the Tower, the Wall, the Gates, the Streets, the Palace, the River, the Images in the Plain of <hi>Dura, &amp;c.</hi> I obſerved the City, and it appeared in different Views. In one Part the People were entirely taken up in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellings, Feaſtings, Diverſions, ſplendid Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and enjoying themſelves. In the other Part they were more reſerved, and were much taken up in a demure Dreſs and Behaviour; in the Decency of their Houſes and Streets, and in the Regularity of their Towers and Fortifications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But without any Appearance of Dangers, Alarms, or Moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they ſeemed all entirely at Eaſe.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, when I had almoſt ſatiated myſelf with gazing at the particular Shows; I thought to take a Proſpect of the whole City together. So I walk'd to a riſing Ground belonging to it, but a little retired from the Croud; where I ſaw a Booth, which I took to be built on purpoſe for the Conveniency of taking Proſpects, and I went directly to it; and at the Door I ſaw an old Man, of whom I enquir'd if he had ever a Proſpect-Glaſs, whereby I might be favour'd with a full View of that royal City, which I ſuppoſed to be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of the World. He told me if I pleaſed to take a deliberate Obſervation, I might perhaps have different Apprehenſions of that ſplendid City, than I had at preſent. For he aſſured me it was ſo full of inteſtine Perplexity, cauſed by Envy, Malice, Exceſs, and Corruption, that the Inhabitants had no real Satisfaction in themſelves; and it was only by thoſe Extravagancies and Amuſements which
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:040891_0005_101A0B97A24A1B50"/>had ſeen, they kept themſelves from perpetual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſtraction. He then fetch'd out his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tective, and told me if I pleas'd he would ſhew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the Situation of the Place; whereby I might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e convinc'd that its Condition was not ſo happy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or its Glory ſo majeſtick as I imagined. So I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ook a diſtinct View on the South Side; and the Foundation of the Place appeared to be built upon nothing but Bogs and Quick-ſands, which could not poſſibly ſuſtain the Buildings; but ere long they muſt inevitably ſink. I again took a View on the North Side; and I found the Foundation was all bituminous and ſulphurous Matter, interſpers'd with ſubterraneous Fire, which appeared ready in a Moment to break forth into Flames. He then bid me look to the Eaſt; and I ſaw a very formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Army approaching the City, with full Power and Commiſſion to deſtroy it; and they ſpread themſelves around with Fury, like the roaring of the Sea. And there was a Trembling upon all the Hills, the Rivers, the Trees, and all the Fields round about; but all the Inhabitants of the City continued in a Stupefaction.</p>
            <p>When I had beheld and deliberated on theſe Things, it filled me with ſuch Aſtoniſhment as almoſt cauſed my Bowels to turn within me. Such was my Diſappointment, and the Horror that ſeized me, that I thought I was neither able to bear the Sight, nor fly from i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, nor ſtand my Ground. And I aſked the old Man if I might lodge all Night in that Booth. But he told me it was not a Place for Lodging, nor would any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his right Mind think it ſafe to ſleep ſo near
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:040891_0006_101A0B99451CD298"/>the City; but if I pleas'd, I might come in and reſt myſelf a little. And when I enter'd, I found four young Men very carefully peruſing a Map; ſeeming to make very particular Remarks, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Obſervations, and would ſome times earneſtly enquire the old Man's Judgment, to inform them of the Meaning of ſome Things. Whereupon I enquired what Piece it was that ſo much attracted their Attention. They told me it was the Map of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Canaan,</hi> with all the Roads between the two Places. And they having had a full Proſpect of the ſame Things which I had juſt now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held; and being determined to leave their native Country, and travel to the latter Place, was the Reaſon of their preſent Enquiries. And the old Man being a native of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and acquainted with both Countries, as well as the Roads from one to the other, they frequently applied to him for Inſtruction in Things difficult.</p>
            <p>Theſe four young Men appeared ſo like each other in their Apparel, their Speech, and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as well as ſome of their Features, that I verily took them all to have been own brothers; and knew not any thing to the contrary, until I became acquainted with a certain Perſon who had ſome Knowledge of the Places where they were born, and of the Regiſter-books. He informed me that two of them were Sons of the Bond-Woman, but the other two were Sons of the Free-Woman.</p>
            <p>So I obſerved them, and they all made Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſeeming vigorous Reſolution for their propoſed Journey. And amongſt other Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:040891_0007_101A0B9AF3890610"/>with the old Man (their Inſtructor) they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arneſtly crav'd his Advice, whether it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for each of them to take along with him a Female Companion? Which he very chearfully encourag'd them to do, provided they were ſuch as were diſpos'd to go the ſame Way, and had their Hearts engaged to ſeek the ſame Country along with them. But otherwiſe he admoniſhed them (by all Means) to avoid ſuch Companions as had no Knowledge of or Delight in the Way they deſigned to travel.</p>
            <p>He pointed out to them many Difficulties in the Way where the Company of Strangers would be of very dangerous Conſequence; told them the Need they would find of ſtrengthening and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging in the Way, rather than hindering and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging; and reaſon'd much upon the Evil that would attend (in many Reſpects) ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions as took no Delight in the Way; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it with the Advantages they might expect in the Company of ſuch as took Pleaſure, and would endeavour to animate them therein. He further informed them in many Inſtances, what bad Effects Travellers, who had formerly gone that Way, had found from diſagreable Companions. And that (to prevent the like Inconveniencies) the King of the Country had made a Law that none of his Subjects ſhould join with Strangers to be Companions in that Journey. And therefore he earneſtly caution'd (whatever they did) to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding careful in their Choice.</p>
            <p>I waited to ſee what Influence this Advice would have upon the Minds of theſe young Men.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040891_0006_101A0B99451CD298"/>But I obſerv'd, that (at the firſt) none of them ſeem'd to reliſh his Counſel; for they had all either contracted ſome Acquaintance with, or placed their Fancy upon Maids who were Natives of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> to whom their Hearts were very inclinable. But the more they appeared engaged in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, the more their Inſtructor inſiſted on the Dangers and pernicious Conſequences which were moſt certain to attend their having ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. And withal told them the King had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed one to attend them in their Journey, whoſe Name was <hi>Self-Denial,</hi> without whoſe Company it would be impoſſible ever to reach the Borders of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And that to chuſe a Stranger for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, would be ſuch an Inſult to him (at the firſt ſetting out) as might cauſe Miſunderſtanding all the Way. For his Part, he told them, that to pretend to travel to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to chooſe a <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> or a Companion, was ſuch a Contradiction, that he could not but very much doubt the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of their Hearts. For if it was poſſible at all for a ſincere Traveller to chooſe ſuch a Compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; (as he would not be too bold in his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) yet he was very certain it could not be ſo long as they continued in the right Uſe of their Reaſon. And he muſt diſcharge his Conſcience in giving them timely Admonition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I obſerved the Event of theſe Conſultations; and I found the eldeſt Son of the Bond-Woman could not be moved by all theſe Arguments. But reſolutely choſe one who was an utter Stranger to the Paths, nor hall any Delight or Deſire thereto. And when he had covenanted with her, ſhe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:040891_0006_101A0B99451CD298"/>proved ſo averſe to going along with him, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>uctant to his purſuing his intended Journey, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>at ſhe prevailed upon him to deſiſt from his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rpoſe. So he ſettled with her in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ey were both there when the City was deſtroy'd, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So, which Way the King diſpoſed of them afterwards, I never knew; but they never proſpered under his Care.</p>
            <p>Thus her Company never yielded him the leaſt Benefit or Aſſiſtance, through his whole Journey; but was an Allay to all his Joys, and an Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all his Sorrows.

Inſomuch, that many of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance greatly encouraged him, to purſue that Opportunity, and not neglect ſo valuable a Prize. This made him a little ſtagger; (for indeed ſhe wanted no Accomliſhment but he Language of <hi>Canaan</hi> to make her juſt ſuch an one, as his Heart could wiſh) and cauſed him to reaſon in his own Mind, with ſuch Interrogations and Replies, as theſe;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Can I expect to find an Object more deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or one more likely to be a happy Companion and a Help-meet?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> She may prove ſo to a Perſon who can be conformable to ſtay with her in <hi>Babylon;</hi> but as I am bound to another Country, I might find Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs in that which would appear Happineſs to another Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But have I not Reaſon to hope that a Perſon of her refined Qualities, may be indued with ſuch Bleſſings as to make her a ſuitable Companion for me in my Journey?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A Perſon may be accompliſhed with all the Refinements, Improvements, and Excellencies of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſo as to appear ſuperior to many of the Citizens; but if theſe be only the Accommodations of their own Country, they can only make a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Difference between them and the moſt abject Peaſants; whereas there is neceſſarily a ſpecifical Difference between a <hi>Babylonian</hi> and an <hi>Iſraelite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But is it not very cenſorious to look upon ſuch a becoming worthy Perſon, as no better than a meet <hi>Babylonian?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:040891_0010_101A0BA16A7AB5C8"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> Inaſmuch as the Difference is ſo great, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>

For we are not to form our Conceptions of them different to the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given by the King's Scribes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not exceeding hard that I muſt deny myſelf an Object ſo agreeable?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The King of Glory denies nothing that is good, therefore if it were really good, it would not be denied me; he only denies us thoſe Things which he knows would be evil, and it is a real Kindneſs to us to be denied of them. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I thought it a real Good; it is hard that he ſhould deny me one Favour, who has given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to me, with all Bleſſings in Heaven and Earth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What if I never find one ſo agreeable, who travels the happy Road?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If I had the Object now before me it muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſhould have any Enjoyment or not; and have I not more Reaſon to expect a Bleſſing in the right Way than in the wrong? Beſide, as no good Thing is withheld, nor any Thing denied, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut becauſe it is Evil; whatever God is pleaſed to beſtow in his own Way, muſt be moſt agreeable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> May not the valuable Qualifications attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Perſon, be ſo bleſſed as to be a Means to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:040891_0011_101A0BA35C4EE320"/>make me happy and uſeful in the Way, though ſhe walk not in it herſelf?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Have I any Reaſon to expect to be made happy by a Perſon who is an utter Stranger to thoſe Things wherein my Happineſs conſiſts? Or can I expect to find Uſefulneſs in this Way, from that which cannot be enjoyed or obtained without going out of the Way? Beſide, whatever Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations ſhe is endued with, or however valuable Accommodations ſhe is poſſeſſed of, it never will be her Inclination to employ thoſe Excellencies to aſſiſt others in a Way which ſhe herſelf hath no Delight in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But ſeeing her Diſpoſition is ſo agreeably complaiſant, and her Mind ſo well qualified with natural Virtues, and decorated with ſo many acquir'd Ornaments; is there any Reaſon to doubt but that a Perſon thus prepared will have a Taſte for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and embracing the beſt Things? And may I not therefore expect to be an Inſtrument to engage her Mind to walk the bleſſed way?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> All the Accompliſhments that a Perſon can poſſibly receive from <hi>Babylon,</hi> can never prepare, qualify, nor diſpoſe them for travelling to <hi>Canaan;</hi> nor will it by any Means induce or incline any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to receive the real Knowledge or Love of that Country. Therefore thoſe who are not powerfully called by the King's Commandment, and inwardly attracted by a vital Influence, can never be engaged by any other Motive or Perſuaſion whatſoever. For there is nothing in the Nature of a <hi>Babylonian</hi> (without the Inchoation of new Principles) that is capable of Attraction. But the more excellent her
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:040891_0011_101A0BA35C4EE320"/>Accompliſhments are, the more ſtrongly her Mind will be cemented to that Climate from whence ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eceived them. And on the other Hand, as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was a <hi>Babylonian,</hi> (though now bleſſed with new Principles) the old Tincture ſtill remains in my Nature, which (like ſo much Tinder) is ready <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o kindle with every Spark of <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Fire. Wherefore the greater Excellencies ſhe is embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with, the greater Influence it will have to draw me aſide into her Paths, and ſo put me in perpetual Danger. For of this I am infallibly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that they will draw away one's Heart.</p>
            <p>When he had thus reaſoned with himſelf, he made a full Pauſe; and appeared in a ſtrong Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Mind; and a Paleneſs aroſe in his Face. And I heard him ſigh, and ſay to himſelf, <q>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has my Mind been roving!</q> And trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, he lift up his Eyes to Heaven; and earneſtly cryed, <q>O God of all Grace, deliver me from Temptation!</q> And from that Time, he never would regard any of the Damſels of the City. But ſaid, He would wait till he ſhould find a true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; and till then he would walk alone.</p>
            <p>So he went on his Way, rejoicing that he had eſcaped the Snare; and carrying along with him, this Motto, "The Lord is my Portion;" enjoying great Satisfaction in his own Mind; ſaying to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, If my King ſees it good for me to walk alone, I know he will bleſs that State unto me; but if it be for my good to enjoy a Companion, I know his Goodneſs will provide one for me, without my going out of the Way to find one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:040891_0012_101A0BA59C5762E8"/>
But as he was thus going on his Way, he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a young Virgin, who was walking the ſame Road; and he begun to deſire to be favoured with her Company; but thought it adviſable to be very deliberate; becauſe many ſeem to walk the ſame Road, which only go Part of the Way, and then turn off into ſome other Path. Therefore he diligently obſerved, whether ſhe cloſely attended to the right Way. So he perceived her to take ſomething out of her Boſom, and diligently peruſe it for a while, and then put it into her Boſom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and purſue the ſtreight Path; whereupon he went up to her, and enquired where ſhe was bound. She told him ſhe was ſetting her Face towards <hi>Zion.</hi> He aſked her, what it was ſhe had been peruſing? And ſhe ſhewed him, that it was the Map of the Road; which ſhe took along with her, for her Guide. He then began to enquire further who ſhe was, and whence ſhe came; ſhe told him, ſhe was by Birth a <hi>Chaldean;</hi> by Education and Converſation a <hi>Babylonian;</hi> but the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſent for her, to go forth to ſeek a better Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He alſo aſked, what Expectations, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement ſhe had, in taking ſuch a Journey? ſhe told him, ſhe had the King's Word, to make her an Inhabitant in his royal Palace, when ſhe arrived at the upper <hi>Bethel;</hi> and to grant her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Defence, and Suſtenance, all the Way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He aſked, if ſhe could be fully ſatisfied in the King's Veracity? ſhe told him the Frauds, and Jealouſies of <hi>Babylon,</hi> had made ſuch Impreſſions upon her Mind; that ſhe had found it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to believe him that could not lie; but his
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:040891_0012_101A0BA59C5762E8"/>Majeſty had condeſcended to give her the ſtrongeſt Demonſtrations of his Fidelity; ſo that now ſhe was convinced, ſhe had no Reaſon to doubt his Goodneſs, for he had confirmed his Promiſe with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Oath, and had given her to ſee, that in his own Records, it was ſealed with Blood; and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Part he had written upon her Breaſt, and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in Characters of Life; and hitherto, ſhe had found his Word verified to her, in ſtrongly defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and abundantly ſupplying her; ſo that ſhe could ſet to her Seal, that he was true. Then, ſhe alſo aſked him divers Queſtions, relating to his Travels, and Enjoyments; and he likewiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her, in a free and ſatisfactory Manner. So that their Affections began to grow warm towards one another: It was a very comfortable Interview; and their Minds were refreſhed by each other's Converſation.</p>
            <p>And they appeared ſo agreable one to another, that he began to think they might be pleaſant &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Companions all the Way. But firſt, he retired for a while, to deliberate on the Converſation that had paſſed already. When the more he thought of her Diligence, in the Purſuit of her Journey; and her fixed Satisfaction concerning the End of it; her Underſtanding in thoſe Things laid down in the Map, for guiding her in the Way, and the Delight ſhe appeared to take in meditating on, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing about the Joys of the City of Habitation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the more he was ſatisfied that ſhe was a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's Daughter travelling to the royal Palace. And when he had lifted up his Eyes to Heaven, and earneſtly beſought the moſt High God for Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:040891_0013_101A0BA7DDA1C8F0"/>and a Bleſſing upon further Converſation, he came again into her Company. And after ſome further Diſcourſe, he aſked the Reaſon of her walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on her Journey alone? She told him ſhe found b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t few travelling the ſame Road; and ſhe did not think it expedient to turn aſide or neglect her Way for any Company in the World. If ſhe met with Company, ſuch as delighted in the Ways of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhe took Pleaſure therein; for by ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her Heart was refreſhed, and ſhe thought herſelf ſtrengthened in her Journey thereby. But otherwiſe ſhe choſe rather to be alone, at Leiſure to divert herſelf in examining her Map; viewing the Springs by the Way, with the Fruit Trees and ſweet Flowers; hearing the Singing of Birds; and meditating on the Glories of her Prince, and the Joys ſhe ſhould have in his Preſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that as Company was pleaſant when ſhe could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, the Delights in the Way ſupplied the want of Company when alone. And upon the Whole, ſhe neither was anxious to have Company, nor had any Averſion againſt it; her Deſire being to enjoy that only which might be moſt conducive to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her in the right Way.</p>
            <p>Then he propoſed, that ſince they had found each other's Converſation comfortable and uſeful, it was his Opinion, it might be for their mutual Advantage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>im it ſhould be eſteemed Honourable. So when theſe two Lovers met again and had deliberately conſulted between themſelves all ſuch Things as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hey conceived neceſſary relating to ſuch an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; and had duly conſidered the King's Statutes thereupon; and jointly petitioned his Majeſty's Preſence with them, and his Bleſſing on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir Undertaking, they joined Hands with great Satisfaction and Serenity of Mind; rejoicing to ſee themſelves preſerv'd from ſo many Snares, and thus happily joined together by a divine Hand.</p>
            <p>I then obſerved theſe two happy Companions, purſuing their Journey: And here I ſaw verified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n ancient Councel; [a Help-meet.] For they were ſincere Friends, pleaſant Companions, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Partners, and uſeful Aſſiſtants to each other. If they met with Difficulties by the Way, they would take each other by the Hand to ſupport them. In Dangers, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> would counſel, and ſtand by one another. In Sorrows, they would ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize, and comfort one another. If beſet with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, one would watch while the other ſlept. If one were ſick, the other would comfort with cordials. If one were indiſpoſed in Mind, the other
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:040891_0014_101A0BA9C4BA8688"/>would divert with ſome ſweet ſong, or Diſcourſe concerning the pleaſant Land. If one were at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Loſs, concerning any Part of the Way, the other would aſſiſt, in ſearching and explaining the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. If one were ready to turn aſide, the other would caution, and admoniſh of the Danger. If one were employed in any Service, the other would be ready to aſſiſt therein. If one found a refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spring by the Way, would call the other to come and drink. If one found any refreſhing Fruit, ſweet Spices, or delightful Flowers would pluck and bring to the other. If one heard any joyful Tidings, would come rejoicing and tell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he other. If one had any pleaſant Proſpects of the Kingdom, would endeavour to ſhew them to the other. If one was favoured with an Audiance of the King, would alſo remember and intercede for the other. And if one was bleſſed with any ſpecial Favours, the other would congratulate, and rejoice on the Occaſion. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I was convinced, That two are better than one; and yet it was very manifeſt, that they were no more Twain. For I knew not whether to call them two Souls dwelling in one Body, or one Soul inhabiting two Bodies; but it appear'd very conſpicuous that two were better than one.</p>
            <p>So I continued obſerving this united Pair advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in their Way; for they greatly contributed to help each other forward; many Difficulties they ſurmounted, and many rich Bleſſings they enjoyed as they travelled in the Way. At laſt they arrived at a pleaſant Hill in View of the Land of Promiſe, full of Delights, refreſhing Fruits, pure Streams,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:040891_0014_101A0BA9C4BA8688"/>and deſirable Entertainments. Here they firſt ſat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
