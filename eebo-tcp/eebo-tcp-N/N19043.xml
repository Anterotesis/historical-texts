            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>THY daughters, FOX, in former days</l>
                  <l>When they deſerv'd, contemn'd all praiſe;</l>

                  <l>A naked breaſt would terrify!</l>
                  <l>They held that wanton, gay attire,</l>
                  <l>Was fuel for laſcivious fire,</l>
                  <l>And valu'd more St. Paul's advice,</l>
                  <l>Which bade them ſeek the <hi>pearl of price.</hi>

               <p>HOW quick are the advances of time! The day is gone, almoſt as ſoon as dawned! The ſilent moments ſlip away inſenſibly! No thief ſteals more unperceived from the pillaged houſe. Wherever we are, however employed, time purſues his inceſſant courſe. Though we are liſtleſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory, the great meaſurer of our days paſſes on, in his unwearied career, and whirls our weeks, and months, and years away. Is it not then ſurpriſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrange, to hear ſome complain of the tediouſneſs of their time, and how heavy it hangs upon their hands? To ſee them contriving a variety of amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing artifices to accelerate its flight, and get rid of its burden. Why, thoughtleſs mortals! need you urge the headlong torrent? Your days are ſwifter than a poſt, which carrying diſpatches of the utmoſt importance, with unremitted ſpeed ſcours the road. They paſs away like the nimble ſhips, which have wind in their wings, and ſkim along the watery

plain. They haſten to their deſtined period with the rapidity of an eagle, which leaves the ſtormy blaſt behind her, while ſhe cleaves the air, and darts upon her prey.</p>
               <p>And, when it is gone, how ſhort it appears! When the fond eye beheld in perſpective, it ſeemed an extenſive plain; but on the retroſpective view, how wonderfully is the ſcene altered! The land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, large and ſpacious, which a warm fancy drew, brought to the teſt of cool experience, ſhrinks into a ſpan; juſt as the ſhores vaniſh, and mountains dwindle to a ſpot, when the ſailor, ſurrounded by ſkies and ocean, throws his laſt look on his native land.</p>
               <p>Shall we, then, be induſtrious to ſhorten what is no longer than a ſpan, or to quicken the pace of what is ever on the wing? Shall we ſquander away what is unutterably important, while it laſts; and when once departed, is altogether irrecoverable? Forbear the folly, forbear the deſperate extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. Shall we chide, as a loiterer, the arrow that boundeth from the ſtring; or ſweep away dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, as the refuſe of our houſes? How parſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſhould we be of our days; how carefully huſband our precious hours! They go indiſſolubly connected with happineſs or miſery. Improved, they are a ſure pledge of everlaſting glory; waſted, they are a ſad preface to never-ending confuſion and anguiſh. On theſe, therefore, our eternal all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. And will an affair of ſuch unſpeakable weight, admit of a moment's delay, or conſiſt with the leaſt remiſſneſs?—Eſpecially ſince much of our
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:024777_0060_0FC87DC0A8DD8088"/>
appointed time is already elapſed, and the remainder is all uncertainty.</p>
               <p>But, ſuppoſe we had made a covenant with the grave, and were aſſured of reaching the age of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſelah, how ſoon would even ſuch a leaſe expire! Let it be extended yet farther, and made co-exiſtent with nature itſelf; yet, how ſpeedily will the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of all things commence! For, yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, and the commiſſioned archangel will lift his hand to heaven, and ſwear by the Almighty name, "That time ſhall be no longer." The abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed opportunities will never return, and new oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities will never more be afforded. Then, ſhould negligent mortals wiſh ever ſo paſſionately, for a few moments only to be thrown back from opening eternity, thouſands of worlds would not be able to procure the grant.</p>
               <p>What inexpreſſible conſternation muſt overwhelm unthinking mortals, who have ſquandered their time in vice, when the general conflagration commences! That dreadful day will ſoon approach, "in which the heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; the earth alſo, and all the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up." That mighty hand, which once opened the windows from on high, and broke up the fountains of the great deep, will then unlock all the magazines of fire, and pour out a ſecond deluge upon the earth. The vengeful flames, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by the breath of the Almighty, will ſpread themſelves from the center to the circumference; nothing will withſtand their impetuoſity, nothing
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:024777_0061_0FC87DC2272ADEE8"/>
eſcape their rage. Magnificent palaces and ſolemn temples will be laid in aſhes: Spacious cities and impregnable towers buried in one ſmoaking maſs. Not only the productions of human art, but the works of almighty power, will be fuel for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring element. The mountains will melt, like the ſnows which cover their ſummits; and even the vaſt oceans ſerve only to augment the inconceivable rapidity and fury of the blaze.</p>
               <p>Theſe are events, the greatneſs of which nothing finite can meaſure. Such, as will cauſe whatever is conſiderable, or momentous, in the annals of all generations, to ſink into littleneſs and nothing. Events, big with the everlaſting fates of all the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and all the dead. We muſt ſee the graves cleaving, the ſea teeming, and ſwarms unſuſpected, crowds unnumbered, yea, multitudes of thronging nations riſing from both. We muſt ſee the world in flames; muſt ſtand at the diſſolution of all ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial things, and be attendants on the burial of nature. We muſt ſee the vaſt expanſe of the ſky wrapped up like a ſcroll, and the incarnate God iſſuing from light inacceſſible, with ten thouſand times ten thouſand angels, to judge both men and devils. We muſt ſee the curtain of time dropt, ſee all eternity diſcloſed to view, and enter upon a ſtate of being that will never have an end.</p>
               <p>Ought we not, therefore, to huſband well every moment of our time, and take heed to our ways? Is there an inquiry, is there a care of greater, of equal, of comparable importance? For, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,

               <head>ON THE WORLD.</head>
               <p>THIS World is like a Lottery, in which we muſt expect to meet with many unlucky chances.</p>
               <p>It is fancy, not the reaſon of things, that makes life ſo uneaſy to us as we find it. It is not the place, or the condition, but the mind alone, that can make any body happy or miſerable.</p>
               <p>When our eſtate in this world is perplexed and uncertain, we ſhould be more than ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to make ſure of ſomething, that we may not be miſerable in both worlds.</p>
               <p>A man cannot be truly happy here, without a well-grounded hope of being happy hereafter.</p>
               <p>A firm truſt in the aſſiſtance of an Almighty Being, naturally produces patience, cheerfulneſs, and all other diſpoſitions of mind, that alleviate thoſe calamities which we are not able to remove.</p>
               <p>None ſhould deſpair, becauſe God can help them; and none ſhould preſume, becauſe God can croſs them.</p>
               <p>Exceſs of ſorrow is as fooliſh as profuſe laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Loud mirth, or immoderate ſorrow; inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of behaviour, either in proſperity or adverſity, are alike diſgraceful in a man that is born to die.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:024777_0063_0FC87DC666979F98"/>
As there is no proſperous ſtate of life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its calamities; ſo there is no adverſity without its benefits. Aſk the great and powerful, if they do not feel the pangs of envy and ambition? En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the poor and needy, if they have not taſted the ſweets of quiet and contentment? Even under the pains of body, the infidelity of friends, or the miſconſtructions put upon our laudable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, our minds (when for ſome time accuſtomed to theſe preſſures) are ſenſible of ſecret flowings of comfort, the preſent reward of a pious reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The evils of life appear like rocks and precipices, rugged and barren at a diſtance, but at our nearer approach, we find little fruitful ſpots, and refreſhing ſprings, mixed with the harſhneſs and deformity of nature.</p>
               <p>It may boldly be affirmed, that good men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reap more ſubſtantial benefit from their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than bad men do from their proſperities; and what they loſe in wealth, pleaſure, or honor, they gain with vaſt advantage in wiſdom, goodneſs, and tranquility of mind.</p>
               <p>Afflicton is ſpiritual phyſic for the ſoul. It is compared to a furnace; for as gold is tried and purified therein, ſo men are proved, and either pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified from their droſs, and fitted for good uſes, or entirely burnt up and undone for ever.</p>
               <p>Happy are they who, laboring under any kind of affliction, can ſay with Job, "When he hath tried me, I ſhall come forth as gold."</p>
               <p>Let a man live but two or three years without affliction, and he is almoſt good for nothing: he
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:024777_0064_0FC87DCBEBCE89E0"/>
cannot pray nor meditate, nor keep his heart fixed upon ſpiritual things; but let God ſmite him in his child, health, or eſtate, now he can find his tongue and affections again; now he awakes, and falls to his duty in earneſt; now God has twice as much honor from him, as he had before. "Now, ſaith God, this amendment pleaſeth me; this rod was well beſtowed; I have diſappointed him to his great benefit and advantage." And thus God is in friendſhip with his people again.</p>

               <p>THERE is not a greater inlet to miſery and vices of all kinds, than the not knowing how to paſs our vacant hours. For what remains to be done, when the firſt part of their lives, who are not brought up to any manual employment, is ſlipt away without an acquired reliſh for reading, or taſte for other rational ſatisfactions? That they ſhould purſue their pleaſures?—But, religion apart, common prudence will warn them to tie up the wheel as they begin to go down the hill of life.

to deceive the time, or, to ſpeak more properly, to deceive themſelves, the length of a day will ſeem tedious to them, who, perhaps, have the unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to complain of the ſhortneſs of life in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. When the former part of our life has been nothing but vanity, the latter end of it can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vexation. In ſhort, we muſt be miſerable, without ſome employment to fix, or ſome amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſſipate our thoughts: The latter we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not command in all places, nor reliſh at all times; and therefore there is an abſolute neceſſity for the former. We may purſue this or that new pleaſure; we may be fond for a while of a new acquiſition; but when the graces of novelty are worn off, the briſkneſs of our firſt deſire is over, the tranſition is very quick and ſudden, from an eager fondneſs to a cool indifference. Hence there is a reſtleſs agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our minds, ſtill craving ſomething new, ſtill unſatisfied with it, when poſſeſſed; till melancholy increaſes, as we advance in years, like ſhadows lengthening towards the cloſe of day.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that men of this ſtamp are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally complaining that the times are altered for the worſe: Becauſe the ſprightlineſs of their youth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented every thing in the moſt engaging light; and when men are in high good humour with themſelves, they are apt to be ſo with all around: The face of nature brightens up, and the ſun ſhines with a more agreeable luſtre: But when old age has cut them off from the enjoyment of falſe pleaſures, and habitual vice has given them a diſtaſte for the only true and laſting delights; when a retroſpect of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:024777_0066_0FC87DCEE5D7BE80"/>
their paſt lives preſents nothing to view but one wide tract of uncultivated ground; a ſoul diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with ſpleen, remorſe, and an inſenſibility of each rational ſatisfaction, darkens and diſcolours every object; and the change is not in the times, but in them, who have been forſaken by thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications which they would not forſake.</p>
               <p>How much otherwiſe is it with thoſe, who have laid up an inexhauſtible fund of knowledge! When a man has been laying out that time in the purſuit of ſome great and important truth, which others waſte in a circle of gay follies, he is conſcious of having acted up to the dignity of his nature; and from that conſciouſneſs there reſults that ſerene complacency, which, though not ſo violent, is much preferable to the pleaſures of the animal life.</p>

               <p>THE miſeries to which human nature is liable, have often been the ſubject of contemplation. Viewing the gloomy ſide of the queſtion, the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:024777_0070_0FC87DDE405AD200"/>
of a benevolent heart are apt to be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agitated.</p>
               <p>Man is born unto trouble, as the ſparks fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; he cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; he flouriſhes in health and vigour, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not; his days paſs like a ſhadow, and he is gone; he eateth in darkneſs, hath much ſorrow, and returneth to his original duſt, and no further remembrance of him remains.</p>
               <p>Death is the law of our nature, the debt which all muſt pay, and there is no diſcharge in that war. The works of nature wax old and decay: the lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt monuments of human art, pyramids, cities, ſtates and empires, have their periods, beyond which they will not endure. All things have a tendency to change; and man, amongſt the reſt of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, when called by Providence, muſt ſubmit to part with the life which was given him. The great and the good, the wiſe and the prudent, the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the ignorant, the renowned and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, the prince and the peaſant, are all travelling the road which leads to the grave.</p>
               <p>The time of our departure is utterly uncertain, and the accidents which may deprive us of life are innumerable. An unexpected bruiſe, an undeſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed blow, a fall from a horſe, the ſcratch of a pin, the pairing of a nail, or the duſt of a wall, may be made the inſtruments of immediate death: thus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acreon, the poet, was choaked with a grape-ſtone; Fabius, the Roman Senator, was ſuffocated with a ſingle hair in a draught of milk; Pope Alexander with a fly, which ſlew accidentally into his mouth;
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:024777_0071_0FC87DDF6BE3A820"/>
Homer died of grief; Sophocles with exceſs of joy; Dyoniſius with the good news of a victory he had obtained, and Aurelianus in the midſt of a dance.</p>
               <p>Diſeaſes and deaths, ſays an ingenious author, are ſecretly lurking every where; they are in our boſoms, in our bowels, in every thing we taſte, in every thing we enjoy. We have death dwelling with us in our houſes, walking with us in the fields, lying down with us in our beds, and wrapped about us in our very clothes, always ready, at the Divine command, to give the fatal blow. If Heaven per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, Benhadad is ſlain in his bed, and Ammon at his table; Belſhazzar in his cups, the Egyptian firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born in their ſleep; Saul in the field; Caeſar in the Senate; Caligula in the theatre; Antiochus in his coach; Zechariah in the temple, and Pope Victor at the ſacrament.</p>
               <p>To exclude from our thoughts that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided, betokens a weakneſs and timidity, which a wiſe and prudent man, who deſires to act his part with propriety, would not indulge. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on death, which terminates every ſcene of the ſhort period of exiſtence allotted to man in this tranſitory ſtate, though gloomy, is intereſting, and may be highly beneficial; it induces us to enquire, wherefore we were made, to aſcertain the duties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us, and to a ſerious and attentive practice of them. No event is more ſolemn and important, than that which is to cloſe the connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life. To prepare for this laſt hour is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous object: to be able to meet it with a ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al compoſure and dignity, calmneſs and fortitude,

ſhould be the earneſt deſire, and engroſs the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal attention of man.</p>
               <p>That we may have a peaceful and happy exit, when we are called to quit this mortal ſcene, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to renounce the purſuits and indulgences of vice and error, and to walk in the paths of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which alone lead to true felicity.</p>

               <p>FINE parts, learning, or rank in life, without Virtue, are not ſufficient qualifications in a man whom you admit to your intimacy and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.

               <p>Friendſhip is the balm of life; the "cordial drop" diſpenſed by Heaven to exhilarate its languor, and alleviate its cures; yet you can have but <hi>few</hi> friends in the extenſive ſenſe of the term.

It is indeed a plant of celeſtial extract, "of tender violations apt to die:" an exotic on earth, it will not flouriſh in every ſoil. The man who, in the unreſerved open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart, expoſes his weakneſs freely (and if I may be allowed the metaphor) <hi>ſtrips himſelf naked</hi> before his ſuppoſed friends, will find among them more <hi>Hams</hi> than <hi>Japhets.</hi> Many who may be warm in the profeſſion friendſhip will, either from a fond deſire of revealing ſecrets, or the baſer motive of detraction, expoſe his failings with cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el aggravations.</p>
               <p>The baſe officiouſneſs of ſuch detractors may, perhaps, receive approbation from the ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the profane, for <hi>they</hi> will not conſider, that it is only exerciſed by the betrayers of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to gain reputation on the compariſon, and to hide ſtill greater deformity in themſelves: therefore, in the choice of your friends, be cautious whom you admit under that ſacred character. A <hi>falſe</hi> friend will injure you more than a thouſand open enemies, and is, in reality, a very deſpicable character.</p>

down again to ſleep; that even this</hi> happy ſtate <hi>is often interrupted by ſickneſs, or one diſappointment or other; and that at laſt old age comes on, robs us of our health and ſenſes, and renders us the object of the contempt of the younger, till death cloſes the ſcene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we conſider life in the contracted view of theſe murmurers, and make it conſiſt only in ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a rotation, life would indeed become a burthen; but if we employ the nobler powers we have, in conſidering what life is, and act in conſequence of ſuch knowledge, we ſhall find a ſcene of ſo exalted and dignified a nature, that we ſhall be apt to think the ſpectacle Providence has introduced us to, by veſting us with human faculties, ſo noble, that we ſhould ſtand indebted only for one day's acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with it.</p>
               <p>Life, properly underſtood, offers to the human creature an unlimited ſcene of pleaſure: but if he will confine his own ſphere of action in a narrower compaſs than his powers extend, whom can he blame?

               <head>ON REPROOF.</head>
               <p>NOTHING is more common than to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to others; nothing more diſpleaſing to many than to receive it themſelves. Inſtructions flatter the ſelf-love of him who gives them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note his ſuperiority over him who is inſtructed: he is pleaſed at thinking himſelf wiſe enough to direct the conduct of another, and yet has not the power to follow his own good counſels. To receive advice gives us diſpleaſure, as it ſhews us our folly or our vices are known to the world: and however weak or vicious men may be, few but have ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their wiſdom, or are not ſo far paſt ſhame, but it gives them ſome uneaſineſs to be found out.</p>
               <p>The cenſuring of faults in our friends has been attributed, and not unjuſtly, more to pride than love or charity, as we endeavour not ſo much to correct, as to make them believe we are without them ourſelves. Such a reproof is only a cover to our own hypocriſy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reproof,</hi> as Wycherly ſomewhere obſerves, <hi>is often to the weak mind what phyſic is to the weak body</hi>—<hi>which either, not timed ſeaſonably, or given in too great a quantity, makes the remedy worſe than the diſeaſe.</hi> Nothing requires more care, experience and knowledge, than the office of a reprover. He who would correct his friend muſt do it with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make a nice choice of a convenient time and place: he ſhould be free alſo from prejudice, paſſion and invective, and conſult the temper of him to whom he ſpeaks, that he may talk to him in that
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:024777_0081_0FC87DFB27546F88"/>
manner which is moſt ſuitable to it.—To do all this is not ſo eaſy a taſk.</p>
               <p>Though there are many abſurdities in giving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, there are ſome alſo in receiving it. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove a ſelf-opinioniſt, though with ever ſo much caution and friendſhip, as it calls his own conduct in queſtion, will be only affronting him; he cannot bear to think he has acted fooliſhly, or at leaſt that any one has perceived it. Many receive the reproof of their friends according to the dignity of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover; they have a pride in being inſtructed by ſome one above them, but cannot bear advice from an equal.</p>
               <p>No one is either too wiſe or too good to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: therefore when reproof is juſt and gentle, it ſhould be eſteemed as the kindeſt office of a friend. To give reproof is the moſt difficult. He who ſets up for a reformer of others, ought always to watch over himſelf; for ſhould he happen to fall into the frailty he condemns, he affords a public ſcene of laughter and ridicule.</p>
