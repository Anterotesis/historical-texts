            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ADMINISTRATION dare not, as yet (or elſe they would) deny the ſubjects right of petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the King; but Bute and Mansfield, will not ſuffer even the petition of the firſt city in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to be received upon the throne. Can their ſupreme Lordſhips give a reaſon why? I mean a ſolid reaſon. It is an undoubted, and till now has been an undiſputed right, which this grateful city claims, a right, which no Royal tyrant in paſt ages has controuled.</p>
            <p>This late political diſplay of Sovereign inſolence, has broken out, to dignify the preſent reign; our Kings are ſtill ready to receive a petition from the greateſt city in the univerſe, but they are the judges where—at their Levee—or in their water cloſe?— Be it ordained henceforth, that all petitions for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of national grievances ſhall be received where
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:013992_0002_0F92591A82029278"/>they may be moſt uſeful to the ſovereign, and leaſt likely to riſe in judgement againſt the miniſter.</p>
            <p>Is it come to this at laſt, that one of the moſt eſſential rights of a Britiſh ſubject is to be treated with indignity? Is it become a farce that may be acted at a ſycophantic Levee, and attended to with as much affected indifference as a birth-day ode? Is the ground and reaſon of this invaluable right for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got? Or are the rights of the crown alone to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and thoſe of the ſubject trampled under foot? Let us enquire into the foundation of the ſubject's right to addreſs the throne; we ſhall then ſee with what propriety, policy, or decency, this ſatisfaction is refuſed now. Whilſt the ſovereign has a right to allegiance, the ſubject has an equal claim to protection.</p>
            <p>Theſe eſſentials from the bond of union, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal relation, between the governor and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; that the ſtate may enjoy the benefits ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from this union, the King becomes the head of the body politic, by the ſuffrage of a free people; the people remain members of this body politic, giving up their natural rights, by compact with the ſovereign, for the ſake of protection and good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Theſe are the two great ends which every ſubject has in view. A King of England, on the other hand has not a ſingle prerogative which is not conducive to theſe two great ends. This is the true ſtate of an Engliſh Sovereign, and an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſubject: in conſequence, a good Sovereign may well expect to be obeyed without reluctance; a loyal ſubject to be heard without contempt; if the Sovereign's dignity muſt be maintained, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects grievances muſt be redreſſed; the one is leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:013992_0003_0F92591B44F38C30"/>by an inſolent deportment, and the other ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grivated by cold indifference. The Prince who will not hear information, is a fool; he who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſpite of it, is a Tyrant.</p>
            <p>It is a maxim with us, "that the King can do no wrong;" the reſult of every political evil, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to his miniſters, but the unthinking Prince who checks Petitions to the throne, raſhly takes every impolitic tranſgreſſion upon himſelf. To this injudicious conduct that weak tyrant Charles the firſt, deluded by his miniſterial ſycophants, owed his ruin, he foreſaw the ſtorm approaching, when it was too late to take ſhelter from its fury, his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings (and juſt they were) ſhould be a perpetual leſſon for crowned heads, but alas! they are kept (if poſſible) in infancy all their lives, at their hazard their infamous dependants are to rife; a wiſe King would not only open his ears, but his arms, to the information of his ſubjects, they are his creators, and they ought to be his guides, they are in truth his only friends.</p>
            <p>Till ſubjects commence ſlaves, neither weak Kings, nor wicked miniſters, can ſtand before them, no army is ſufficient in a free country, to encounter civil indignation and reſentment, iniquity never can prevail till men have loſt their reaſon, thoſe who dare to think, will dare to act. To injured ſubjects the ſharpeſt of all incentives is contempt, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt expedient is redreſs, the ſole right of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this lenient meaſure, lies in the breaſt of the ſovereign; if miniſters are wicked he can diſcard them, if venal parliaments, at the back of a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, attempt to undermine the conſtitution, he can diſſolve them; without proceeding to this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:013992_0004_0F92591C635D3518"/>he can, and it is his duty to withhold his aſſent whenever any act has improvidently paſſed the two houſes, which is likely to be pernicious to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In ſuch times of corruption and iniquity, every member of the body politic has a right to inform head (the King) of the approaching danger, in ſuch times, ſhall a great city be repulſed? If they are to be received with unuſual indignity, ſuch an intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reception is equal to an actual repulſe. That Prince wants wiſdom, who is not capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting that opulent cities are the vital parts of his dominions, yet what treatment has the city of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don lately met with? have they not been charged with encouraging his Majeſty's <hi>rebellious ſubjects</hi> (as they are called) in America? Is it not treaſon to encourage traitors? Yet my Lord Mansfield knows that the word (encourage) is the word uſed by his Majeſty, in his anſwer to the city petition. Now if ſubjects have a right, (and who dare deny it?) to petition the ſovereign, they are entitled to ſome degree of decency, when they approach the throne with a remonſtrance; becauſe theſe remonſtrants are a moſt important part of thoſe people to whom the ſovereign owes his exiſtence and continuance. The Majeſty of a people reſides in the collective body, not in a packed majority of ſmuggled repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives in a venal houſe of commons, it is not from the luxurious and corrupt, but from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and commercial parts of the kingdom, that this collective body will take its tone, they are the ſinews of the ſtate. The rotten commons, and and ſtill more rotten peers, are but as ſtraws floating lightly upon the ſurface of this great community
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:013992_0005_0F92591D01E6D4E8"/>theſe are the bees that make the honey, and thoſe the idle drones, that rob the public hives; yet theſe alone are the perſons whom the "King delighteth to honour," they alone are received with ſmiles.</p>
            <p>The incenſe of flattery is grateful, the voice of truth an abomination to the throne, the ſovereign (tho' not to be ſurfeited with ſupplies) is grown ſick of information; petitions are therefore to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at levees, there they will be handed to a Lord in waiting, (one of the corrupt gang) and neither opened nor heard of afterwards, but when petitions are received upon the throne, a King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtop his ears; their contents, their reception, and the anſwer, are notorious, the whole world may then look on, and either applaud the wiſdom, or be aſtoniſhed at the juſtice of the ſovereign.</p>
            <p>Can tyrants who violate the laws of God, fear the ſentence of this earthly forum? Is it for this puſillanimous reaſon, public remonſtrances are to be treated like private petitions, preſented by indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant individuals? Are the city of London to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived like paupers in the corner of a levee? Do they come for alms, or for redreſs? Do they come to ſolicit a penſion, or to claim a right? Do they ſue for the performance of a jobbing contract made with a perfidious miniſter, or for an eſtabliſhment and due obſervance in futuro, of that compact made between the crown and the ſubject, at the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If they come in the latter ſhape, the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their ſuit demands all the dignity and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the ſovereign.</p>
            <p>If petitions of ſuch a ſerious nature, can be baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled by a careleſs, light reception at a levee of idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrous placemen, and needy mendicants, every ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:013992_0006_0F925921C7F867C0"/>of honeſt information is ſhut up by the falſe friends of deluded Majeſty; the ſovereign is ſtill kept in a ſtate of darkneſs and dangerous perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for the ſake of a miniſterial gang of public robbers, at the hazard of the property, lives, and liberties of a whole empire.</p>
            <p>The iniquitous proceedings of this atrocious gang in the laſt, and preſent parliament, which they packed, fully juſtify me in branding them with the name of public robbers. Let them look into the black journals of their guilty houſes.—There they will find that individuals, corporations, electing counties in Great Britain, (not to mention the vaſt continent of America, and the colonies, merchants and manufacturers, dependent on it) have been deprived of their rights, their liberties, and lives, by that Banditti, who call themſelves the King's friends, yet act like enemies to him, and to their country.</p>
            <p>Theſe would open the way (ſhould they at laſt meet with due attention) firſt to their removal from the King's preſence, and then to fatal enquiries—To the ſalvation of Great-Britain and America, and to the puniſhment of that infernal Gang of national Parricides. They, on the other hand, fearing only for themſelves, wiſh to ſtop all acceſs to the Sovereign's ear, and evrey appeal to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or his heart. England cannot look with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern upon the ſufferings of America. Her claims is juſt, ſhe ſays, and ſhe ſays truly, that taxation (when it is for the ſingle purpoſe of taking money out of her pocket) and repreſentation are, and muſt neceſſarily be reciprocal. In every other reſpect ſhe ſubmits (as a Colony), to the Legiſlature of her Mother country; ſhe ſubmits to all thoſe laws of England, which affect the general ſyſtem of policy throughout the empire of Great-Britain; but ſhe ſays wiſely, that the money which ſhe acquires by the
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:013992_0007_0F9259233809D728"/>ſweat of her own brow, is not the money of the people of England; and therefore cannot be given away by ſuch perſons as repreſent the people of England only.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtands the caſe of America, whom adminiſtration are labouring to bring under the abſolute yoke of their corrupt parliamentary majority: Unleſs they can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs this, they know that neither America, nor Great-Britain (whom they keep like an apple in their jaws, as Hamlet ſays, firſt mouthed to be laſt ſwallowed) can be effectually enſlaved. Unleſs America can be maſſacred, and her refractory numbers reduced, by ſword and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, within a poſſibility of controul, ſhe will ſet a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible example of ſpirit to her mother country, for whom a net is likewiſe already ſpread. Till America is totally ſubdued, the liberties of Great Britain cannot be finally extinguiſhed. The aim of the preſent deſpotic admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and their ſervile majority is plain: They wiſh to bring America not only under the yoke of our legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, but of their ſtanding army, with which they will keep them under foot for ever, ſhould they conquer now. Should they fail in this diabolical deſign; America riſing from her ruins, will erect an empire of her own; an aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum for the diſtreſſed ſubjects of her mother country; who, as they ſeem at preſent careleſs about the rights, will at laſt retain the name of Engliſhmen. But ſhould our parricides ſucceed, and America be once ſubdued, the whole Britiſh empire will in due time be ſlaves. Then will the patriotic ſcheme of our preſent virtuous adminiſtration be compleat; their friendſhip to their King, their affection for their country; the vain confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the one, the well grounded diſtruſt of the other will appear. The ſecret machinations of the cabinet, the ſuperior wiſdom of the Great Council of the nation, will be diſcloſed, to the eternal ſhame and infamy of thoſe, who muſt neither preſume to call themſelves Britons nor men, if they long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thus tamely to petition when they ought to act. Then ſhall we all deſerve the ridicule of the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:013992_0008_0F925923837EDDF0"/>ſarcaſtic Mansfield, and be, in very deed, a tame herd of animals, among whom the worſt of all diſtempers (ſlavery) may be ſaid to rage; whilſt we dare not avail ourſelves either of our Hoofs, or Horns.</p>

                     </gap> attention to the future correſpondence of CATO, who breaths the Godlike ſentiments of freedom. They embrace this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of contradicting a most infamous report, no leſs induſtriouſly than falſely propagated by the emiſſaries of the preſent infernal adminiſtration. "That the CRISIS was ſet on foot, and is countenanced by the ministry as a pretence for laying a reſtraint on the Preſs." The authors beg leave to declare in the moſt ſolemn manner, before God and Man, that ſuch aſſertions have not the leaſt foundation in truth, and that they are circulated by a tribe of penſioned raſcals, who are employed to write down truth, and eſtabliſh falſhood, only with a view to deceive and miſlead the people, and to draw their attention from the true channel of faithful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and from that destruction with which they are now threatened. The CRISIS was ſet on foot with a deſign to ſupport and defend the constitutional rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of England and America, which the authors hold equally dear with their lives. It was ſet on foot at a time when the liberty of the preſs was nearly destroyed, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered uſeleſs by miniſterial proſecutions, a Scotch Chief Justice, and the daſtardly ſouls of narrow minded Printers, who were afraid to give a tyrant his true appellation. The authors are determined to write like Engliſhmen, unawed by fear, or proſecution, to ſpeak bold truths, ſuch truths as ſome would fear to think. Freedom of ſpeech and writing is one of the firſt, and moſt glorious privileges of a free people: this the authors claim as a right, and this they are firmly reſolved to uſe and defend: for to this privilege we may again stand indebted, for another REVOLUTION.</hi>
