            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT, &amp;c.
TO THE MEDICAL SOCIETY OF CONNECTICUT.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have been informed, that, in the beginning of Auguſt laſt, the yellow fever broke out in Phildelphia; that, according to authentic records, this malignant ſcourge devoured about thirteen hundred of its inhabitants; and that, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the month of October, it had happily and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely diſappeared.</p>
            <p>You have known alſo what meaſures were adopted by our executive, by the board of inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the health-office, and by the college of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians of this city, to check its progreſs.</p>
            <p>No doubt you have likewiſe read ſeveral pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications on the cauſe of origin, and on the nature and treatment of that malady. You muſt alſo have obſerved, with much concern, that learned men, eminent profeſſional characters of the faculty, were abſolutely and ſyſtematically divided both in their theoretical and practical opinions on the
<pb facs="unknown:034311_0010_0FFC3C5BCE037E70"/>ſubject; ſo that, thoſe deſirable improvements which would check its progreſs, and juſtify and eſtabliſh the beſt mode of treatment, were unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily retarded. But, gentlemen, the public alarm will ſoon ſubſide; and it is my hope that all regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar phyſicians, without any party ſpirit or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to dictate to each other, will very ſoon ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render to ſtriking facts, and ſubmit to fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and beneficial rules.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, therefore, diſpenſe with any hiſtorical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails, conceiving that they more properly belong to the province of a public recorder, or to an official authority. My only view is, to promote medical knowledge, on that intereſting ſubject; and it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of nothing foreign to the obligation which is impoſed upon every phyſician, to afford, if he can, by the means of a candid inveſtigation, ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements to the healing art. To phyſicians and to natural philoſophers, in fact, the public, with confidence, entruſt the taſk of reſearching the laws and evils of nature, that they may thus be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to protect the lives and health of their fellow creatures. My opinions and obſervations, however, I ſubmit to your examination and judgement; not pretending to dictate to any one who may think himſelf better informed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall trace the deſign of my ſubject in order to compriſe the different views under which it may be conſidered; in all of which I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:034311_0011_0FFC3C5A465D7C70"/>myſelf to well known facts, inſtead of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranging new theories and ſyſtems.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſtly,</hi> I ſhall examine moſt of the opinions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by writers on the yellow fever, and the arguments by which they have been ſupported or refuted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall give a phyſiological deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the yellow fever, as it appeared, at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent periods, in Philadelphia, and enquire into the cauſes to which it may be aſcribed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will deſcribe our method of treatment for the cure of the yellow fever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Practical cautions for the cure, will be enumerated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> General means to prevent the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and generation of the yellow fever, will be propoſed.</p>

               <head>SECTION I.</head>
               <p>VARIOUS and numerous are the opinions on the origin and nature of the yellow fever. The firſt is, that it was imported from the empire of Siam,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034311_0012_0FFC3C58B919C088"/>into the Weſt-India iſlands by a French ſquadron, returning from thence, in the year 1689; and which was obliged, by ſtreſs of weather, to put into Fort Royal, in Martinico<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Deſcription de la partie Franc, de St. Domingue par Moreau de St. Mery, p. 700.</note>. It is true, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that, as ſoon as theſe ſhips arrived, their crews, as well as the crews of many others, were much infected with a very malignant fever. Great number periſhed, together with many inhabitants of the iſland. From Fort Royal the malady was imported, by ſome commiſſioned ſhips, into St. Chriſtopher's and into Hiſpaniola, where it made great havock. In Port-de-Paix, and ſeveral other places, its effects were ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, during many years after, that, in the year 1692, a royal edict, from the king of France, ordered a quarantine for all ſhips coming from Martinico. Two years after, and even ſo late as 1708, penal laws, inflicting the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death, were paſſed in commercial towns againſt any ſeaman or paſſenger who ſhould come on ſhore without a legal examination or permit. The malignancy of the diſorder was ſuch, ſays Mr. Morean de St. Mery, "as to cauſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted blood to run out from all the organs, and even from the pores of the ſkin, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards covered with bloody ſpots." Since that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal epocha, ſeveral accounts have been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a particular kind of malignant fever raging,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034311_0013_0FFC3C5661005958"/>at certain periods and ſeaſons of the year, in all the tropical countries; which, in all its ſymptoms was nearly like the yellow fever. One of the oldeſt and moſt ſatisfactory accounts which we have of the malady of Siam, or of the yellow fever, is that of Mr. Pouppe Deſportes<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Maladies de St. Domingue.</note>, a French phyſician, ſent to Hiſpaniola, by the king of France, in the year 1732, to ſuperintend the regulations and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments of the hoſpitals in the colony. It is true that ſome ſymptoms of the fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er deſcribed by that candid writer, ſeem never to have occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the American yellow fever; but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſtitute a material difference. They only lead to prove, that the ſame diſordered may take va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhapes, and characters, according to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſoil and climate. Pouppe Deſportes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the fever an peſtilential one, and had no doubt of its contagious nature. He enumerated more dreadful diagnoſtics than any we know of. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the black vomit, and the j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ice, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that ſuppurations and mortifications on the joints were often its forerunners. The ſucceſſive ſtages of the diſeaſe, as deſcribed by him, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with what we have experienced here; and, from a comparative ſtatement of the temperature and variation of the atmoſphere, during many years, he drew the decided opinion, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady of Siam was always an immediate effect of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034311_0014_0FFC3C53605DC828"/>noxious exhalations, produced by the united agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſtorms, rains, and great heats.</p>
               <p>Another reſpectable witneſs of the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, is Mr. Dazille, phyſician appointed by the king in Hiſpaniola, about twenty years ago<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Obſervations ſur les Maladies des Negres.</note>. He reports that he was called in, at Cape Francois, with three other phyſicians, to conſult on the caſe of a Mr. Lambert, who had lately arrived from Europe, and thus expreſſes himſelf. "On the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of his ſickneſs, Mr. Lambert was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in the middle of his room, not complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any kind of pain. He appeared much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at our meeting for conſultation, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that the was not ſick. His pulſe was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, and a little febrile; his converſation was ſomewhat incoherent; and his eyes were tinged with a light yellow hue. I firmly declared to the phyſicians, that, in the evening, he would die. We met again at twelve o'clock; when we found him as yellow as a marigold and in a ſtate of coma. His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>glutition was already difficult, and he died at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> half after ſeven in the evening!</p>
               <p>"I was ſometime after, requeſted, by the viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>hoiſeul, to viſit Mr. de Sainthenay, knight of St. Louis, &amp;c. I found him ſitting at his deſk counting money. Since the fourth day of his ſickneſs, he had been yellow and over his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034311_0015_0FFC3C50F90CD3F0"/>body. His countenance was anxious and much altered; his pulſe very bad; and his ſkin had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready that cold moiſture which ſo peculiarly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignates the laſt ſtage of this kind of malignant fever. I immediately ſent word to the viſcount, that Mr. de S. would die on the ſame day, which was, unfortunately, the caſe."</p>
               <p>Experience had taught Mr. Dazille the inſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deceiving appearances peculiarly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the malady of Siam, or yellow fever; and he cautions his medical readers not haſtily to prognoſticate the fate of their patients. He and ſeveral other French writers have poſitively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that this fever was introduced into the Weſt-Indies from Aſia, about a century before. Although it has all the features of a contagion, to prove that opinion, yet it is very ſtrange that it never has been imported into Europe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the uninterupted intercourſe of all the European powers with their iſlands. Time and experience have proved to them, that the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy and frequency of fevers in the tropical countries could not reach Europe. However, it cannot be inconſiſtent to ſuppoſe, that, if the malady of Siam had been imported from ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a region as the Eaſt-Indies into tropical Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, it might, of courſe, have been received in the ſouth of Europe; ſince there is no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the climates of New-York or Newhaven, and thoſe of Cadiz or Marſeilles.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034311_0016_0FFC3C4E9C73EB98"/>Indeed, if there is a difference, it ſurely will he favourable to the hypotheſis, that ſuch a fever could have been imported often into the ſouthern latitudes of Europe. This was never the caſe, I believe, however, but once; when, in the year 1757, an Engliſh man of war from Quebec arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Plymouth with the yellow fever, which was very ſoon ſubdued by the climate, and did not leave the leaſt marks of contagion.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, that, by its nature, this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is confined to tropical countries, and ſeldom or never can ſpread in the northern latitudes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it ſhould there meet with an uncommon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat, as is often the caſe in North Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Such objections may be refuted, by conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the yellow fever does not preciſely break out during the heat of our tropical days, but on the return of the variable days of autumn. Shall we not then ſay, that the yellow fever may ariſe from ſome ſource colder and nearer than Siam or other tropical countries?</p>
               <p>I find that Hypocrates has known, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the chief ſymptoms of this kind of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever; and has noticed the ſpontaneous vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings of the bile, the jaundice, and the black vomit, &amp;c<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Aphor. Hypocrat. Aphor. 22, 23, and 62, ſec. iv.</note>. The warm climate in which <hi>he</hi> lived, could, indeed, give him frequent opportunities of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034311_0017_0FFC3C4CEC87BFF0"/>obſerving all the effects of any infecting effluvia on the human body. His rules and precepts ſtill hold good in the ſymptoms of our yellow fever. Why then ſhould we ſearch for its origin in diſtant countries, whilſt we are ſurrounded with the ſame cauſes and circumſtances that generated the yellow fever in the iſland of Cos, in the Weſt-India iſlands, and in Siam, as well as in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica?</p>
               <p>It is an unqueſtionable truth, that a contagious diſorder may be imported; and that this frequently happens, can be proved by many hiſtorical and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent facts. Againſt theſe we do not pretend to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any dogmatical aſſertion. But, if the malignant ſcourge has always been introduced by extraneous cauſes, and could never exiſt in our climate but by importation, why does it reach our ſhores, ſo late as the month of Auguſt? Why is the plague of the American tropical iſlands increaſed by the mild and moderate temperature of our autumn? If it be anſwered, that the contagion muſt acquire its growth during the hot ſummer of the iſlands, before it can be tranſported, they thus aſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> and ſeaſons. Should it be acknowledged that the yellow fever often breaks out, in the iſlands, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their winter, or early in their ſpring, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034311_0018_0FFC3C4A88A87610"/>would not explain, why we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, on the return of our hot days.</p>
               <p>An imported contagion might, indeed, be more heightened in certain places than in others; but as the contagion of the plague, the venereal lues, the itch, the ſcurvy, the ſmall pox, &amp;c. are active in any part of the world, why does not this complaint ſpread to our inland places, country ſeats, and towns; among our robuſt farmers and the numerous inhabitants of our back countries? Are theſe places ſo perfectly airy and refreſhed, that this kind of contagion cannot reach them? Should it be anſwered, that in maritime towns only the atmoſphere can receive and tranſmit the ſeed of contagion, it is obviouſly admitting that there is an unqueſtionable ground to aſſert, that the fever is generated among us.</p>
               <p>Why is it that people, attached to a certain mode of life, and careful in the uſe of certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventives, may expoſe themſelves to the floating contagion, without fear as well as without effect? Are they more favoured by nature, diſpoſition, and conſtitution? If it is ſaid, that a perfect ſtate of health does not admit this kind of contagion, is not, what we ſuppoſe, admitted, that an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate of health will eaſily be acted upon by an impure atmoſphere, or by exhalations from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted animal, or vegetable ſubſtances?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:034311_0019_0FFC3C4783664CE0"/>Infine, there are authentic proofs that the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever has ſometimes, appeared in iſolated caſes, in Philadelphia, and other towns. It did not ſpread, however, except in the years 1762, 1793, and 1797. Doctor Hilary has alſo obſerved, and poſitively aſcertained, that once in Barbadoes the yellow fever was not communicated even to the attendants of the ſick. As this ſtrange circumſtance cannot be explained, except by the ſtate of the air, is it not enough from his aſſertion, and from the repeated inſtances in which it did not ſpread, to derive the grounds of our opinion, that this fever is ſometimes generated by principles contained in our own atmoſphere? After all theſe arguments, gentlemen, againſt the importation of the yellow fever, from Siam or from the Weſt-India iſlands, it would be unfair not to take notice of the arguments by which it has been deduced from a different ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. Theſe grounds or proofs are but few and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal, and moſt of them will contribute to ſupport our opinion. It is ſaid, <hi>firſtly,</hi> that, in all places and towns in America, which have been infected with the yellow fever, it has been eaſy to trace its origin to certain ſhips from the Weſt-Indies, &amp;c. Now, I ſhall not recapitulate to you thoſe tedious enquiries into facts that every party have ingeniouſly and with equal ſucceſs controverted; for, ſhould they prove the poſſibility of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the contagion, it will not affect our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Such facts, indeed, ought rather to impreſs
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034311_0020_0FFC3C4544B38978"/>upon our minds, the important truths of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous effects of any kind of effluvia from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted vegetable or animal ſubſtances, which are ſo often unavoidably engendered in the cargoes of ſhips coming from tropical countries in the hot ſeaſons of the year. Of this, there are as many inſtances as there are eminent medical writers, on the ſubject of contagion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The importation of the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cannot be doubted, when it is ſo often known to have raged on board of veſſels both at ſea and in port. Indeed, the French have derived their name of this fever, from its peculiar frequency among ſeaman; and ſeveral of their writers have called it <hi>la matelote.</hi> Be this as it may, two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are obvious, even in our opinion, to render the yellow fever more frequent among ſeamen. One is, that they are conſtantly prediſpoſed to bilious complaints, as we ſhall hereafter explain; and the other, that they are continually expoſed to putrid exhalations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If theſe towns and places had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the contagion from tropical countries, we ſhould find in our hiſtorical records more frequent inſtances of a malady that is ſuppoſed to be of a domeſtic origin. Formerly our ſummers were ſtill hotter, and more inſupportable than they are at preſent; and our towns, or rather villages, were deſtitute of any improvement, were often filthy and neceſſarily neglected; yet they were remarkably
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034311_0021_0FFC3C4387F9A810"/>healthy. Againſt objections ſo obſtinately urged, I could oppoſe undeniable proofs of great changes in many towns and places, of variations in the air, winds, and atmoſphere, from whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to peſtilential, and <hi>vice verſa</hi>; but we have no certain data from ſuch fluctuating pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to direct our enquiries. It is, therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to inſiſt on them here, while we can, in a few words, ſatisfy our reaſon and judgement from well-known facts, more applicable to the point in controverſy. Is it not true, that putrid effluvia, infections vapours, and poiſonous miaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata, muſt be more abundant and permanent, more often generated, and more fully diffemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in populous and large towns than in villages or thinly inhabited places?</p>
               <p>I do not find, gentlemen, among the Engliſh medical writers, any other peculiar opinion, on the origin of the yellow fever, except that of Dr. Warren, who implicitly believed, that it had been firſt brought from Paleſtine to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles, and from thence to Martinico and to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes, about thirty or forty years ago. All the works I have read, agree generally in the ſupport of the doctrine of local exhalations. It is now time, however, for me to dwell a little on the opinions which, though much divided, have nevertheleſs prevailed in Philadelphia, both among phyſicians and others. The college of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians of this city, had officially expreſſed, in the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034311_0022_0FFC3C41494EF328"/>year 1793, an opinion, that the fever had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from the Weſt-India iſlands, and that it was very contagious. They have, by no means, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this year, from that declaration. As we have not any publication, collectively, from that body, that could exhibit more, and ſtronger arguments than merely their opinion of its importation, I ſuppoſe, that it is unneceſſary for me to ſay any thing either for or againſt the opinion. An almoſt equal number of phyſicians, among whom are many eminent characters, have uniformly ſupported the contrary doctrine, that the fever was of a domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic origin; and that it reſulted from corrupted ſubſtances in the cargoes confined in ſhips' holes, as well as from thoſe impure exhalations to which we are expoſed. Among theſe laſt, however, a diſtinction ſhould be carefully made of thoſe who acknowledge its highly contagious nature, and the few who yet think that it is not of ſuch a malignant character. I haſten to obſerve, that this aſſertion has been repeatedly publiſhed by a few European and Weſt-India practitioners, who have had but few opportunities of ſeeing many inſtances of the <hi>malady of Siam,</hi> at leaſt in Hiſpani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ola, where it has very ſeldom appeared for theſe laſt twenty years, and where they have a better opportunity of treating the <hi>amphimerina bilioſa</hi> of Savage, or what they call la <hi>fievre lipyrienne,</hi> or the <hi>Tritacophya Americana</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Savage's Noſologia, cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034311_0023_0FFC3C3E5616DC88"/>ſimply reduced to an inflammatory typhus, and to the putrid malignant fever. This capital miſtake has been, conſequently, connected with aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deſtitute of neceſſary demonſtration; it has expoſed to doubt, and almoſt denied, ſome fundamental principles of phiſiology and practice, reſpecting infectious diſorders and epidemics of camps, jails, ſhips, and of all crowded places<note n="*" place="bottom">It has narrowly reduced medical aſſiſtance to the inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent method of diluting, cooling draughts, and feeble cathartics.</note>. In a word, this miſtake has erected a doctrine void of the deference due to the authority of writers in the healing art of the former and preſent age.</p>
               <p>I ſhall analyſe, with more pleaſure, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion, for which documents, enquiries, and liberal and candid diſcuſſions, have been procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and unremittingly purſued by ſeveral phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. Among theſe Dr. B. Ruſh deſerves particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice; becauſe he has ſupported it, ſince the year 1793, both in his lectures of the inſtitutes of medicine, in the univerſity of Pennſylvania, and in ſeveral treatiſes he has ſince publiſhed on the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever. He has never ceaſed to warm his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens of the preſence or proximity of the cauſe of this contagion, in their ſea-ports, wharves, ſtreets, and ſtagnant waters. He has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the phenomena of exhalation from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of vegetable and and animal putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, being aware, by long experience, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034311_0024_0FFC3C3CCA51C110"/>an elightened judgement, that the inhabitants of this place were particularly ſubject to billious fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers during the autumn, from ſudden changes, and the extremes of the climate, and from the groſſneſs and indigeſtive quality of their aliments, he early underſtood that infectious miaſmata could aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the bilious remittent, and convert it into a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant and contagious fever. On this judicious ground he founded his theory and practice, and we ſhall ſee hereafter of what importance it has been to the diſcovery of truth, and the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of medical practice.</p>
               <p>Having hitherto ſtated, gentlemen, the hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal opinions of the moſt enlightened phyſicians of Europe and of America, I muſt obſerve, that it was my purpoſe to point out ſuch of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as were more congenial to the true baſis of the theory to which I have confined myſelf; and to illuſtrate a poſition which has already occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo greatly the public attention. I ſhall add a few more arguments to ſupport the local origin of the yellow fever and its highly contagious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>A ſtriking circumſtance was formerly exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Pouppe Deſpartes, a French phyſician, ſent by the king into Hiſpaniola. During many years he accurately obſerved the ſtate of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere in the ſpring and ſummer. He noticed, that frequent and heavy rains, interrupted by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034311_0025_0FFC3C3A8319B768"/>weather, and intervals of heat, in thoſe tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical countries, was productive of more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous exhalations from the earth. He was thus ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to foretell the appearance of the peſtilential malady of Siam, as he called it. He obſerved, alſo, that, after heavy rains, the noxious effects of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations were checked by winds, or other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. A few caſes from this very juſt authority, will ſerve to warn the inhabitants of our towns of the terrible effects of the exhalations to which they will be expoſed, by the concurrence of rains, after long draughts, with the intenſe heat of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, if they retain among themſelves all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of vegetable and animal corruption. Theſe materials ſeem to increaſe with our population; and, in Philadelphia, I believe, there are more of them than in any other town in the union. They may conſiſt of the logs which form our wharves, and which project to a conſiderable diſtance in the water; of the boards with which almoſt all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures of lots and houſes are ſurrounded; of the roofs of all our houſes; of numerous privy-houſes which are ſeldom emptied; and of many ponds and ſtagnant waters, both in the city and ſuburbs. If it ſhould appear ſtrange to point out, among the ſources of exhalation, the very wood which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily make uſe of for our dwellings and ports, I intreat my reader, before he rejects my aſſertion, carefully to enquire into the natured laws and effects of exhalations from wood, timbers, new
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034311_0026_0FFC3C3790188778"/>ſhips, cellars, foreſts, &amp;c. of which he will find ample documents in the writings of doctor Lind and others. Let him call to mind the number of wooden works in all our cities and ports, where the tide ſucceſſively uncovers and expoſes the wharves to the ſchorching rays of the ſun, and then let him draw his concluſions.</p>
               <p>In proof of the fermentation of animal ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, particularly during the heat of ſummer, which I have already ſuggeſted, I ſhall propoſe an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment. Let a candle be lowered into a ditch, by means of a line, and it will be found, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitic aſcending gas, will put out the light in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as it approaches the ſurface of the earth, and this effect will be much more certain in the latter end, than in the beginning of the hot ſeaſon. When this gas aſcends and is received into the atmoſphere, it doubtleſs breeds contagion and death; and I am fully ſatisfied, that many people have, as well as myſelf, perceived and ſmelt its effluvia, chiefly du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the calm and clear nights of the month of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. Several intereſting publications have appeared in the papers of Philadelphia on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<note n="*" place="bottom">It has been ſtrongly contended in ſame of them, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the wells of Philadelphia are rendered noxious by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>utial grounds and others cauſes. I confeſs I have not yet heard ſufficient objections to deſtroy this opinion. By the effect of ſome local im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnations, ſeveral of our wells are particularly remarked for their bad waters. A reſpectable chymiſt of this city, analyſed the water of his own well, and found that it contained a quantity of magneſia, muriatic ſalt, and uncombined alkali. This certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does not prove much in favour of our waters; and I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aware, that this ſubject requires a more particular inveſtiation. I hope, therefore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> all attract the attention and fix the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſome of our learned and philanthropic citizens.</note>. From this ſhort ſketch we may conclude,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034311_0027_0FFC3C3551F411C0"/>that the opinion of the yellow fever being generated among us, is founded upon good ground; and that it would be in vain to attack this opinion by the objections which have been mentioned and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above. For further ſatisfaction, we ſhall add, that the circumſtance of its having appeared but once in Philadelphia, before the year 1793, does not imply that it cannot be of a domeſtic origin; ſince it is obvious, that it might have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſubſiſted in ſome or few caſes, among thoſe bilious fevers that are endemic among us in the autumn, without having been much taken notice of.</p>
               <p>Would it be juſt to ſay, that this epidemic has never made its appearance in Philadelphia, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in 1762, 1793, and 1797, while there are creditable witneſſes who have poſitively ſeen and obſerved it, every year ſince the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of phyſicians and others has been kept up by the recollection of the calamity? This fever, though ſo highly contagious as to be compared even to the plague, may, like the plague, be wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propagated or entirely imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ded by cauſes that favour of oppoſe its progreſs; for unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table changes and variations of heat and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034311_0028_0FFC3C33B93D1768"/>have ſometimes put an end to the latter in the heat of the ſummer, and they have alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed it in the middle of the winter. The caſe No. 1, was that of a father ſurrounded with a numerous family of whom not one was infected but himſelf. The ſame fact has occurred to my obſervation, in almoſt every family, in which the diſorder proved mortal. In ſuch caſes, the patients ſecrete very little of the putrid miaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata; they are much leſs infectious, becauſe the poiſon is kept in their body to deſtroy the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life; and one of the moſt deceiving ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms is, that they ſeldom emit any diſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>able ſmell. It is quite the reverſe, however, when they recover; and phyſicians and nurſes are well acquainted with the inſupportable foetor, peculiar to that fever, which exudes from their bodies, and continues, for a long time after, in their bed and clothes. Conſequently one or many mortal caſes of the yellow fever may have happened, without having been followed by contagion.</p>
               <p>But it is further objected, that the traces of the importation have been viſibly marked in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia; where the fever, having been commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by ſomebody from Southwark, has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the moſt diſtant part, which is Kenſington, and the houſes on the Frankford road; meanwhile there were but few ſcattered caſes in the centre and northern parts of the city. This laſt mentioned theatre of the diſeaſe, would, however, have been preſerved from contagion if the epidemic was of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034311_0029_0FFC3C314DFEDAF0"/>a domeſtic origin; for the place is quite open, and preſents a view of many country ſeats, and being not on the ſame ſtraight line of the town, it cannot receive its exhalations. However ſtriking and concluſive this whole objection ſeems to be, yet what will be thought at laſt, by an unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced reader, when he recollects that Kenſington, and all the adjacent grounds, are wholly a kind of naval yard, full of timber, and more than any other part of our ſuburbs, ſurrounded with marſhy grounds, and ſtagnant waters. The adjacent banks of the river are, beſides, filled up with all the rubbiſh of new and old timber. So much for the origin of the yellow fever in Kenſington, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In ſupport of the opinion, that the yellow fever is of domeſtic origin, why ſhould we not derive, gentlemen, ſome authority from the medical doctrine already known and promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in all the ſchools of the world; of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible infection of diſorders generated in places where people are crowded, or where unwholeſome exhalations are produced? The hiſtory of jail diſtempers, of fevers on board of fleets, and of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſorders in camps, teaches us that it is not requiſite to ſearch for the origin of our calamity in diſtant countries.

To incredulous and ſyſtematic theoriſts, I ſhall exhibit the faithful evidences which we may derive from the inſtinct of ominous birds. If my mind was not diſtracted by error and prejudice, I ſaw, repeatedly, during the two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our calamity, vultures flying over our afflicted town. Theſe kinds of volatile and carnivorous animals, never wander but in the currents of miaſmata and putrefaction. This is the means by which, in a few hours, they reach their diſtant and putrid prey. This is alſo a proof that our atmoſphere was infected with the corruption which created our epidemic. For an imported diſorder cannot infect the atmoſphere, any more than our ſources of exhalation.</p>
               <p>It remains now with me, gentlemen, to make a few more obſervations on the contagious power of the yellow fever. I have already notice, that very few opponents have appeared againſt that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it is certain, it will meet with none in the ſchools of America. The doctrine of the noxious qualities or ſubſtances of which the air and winds may be the vehicles, has been handed down to us by Hypocrates; and wonderful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in chymiſtry have ſtill letter explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this truth, and all its phenomena; for the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034311_0031_0FFC3C2C08D64C70"/>idea of contagion implies nothing elſe but the tranſmiſſion of certain principles of diſorder, whether conveyed through the medium of the air or by an immediate contact. When this effect takes place, bodies are ſaid to be infected; and ſurely as many diſorders as by their particular effluvia always excite the ſame morbid ſtate, ſo many muſt be contagious. Happily, in the long catalogue of diſeaſes to which we are ſubject, theſe are, comparatively, few. Although conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may ariſe from noxious effluvia, floating in the air, yet it ſeems that the ſame principles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more malignancy when they are propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the channel of diſeaſed human bodies. In them, the contagious miaſmata regenerated and multiply; and, if they were not checked by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable changes in the atmoſphere, who could foreſee an end to a malignant contagion <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>On the 3d of May, the fleet ſailed from Breſt to Louiſbourg, but both during their paſſage to, and ſtay in that port, the fever became general, and was attended with a conſiderable mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. On the 20th of October, the fleet ſailed from Louiſbourg, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on board their ſick, but leaving about four hundred in a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtare. At ſea, the contagion acquired new vigour In a very ſhort, time, the whole ſquadron was diſabled; and, on their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at Breſt, on the 22d of November, the few remaining ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were ſcarcely ſufficient to navigate their ſhips, having no leſs than four thouſand men ill. All their ſurgeons and almoners were either ſick or dead; and, when they arrived, ſeamen were immediately ſent on board to bring them to anchor, and ſurgeons to aſſiſt the ſick. Unfortunately four thouſand more arrived, at the ſame time, from Quebec, in the <hi>Bizarre</hi> and <hi>Celebre,</hi> two men of war, into which the ſickneſs was communicated by the above ſquadrom. During the general confuſion, they had been promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly crowded into the town of Breſt, wherever they could get admiſſion. Fifteen hoſpitals were at laſt ſitted up. Phyſicians and ſurgeons came from all parts of France, and voluntarily gave their ſervices, beſides thoſe who were commiſſioned by the court. The hoſpitals were ſo crowded, that at laſt the mortality ſpread among the attendants. Five phyſicians, one hundred and fifty ſurgeons, and two hundred almoners and nurſes, fell victims, together with a great number of ſlaves, who were engaged to aſſiſt the ſick, upon a promiſe to receive their liberty. From the attendants, the fever paſſed to the lower claſs of people in Breſt, among whom it quickly diffuſed itſelf. The havoc then became general; and the houſes were filled with the dying and the dead. A proclamation from authority, had promiſed the ſick, that they would be provided with the attendance of a phyſician, or any other neceſſary means of aſſiſtance, if they would give proper notice. But, it was ſoon found, that, in many houſes not one was left who could give the nonce, and that, in others dead bodies had remained without burial. In ſine, the month of April brought a gradual and abſolute ceſſation of this contagious epidemic, which, in leſs than five months, ſwept off ten thouſand people in the hoſpitals alone, beſides the inhabitants who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the yellow fever, gentlemen, has manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch particular characters of a highly contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous malignancy, that it ſuggeſted to many, no doubt, the idea of importation, which could not indeed, be denied, were there not ſo many and ſuch powerful reaſons to invalidate it. It was not like an epidemic which ſtrikes only at certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, of the ſame diſpoſition, or defects of conſtitution; and thus diſcloſes, at laſt, what kind of victim it endangers. It does not, like the ague, threaten thoſe of lax nerves and fibres; like the catarrhs or influenza, falling upon the humourous; like the autumnal fevers, afflicting the bilious; and like inflammatory diſorders, ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing upon the plethoric; no, the yellow fever has ſpared neither ſex nor age. The infant in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, as well as the moſt aged, were alike expoſed to its attacks. It ſeemed, indeed, very general among poor, intemperate people, and in filthy houſes; but we have ſeen alſo its power on thoſe, who, among all the comforts and coveniencies of life, were unfortunately reached by it.

               <p>Moreover, theſe principles and facts cannot, in the leaſt, be invalidated by objecting, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſorder could not remain confined in maritime towns; and that, like the plague, it would have found its way to populated coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try places; for even the plague abated entirely in Aleppo in the height of the ſummer, when the extreme heat, dilating too much the peſtilential miaſmata, probably rendered them harmleſs.

By other unaccountable cauſes, it equally broke out during the winter and ſummer, and alſo equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappeared, during each contrary ſeaſon, in Okſacow, in the years 1737 and 1738. If the plague could be checked by contrary changes of ſeaſon, and even by the heat of the ſummer, who will be aſtoniſhed at finding that ſome reaſons alſo excludes generally the yellow fever from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?

Phyſiological and Pathological Deſcription of the Yellow Fever.</head>
               <p>FROM all the documents which have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us, both by Engliſh and French writers, there is no room to doubt, that the diſorder which they have called the malady of Siam, the <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lote,</hi> or the yellow fever, is exactly the ſame which has, in ſeveral inſtances, raged among us. It ſeems, however, that our epidemic, differs, though not materially, in ſome of its ſymptoms, from that of the tropical countries. Dr. Johnſon, has, indeed, acknowledged three kinds of yellow fever. With reſpect to them, I ſhall, juſt ſimply remark, that, if there are three diſtinct and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees, they muſt be owing to the following obvious circumſtances. Firſt, that of its effects or attacks on a patient who quickly becomes its vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim; ſecond, of one who, without great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or danger, paſſes through its ſtages; and laſtly, if thoſe, who, with proper aſſiſtance, get over the reſolution and criſis. Theſe three characters, are, undoubtedly, the natural reſult of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent degrees of contagion, or of the conſtitution, habit, and previous complaints of the patient. There is conſequently out one ſort of yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. This malady ſhould, beſides, be conſidered only during two of its periods, that of its <hi>ſymptoms</hi> and that of the <hi>criſis.</hi> In practice, this diviſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<q>Till this day, theories have often changed, while practice remains the ſame: and it was the doctrine of a celebrated author (Dr. Cullen) that medical hypotheſis is but a chain to link facts together,</q>
(<hi>Analytical Review, Arg.</hi> 1789, <hi>Art.</hi> viii.l I have often been indured to contemplate this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, either from the conſideration that men of great genius and information have adapted it, or from a determined reſolution not to condemn, what, perhaps. I did not properly underſtand. With great reluctance, however, I would have exchanged thoſe ſimple elements that ſo eaſily explain the laws of nature, the phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of life and vegetation, for a metaphiſical theory, which, from the poſitive qualities of bodies and ſubſtances, carries us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſeries of complex and occult modes of action. If a perſon can underſtand all the phenomena of health and life, by the obſcure ideas of excitement being always evolved in a ratio to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the excitability, and exciting powers, which muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bear a due proportion to each other, &amp;c. let him enjoy his conviction. But, why cannot the ſame conviction reſult from the ſimple laws of human life, as anatomy and phiſiology exhibit them to our obſervation? As for the ſucceſs, which might in practice be derived from that theory, it is a delicate matter, and I will not avail myſelf of thoſe ſarcaſtic comments upon it which I have frequently read. This much I can ſay, that I believe the doctrine may be of ſome advantage with men of genius, but I am ſatisfied that it leads to capital miſtakes, thoſe who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect themſelves by it, whilſt they do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034311_0038_0FFC3C1CACD1B970"/>the final reſult of this diſorder, it is equally horrid and inſidious. Penetration and attention are, therefore, the firſt and moſt eſſential requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites to keep us from indulging thoſe erroneous and falſe hopes, which, both the patient and his friends, are too apt to entertain. A turgency of the blood veſſels, or what we call a plethoric ſtate, may, during one or two days, precede the attack, but is ſeldom taken notice of by the patient; and no other previous indiſpoſition can be remarked. Whatever then may be the ſtate of the body, the fever ſuddenly and tumultuouſly breaks out. Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous vomitings of yellow, green, and gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous bile; a depreſſing head ache; a numbneſs of the limbs, and joints; a burning heat in the face; and redneſs in the eyes; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately take place. Such rapid and violent changes in the whole frame, are, I believe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common in any kind of fever, and belong only to the plague. During the two firſt days, this ſtate admits of but little change. Short intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, are, however, ſometimes obtained by means of the remedies which are adminiſtered. The patient may poſſeſs all the other febrile ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; but I have ſeen none of them more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than delirium and coma. We next diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover an ominous and abſolute proſtration of ſtrength, an abatement in the pulſe, an entire ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation of feeling, and an inſidious ſecurity in the patient, who fancies himſelf faſt approaching
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034311_0039_0FFC3C1A700C0898"/>to a recovery, and who only complains of a want of ſtrength. He ſoon after, however, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences frequent and ſhort chills; and his evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are colliquative, foetid, with yellow or white matter. He then ſighs deeply; is reſtleſs; and he cannot even bear the weight of a covering upon his body. He next appears totally inſenſible either to heat or cold; his ſkin is dry; there is no kind of exhalation of diſagreeable ſmell about him, and even very little is perceived from his breath. He has no thirſt, but he can drink any thing. Nauſeous medicines, or agreeable food, are alike received into his ſtomach without ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening it. His tongue as yet portends nothing alarming; it is covered, however, with a kind of thick white cruſt, from the root to the edges, which remain perfectly red. In this ſtate his urine ſeems ſtopped, although he drinks much; and, if he voids any, it is generally purulent. This period of the diſeaſe, in which the deluſion of the patient exiſts, notwithſtanding the ceſſation of his regular functions, is highly expreſſive of the diſorder being unconquerable; and I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to aſſert, that when it is obſerved in the ſecond or third day, it ought to determine the phyſician to give over, without heſitation, the leaſt hope of a recovery. The patient will be in the agonies of death as ſoon as the third day arrives, and never later than the fifth.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Although the patient may be acted upon by medicines, he is certainly deprived of ſalutary evacuations; and chiery of thoſe which we ſhall hereafter deſcribe as the only proof of a ſucceſsful treatment. To be deprived of them, before the third day, is a ſure prognoſtic of death.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The patient complains but little; and a kind of ſtupidity, reſulting from the ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ideas, forms a ſtriking contraſt with the watchfulneſs and the confuſion of his countenance. This ſymptom is more alarming, and is direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly oppoſite to the inquiſitive anxiety and irreſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uneaſineſs of patients in common caſes. Thoſe, therefore, who are beſt acquainted with the natural diſpoſition of the perſon who is ſick, will be beſt able to judge of this deciſive ſymptom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:034311_0041_0FFC3C15E97697F0"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In all his actions the patient ſhews an uncommon degree of ſtrength; while repeated exacerbations of fever, frequent bloodlettings, and want of nouriſhment, ſhould render him very weak. This very ſtrength, however, is unnatural and contrary to the appearance obſerved in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable caſes. It is the effect of an univerſal ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic conſtriction of the nerves, and indicates the dreadful action of the morbid cauſe upon the viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera, and its manifeſted by a kind of trill in the nerves, or by an involuntary fluttering in the muſcles, which we may evidently perceive, if we keep, attentively, during a few minutes, the hand or the arm of the patient in our hand. This laſt ſign claimed my particular notice, and it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways proved ſingularly uſeful to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and laſtly, we may always diſcover, that each of the exacerbations of the fever are preceded by <hi>horripilatio,</hi> or violent chill. After theſe four ſymptoms have taken place, we ſhould never put any dependence either on the pulſe or the tongue; for, whether the pulſe be febrile or not, intermitting or regular, it prognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticates nothing deciſive for the patient, unleſs we can diſtinguiſh it hard, and tenſe, and poſſeſſing a ſpaſmodic and fatal conſtriction. The tongue alſo preſages nothing concluſive; it will be found white or ſoul all over its upper ſurface, and its edges red. If the patient remains for ſome time
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:034311_0042_0FFC3C13B16CB1D8"/>without drink, a triangular red ſpot will appear from the edge to the centre of the tongue. But after a diluting draught this diſappears; and theſe ſtates take place, both in caſes of death and recovery. One appearance of the tongue, however, is omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous in the firſt days of the diſeaſe; which is, when it turns black or brown, before the laſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbation of the fever, which generally ſubſides on the fourth day. Iliccough or an abſolute ſuppreſſion of urine, are likewiſe very dangerous ſymptoms, if they take place before the time of the reſolution of the fever; but if the firſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens after it, it happily conſtitutes the final and ſalutary criſis.</p>
               <p>Another ſymptom uſual in malignant fevers, but particularly in this, is a kind of ſmall red petechiae, very ſimilar to free bites. They appear on the hands, the neck, the breaſt, and alſo on the face. Many ſuppoſe that they are from the bites of muſquitoes, or of other inſects. A phyſician may know better, but cannot derive from them any thing further than a proof of the malignancy of the fever. (Vide caſe No. 4.)</p>
               <p>I dwell more particularly upon theſe apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trifling circumſtances, becauſe they are of the utmoſt importance towards aſſiſting us in our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries. Phyſicians are, alas! pecularly liable to error in a diſorder ſo difficult to judge, and ſo violent in its attacks. From an affectionate regard
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:034311_0043_0FFC3C116FD5AE88"/>to their patients, or from a reaſonable pride in their own medical ſkill, they are ſometimes over confident of their ſucceſs; and too frequently, in the event, the friends of the patient, are unhappily plunged into diſpair, at the diſappointment of their expectations. Would it not be more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, then, in caſes of iminent danger, to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them againſt it; and thus, when the utmoſt of our ſkill is baffled, to deſerve their confidence and gratitude by our candour?</p>
               <p>I now arrive at that fatal period, when, by the deadly effect of the decompoſition and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the animal fluids, all the ſtruggles of nature are entirely overcome. On the fourth day, this period is announced by the paleneſs of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The feelings of the unhappy patient have now loſt ſo much of their power that he is totally incapable of giving any account of his confuſed ſenſations. His ſkin becomes gradually tinged with a yellowiſh colour, while his lower extremities become of a deep red and are a little ſwelled. The eyes looſe that remarkable animation which they before poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and appear deſponding; while the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance becomes confuſed and grim. Nauſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> at this period, is a common ſymptom. If drink be thrown up, it is not altered from the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:034311_0044_0FFC3C0E65162BD0"/>ſtate in which it was taken, unleſs indeed, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving acquired a ropineſs, and being mixed with ſmall flakes of dark coloured matter. A black or brown fluid, much like coffee grounds, is next vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. If this does not take place, it is only owing to a want of ſtrength; and the ſtomach is, then, much more oppreſſed; and the patient may be expected to die early in the fifth day, or ſooner. Stools are alſo frequent and eaſy, but very offenſive. They are yellow, grey, and of a ſooty colour, and contain a few flakes of white or red. Delirium in this ſtage is very common. Frequent inſtances are alſo ſeen of patients preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their reaſon till the laſt moment, (Vide caſe No. 4,) when a cloud ſuffuſes their eyes, and makes them averſe to the light. During all this time, the pulſe is in a deceiving ſtate. It keeps, for the moſt part, quite calm, and is a little febrile, or perhaps not ſo at all. It occaſionally, however, appears intermitting, unequal, and different on one ſide of the body from what it is on the other. This is generally its laſt expreſſion of energy, and may be owing to a ſpaſmodic conſtriction. In ſuch caſes, it ſometimes riſes to an unexpected vigour, and is the forerunner of a temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. The patient talks much of his expected reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and will ſometimes even try, with ſucceſs, to give deceiving proofs of it. He wiſhes to take exerciſe and to purſue his buſineſs. He will get up; want to dreſs himſelf; and will walk very
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:034311_0045_0FFC3C0C2033ED50"/>freely. I have ſeen a few who, on theſe occaſions, were able to ſet in company. Every one was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed, and would remark no other alterations than that of a deep orange colour all over his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, an incoherence in his converſation, and a very confuſed look. How ſhort, alas! and deceiving is this laſt ſpark of life? A cool moiſture and a total proſtration of ſtrength ſucceeds, and ſuddenly conquers this elaſticity of the fibres. On a ſudden, the pulſe diſappears; the extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cool; the convulſions of the ſtomach are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, with accute pains, cauſed by a ſlight preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the abdomen; and a deplorable, though ſhort agony, terminates the diſorder, after having diffuſed a putrifying poiſon in the blood, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed the nobleſt viſcera by mortification. (Vide caſe No. 5.)</p>
               <p>Such are the periods and ſymptoms of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, which has been diſtinguiſhed, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral writers, as a particular ſpecies of the moſt malignant kind. When there exiſts an error in the treatment, or any dangerous circumſtances in the conſtitution of the patient, he muſt certainly fall a victim. The diſeaſe remains the ſame, however, in its nature and operation; and we will find, among thoſe who happily recover, no other chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges than thoſe which conſtitute an iſſue prompted by accidental or unavoidable cauſes, and which take certain modifications from the conſtitution, the ſex, the age, or previous indiſpoſition of the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:034311_0046_0FFC3C0A99891FE8"/>patient. Let us now direct our enquiry further, by a review of the different ſtages of the malady, when it can be conquered by nature or by art.</p>
               <p>It was the doctrine of Hippocrates, that, on the breaking out of any acute malady, there were ſymptoms pointedly prognoſticating its fatal iſſue, or the probability of its cure. Thus he remarked, that, if the patient, on being taken, was diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red involuntarily to ſhed tears, or if he was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with convulſive fits, he would either die, or labour under a very long and dangerous attack. Medical practice, in our day, is, however, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved, and is attended with far different and happier reſults. We have ſeen and known many who have recovered from peſtilential and malignant diſorders, who, at firſt, had exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the moſt portentous ſymptoms. (Vide caſes No. 6 and 7.) Whatever theſe ſymptoms may be, in the firſt day of the diſeaſe, any unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgement muſt be ſuſpended. In fact, if obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indications have been faithfully followed, on the ſecond day, we may diſcover beneficial and critical perſpirations, remiſſions of the fever, and ſalutary evacuations. The latter muſt be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, copious, and of a dark green colour. Inſtead of that proſtration of organic ſtrength, which we have noticed above, the patient complains only of a natural weakneſs; and when he takes refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by a few hours of ſleep, he keeps a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſituation in his bed. Upon comparative obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:034311_0047_0FFC3C079D53C830"/>it muſt be acknowledged, that, inſtead of weakening the organic ſenſations, the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fever irritates and heightens their powers; for, if but a ſight doſe of phyſic be given to the patient it will be very powerfully felt. His taſte is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe equally affected by nauſeous medicines, by refreſhing liquors, and by the moſt wholeſome nouriſhments. The coma and delirium may take place, without being ominous; the pulſe may be rapid and revulſive without a convulſive conſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The leaſt noiſe provokes in him a ſorrowful anxiety; but this ſymptom is for better than a deceiving ſecurity and a portentous ceſſation of his complaints. The fever keeps the patient, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, in this ſituation for three days. On the fourth, the change operates; and is, indeed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with ſome apparently dangerous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which are very critical; but, which, in the end, become ſalutary. The chief of theſe are, the affection of the ſtomach, and its repeated nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, joined to frequent vomitings, attended with a pain which a gentle preſſure accutely exaſperates. Proper medical aſſiſtance gradually relieves this and other acciedents; but, until the ſixth day, no ſafe proofs of a good iſſue are to be perceived. Should, however, a few paroxiſns of fever be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, ſo much the better, provided they are unattended with a chill. Theſe will ſerve to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine a happy reſolution; for the yellow fever, when treated with ſucceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The yellowneſs of the ſkin uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears after the exacerbation of the fifth day. It is not interſperſed with any ſhade or red ſpots, and there are ſcarcely any which are apparent on the extremities. This jaundice begins to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the ſeventh day. In the beginning, the tongue does not much differ from what I have above deſcribed in the worſt caſes. In theſe caſes however, it every day acquires a more uniform paleneſs, or ſmall red ſpots; and upon the whole ſeems of a more ſpongy and porous ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>It is a general obſervation in medicine, that in proportion as the reſolution of an acute diſeaſe is perfect, the weaker the patient afterwards feels himſelf. This ſtate of the body is alſo, one of the beſt means by which we can judge of the ſafety of organic life. Agreeably to theſe principles, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient who recovers from the yellow fever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes great exertions and a very difficult ſtruggle. In this exhauſted ſtate, he is doomed to a tedious convaleſcence, and may eſteem himſelf happy if he recover from it in a ſpace of time equal to that of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Several other circumſtances more particularly deſignating the character of the yellow fever, when carried to a ſucceſsful iſſue, remain to be mentioned.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I frequently ſaw the firſt of theſe in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and it proved fatal or not, according to the pathological rules of Boerrhaave:

               <p>The ſecond has occurred, though ſeldom, in my practice. When it did appear, it was perfect, and generally ſucceeded on the fifth day, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways immediately reſolved the malady.</p>

               <p>The fifth frequently took place as a pain, but never as a ſuppuration.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, the only critical diagnoſtics which have been peculiar to the yellow fever of Philadelphia, were, the hemorrhage and the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the parotids<note n="*" place="bottom">The firſt were commonly from the noſe among men, and from the uterus among women of a competent age.</note>; but theſe very diagnoſtics, together with the jaundice, were either favourab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſymptoms of forerunners of certain death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time in which they appeared. In fact, we learn, by the pathology of the human body, that, in all acute diſorders, Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a certain ſpace of time either to cure, to reſolve, or to diſperſe the morbid cauſe under which the body is labouring; and the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect proof that the attempts of art or of nature have failed is when we too early diſcover incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete effects or a falſe criſis. Of theſe however, an explanation will be given in the ſection on the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the yellow fever; notwithſtanding I ſhall explain the real pathology of one of the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid diſorders that ever afflicted the human race.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:034311_0051_0FFC3BFE612B39E8"/>I here repeat with confidence that nothing but facts will be the baſis of a theory that has no connection with any new ſyſtem, and which will be an anſwer to theſe queſtions why the yellow fever is attended with ſpontaneous vomitings of the bile, with a jaundice, with black vomit, &amp;c.?</p>
               <p>The opinion that the yellow fever is a true bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious one, and differs only in degree, which is the higheſt and the moſt malignant, has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready known and ſatisfactorily proved by Dr. B. Ruſh<note n="*" place="bottom">Account of the bilious remitting yellow fever, &amp;c. in the year 1793, by B. Ruſh. M. D.</note>. With this principle as a guide, many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, ſyſtems and conjectures might have been long ſince diſpelled, or at leaſt better explained. The hiſtory of its ſymptoms, exhibits, in the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner, the corruption and malignancy of the bile. As ſoon as the patient is ſeized, he ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly vomits bile; and if he recover, it is by the means of ſucceſsful and copious evacuations of hepatic and cyſtic bile. If he die, it is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in conſequence of the mixture of the bile with the blood, and the mortification of all its viſcera and reſervoirs. All the anxieties, nauſea, pains, obſtructions, and exacerbations of fever, in every caſe, ſeem evidently cauſed by the fermentation, the ſtagnation, and the acrimony of the bile. In ſhort, if morbid bodies be examined by defection, new ravages of the bile are alſo diſcovered. From
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:034311_0052_0FFC3BFBD69D5E20"/>theſe facts, what other inferences can be drawn, but that of fixing the pathology of the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in thoſe laws and accidents that are connected with the bile. In order then to eſtabliſh ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ground, let us firſt enquire to what uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form cauſe we may attribute all the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>Hippocrates has obſerved<note n="*" place="bottom">Aphor. 62. Sect. IV.</note>, that autumnal fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were attended with jaundice, in conſequence of people living upon rich beef, and Boer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haave admits acrid bile and poiſon among the cauſes of the worſt kind of jaundice. The liver, from its nature and functions, receives a great quantity of blood from the <hi>venaporta,</hi> to prepare the bile; we may therefore conclude, that diſeaſes of that viſcera, might diſturb or alter the bile, and <hi>vice verſa.</hi> But, if a poiſonous exhalation has, by its affinity with the bile, diffuſed itſelf in the alimentary canal, it is very probable that the infection will early reach, by many known paſſages, its very ſource; and the liver, the gall bladder, the duodenum, the ſtomach, &amp;c. will then be diſeaſed by a poiſoned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Another ſtriking proof in favour of this theory, may alſo be drawn from the march of the diſeaſe in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering patient.

Were no improvement to be expected from repeated inſtances of the ſame facts, any ſcientifical attempt would no longer the praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, nor repeated inveſtigation meritorious. My theoretical conjecture, however, that the calorie of a hot ſummer, might produce, by the abſorption of aqueous particles, the fermentation or putrefaction of the blood, and thus create a malignant fever, is the natural reſult of adopted elements and principles. By the help of theſe, we never fall into contradictory opinions, although we are liable to miſtaken applications. Beſides, I had long ſince ſuſpected that contagious effluvia might contaminate and corrupt the animal fluids, as well as that they might be altered by the loſs of ſome of their component parts; and this was my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the above mentioned diſſertation.

Method of Treatment of the Yellow Fever.</head>
               <p>WITHIN theſe laſt five years, the period in which the yellow fever has made its general appearance in America, ſeveral methods of treatment have been publiſhed here; and the ſame ſubject has alſo been ably diſcuſſed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eminent Weſt-India writers. I will not, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, attempt to comment or decide upon the reſpective merits of either; but, I muſt confeſs, that I have never yet been able ſufficiently to diſcover by what indications the uſe of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies was to be directed. Thus it frequently happens that they ſometimes ſucceed and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not; and the mercury, bleedings, bark, cold or warm baths, acids, bliſters, &amp;c. often fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even in the hands of thoſe who contended the moſt warmly for their application. If they afterwards attempted to explain under what circumſtances their propoſed method has fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they have generally offered vague pretences and uncertain rules. Let us then, with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, declare this unexceptionable rule in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, that no method of cure ſhould ever be depended on, unleſs it be founded on ſuch
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:034311_0058_0FFC3BEE42E85E98"/>rational grounds that the remedies employed will anſwer, under every circumſtance, the indications of the diſeaſe. Experience has, at laſt, proved that bleeding and mercury are ſufficiently powerful to conquer the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant degrees of the yellow fever; yet, in the uſe of theſe remedies, the greateſt care and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection are requiſite in order to inſure their ſucceſs. Before I enter upon the explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my method of treatment of the yellow fever, and of the proper mode of adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering theſe fundamental remedies, ſuffer me, gentlemen, to obſerve, that, in America at leaſt, Dr. B. Ruſh has the honour to ſtand foremoſt in ſupport of their efficacy. While no other method ſeemed equally ſucceſsful, that of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſection and calomel was ſupported, during the two inſtances of our calamity, notwithſtanding the moſt bitter invectives and ſarcaſtic publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were continually levelled againſt it. Some unfortunate and unſucceſsful caſes were held out as proofs of its danger; and the charge of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and indiſcriminate bleeding was exbited as a murderous practice. Theſe objections, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when weighed with impartiality, will be found to reſult from the unavoidable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of a temporary and violent epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic. One may ariſe from the <hi>method of indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which cannot, in caſes ſo uncommon, be equally well-underſtood by every phyſician; and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:034311_0059_0FFC3BECB67FB4B8"/>the other, from the impoſſibility of conducting the ſick with regularity and diſpatch, among ſo great a number of patients, who are often deprived even of the neceſſary accommodations, or who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently miſtake their own caſes; and who, in the height of their deſpondency, communicate their terrors to the attendants. Too <hi>profuſe and indiſcriminate</hi> bloodletting, may have occurred in ſeveral inſtances; but I am happy in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, as far as I am acquainted with them, they could not be fairly derived either from the private or public opinions of Dr. Ruſh. It is, therefore, peculiarly pleaſing to me, that I am thus able, in ſome meaſure, to vindicate the character of an eminent and humane phyſician; and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſo, becauſe in ſome points of theory I may be found to diſſent from him.</p>
               <p>It is only from the pathology of the yellow fever, that any ſafe or efficacious rules for its cure can be derived. For every judicious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, will candidly acknowledge, that, if the numerous remedies which have hitherto been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended for the yellow fever, have produced a cure, they have likewiſe too frequently failed. If then it be a fact, that the contagion peculiarly connects itſelf with the bile, and corrupts it, we may clearly and ſafely eſtabliſh, as a <hi>firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi> that the bile ought to be ſpeedily eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, purified, and renewed. If it be true, that
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:034311_0060_0FFC3BE992C1DD58"/>the morbid ſtate of the bile cauſes its ſtagnation, produces obſtructions in the liver, and prevents the entrance of a conſiderable quantity of blood into that large viſcera, we may point out as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>fundamental indication,</hi> the neceſſity of ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily oppoſing the immenſe revulſion of the blood in the arterial ſyſtem, which increaſes the general ſpaſms, together with all the ſymptoms of inflammation, and which continually endangers the life of the patient<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>I find with pleaſure that the theory of this pathology has been already adopted by reſpectable writers, and has been aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the bilious fevers of warm countries, among which our yellow fever is of the firſt and moſt malignant degree.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Whenever there is a deficiency in the powers of the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating ſyſtem, the larger veſſels are diſtended, particularly the vena portarum; this cauſes the bilious evacuations in warm climates.</q>

To give, however, gentlemen, a
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:034311_0061_0FFC3BE80A29B710"/>more explanatory view of <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>ſecondary indications,</hi> for the mode of treatment of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, ſuffer me to exemplify them by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing hiſtorical caſe, wherein I ſhall notice the minuteſt circumſtances, both with regard to the diſeaſe and to the medical preſcriptions which were adminiſtered.</p>
               <p>T ... B ... about twenty-two years of age, was of a ſound conſtitution, and of a regular life. He had lately loſt his father and a brother in the prevailing fever. After their death, he, with the reſt of the family, went into the country; but he had already been infected with the contagion. This was ſoon manifeſted by all the alarming ſymptoms, but chiefly by the ſpontaneous puking of the bile. He was immediately carried back to town, where proper aſſiſtance might be obtained; and, before a phyſician could be ſent for, an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced nurſe had ordered him to be copiouſly bled, and had given him a doſe of ſalts. Theſe orders were good but inſufficient, and nothing further was done until the evening of the ſecond day. At this time I was called in, when I found him extremely ill, and very nearly approaching to that proſtration of organic action which does not even give time for an exacerbation of fever. Having juſt loſt his parent and a brother with this ſame diſeaſe, he could not but conſider himſelf alſo as a devoted victim. His ſpirits were, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:034311_0062_0FFC3BE518699E58"/>uncommonly low, and he appeared invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to shed tears. This circumſtance, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the rule of Hippocrates, I conſidered as an ominous and fatal prognoſtic. A confuſed and gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

All the good effects that might have reſulted from the firſt copious bleeding had been loſt; ſince no proper help had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

To obtain, therefore, this deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble change, I depended much upon the action of the mind on the nerves, and eadeavoured much to raiſe the hope and confidence of the deſpairing patient. Whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e, they acquired a ſenſible energy. His extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities became warm; and, wiſhing to remove every obſtacle to the operations of the treatment, I immediately ordered a carminative and nitrous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Thus I conſidered that the previous congeſtion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the foeces might be diſcharged, and that the ſubſequent and neceſſary evacuations could no lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>r be retarded. At night, the patient was, agreeably to my wiſhes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:034311_0063_0FFC3BE2CBDC29D0"/>ſeized with a violent exacerbation of fever, attended with delirium. This ſtate gave the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, indication of a copious bleeding; for by it I fulfilled the ſecond fundamental indication abovementioned, viz. that of emptying the blood-veſſels, when the blood can be no longer admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the liver, and when the large veſſels are in a ſtate of infection. Agreeably to this indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the patient loſt fifteen ounces of blood on the night of the ſecond day. Without loſing-time, the bile was to be evacuated; for a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able relaxation, and an abſolute ceſſation of ſpaſms, irritation, and inflammation, always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a copious bleeding, and at this time the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines have conſequently more power. I direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the patient, therefore, to take immediately, and every two hours after, a doſe of calomel <hi>gvi.</hi> jalap, <hi>gx.</hi> and ſcamm. of Alep. <hi>gii..</hi> This preſcription was to be alternately followed with proper diluting and cooling drinks. On the third day, the medicine operated ſatisfactorily; for a prodigious quantity of green or cyſtic bile was evacuated. The pulſe, however, exhibited a ſtate of conſtriction, and the ſtomach was ſick.</p>
               <p>Let us now venture a few conjectures on theſe unfavourable ſymptoms. Among the remedies which we employ, there are many, whoſe power and efficacy we can underſtand and analyſe; but there are others alſo which may anſwer all our
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:034311_0064_0FFC3BE142752298"/>wiſhes, without our being able to account for their ſucceſsful operation. Thus, if in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt foldings and cavities of our viſcera, there exiſt a corrupted fluid which we wiſh to evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, it is obvious that venefection, affecting the whole ſyſtem and diſtending the nerves and the veſſels, will operate on each diſeaſed part; yet how does it happen that a mercurial powder ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obtains the ſecretion of the hepatic and cyſtic bile? This circumſtance, as well as that of the ſame effect being produced by the regulus of antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, when taken into the ſtomach, cannot as yet be explained. In the caſe now under contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, twelve grains of calomel, mixed with other draſtics, was ſufficient to evacuate a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of cyſtic bile. It was not, therefore, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that by a continued action of the mercury another quantity of bile might be forced out and ſecreted from the liver to the duodenum and the ſtomach. It was the acridity of this bile which cauſed the conſtriction of the pulſe, and which ſickened the ſtomach. Under theſe circumſtances I conſidered it ſafer to effect its evacuation by a vomit than otherwiſe; and I conſequently order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an emetic. It produced the happieſt effects; for, at the cloſe of the third day, the patient had ſcarcely any inflammatory ſymptoms, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a viſible remiſſion of fever. His ſkin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared moiſt; and his countenance was more cool and placid. All his ſenſations were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:034311_0065_0FFC3BDEF97AC478"/>affected by the comforts of a good bed, and a room warmed and purified by a chimney fire.</p>
               <p>It ſhould appear, gentlemen, that our patient is now brought, from the moſt perilous ſtate to the point of recovery. The <hi>moles movenda</hi> of the arterial ſyſtem, and of the large infarcted veſſels; have been relieved, and the contaminated bile evacuated. Thus, therefore, two important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications have been timely fulfilled; and the actual ſtate of the patient appears to be that of the <hi>vis vitae,</hi> which always marks the beginning of the convaleſcence. But you will remember that the laſt indication has not yet been obtained, and that, within a certain ſpace of time, it muſt be effected either by natural or artificial exertions. This indication has already been deſcribed as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the depuratory criſis of the whole flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids, when they have been more or leſs contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; and it compriſes all the <hi>ſecondary ones</hi> for the treatment of malignant and bilious remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. It is beyond the power of medicine to abridge the courſes and periods of theſe fevers. But, notwithſtanding their different ſtages cannot be ſo accurately traced as would enable us to form a nomenclature, yet ſome general rules have been deduced; and, upon the authority of theſe, it muſt be allowed, that the bilious remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, like the <hi>cauſos</hi> or <hi>febris ardens,</hi> muſt laſt four or ſeven days, and may even be protracted
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:034311_0066_0FFC3BDD70408DE8"/>to nine or fourteen. Exceptions to this march are very ſcarce; and the caſe No. 6, which was perfectly reſolved in three days, I never could account for in any other way than the following. By the <hi>primary</hi> effects of the contagion on the bile, the patient did not receive its <hi>ſecondary</hi> tranſmiſſion into the blood, and had not conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the elaboration of nature to ſuffer, but was cured as ſoon as the evacuations of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patic and cyſtic bile were obtained.</p>
               <p>But, gentlemen, the illneſs of my young pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient did not end at the point I have laſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for I ſoon diſcovered another paroxiſm of fever. For the relief of this I preſcribed gentle remedies, ſuch as carminative injections and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting draughts; and previous warm bath had been applied to the inferior extremities and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen. You will thus perceive, that I conſider mild operations only as deſirable, during the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acerbations of the fever, except that bleeding is requiſite when its inflammatory characters are too high. In the preſent caſe, I could ſee no urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſity for veneſection; for the bile had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been evacuated, and the remiſſion of the ſymptoms and fever had been regular and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Beſides endeavouring to preſerve the life of his patient, a phyſician ſhould be careful in the uſe of thoſe means which, by their frequency, may create other diſeaſes, or render the convale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:034311_0067_0FFC3BD9AFAE96B8"/>very long and perilous. On the night of the fourth day, the fever of the patient was ſo violent, that, in his delirium, he got up and went naked into ſeveral corners of the houſe. How wonderful, gentlemen, are the exertions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture when ſhe is properly aſſiſted! As ſoon as this exacerbation was over, the patient had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral copious diſcharges of bile; red petechiae were obſerved on his breaſt and arms; and his ſalivary glands being a little affected, he had a ſalutary and frequent ſpitting. The criſis pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the malady was now beginning to appear. The redneſs of the ſkin began gradually to change to a whitiſh hue, which I judged would, at a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time, turn yellow. What were then my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; what was I to do; and what had I to expect? The revulſion of the blood from the veins into the arterial ſyſtem was certainly finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the corrupted bile, by which the liver was infarcted, was ſecreting and diffuſing partly in the bowels, and partly in the blood. Mercurial draſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics were ſtill neceſſary; and, by their means, I again procured copious evacuations of yellow bile which was probably from the liver. On the fifth day, the yellowneſs was viſible; a quantity of this ſtagnant bile having mixed with the blood. It was then neceſſary to accelerate and ſtimulate the circulation by ſudorifics and tonics; and the ſtomach, being languid and exhauſted, ſome reſtorative and nouriſhing ſubſtances were
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:034311_0068_0FFC3BD827861A60"/>to be adminiſtered. Thus, from the fifth to the ſixth day, the patient was aſſiſted, and enjoyed ſome natural ſleep. His fever had been very moderate and attended with but little delirium. On the ſixth, obſerving no further exiſting cauſe of irritation, I ordered a mild nitrous cathartic to keep up the motion of the bowels, and to prepare, by natural evacuations, if poſſible, the approaching final reſolution of the malady. This took place, during the night of the ſeventh day, by an equal and profuſe perſpiration, by copious urines, containing a thick yellow ſediment, and by repeated diſcharges from the bowels.. I then deſired that the patient ſhould be put in clean linen and in another bed. I muſt not, however, omit obſerving, that the ſheets and clothes with which he had been covered during the laſt days of his illneſs, were ſpotted with a kind of yellow purulent matter, and had a very offenſive ſmell. This circumſtance is always a ſtriking proof of the final depuratory criſis terminating a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever, and more peculiarly exhaling the contagious miaſmata of the yellow fever.</p>
               <p>From this moment, the patient could not, with any probability, experience any further exacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of fever; and he wanted no further aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance than ſuch as is neceſſary to convale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents. He was in this ſtate during five or ſix days, and a gradual nouriſhment, with two grains of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:034311_0069_0FFC3BD5E7A5FA88"/>opium, given at night, were for ſome time adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. This remedy is very reſtorative after acute and dangerous diſeaſes. It calms the general ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation of the viſcera; it fixes the oſcillation of the nerves; it procures repoſe and comfort; it gives ſome tonic power to the alimentary chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; and, infine, it helps the diſperſion of the yellow ſerum remaining in the cellular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</p>
               <p>A ſcrutiniſing peruſal of the preceding caſe, will, perhaps, gentlemen, afford a better idea of my method of treatment of the yellow fever, than any treatiſe I could give. I ſhall, therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this ſection with the following propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> The pathology of the yellow fever ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts three indications to be obſerved in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of treatment. The firſt is the ſpeedy eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation and renovation of the corrupted and acrib bile; the ſecond, to counteract the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of inflammation and to diſcuſs the congeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the large blood veſſels, which cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge into the liver; and the laſt, to aſſiſt the depuratory criſis of the whole ſyſtem, which is to be effected within a certain ſpace of time, and by natural or artificial means.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The calomel is a ſpecific of unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſucceſs, to evacuate the hepatic and cyſtic bile; provided its action be directed towards the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:034311_0070_0FFC3BD39C7C3C80"/>bowels, by being united with other draſtics. As a ſialagogue it may be favourable: and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, applied externally, cannot be uſeful but in the laſt indication.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The firſt indication will be alſo ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſiſted by the uſe and action of an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial emetic; but, before this and the calomel could be efficaciouſly adminiſtered, the ſyſtom muſt be brought to a conſiderable relaxation and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ceſſation of the inflammatory ſymptoms.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> Profuſe and repeated bleedings are the only ſure means of abating the inflammation, and of fulfilling all the views of the ſecond indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which occur at the exacerbation of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. There may, however, be ſome advantage in ſparing the blood; but, during the three firſt days, not to take enough of it would be fatal.</p>
               <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> The laſt indication requires all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical rules for the treatment of malignant fevers within a certain ſpace of time; but the two firſt muſt be completely obſerved within three days; for, in the latter period, the contagious miaſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta may already have contaminated all the animal fluids and mortified ſeveral viſcera.</p>
               <p n="6">6<hi>thly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> With the above indications, rules, and remedies, in conjunction with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing practical cautions, the treatment of the

               <p>THIS was one of the cautions laid down by the immortal father of the medical art, who was poſſeſſed of all the treaſures both of judgment and experience.
<q>All that is too much is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Nature;</q>
and even our important diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of a ſpecific and of remedies for the yellow fever, will become dangerous if we adminiſter them without proportion or reſtraint. I ſhall, therefore, gentlemen, proceed to conſider a few important cautions in veneſection and the uſe of mercury for the cure of the yellow fever, and then enumerate ſuch other objects as relate merely to the patient.</p>
               <p>It is a well authenticated fact, that frequent ſucceſs has attended profuſe blood letting in the yellow fever. If the injudicious and illiberal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:034311_0072_0FFC3BCF16EADDF8"/>that have been levelled againſt it during our late calamity, have deſtroyed the confidence of ſome of the patients and their attendants, it has been owing to the force of ridicule which is too apt to ſeduce unreflecting minds. But time and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience lead to truth and will ſurmount every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle. When the celebrated Moliere had, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral dramatic pieces, painted the medical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in the moſt ludicrous colours, the public laughed at the ignorance of pretended phyſicians. But the reſult was, that a more juſt diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was afterwards made between them and practitioners of genuine reſpectability. However, the public will doubtleſs readily acknowledge that facts and principles will always ſtand forth againſt every ſarcaſtic aſſailant. To thoſe who think that indiſcriminate bloodletting was recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a ſpecific in the yellow fever, we would remark, that the principles held out by phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ought always to be examined with imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and attention. We ſay, it is true, that, for the cure of the yellow fever, we muſt bleed early and as copiouſly as fifteen or twenty ounces at a time; that, in each exacerbation of fever, during the three firſt days, bleeding ought to be free in proportion to the apparent inflammatory ſymptoms or elevation of the pulſe; that the ſtagnation of the bile in the liver and other viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera infarcted, ſuſpending the circulation of the blood in the large veſſels, ought partly to be
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:034311_0073_0FFC3BCCD8C0D290"/>conſidered as an immediate cauſe of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and partly requiring a great depletion of blood; that the power and efficacy of mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial draſtic doſes, being always in a ratio to the relaxation of the ſyſtem, it will be previouſly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to relax by bleeding, and this perhaps as often as they are adminiſtered; that the meaſure of bloodletting has no bounds but that of a viſible and favourable change, and no terms to its reiteration, but the marked period where the effects of the malady are irrevocably fixe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for death or recovery. After admitting theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules, two cautions ariſe from pathological principles, viz. the time of bleeding and the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of blood to be taken. If veneſection pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſuch powerful changes in the equilibrium of the animal fluids, and if it relaxes the ſolids, we ought not to have recourſe to it, without a ſtrict attention to the ſtage of the malady, to the exacerbation of the fever, and to the formation of certain criſes. 1<hi>ſt,</hi> During the three firſt days of the fever, this remedy will doubtleſs anſwer all the aforeſaid indications and purpoſes; but, when the effects of the contagion are diffuſed in the viſcera and blood, as is generally the caſe after the third day, bloodletting may anſwer very well for certain ſecondary ſymptoms, but would then be uſeleſs for primary indications; and even if the patient was likely to recover, ſuch means as have an enweakening tendency, would only retard
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:034311_0074_0FFC3BC921AA4D28"/>the favourable event. Hence ariſes the practical caution of ſparing blood, if poſſible, after the third day. 2<hi>dly,</hi> As the exacerbation of the fever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits all the extent and degrees of the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ſymptoms, it affords the beſt opportunity of judging of the neceſſary quantity of blood to be taken. At this period, alſo, the blood-veſſels are infarcted or are in a ſtate of congeſtion; while, at any other, nature ſeems to reſt, and it is perhaps better to let her help the patient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbing the criſes and operations of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Hence ariſes the practical method of bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the very moment of exacerbation; but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom before and never immediately after. For, in the firſt caſe, we may retard it, when it is eſſentially neceſſary, and in the ſecond, we intervert its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and render them incomplete. 3<hi>ly,</hi> We have already noticed, that the admiſſion of the bile into the blood, the hemorrhage, eruptions on the ſkin, &amp;c. were criſes of the diſeaſe, and that when one or many of them take place, the fate of the patient is decided. If he has not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, been bled, before theſe ſymptoms take place, it is ſeldom in his favour; and if a caſe ſhould happen, in which nature, without the aſſiſtance of bloodletting, ſhould effect the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diſeaſe, it muſt be owing to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted ſtate of the whole maſs of forces and fluids. If then, theſe happy effects can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to ſuch a ſtate, we muſt be careful not to
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:034311_0075_0FFC3BC793DCD2D8"/>commit the iſſue of a recovery, or create irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable accidents, by a diminution of theſe forces and fluids. Hence ariſes another practical caution of ſparing the blood after the appearance of one or more of the criſes. It would be very difficult and almoſt impoſſible to trace all thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which are to be diſcovered and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by accurate attention and judgment. One inſtance, however, in the caſe of T. B. above related, may ſerve to illuſtrate the caution upon bloodletting. His ſituation ſeemed to require a third bleeding, and but little danger could have reſulted from it. It will be remembered, that he had been copiouſly bled at firſt, while in the country, and that, deprived of any further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he remained without medical aſſiſtance till the latter end of the ſecond day. At this time, he was in the moſt alarming ſituation, and I wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted anxiouſly for the ſecond exacerbation, which took place in the night, and indicated a ſecond copious bleeding. Its effects were ſo favourable, and it produced ſo happy a change, that, at the time of the approach of the third exacerbation, I was convinced it would be regular, and not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with too much inflammatory diatheſis; for the patient had ſtill continued to evacuate bile. I then left it entirely to the forces of nature. It was indeed violent; but its effects preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted regular criſes as far as medical rules deſignate. Infine, I concluded, that if this laſt
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:034311_0076_0FFC3BC5F871BCD0"/>exacerbation could, without bleeding, be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with many favourable ſymptoms, I might continue the treatment without uſing it any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I afterwards received the greateſt benefit from this reſerve; for it rendered the convale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence of the patient very ſhort. This generally is the caſe with thoſe who loſe but little blood<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Lieutand, phyſician of the late king of France, has proved that profuſe bleeding cauſes ſuch a relaxation of all the blood veſſels, as greatly to enlarge their capacities, which, by admitting more blood than is neceſſary, creates all the maladies incident to a plethoric ſtate. It will, conſequently, be of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſervice to our patient to ſpare as much blood as poſſible. The mercurial draſtics ſhould be given immediately after bloodletting, as they will then produce a more efficacious effect; and, as the exacerbations after the third day till the end of the fever, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways decreaſing, it muſt be concluded, that, admitting the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy indiſpenſable during the three firſt days, neceſſity will hardly be found for more than three or four veneſections.</note>. (Vide caſe 7.)</p>
               <p>The exhibition of the calomel, in the yellow fever, will preſent to us more important and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>objectionable grounds of caution, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trace the different modes of the operation of this precious medicine, in order to confine its uſe to what abſolutely requires it. We have ſeen that, as a draſtic purge, it was particularly adapted to the excretion of the hepatic and cyſtic bile. To this ſtriking circumſtance, we cannot help aſcribing the repeated ſucceſs of thoſe phyſicians who firſt recommended the uſe of this medicine. We are
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:034311_0077_0FFC3BC3006E2F08"/>alſo acquainted with its effects as a ſialogogue or ſalivating remedy; ſince many phyſicians have thought that this kind of operation could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by it only, and could be depended upon. Infine, the uſe of mercury, in the form of oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has been applied in many caſes of the yellow fever, and I ſhall therefore, examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will thus anſwer ſome uſeful purpoſes or not. From theſe preliminaries, gentlemen, I ſhall derive only one propoſition, for practical caution reſpecting the uſe of mercury, including all my own rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The calomel, or mercurius dulcis, ſhould never be adminiſtered as a ſalivating remedy in the yellow fever. It is ſufficient to direct its action towards the bowels by the help of other powerful draſtics. It will aſſiſt the criſis of the ſuppuration of the paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tids if it can take place. The external application of mercury will not effect an evacuation of the bile, and could not anſwer but for the depuration of the ſyſtem if the patient had not exacerbations of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but in this hypotheſis the remedy muſt prove uſeleſs and dangerous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Several important queſtions ariſe from the preceding propoſition. What are the objections againſt the ſalivating method? Is the criſis of the ſwelling and ſuppuration of the parotids differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from common ſalivation? Can it take place
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:034311_0078_0FFC3BC175122E80"/>in the yellow fever without the action of mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? If it is a ſucceſsful criſis, why do we avoid exciting it? And finally, if a mercurial prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, taken internally, is allowed to be a good ſpecific, why does another ſimple mercurial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, applied externally, prove uſeleſs or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous? Let us now reſume each of theſe queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and candidly inveſtigate them, unattended with a lengthy and ſcientifical collection of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, with which I ſuppoſe my medical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well acquainted. In every kind of complaint there is not one of thoſe revolutions or admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble criſes in the frame, which are excited by the combined action of remedies, with a view of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a ceſſation of the diſorder, that is not an exact imitation of what the natural and ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous laws would accompliſh, if they were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. The beſt, therefore, we can do is what nature frequently operates without our aſſiſtance, and often before it can even be obtained. Thus, among all the ſingular circumſtances to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked at the end or reſolution of malignant fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the ſwelling and ſuppuration of the glands and parotids has been noticed as one of the moſt favourable criſes, and I have already obſerved that Pouppe Deſportes, in his deſcription of the malady of Siam, had particularly noticed its final and ſucceſsful operation. To his authority I could ſubjoin that of many phyſiological writers. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience alſo has exhibited to me ſeveral inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:034311_0079_0FFC3BBE43ABD1C0"/>of the moſt perfect and ſucceſsful ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parotids, in the yellow fever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much mercury or none at all. (Vide caſes No. 8 and 10.) I do not doubt, gentlemen, but to this criſis, which is not uncommon, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for the conſiſtent and bold attempt of the phyſicians who firſt diſcovered the ſucceſs of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomel in the yellow fever. They did not perhaps notice, that it cured by its draſtic power, and that a ſucceeding ſuppuration of the parotids was rather a ſpontaneous criſis, than the effect of the remedy. But if this be ſo, there are others alſo which ſpontaneouſly prognoſticate a perfect cure in all malignant fevers, as well as in our epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic. Theſe are yellowneſs, profuſe evacuations from the bowels, hemorrhages, tranſudation of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted blood from the lips<note n="*" place="bottom">This is one of the moſt ſingular criſes I ever ſaw; and, as it occurs but ſeldom to practitioners, I think it deſerves deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſubject was a poor man, of about thirty years of age. He was in the third day of his fever, entirely in the hands of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and deſtitute of any proper aſſiſtance. Although he was very ill, the uſual medical aſſiſtance operated ſo favourably, that I deſired he might not be ſent to the hoſpital. On the fifth day, ſome blood ran from different parts of his lips; where it ſoon har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and thickened ſo much, that he could hardly received any thing into his mouth. The leaſt motion or violence would cauſe a new hemorrhage. On the ſeventh day, the yellowneſs appeared much leſs than is common; but the ſize and weight of thoſe black ſcabs were ſo great, that they reached the noſtrils, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the reſpiration very difficult. The patient was in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt torture, and made a hideous appearance. I ordered the lips to be waſhed with ſome warm mucilage. A few pieces of ſcab were ſoon detached, but new beds formed again though much thinner. They gradually diminiſhed during the convaleſcence, which was otherwiſe rapid and regular.</note>, &amp;c. All theſe criſes,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:034311_0080_0FFC3BBCAE0B7DA8"/>which are equally good when they take place at a proper time, appear various in different kinds of malignant fever. Thus, the yellowneſs is particularly characteriſtic of our fever, and the lymphatic ſwellings, in the ſame manner, deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the plague, &amp;c. But, if in both diſeaſes, the ſuppuration of the parotids could be excited, by art or nature, the one would not be attended with a jaundice, nor the other with a ſwelling; for there is never more than one criſis peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly ſpontaneous. The moſt convincing proof, however, that the ſuppuration of the parotids ought to be conſidered as a ſpontaneous criſis in this fever, may be derived from the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which every practitioner muſt have made on the progreſs, ſtages, and ſpace of time, through which a ſalivation is commonly artificially ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Few inſtances are found, even among de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate patients, in which it breaks out in leſs than eight days, and it generally takes two or three weeks. As much time is afterwards neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to obtain, by it, a ceſſation of the exiſting ſymptom or diſeaſe. Now, it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that five or ſix days only embrace all the periods and iſſue of the yellow fever. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if a ſuppuration of the parotids takes
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:034311_0081_0FFC3BB981B84EC0"/>place, it will rather be ſpontaneous, than be the reſult of a few doſes of calomel; for the courſe of the diſeaſe is too rapid to depend upon its ſalivating effects. But if the criſes of a ſwelling and ſuppuration of the parotids is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſpontaneous reſult, peculiar to one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, and not to another; if it be a mere chance to receive it, as well as to be favoured with another as hemorrhage, flux of the bowels, &amp;c. will it be prudent to adminiſter the calomel as a ſalivary medicine only? Will not the ſafety of ſo rapid and violent a diſorder be committed to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain effect? And will not the treatment be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an obſtacle to ſuch means as nature em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys to get rid of the imminent morbid cauſe?</p>
               <p>To enforce this argument, we muſt examine what indications, facts, and theories, have united in ſupport of calomel. This medicine has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a peculiar efficacy in evacuating the bile, and in cleaning the infarcted liver; and I truſt that no ſyſtematic practitioner will deny the truth of this fact. Why then do they prefer an uncertain operation to that which is as eaſily and as well produced in all ſubjects? Why would they endanger the iſſue of the malady, by fixing the whole effects of the mercury upon the primae viae, in order to confine its action on the ſaliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glands only, and thus render it uſeleſs in the evacuation of the <hi>ſpecific contagion,</hi> at a time when
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:034311_0082_0FFC3BB7F5593618"/>the moſt urging neceſſity calls for it? Why would they give time to the poiſoned bile to injure its reſervoirs, and then, by pouring into the blood, infect the whole ſyſtem? Why would they believe that the evacuation of that <hi>ſpecific contagion</hi> can be better effected by means of the ſalivary glands than by the natural excretory organs, as long as its ſources in the viſcera are not emptied? Such, however, would be the effects of adopting exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively the idea of ſalivation by calomel for the cure of the yellow fever.</p>
               <p>In dwelling a little longer, upon a ſubject of ſo much importance, I do not, gentlemen, fear to be tedious; and I truſt I ſhall be excuſed when I attribute many unſucceſsful inſtances of our treatment of the yellow fever, by calomel and bleeding, to the neglect of the conſiderations I ſhall now ſubmit to your attention. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obſerved, that when the hepatic and cyſtic bile are evacuated, the ſyſtem remained more or leſs infected; becauſe the large blood veſſels, which pour into the liver, and receive its blood again, muſt have waſhed off enough of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious bile. I alſo ſtated, that to repair ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, a general depuratory criſis was afterwards to take place, within a certain ſpace of time, and by natural or artificial means. As this phyſiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical rule cannot be denied, it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, by every practitioner, that it would be
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:034311_0083_0FFC3BB5078C4FE0"/>impoſſible, as well as improper, to excite, in every patient, the ſame final and depuratory criſis. They will remember, that, in a woman, it may, perhaps, take place by a diſcharge from the ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, and in men, by perſpiration, hemorrhages<note n="*" place="bottom">I remember ſeeing, during the late calamity, a publication in one of the newſpapers of Philadelphia, in which the writer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to prove the neceſſity of bleeding in the yellow fever, by the frequent hemorrhages of the patient. I differ greatly from this opinion, and believe it might occaſion conſiderable miſtakes in practice. In the higheſt turgency of the blood-veſſels, the ſmall or capillary ones, have, according to their ſize, as much to reſiſt as the largeſt, which are ſeldom known to burſt, even when the pulſe is in the higheſt ſtate of elevation, except in caſes of appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, when the blood cannot return into the heart. Hemorrhages are always the effect of a leſion or of the morbid ſtate of the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the veſſels. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> diſeaſes, they originate from the vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſyſtem; and they never happen during the exacerbations, but on the contrary during the remiſſions, and when the pulſe has returned to its greateſt calm. At this period, the relaxed vaſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſyſtem, pours off a fluid ejected from the circulation, and not reſumed in the veins. It is from this cauſe that hemorrhages in fevers are conſidered as ominous prognoſtics, according to the time of their appearance.</note>, evacuations from the bowels, &amp;c. The diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of what will be the tendency of the patient, and by what criſis he will be finally aſſiſted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains conſequently with us. When this is made, we ſhall be obliged again to acknowledge, that the calomel, when adminiſtered to ſalivate, will, in many caſes, counteract the march of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; and that it will obſtruct every criſis, but that of the mouth. A purge counteracts the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:034311_0084_0FFC3BB3457FD640"/>while the latter has the ſame effect upon all that can be obtained by hemorrhages, perſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirations, &amp;c. It follows, therefore, that, if the patient has neither time or a natural tendency to undergo the operation of ſalivating, this means would be contrary to the cure of the yellow fever.</p>
               <p>The practice of exciting a ſalivation, for the cure of ſeveral diſeaſes, will better explain its equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal effects in the yellow fever. By it, the morbid cauſe is tranſported from any part of the body or from the blood, into the ſalivary glands, from whence it is inſenſibly waſhed out, attended with a moſt offenſive ſmell; and the mercury ſecretes, by theſe glands, a great quantity of ſaliva. Should others give a different explanation of this phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, yet we muſt all agree as to the fact, and this is ſufficient. It cannot be denied but that the affection of the mouth varies afterwards very much among different individuals, and although this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance cannot be accounted for, the reſults may be ſatisfactory and have the deſired effect. There are patients on whom the greateſt quantity of mercury has never been able to affect their mouths. Some receive an eaſy affection in the ſublinguals and maxillary, but their ſpitting is unattended with a ſwelling of the parotids, and conſequently has no critical good effect. The ſtate of the teeth, their being covered with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſcales, or much decayed, and previous mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:034311_0085_0FFC3BB10663F0C8"/>of the gums, may, in many caſes, render the action of the mercury ſo painful and even dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, by hemorrhages, that the courſe of the medicine muſt be interrupted, without fulfilling the adopted intention. Infine, the practice of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtering mercury, without ſalivation, by the means of certain precautions, recommended by many phyſicians as equally ſucceſsful and ſafer in the reſults, are conſiderations ſufficiently pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to make us diſapprove of the ſalivating me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in a diſorder ſo rapid, and the malignancy of which, might be conquered by leſs equivocal means.</p>
               <p>Reſuming my former propoſition, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, as an important caution, that calomel ſhould never be adminiſtered by itſelf nor in the method or proportions intended for ſalivation; that, on the contrary, it muſt be but about the third part of a draſtic mixture, by the means of which it will immediately be diffuſed into the bowels; and that, if, in ſpite of jalap, ſcammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, or gamboge, it is retained too long without operation, an oily cathartic, or ſome neutral ſalts, ſhould be given to prevent the mercury from aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, and to enforce the bilious evacuations, the importance of which has been ſufficiently proved. This method leaves always time enough for the criſis of the mouth if it is neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by nature. It helps it ſufficiently, and it
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:034311_0086_0FFA6B85C1A90C80"/>even accelerates its appearance, and gives it all the characters that can render it perfect and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary. Such caſes have occurred to me in the proportion of one out of ten<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>In practiſing the method of adminiſtering calomel, in the proportion of a third againſt two-thirds of other draſtics, as ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lap, ſcammonea, &amp;c. the following has been the reſult of my practice in the worſt caſes.</p>
                     <p>Out of ſeven patients to whom the calomel was carefully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered as a draſtic, I loſt only one.</p>
                     <p>I had one ſpontaneous ſuppuration of the parotids out of ten.</p>
                     <p>One accidental affection of the mouth, with gentle ſpitting, unavoidably cauſed by the calomel, and without conſequence, out of four.</p>
                     <p>One critical reſolution by hemorrhage, out of three.</p>
                     <p>One by eruptions out of twenty.</p>
                     <p>And, finally, one by tranſudation of the blood from the lips out of fifty.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Few obſervations remain againſt the external application of mercurial ointment. Admitting that it tends to the purification of the blood, what will be thought if the original cauſe and the foam of contagion are not deſtroyed? The reſervoirs of the bile are not emptied by mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial <hi>frictions.</hi> This remedy, therefore, cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer any good purpoſe, except after the firſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the diſeaſe, when previous evacuations have been accompliſhed. This hypotheſis, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:034311_0087_0FFC3BADE1A2D318"/>would ſtill be liable to conſiderable objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuch as the exacerbations of the fever, and the turgency of the blood-veſſels, which never fail to manifeſt themſelves as ſoon as the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury is admitted into the circulation. The firſt would be conſiderably counteracted by mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial frictions, while they are neceſſary to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the malady within a certain ſpace of time; and the other would become preciſely one of its moſt dangerous ſymptoms, and would be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſettled before we could have time to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, or to obtain any deciſive and good reſult. I ſaw, in the laſt prevalence of the fever, a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt young man, in the fourth day of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who had been regularly rubbed with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial ointment. The excretory evacuations had been neglected; he had not the leaſt affection of the mouth; and he died on the fifth day.</p>
               <p>Some practical cautions reſpecting emetics alſo demand our attention. I have already ſtated their uſefulneſs in emptying the ſtomach and duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, when, in the courſe of the firſt period, theſe viſcera are ſickened, notwithſtanding every other application has been ſucceſsful. If the mercury, in ſhort, promotes the ſecretion of the bile from the liver, this favourable operation is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed by a ſickneſs of the ſtomach, and then the emetic is neceſſary. (Vide caſe No. 7.) In many inſtances, the patients diſcover a great
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:034311_0088_0FFC3BAB9F74E6F8"/>averſion to this remedy, and if they are of a delicate nervous conſtitution they frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to take it. In ſuch caſes I employ an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedy, ſtrongly recommended by the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Mr. Dubois de Rochefort, in his Materia Medica. He calls it <hi>un emetique cathartique en lavage.</hi> One grain of tartar emetic, or one grain and an half at moſt, is to be diſſolved, with half an ounce, or three drams, of ſalt of Glaubert, in about two pounds of water. The patient is to drink it by tumblers full every hour. This medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is not nauſeous; it ſeldom excites vomitting; and it is always ſure to empty the ſtomach and bowels downwards. It is a general obſervation in practice, that the patient ſhould, in all acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, be prepared, by various depleting reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for all the ſubſequent operations. But we muſt cautiouſly avoid giving of pukes in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the yellow fever, and particularly ſo if a profuſe bleeding has not immediately preceded it. Indeed, the turgency of the arterial ſyſtem is then ſo great, that the convulſions of the ſtomach may have dreadful conſequences. I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen them followed with ſuch fatal acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, that I think it my duty to mention the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a cautious reſerve<note n="*" place="bottom">It is a general cuſtom among practitioners, to preſcribe bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in deſperate caſes, and I have often been ſtrongly importun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adminiſter them, by the nurſes and friends of the patients, whoſe hopes of their efficacy are ſincere, but who are unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their real conſequences. I ſhall not here enquire into the nature and extent of their utility, nor the method of their application. After referring to all that has been diſcovered and adopted in the treatment of the yellow fever, it muſt be allowed that they are abſolutely uſeleſs, and cannot anſwer the leaſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in any period of the diſorder. As, therefore, there are ſuch numerous diſtreſſing circumſtances attending an unfortunate iſſue of the treatment of the yellow fever, humanity requires us to exclude this excrutiating application.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:034311_0089_0FFC28259992FF40"/>Admitting the above practical cautions to be adopted by thoſe phyſicians, who, with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety, have choſen calomel and bleeding for the cure of the yellow fever, ſtill, gentlemen, if the patient labours under the complaints of diſeaſed viſcera and vitiated conſtitution, or if he has not made timely application for medical aſſiſtance, they are not ſufficient. Under this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold conſideration, every impartial judge will make due allowances for the medical art in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate caſes of death. It is too true, that, during the prevalence of a dreadful and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious epidemic, confuſion and deſpair, ſecluſion from intercourſe, and erroneous opinions on the firſt ſymptoms of complaint, expoſe the patient to diſſident delays and improper meaſures; but experience and the warnings of phyſicians, ought to teach our fellow citizens the importance of an early application to medical aid, in the cure of one of the moſt malignant diſorders that ever was known among nations. In caſes where the diſeaſe would have gone through its periods in the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:034311_0090_0FFC3BAA0B6FCBA0"/>ſhort ſpace of three days, one day loſt proved fatal. Thoſe alſo, in whom the malady was of longer continuance, and who remained unaſſiſted during the firſt days, found, alas! a ſimilar fate. Let no one, therefore, for his own ſake, be careleſs about any ſlight inſtance of complaint which he may experience during the prevalence of an epidemic; for, although various degrees of bilious or other complaints may appear, and though their mildneſs may have nothing common with the rapid and malignant effects of the former, yet, at the firſt call, the phyſican himſelf feels obliged to employ all the energy of his practice, notwithſtanding he ſees but partial and ſuſpicious ſymptoms. His ſeverity of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and preſcription, will not be attended with dangerous conſequences; but will happily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the proper treatment for any unexpected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant caſe.</p>
               <p>In order to illuſtrate the importance of an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly application to phyſicians, during the ſeaſon which unfortunately creates all degrees of bilious, remittent, and malignant fevers in theſe climates, I ſhall familiarly relate an inſtructive inſtance of errors of judgment, in a caſe of apparently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and trifling indiſpoſition, and of the inutility of medical aid when applied for too late. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of our late calamity, I was ſent for by the wife of an unfortunate huſband.
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:034311_0091_0FFC3BA7CB415CE8"/>From motives of the moſt unequivocal tenderneſs and affection, ſhe unhappily deprived him of ſuch timely aid as would undoubtedly have ſaved his life. "During four nights ſhe had not left his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. Perſuaded that ſhe knew, by experience, his indiſpoſition, ſhe continued all this time to give him ſuch remedies as ſhe thought proper. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed at firſt to admit me into his room; for the frequent viſits of phyſicians to infected houſes alarmed her very much. She ſaid that ſhe had been ſo ſecluded from any kind of intercourſe with others, that, thank God, the yellow fever had ſpared every one of her family. She obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſhe had called me for ſome advice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the indiſpoſition of her dear huſband; but ſhe was happy to think, that there would not be much occaſion for medical aid; for, ſince ſhe had ſent her meſſage, he appeared to be on the point of recovery. He was up, walking about the room; and he intended, next day, to ride out to the country." This laſt circumſtance, ſtruck me with the apprehenſion that this was the laſt day of the life of the patient; and, that I might be better able to judge, I requeſted her to give me an account of his indiſpoſition from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. "He was taken, ſhe replied, with a ſlight fever and puking, owing to a little intemperance on the preceding day; and his head ache and pain in the limbs, ſhe knew very well, proceeded from a violent cold, which ſhe always cured with ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:034311_0092_0FFC3BA4D67B14C8"/>tear. She had afterwards given him a few pills, which operated faithfully, and the pains and fever happily ſubſided. The patient had, laſt night, puked ſomething of a black colour; but ſhe did not wonder at it, as ſhe had previouſly complied with his wiſh of giving him ſome coffee and toaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bread. He now felt very eaſy, though a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle weak, which was of courſe; and ſhe could not expect him to be better. In ſhort, ſhe had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and nurſed ſo many ſick, among friends and relations, that ſhe was ſufficiently acquainted with the neceſſary management and cautions!!" I cannot tell, after ſuch a recital, which ſtruck me moſt, the innocent confidence of the wife, her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpecting ignorance, the irrevocable fate of her huſband, or the painful taſk which devolved upon me, of deſtroying ſo many erroneous opinions, and plunging, by one word, the whole family in the moſt unexpected diſtreſs. My ſilence was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the patient, who called us up, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing ſome uneaſineſs and wiſhing to lie down again. His pulſe was ſmall, tenſe, and intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and a black inſtead of a yellow hue was ſuffuſed all over his body. The confuſion of his look, was highly expreſſive of inſtant danger; and being ſuddenly taken with the moſt extreme weakneſs, he could hardly anſwer to but few of my queſtions. His wife was now ſeized with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and, taking advantage of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the moment, I retired with her from
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:034311_0093_0FFC3BA2927E2180"/>the preſence of an object who was every moment becoming a more deplorable proof of her blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed confidence—a victim of a culpable ſecurity— an object whom ſhe ſaw no more! But if this ſingular caſe, the error of which cannot be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to neglect, may appear rare; yet how many others have I ſeen, and how many deaths may be attributed to parſimony, indifference, and the want of timely medical aſſiſtance!</p>
               <p>The laſt ſubject of practical caution, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that has occurred to me in the treatment of the yellow fever, is ſtill more ſerious than the preceding ones, and of more certain fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. In other acute diſorders, a phyſician may perhaps find out ſome means of relief, and calculate by them a ſucceſsful mode of treatment, notwithſtanding the patient may labour under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious complaints of diſeaſed viſcera or injured conſtitution; but in our epidemic there is no ſuch proſpect, or at leaſt it is very faint. During the two periods of its prevalence, I never met with an inſtance of recovery from it, when the whole frame had been materially injured by certain cauſes. A pulmonic affection, however, when not too far advanced, would not, I believe, readily preſent an obſtacle to the cure, as I have once ſeen exemplified; becauſe the proximate cauſe of our fever lies entirely in the bile and alimenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry channel. But I ſhall always deſpair, at the firſt
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:034311_0094_0FFC3BA10A94ADE0"/>view, of thoſe who have conſiderable obſtructions or congeſtions in the liver, or who have unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately kept in their conſtitution any ſcorbutic t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>int or remains of ſyphillitic contagion. On the dreadful effects of this laſt, in the malignant yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, I ſhall preſent you a few important re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions; and that they may be carefully contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by my young readers, is the philanthropic wiſh dictated by too many fatal inſtances. It has been evidently remarked, that the epidemic acted moſt ſeverely upon young and robuſt men, and that its victims were chiefly of that deſcription. This is a poſitive fact, the elucidation of which will not appear ſtrange, when it is remembered that it is not eaſy to get rid of the poiſon receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the embraces of proſtitution; that many methods for its cure are truly deceiving; that ſome noble viſcera may, by it, remain eſſentially diſeaſed; and that the blood, which contains its particles, will be ſooner and unavoidably conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by another contagion. The moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſymptoms do not always juſtify the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence either of the patient or phyſician; for we are unacquainted with all the changes and ſhapes of a malady which has been juſtly termed a Proteus or a Cameleon<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Aſtruc on venereal diſeaſes.</note>. We are daily taught by experience, that, by the ceſſation of one of its ſymptoms, we are not to judge of a perfect cure. It
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:034311_0095_0FFC3B9ED4F5D458"/>deceives us and the patient alſo; for it often lurks within the body, without diffuſing into the blood, or producing any mark of infection. Since there are external ſwellings and various ſorts of tumours which we attribute to the venereal lues, why ſhould we doubt but that they may exiſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, or within ſome noble glands? How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, indeed, the proſtrate gland remains ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſwelled, and tumefied with exuberances, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the improper cure of a gonorrhoea, by ſtrong aſtringents, I leave thoſe to determine, who are acquainted with the precious enquiries of two famous ſurgeons on that ſubject, Petit of France, and Hunter of England. In theſe caſes it is very eaſy to appreciate, without further explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what will be the effects on the ſecretions of the urine, on the functions of the kidneys, and on the bowels. To ſuch internal and chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical cauſes, we muſt aſcribe the numerous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and long complaints, which baffle medical ſkill until their primitive cauſe is cured. Mania, hypocondria, epilepſy, and the long liſt of ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous complaints, may originate from the ſimple irregularity of ſecretion of urine into the kidneys; for a part of that fluid remaining in the blood, muſt afterwards affect the whole, or at leaſt a part of the frame. But ſuch circumſtances have a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded effect in acute, malignant, and contagious fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. The violence of the firſt ſymptoms is an additional evil to the enweakened viſcera; for
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:034311_0096_0FFC3B9BD9540DF8"/>by it they are immediately brought to the brink of deſtruction. The ſtruggles, the exertions, and the efforts of nature, are then ſoon exhauſted; and if there is a ſcale of the natural degrees of health, of thoſe which may be depended on above it, and of thoſe under which the phenomena of life ceaſes, what proportion remains for medical expectation and ſkill, when ſuch complicated cauſes abſorb the whole balance of what is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed excitability by one, and what is thought to be the whole extent of natural laws by another? Were it not a point of delicacy, gentlemen, for a practitioner to produce reflections on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, that, according to the opinion of many, would blemiſh the memory of the dead, I would ſupport this diſcuſſion with the evidences of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes.

General Means to prevent the Generation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of the Yellow Fever.</head>
               <p>Two contrary opinions have appeared on the origin of the yellow fever, and have been officially tranſmitted to the executive, by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal bodies of Philadelphia. An attentive public, who know that truth cannot be contradictory, muſt doubtleſs feel deeply concerned; and will regret that, after repeated calamities, no unanimous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement ſhould be made among the learned on ſo intereſting a ſubject. Under theſe circumſtances it becomes neceſſary, that, while meaſures are adopting to prevent its importation, the probability of its domeſtic generation ſhould not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. The public precautions ſhould not be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſolely on the particular opinions of either p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I do not, therefore, gentlemen, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of any meaſures that may be adopted to prevent the imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rtation of the yellow fever; on the contrary you will diſcover that the above theory has a ſenſible advantage over the latter,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:034311_0099_0FFC3B966AE17678"/>for it alſo admits of all the neceſſary precautions againſt the effects of noxious exhalations from the holds of ſhips or veſſels arriving from tropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal countries in the hot ſeaſon of the year. If we do not implicitly believe that this contagious epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic is imported from one country to another, like the plague or the leproſy, ſtill we admit that it may poſſibly originate on board of ſhips during a long paſſage, which contain animal or vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubſtances in a ſtate of fermentation; that, raging contagiouſly among crews from tropical iſlands, when the remains of them come to mix with our citizens, it may ſpread its infection among them, and chiefly during the hot ſeaſon of the year; and that, infine, when a contagious diſtemper is known to rage in any part of the world, our intercourſe with it ſhould be cautions and ſubject to lawful controul.

It of courſe follows, that to oppoſe the poſſibility of its importation, and of its breaking from corrupted cargoes, it would be expedient to remove ſuch ſhips from our ſhores as are loaded with colonial produce, at leaſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the months of June, July, Auguſt, Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and October. The rule for admitting theſe articles ſhould be defined according to their good or corrupted ſtate, a few days after the ſhips have been unloaded. No intercourſe with their crews ſhould be permitted during five days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But if a veſſel is ſuppoſed to contain corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted miaſmata, and authenticated caſes of any kind of bilious fever ſhould be found on board, the ſick ought to be removed to a diſtant hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, and the ſhip and company perform a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantine of ten days.</p>

               <p>Philadelphia, ſituated on the weſt bank of the Delaware, and on the narroweſt ſpace between the Schuylkill and that river, may be wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignated in the form of a parallelogram, the ſquares of which are interſected by wide croſs-ſtreets, which raiſe very little, in certain points, from the ſouth to the north, but which are open to all the winds, and to all the emanations of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The conveniencies of foot ways, their cleanneſs, and the uniform practice of the inhabitants in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently waſhing the outſide of their houſes, give to the city a ſingular appearance of regularity and neatneſs highly admired by foreigners. It contains, however, ſome capital defects; and too many unfavourable circumſtances concur to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure its ſalubrity. Water-ſtreet, thirty feet wide, extending from the northern liberties to Pine-ſtreet, parallel with the courſe of the Delaware, is in a confined low ſituation. Though the whole of its extent, it has but few vacancies, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactly
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:034311_0102_0FFC3EA454B2B4C0"/>built, very diſagreeable, and is totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of back yards on the ſide of Frount-ſtreet. The ſame is to be obſerved with reſpect to Penn-ſtreet. It likewiſe runs along the river from Pine to Cedar-ſtreet; and, in the late caſes of epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic, both have been particularly marked as the firſt ſeat of the diſeaſe. The main height of the ground on which the city ſtands, is nearly forty feet above the Delaware. Many ſtreets are, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, lower; and, conſequently, the adjacent ground, intended for the continuation of the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal plan, is in many places marſhy.

As I ſhall, in the courſe of my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, avert more particularly to this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I ſhall now obſerve that they are elevated above the higheſt tides, ſo that at low water, their vertical ſides are expoſed, for near five feet, to the rays of the ſun. In the Northern Liberties and the diſtrict of Southwark, there are many
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:034311_0103_0FFC3EA213FF6280"/>vacancies on the banks of the river. Owing to the periodical floods, theſe form large miry grounds, which are never dry, but covered either with thick beds of filth from the adjoining ſtreets or habitations, or with rubbiſh, old timber, &amp;c. Theſe ſources of exhalation are not of the moſt indifferent conſequence.</p>
               <p>Our city is ſupplied with no running waters or fountains, and but few ciſterns are to be found in private houſes. Wells only are dug, in diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive number, in different parts of the city and ſuburbs. A pump is placed in each well, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is thus eaſily obtained for all the wants of life. A gutter, formed by the elevation of the foot way, and by the gradual deſcent of the ſtreet to each ſide, ſeems ſufficient to receive and carry down the dropping waters. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:034311_0104_0FFC3EA08C7C6170"/>There are twenty-eight houſes for public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Philadelphia, and I believe as many grave-yards within the city and ſuburbs. It ſeems yet to be queſtioned whether they are really of a noxious nature or not. It is ſaid that, as the graves are uſually dug to the depth of ſix feet, the health of the citizens cannot be injured by them. Even admitting this obſervation to be true, yet, if dangerous vapours cannot immediately riſe from the grave-yards, by the effect of the heat, they may otherwiſe be diſengaged, by the hydraulick laws of ſubterraneous waters. For, ſuppoſing a grave-yard in a very elevated part of the city, as that of the Friends, at the corner of Arch and Fourth-ſtreets, which is beſides near five feet above the ſtreet, within a ſtony enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it will be granted that the dead are on a level with many different parts of the city, and in ſome caſes even above it. Now, ſince it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the greateſt elevation of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the river is forty feet, and that many of the grave-yards are on the higheſt grounds, it will evidently appear, that the inhabitants liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a lower part of the city, will receive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations from the earth, of moiſture and waters that have been infiltrated through an elliptic plan and through a vaſt number of dead bodies. This obſervation will be found to agree with the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draulick laws; for, according to them, in ſatura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted grounds, evaporation collects the waters by
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:034311_0105_0FFC3E9E1F69F248"/>infiltration from higher ſurrounding points in the ſame manner, that, to obtain water from the the higheſt parts, we dig for its evacuation at the lower ones. This explanation, gentlemen, will ſhew how the evaporations in moſt of the low parts of our city, are rendered noxious by the putrefaction of thouſands of dead bodies, and may be carried from one point to another, by means of the grave-yards being intermixed with our dwellings, beſides their immediate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in altering the waters collected in our wells.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we have a more dangerous ſource of putrid animal exhalations, which is more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diſcovered in thickly inhabited places af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the heat, and at the cloſe of ſummer.</p>
               <p>Each dwelling has a privy-houſe, ſituated at the fartheſt end of the yard; and the houſes on the eaſt ſide of Front-ſtreet have them in their cellars. The ditches upon which they ſtand, are dug to a conſiderable depth and built round with ſtones or bricks. Many of them are twenty fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> deep, but this circumſtance removes ſtill further the idea of cleaning them. After many years the fermentation cauſes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive vapours during the ſummer; and it is very ſeldom the caſe that the ditches are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than once in ten years, when it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:034311_0106_0FFC3E9B9B946CC0"/>conſidered caſier to fill them with ſtones, and to dig others. The fact is, gentlemen, that towards the end of the ſummer, that is to ſay, after the action of the heat has ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited fermentation, mephitic gas aſcends from the ditch. Our inhabitants are ſo well appriſed of this, that they always provide their little-houſes with a vent hole. This is a proof that the depth of the ditch is not a preſervative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its noxious vapours; for the rarefaction and the heat of our atmoſphere could raiſe them from a much more diſtant centre. The abſorption of the within contained fluids is ſo ſlow, in moiſt and impregnated grounds, that they wholly remain and ſerve to accumulate the maſs of fermentating animal ſubſtances. If a lighted candle be lowered into one of theſe ditches, by means of a line, it will often be put out; and when the temperature of autumn does not oppoſe the dilation of the aſcending gas, it is plentifully diffuſed round the houſes, yards, and alleys, where it is often ſenſibly ſmelt, chiefly when the air is calm and ſultry.</p>
               <p>After the enumeration of ſo many cauſes and dangerous ſources of putrid exhalation, will not our minds, gentlemen, be impreſſed when the reflection of Dr. Lind, that, "next to infection, the moſt frequent cauſe of fevers
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:034311_0107_0FFC3E994A9FCD88"/>is perhaps the offenſive and polluted air in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy places;" and that our calamity, perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically breaking out, at a certain ſeaſon of the year, was not merely imported?</p>
               <p>There are, in Philadelphia, many other ſources of putrid effluvia<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>There are ſeveral ſinks in Philadelphia, to receive the waters from the gutters, at thoſe points where a declivity can no longer be given to their beds. Two very remarkable ones at the corners of High and Fourth-ſtreets, were, during laſt ſummer and fall, productive of the moſt offenſive exhalations and became a mere nuiſance. It is very probable, that, by ſome defect or other, the waters in them were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; and I take the liberty to direct my requeſt to the proper authorities, to have theſe ſinks examined and repaired. As many cats were ſtarved, in conſequence of the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the city, there was, I am perſuaded, a quantity of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion in them. Called out frequently during the night, I could ſtrongly perceive the ſmell as far as Arch-ſtreet on one ſide, and Cheſnut on the other. I employed ſome hours in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the current of exhalation, and was at laſt ſatisfied as to its true origin.</p>
                     <p>There were alſo ſeveral ſinks in Pear-ſtreet, in Cheſnut-ſtreet, at the corner of Dock and Walnut-ſtreets, and in other parts, the canals of which have been, I believe, deſtroyed, but the holes left open, and the people of the neighbouring houſes ſtill continue to throw their filth in them. I have been informed, by a very reſpectable citizen, that he obſerved, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the two inſtances of our calamity, that theſe vent-holes of putrefaction had been productive of a great number of death in their neighbourhoods.</p>
                  </note>, which perhaps are
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:034311_0108_0FFC3E962EB47F48"/>unavoidable, and are common to all other thickly inhabited places in the world, but which ought to attract the attention of our public authorities; ſince they are much more dangerous in a place expoſed to the heat of the tropical countries. For theſe, as well as for the preceding obſervations, I hardly think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, gentlemen, to dwell much upon the direct meaſures that ſhould be adopted by the citizens at large, againſt the different cauſes of our epidemic. If they were not kept in a ſtate of incertitude, with reſpect to its real origin, their wiſdom and prudence would enable them to make the proper regulations. But alas! thoſe who are induced, after ſufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, to predict that the fever will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently rage again in Philadelphia, know how many opponents there are to this melancholy truth, and have very little hopes of obtaining a majority in favour of their advices. Yet, if I cannot flatter myſelf with gaining many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes to my opinion, I conſider it as a duty and a pleaſure to throw my mite of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and firm belief, into the fluctuating ſcale of public opinion. Under the influence of this ſentiment, I aſſert, that the only ſure and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious means of preſerving Philadelphia from contagious malignant fevers, will be thoſe that are directly calculated to remove or deſtroy,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:034311_0109_0FFC3E94A76B2408"/>if poſſible, the ſources of putrid exhalation from animal and vegetable ſubſtances that are contained within our precincts. Theſe means, gentlemen, are of ſuch a magnitude, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> neither time or great expence would be able to effect them, if religious prejudices, views of mercantile intereſt, and opinions of party ſpirit, are ſuffered to thwart their execution. Before I attempt to enumerate them permit me to make a few reflexions more on the chymical principles and reſults of putrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In whatever light we conſider the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent parts of vapours and gaſſes, either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former or new nomenclature of chymiſtry, this much will be acknowledged, that life is oppoſed to the putrid fermentation of animal or vegetable ſubſtances; and that, as ſoon as they are deprived of it, they neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fall into a complete ſtate of putrefaction, which is more or leſs accelerated, according to the quantity of heat or caloric, of air and of water, in which they are immerſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> As ſoon as the putrid fermentation takes place, a new combination ariſes of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubſtances, which have a peculiar tendency to unite to the air by the help of the heat, or
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:034311_0110_0FFC3E9198D5F0D0"/>to the water by their affinity to them; ſo that both fluids, being conſiderably altered in their nature, will preſent a quite contrary effect to that they would have exhibited at firſt, viz. the very air which was good for life and health, will produce a quite contrary effect, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> Among the different qualities of the ſubſtances diſengaged from animal fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there are two very remarkable and which conſtitute all the degrees of noxious exh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The firſt is their extreme tendency unite with air and water, (<hi>Vide Diction. de Chimie, par Macquer, art.</hi> GAS); and the other is a certain degree of their development, which is impoſſible to account for, in which whether in a fluid or ſolid ſtate, their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate contact with any living body, ſuddenly deſtroys or ſuſpends the phenomenon of life. A traveller found the body of a drowned man that had been waſhed on the ſhore by the flood. As he perceived no foetor, in examining the corpſe, he inadvertantly plunged his finger into a ſoft and putrified limb. From the finger the mortification was ſo rapid to the vitals, that he had no time to be aſſiſted, and he died. Anatomical diſſection has alſo proved the truth of this terrible and dangerous ſtate of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction. Its various degrees muſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:034311_0111_0FFC3E9010DB3368"/>breed different kinds of diſeaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> Theſe exhalations are, moreover, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to other laws and phenomena of nature, which ſometimes occaſion them to be harmleſs when they are moſt dreaded, or very noxious and fatal while they are not perceived or even thought of. Heat, without aqueous particles, raiſes them, and winds carry them through immenſe regions. They ſeem viſibly to be a kind of meteor; their operation on the body is terrible, and they in ſome meaſure deſtroy the vitals without any contagious or poiſonous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Such are thoſe remarkable winds and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, ſo well known in the deſerts of Africa, and which originate in the mountains of Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinia<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Bruse's Travels through Abyſſinia,</note>. Heat, alſo, may dilate them to ſuch a degree that they become harmleſs. This is the caſe when it puts an end to the plague in the hotteſt countries of the earth. Aqueous vapours, without much heat, can diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage but little of theſe exhalations, and it is then very common to perceive much foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, without receiving any injury from it. Thus people attending the ſick, diſſecting of dead bodies, butchers, tanners, and all thoſe who are frequently among exhalations from animal
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:034311_0112_0FFC3E8D07A788A0"/>fermentation, are not known to be injured at all. Thoſe exhalations which are ſuſpended above a corpſe, within a metallic or wooden coffin, do not want much heat or moiſture, to become fatal as ſoon as broken open. A mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic gas then appears ſimilar to that which we diſcover in our chymical experiments. Its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are ſudden againſt every living body; but it can be almoſt deſtroyed or rendered harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, by aqueous vapours, and may be totally abſorbed by vegetables. This air or exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion occaſioned the death of many citizens of Paris, who, in the month of Auguſt, 1792, were inſtantly killed by its contact, while they were breaking the tombs, to take away the leaden coffins, for materials of military ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>
               <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> Fevers, produced by exhalations are remarkably various, according to their places, time, and ſeaſon. What a ſtriking difference was there between the elephantiaſis of Athens, the plague of Marſeilles, the ſore-throat of Italy, and the ſweating ſickneſs of England? We could hardly find, in the preſent day, any pathological ſimilarity among the dreadful epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics of Norway and Holland; the anomolous malignant obſerved by Hoffman in Germany, during the years 1727, 1728, and 1729; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent

Particular Preventives againſt the Yellow Fever.</head>
               <p>THIS ſection, gentlemen, I would conſider as the leaſt uſeful of my eſſay, if any of my readers expected to find in it ſecret receipts or infallible remedies, and if they believed that I thought my advices, joined to thoſe of the moſt eminent phyſicians, ſufficient to render them invulnerable to one of the moſt rapid and fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſorders. Where is the art that can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably face danger, can always elude its ſtrokes, or reſiſt its efforts, whether in battles or in any kind of human infirmities? Alas! when the beſt preventives have been made uſe of, and the mode of living rendered ſcrupulouſly cautious, ſtill there are many chances of infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt one of preſervation; becauſe the attendants of the ſick, as well as thoſe citizens who are detained in town by the neceſſary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:034311_0117_0FFC3E825496EB78"/>of buſineſs, are expoſed to the fatigue, the anxiety of mind, and all the other inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies attending a general calamity, and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch circumſtances, it is not always in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power, totally to avoid the means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Thus we have been ſeen many of our phyſicians, who, during the late calamity, were among the foremoſt in attending on the ſick, become the victims of its ravages! Their names and memories deſerve the tribute of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and of gratitude<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note>. To us, gentlemen, they have given a noble example. Let us then ſhed a tear upon their tombs; and, like them, pledge ourſelves as the friends of humanity.</p>
               <p>Phyſicians and others who firſt ſuſpected the domeſtic origin of our fever, adviſed their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens to remove to the country. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever efficacious this meaſure was to thoſe who
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:034311_0118_0FFC3E800DFD7390"/>could afford the expences attending it, what diſtreſs did it not produce among the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing claſs of our citizens, to the public func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaries, and to thoſe whom public or private concerns retained at the theatre of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity! By deſertion, indeed, the laſt preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was rendered more afflictive than that of 1793, although it was not ſo extenſive in its ravages; and it will always be my wiſh, that, during ſuch a period, we may experience leſs of that ruinous and unexpected diſperſion of our citizens. When this is the caſe, there is no kind of diſtreſs to which our patients are not expoſed. Inſtances, likewiſe, were known of malignant caſes and of deaths among the fugitives. A mortal infection was thus propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in ſeveral ſurrounding country places, for how could they eſcape the neceſſary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications and intercourſe? In European places expoſed to peſtilential diſeaſes, it is a ſupreme law, that, during their prevalence, the inhabitants are not ſuffered to quit their places of abode. Far be it from me to wiſh for ſuch an inhoſpitable meaſure. It is only mentioned to ſuggeſt, that it is a queſtion whether more good than evil would not ariſe to the community at large, if, free from terror, aſſiſted by proper and efficacious meaſures, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by numerous inſtances of preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:034311_0119_0FFC3E7CDD66AC20"/>in town and recovery among the patients, they could be perſuaded to ſee the ſhort period of an epidemic ſpent, unaccompanied with the tenfold calamities and misfortunes of deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>However rapid the effects of an exiſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion may be upon healthy people, we can derive from our ſtated principles, three powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of confidence and ſecurity. The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from the nature and operation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion on the bile only; the ſecond, from the poſſible removal of the ſick from numerous families, or an abſolute ceſſation of intercourſe with them; and the laſt from efficaciouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced cautions even in caſes of the neareſt danger.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The yellow fever, we have already ſaid, is merely a bilious one of the moſt malignant degree. Its operations and ſymptoms are wholly upon and from the bile. Our inhabitants are particularly ſubject to bilious complaints in a certain ſeaſon of the year, and when the laſt are endemics, the former will turn out to be an epidemic of the ſevereſt kind.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen alſo that bilious and yellow fevers commonly fell upon thoſe in whom the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:034311_0120_0FFC3E7A959F6E50"/>bile was of a thick or vitiated nature, and who, by habitual neglect, intemperance, or other unhealthy mode of living, expoſed that ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a ſtate of ſtagnancy and corruption. Such ſimple and reaſonable given obſervations ſhould help us to fix upon a ſucceſsful method of diet, of remedies, and of cautions, during the perilous prevalence of the yellow fever. At ſuch a period, a vegetable diet will be a ſure preventive againſt animal corruption; and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal food of the lighteſt kind, being always ſufficient for neceſſary nutriment, if preferred to heavy and groſs meats, will not excite ſo great a fermentation of the animal fluids. Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tonic drinks, meaſured according to the wanted digeſtive power, will preſerve us from thoſe inflammatory and heated motions of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation which always attend the face and feelings of drinkers of ſtrong wines and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritous liquors, which is an obſtacle to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and ſecretion of liquid and pure bile. But it may be ſaid, that ſuch a plan of diet would not be ſufficient, during the exhauſting heat of the weather and the neceſſary fatigues of life, and particularly ſo at a time when the body ſeems to want more ſtimulating means to raiſe the lowneſs of our ſtrength and ſpirits. This, gentlemen, is true, and this feeling is powerful; but we ought not to ſuffer our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:034311_0121_0FFC3E790C6D80D8"/>or miſinformation, to make us miſtake the proper means. I have been frequently more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated and refreſhed by a warm bath, during the heat of ſummer, by an airing in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or by a cooling medicine, than I could poſſibly be by the moſt ſucculent cordial. In fact, we may compare our body, charged with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpringy actions, to a bow, the elaſtic power of which would be loſt if it was ſtiffened by the effect of a drying fire, but which would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſerved if kept in a ſoft and moiſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature. Beſides, when we feel very weak, it is often becauſe the vis vitae, elevated to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common degree above the point of health, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to its end, the ſame as when it is too low; and then relaxing means are proper, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary, and ſucceſsful. It is obſerved that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more frequently experience the effects of weakneſs, brought on by the heat of our fluids, than in the ſummer. At this ſeaſon, we are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly expoſed to obſtructions in the alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentary channel, crudities of the ſtomach, and ceſſations of daily evacuations. This laſt effect is unavoidable, even among the moſt regular conſtitutions; but evacuating medicines oppoſe to it an infallible power. A puke or a draſtic never fails in removing thoſe crudities or obſtructions; and, if they are mercurial or antimonial, they will more properly diſcuſs
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:034311_0122_0FFC3E7769233C18"/>the reſervoirs of the bile, and renew that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal fluid, the fermentation of which becomes ſo dangerous. I had frequent opportunities, during the two prevalences of the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to give this advice to people, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to enjoy a regular degree of health. A ſlight indiſpoſition, which could hardly call for their attention, at another time, was then a ſufficient motive for applying to cautious meaſures. I never heſitated, when the ſubject could bear it, to preſcribe a puke at firſt, and a mercurial draſtic after. In this manner, and with much ſurpriſe, I timely delivered many of them of a prodigious quantity of unnatural, black corrupted bile, from which a dangerous fit of ſickneſs would undoubtedly have origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. (Vide caſe No. II.) Yet they afterwards lived healthy, notwithſtanding the heat of the ſeaſon and the prevalence of the contagion. It is, in fine, a neceſſary caution, repeatedly to have recourſe to ſuch medical aſſiſtance; for it is acknowledged, both by phyſicians and others, that repeated caſes of infection may occur.</p>
               <p>Frequent walks and airings, chiefly during the cool moiſture of the morning and evening, taken to ſome diſtant places from our ſultry dwellings, will be another ſalutary practice.
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:034311_0123_0FFC3E7399703118"/>It interrupts the action of the exiſting exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and refreſhes us by the help of a purer and more elaſtic atmoſphere. It alſo aſſiſts the functions that are the moſt endangered, and frequently breaks the courſe of annual and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental diſeaſes. In moſt of the cities of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, where the ſtreets are irregular, a long experience has ſhewn, that the moſt eſſential cauſes of their ſalubrity are, pure waters and public walks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>and every means, both natural and artificial, has been employed to render the latter delightful. Faſhion, in this point, has been invariably adhered to; and though pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic walks may be the theatre of a ſhewy ſtyle of dreſs and manners, or of idle talks and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terviews, yet they notwithſtanding remain a cheap means of exerciſe, whereby health is preſerved and diſeaſes diſpelled. Sedentary life, long ſittings in religious meetings, ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one ſociety from another, protracted clubs for various kinds of entertainment, for politics, for intereſt, and numerous and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſhionable tea-parties, are manners and cuſtoms particularly obſerved among the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of our metropolis. Can I then, gentlemen, be blamed, when I affirm, that, medically ſpeaking, they have a contrary tendency to that of exerciſe, taken in a pure air, and a far
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:034311_0124_0FFC3E714E46CCE8"/>different effect to thoſe of lively manners and more recreative life?</p>
               <p n="2">II. Another motive of ſecurity for the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens at large, during the prevalence of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious epidemic, would be, I have already ſaid, the removal of the ſick, or an abſolute ceſſation of intercourſe with them. This mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, during the late calamity, was ordered by a proclamation from our governor. He was blamed by many who thought only of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences ariſing, in its execution, to the ſick, who were reluctant to leave their homes and their choſen attendants; and the frequent inſtances of miſtaken caſes was another cauſe of their diſapprobation of the meaſure. This oppoſition prevailed to ſuch a degree, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obſtinately remained ſecluded in their own houſes, died there, and their bodies were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſecretly carried to the diſtant grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of the Wigwam hoſpital. Theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies cannot be denied, but the efficacious and vigilant meaſures of authority might at laſt conquer them. The idea that they are a violation of the rights of humanity and of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal liberty, may be oppoſed by good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Public ſafety, and a care for the health and lives of the community at large, have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten commanded ſtill more ſevere meaſures. At
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:034311_0125_0FFC3E6FBB305800"/>this preſent time, if a perſon who is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a quarantine on board of a ſhip or in the lazaretto at Marſcilles, is detected in violating the limits of his confinement, the centinel has orders to kill him inſtantly, and yet this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure has been dictated by the voice of humanity.</p>
               <p>Another argument will enforce the neceſſity of reſtraining perſonal liberty in caſes of contagion. It is the cuſtomary right by which the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtates exclude us from the uſual intercourſe with them. The time may come, which heaven forbid, when the contagious power of this epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic, may ſuggeſt to neighbouring diſtricts the neceſſity of a temporary ſecluſion, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſo, if ſevere regulations are not adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among ourſelves. Will it then appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane, if we ourſelves are obliged to forbid any communication with the ſick, their houſes, and the ſtreets in which they are ſituated? The diſtreſſes of this ſevere meaſure would, no doubt, be ſoftened, if ſeveral hoſpitals were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up, and a choice left to the patients of their own attendants. They could be thus ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with more private accommodations at their own expence, while the poor and forlorn would be taken into thoſe public houſes which have been already ſufficiently well regulated and ſupplied with every neceſſary by the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:034311_0126_0FFC3E6D41F075C0"/>care, and generous donations of our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, during our paſt calamities. Infine, if theſe general meaſures are never adopted, we ſhould at leaſt be cautious to ſuſpend any intercourſe with the infected houſes and ſtreets, although it will be moſtly too late when the contagion has been ſuffered to ſpread. Patriotiſm and candour, both of phyſicians and citizens, would ſoon aſcertain the preſence of the ſcourge. The miſtakes of an iſolated judgment may be obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by previous appointment of many phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians to viſit and conſult upon each new caſe and patient. During the laſt prevalence, the public were cautioned that many deaths were aſcribed to the yellow fever, ſome weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would believe it; but they ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that they received proper and timely information, owing to the attention of well known phyſicians. This is an unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reſult from what we have ſtated of the nature and operation of putrid exhalations, that as ſoon as their firſt effects are diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the early ſtage of the ſeaſon, we might think it in our power to be prepared againſt ſubſequently created caſes, and againſt the contagion from bodies. Theſe are known to emit, in caſes of death, almoſt none, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dangerous only in the laſt periods of the ſickneſs when they recover.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:034311_0127_0FFC3E6A468747A8"/>III. There are other meaſures which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has proved extremely ſucceſsful for preſerving even thoſe who are obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in infected places. It has been officially reported to the governor, that, in the hoſpitals, during the late prevalence, the contagion had not ſpread among the attendants. This would be incredible were we not appriſed of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves and cautions that are naturally made uſe of, invented, and dictated by neceſſity when it becomes the ſupreme law. The origin of the famous <hi>vinegar of four thieves,</hi> ſo much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as a preventive againſt the plague, is a proof of that beneficial induſtry, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found better or more medical means em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed with ſucceſs, than among thoſe who do not heſitate to exchange many chances of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt a valuable compenſation. Yet all their induſtry is aſſiſted with nothing elſe than what is in the power of every one. Reſuming, my enquiries, and the effects of their general method, I found three reſults from taking vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous medicines and from diet. One is, that they reduced the ſyſtem, and abated, conſequently, any diſpoſition to inflammatory or phlogiſtic diatheſis; the ſecond, that they kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a continual ſtate of evacuation, and thus were never ſufficiently acted upon by the contagious miaſmata; and the laſt, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:034311_0128_0FFC3E6805EFA740"/>the bile and rendered it more pure, more fluid, and of a quite contrary ſtate to that which conſtitutes a bilious malignancy. Theſe three rules or indications are equal to any that the medical art can ſuggeſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe; and, as far as they could be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by individuals, and anſwered to by eaſy means, they would, I believe, moſtly render the contagion harmleſs to healthy people, and juſtify a very frequent uſe of warm baths, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious bleedings, and the occaſional adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pukes and mercurial draſtics, ſuch as we employ in the treatment of our patients.</p>
               <p>Some of my readers would, perhaps, here wiſh to be informed, as well as in every other medical work, what peculiar doſes, powders, or pills, and the quantity adminiſtered, ſhould be particularly employed as preventives againſt the yellow fever. I do not wiſh to make a ſecret of the moſt minute circumſtances for the proper uſe of bleedings, pukes, and mercurial draſtics, but I have already ſaid enough upon that ſubject. A ſtill more uſeful piece of advice ſhall here be given, viz. that it is not by <hi>ſaturation</hi> or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity only that medicines are rendered efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor without thoſe proportions and modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which the various conſtitutions of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent patients require, and of which phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:034311_0129_0FFC3E6633D63F98"/>can be the only proper judges. I conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prefer that preventive medicines ſhould always be prepared according to what is requiſite for each conſtitution and by the previous indiſpoſition of body. The moſt impoſing name, affixed to a pill or powder, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> make it better, if given and employed without any neceſſary reſtriction whatever, but would, on the contrary, cover great blunders and miſtakes. Such is the caſe of thoſe patent medicines, which, in the immenſe catalogue of their virtual properties, include all the ſeries of human infirmities, but which are at laſt given up as dangerous or equivocal remedies. To their patrons, however, I am willing to grant, that, if it was poſſible to aſcertain above what point they are variouſly noxious, before any obtained ſucceſs, and under which propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they would fail or become uſeleſs, they would not be thought a great nuiſance among the credulous, whatever power they may be poſſeſſed of.</p>
               <p>The attendants of the ſick ſhould always be attentive to keep a fire in the patient's room, although the warm weather might render it uncomfortable. This I conſider as a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful mean for purifying and renewing the incloſed air, which is inſtantly abſorbed with
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:034311_0130_0FFC3E63D031D408"/>any morbid exhalation. The phenomenon of fire, cannot take place but by an immenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of air, and it thus becomes a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ventilator. This meaſure not only deſtroys any floating contagion for the benefit of the attendants, but I have obſerved it to be very uſeful to the patient, whoſe body ſhould not be immerſed in its own infectious emanations, and who cannot yet bear to be expoſed to the variable external temperature. Infine, by the means of fire, a ſalutary and fragrant ſteam can be immediately procured, in the critical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of foetid and dangerous evacuations.</p>
               <p>Various means have been alſo recommended as preventives by expanding round ourſelves volatile and chymical ſubſtances to neutraliſe, as it were, the putrid miaſmata. Although this method is very uncertain, yet much benefit may be obtained when the current of an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial vapour breaks or alters a contagious one. Theſe means, however, too often act unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably towards the conſtitution, and have a tendency to enweaken the nerves, while it is highly requiſite that the body be kept in the very point of health. Every one knows, in this reſpect, the effects of camphor and of muſk. The aromatics have a contrary and better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, becauſe they are equally tonics and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceptics.

I have ſeen alſo the ſtrongeſt vinegar general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed againſt peſtilential emanations, and its ebullition with ſugar upon red hot iron, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces an agreeable and ſalutary vapour.</p>
               <p>Much has been ſaid upon the ſubject of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying or waſhing with caution the clothes and beds of the ſick. None, I believe, are more infectious than thoſe of a recovered patient. I have collected, on that ſcore, the moſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory proofs, that a patient may be even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infected in his own bed and clothes; and this is undoubtedly the origin of thoſe ſtrange caſes, the ſtages of which run through a longer courſe, and repeated recoveries and relaxes, which is quite contrary to the known periods of a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever. it is perhaps uſeleſs and even incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient frequently to trouble a patient by giving him the comfort of freſh, clean, warm clothes, but it is abſolutely neceſſary to do ſo as ſoon as a profuſe perſpiration has marked the end or a favourable criſis of the malady. If the care of the infected linen is left entirely to the nurſes and ſervants, they muſt be directed to fold them immediately, and to throw them into cold water, where
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:034311_0132_0FFC3E5E68CE6D28"/>they ſhould be kept for twenty-four hours, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with aſhes to be filtrated into lie, with which they muſt be waſhed. The ſame care ſhould be extended to the beds. At leaſt they ſhould not be uſed again but after repeated night and morning airings. Infine, the attendants ſhould be careful to promote in themſelves a a conſtant ſpitting, and to avoid, as much as poſſible, ſwallowing the ſaliva. But let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that, with theſe general cautions, and many more too tedious to be related, at the cloſe of the ſeventh day, the convaleſcent patient can no longer tranſmit any contagion. His recovering ſtate, is a proof of the purity of his blood. How diſtreſſing, therefore, would it be, under a falſe idea of danger, ſtill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue our intercourſe with him with reſerve and caution, when it is no longer neceſſary. He has been already too long obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider himſelf as an object of terror and dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction. To what a perilous deſpondency has he not been delivered by fugitive friends and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations! To what afflictive ſolitude has he not been condemned, while excruciated by a devouring poiſon! The arm of Providence could alone help him from under the two fold preſſure of his body and of his mind! The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer may counteract the laws of life as ſoon and as irrevocably as the latter! And ye attendants
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:034311_0133_0FFC3E5CE1B7D218"/>of the ſick, if a liberal and philanthropic mind ennobles your cares and ſervices to your fellow beings; if you are not ſtrangers to a moral ſympathy—to the ſupreme maxim of doing to others as you would be done by; and if it is your pride not to value your dangerous taſk by pecuniary compenſations, you deſerve protection from heaven and reſpect from your fellow citizens. But ſuch a meritorious claim is loſt by mere mercenary ſervices, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come baneful to unfortunate patients whom your expreſſed terrors and affected impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, loudly beſpeak as objects of horror in the creation. Deſpair, abſolute deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and depreſſion of ſpirits, will ſoon ſubdue the ſmall ſhare of organic ſtrength left to them in this ferocious diſorder. Their fate is in your hands, more than in medical ſkill, if charitable cares, hopeful words, and apparent confidence, are not continually and ingeniouſly offered, as the moſt ſuceſsful comfort that will help, both the power of nature, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of phyſicians.</p>

                  <p>J. W. upwards of forty-five, was corpulent, ſanguineo-phlegmatic, robuſt, and apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge in the uſe of ſpiritous liquors. For ſome years, he had been ſubject, during the winter, to pains in the breaſt, and to congeſtion of bile in the ſtomach. He was ſoon relieved by dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and depleting remedies; but, after ſeveral relapſes, I had ſufficient reaſon to think his complaint a chronical one, originating from ſome ſerious cauſe. He oppoſed any further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation, always depending upon a real cure. He was taken, on the 22d of July, of the
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:034311_0136_0FFC3E5523ECA3D8"/>laſt ſeaſon, with all the alarming ſymptoms of the yellow fever, and was treated accordingly. As his pulſe was hectic, in the beginning, I was not ſurpriſed to find him worſe on the ſecond and third days. The evacuations were always colliquative and foetid, his urine ſuppreſſed, and copious bleeding, could never abate the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſymptoms. I affirmed, to his friends, that he would die in two days. I nevertheleſs endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to enquire from his neareſt relation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch circumſtances as would lead to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the real chronical cauſe, which was ſo highly aggravating this acute malady; and it was at laſt diſcovered, that, for nine years paſt, he had been ſubject to what was termed, the gravel. Sufficient inductions could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately explain my ſuſpicions, although it was too late to remedy a diſeaſed viſcera. It was intereſting to aſcertain the caſe, and I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave from the patient to introduce a catheter and a bougie into his bladder. With the firſt I found inſurmountable obſtacles; but, with the latter, I penetrated all the <hi>meatus ut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A laſt attempt with a catheter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a large and ſoft tumour ariſing from the neck of the bladder, and from it I drew
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:034311_0137_0FFC3E539B768480"/>pure blood and clots of brown matter. The next day, the fifth, the patient was as yellow as a marigold; he ſeemed choaked with an infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fluid in his ſtomach, and he expired in the evening.</p>

                  <p>It would be ſuperfluous to explain the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mordial cauſe of theſe ſtrictures, of the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the proſtrate, and the tumour projecting within the bladder. It would rather appear ſtrange that the patient had ſo long complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the gravel, without ever being obliged to apply to more direct and efficacious meaſures, if we were unacquainted with the indiſtinct and confuſed feelings of thoſe who have long laboured under a chronical complaint. This patient was more affected by the effect than by the cauſe. When the ſecretions from the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and kidneys were totally diſordered, the blood retained much of the urine, and cauſed the ſecretion in the liver to be more copious and corrupted. Thus frequent bilious congeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions took place in the ſtomach, &amp;c.

                  <p>C. D. was a man of fifty years of age, of a very thin habit, with large and numerous blood veſſels; of a merry diſpoſition; and who had unreſervedly uſed high food and ſtrong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors. He was ſtill very cautious, in the month of October, 1793, and continued to live in a country place in the neighbourhood. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of a friend induced him to come in town, and he was immediately taken. His previous complaints were ſaid to be a conſtant rheumatic affection, in the thighs and hips. He had alſo frequently experienced paroxiſms of gravel, and no more could be ſaid on that reſpect. His fever was very high; his face red, lurid, and all his frame agitated. A copious bleeding, nitrous drinks, and mercurial draſtics, were adminiſtered in the ſecond day. They afforded but a very ſhort remiſſion. The evacuations
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:034311_0139_0FFC3E4EE0583278"/>contained very little bile; the urine was very clear; and he felt an uncommon proſtration of ſtrength. I had, from the patient himſelf, that he did not feel whether he had a ſtomach and a belly. I conceived him to be under a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fatal prognoſis. Two other bleedings were ordered in a ſhort interval, with more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful evacuations, and an emetic. They had not the leaſt favourable effects. He continued reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, aſleep, and had a violent chill. His deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency grew more alarming. He loſt all feeling. The jaundice came on rapidly, on the third day, tinged with a blackiſh hue; and he died on the fourth.</p>

                  <p>If the firſt mercurial draſtics, adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a little after veneſection and when the exacerbation abates, are unattended with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe diſcharge of green bile, we will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fail in all the ſubſequent applications; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not any other combination of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to overcome the increaſing reſiſtance of the morbid cauſe. Proſtration of ſtrength is, alſo, a premature ſymptom of death, when it appears without previous critical operations. Infine, the ſecond exacerbation of this patient
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:034311_0140_0FFC3E4BC11B3018"/>came on with a chill, and nothing could be more ominous.

                  <p>A young gentleman, J. T. of a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſanguineo-phlegmatic; of irritable nerves, ſober life, thin habit, and ſubject to frequent weakneſs of the ſtomach, was ſeized with a ſhivering, internal burning heat, retching, ſpontaneous puking of bile, and the moſt tumultuous fever. Headach, pains in the limbs, with exceſſive anxiety of mind and body, had increaſed to an inſupportable degree, when I firſt ſaw him; and nothing better could be done than to open a vein and let out twelve
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:034311_0141_0FFC3E4A31FAF7B8"/>ounces of blood. The uſual mercurial draſtics were given after the exacerbation, in very ſmall doſes, and their operation was very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and contained very little bile. The urine appeared turbid and foetid. The ſecond day offered a very gloomy proſpect for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture iſſue. The countenance and look of the patient were confuſed, although he was beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully red coloured, and I diſcovered retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſome convulſions in the muſcles of the arm and a general ſpaſmodic ſtate, with a ſlight pain in the pit of the ſtomach. His tongue was covered with a thick yellowiſh cruſt, and his pulſe very hard. I thus judged that the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt benefit had not been obtained, and that the caſe was more perilous. With the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of oppofing the ſpaſms and irritation, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing them to the greateſt poſſible degree, and of procuring afterwards critical evacuations, he was ordered to be put into a ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm bath, and bled after it. With theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious means, it was probable that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an antimonial emetic would be regular. It certainly anſwered to profuſe evacuation of hepatic bile, but it drew the patient into the moſt alarming faintneſs and convulſion. We were then in the third day! I gave up all my hopes. Other remedies, as bliſters, and draſtics, were ſubſequently adminiſtered to gratify the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:034311_0142_0FFC3E47E82B43A0"/>of friends; but the amiable youth rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed more dangerous ſymptoms. A deep orange colour ſuffuſed all over his body on the fourth day; ſome black, yellowiſh, and foetid ſtools took place, and his delirium in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to diſparity. In the evening, he got up, could walk, and in many other exertions, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed the vigilance of his attendants, until he was ſeized with agonizing pains; he expired early on the fifth day.</p>

                  <p>The moſt inſidious caſe was that of B. a robuſt young man, of twenty-three, brought up to hard labour, of a bilious temperament, of a middling ſize and regular habit, ſtrong nerves and hard fibres. The moſt particular care was paid to him, and he went through all the ſtages of the malady without any very alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſymptom; for he died on the eigthth day, after a ſhort agony, without any previous proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of ſtrength or a moment of delirium. Of the uſual criſes of the yellow fever, the jaundice only had been marked ſince the fifth day. It is true the urine was very rare, but bleedings, mercurial draſtics, and other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, had all produced viſible effects, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory relief. Every night the patient appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be refreſhed with a few hours of ſleep. If he had ſome anxiety, it was rather from
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:034311_0144_0FFC3E42A1407B50"/>his mind than from his body. Sitting upon his bed, converſing, and directing himſelf the preparations of medicine, was his ſituation more or leſs, until the laſt moment of his life, and I confeſs that, during four days, he deceived my expectation. My reader will now recollect ſome obſervations made in p. 32, reſpecting dangerous ſymptoms, which it is ſo difficult to diſtinguiſh. I have there ſtated that want of ſufficient evacuations of bile, loſs of painful anxieties of the body, an uncommon degree of ſtrength and chills preceding the fever, and muſcular convulſions, were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remaining but fatal ſymptoms in inſidious caſes. Theſe were all the ſtriking ſigns diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marked in this patient; and, in ſpite of the apparent mildneſs of all other ſymptoms, they always conſtituted an alarming prognoſis, which the iſſue juſtified by a ſudden death. It was very intereſting to aſcertain what previous diſorder in the conſtitution, or in any viſcera, had aggravated the caſe of this robuſt young man; but, if there was any, I could not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, and remained ſatisfied with that general opinion, that deſtruction of life is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cauſed by unobſerved violation of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral laws, than by effects that ſtrike our ſenſes and our feelings.</p>

                  <p>Mr. F. d' E. a foreign gentleman, was taken in the latter end of Auguſt. He was upwards of thirty-ſix, of a pale complexion, tall and ſlim in his body, bilious-choleric in his temperament, of great ſenſibility, and of a ſedentary life. Recent misfortunes had much undermined a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution naturally ſtrong. He had lately been ſubject to frequent indiſpoſitions of the ſtomach, and chiefly ſo fifteen days before his laſt ſickneſs, during which time he had entirely loſt his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. Probably he received the infection in the company of a friend who fell a victim, a few days before, and it quickly diſturbed the opertion of every function. His firſt and ſonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous pukings of the bile were very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as well as his inflammatory diatheſis. He loſt near forty ounces of blood, in leſs than twenty-four hours. On the ſecond day, all eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations had been colliquative, foetid, and without cyſtic bile. In the exacerbation of the following night, he complained of an internal burning heat, and his eyes appeared red and
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:034311_0146_0FFC3E3EC8B93EF0"/>inflamed. In vain did I again employ the beſt of an antiphlogiſtic method; and neither anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or mercury could ſtimulate the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs of the bile. On the third day no dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind was remarked; but, on the contrary, an incoherent converſation, a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and grim look, and a conſtant watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs prevailed, ſo that he could not bear the ſlighteſt covering in the way of bed-clothes, and was often indulged in the trial of ſeveral beds, to find a diverſion to the anxieties of his body. At ſuch a ſight we gave way to deſpair, and medical preſcriptions were but formalities of circumſtance! The urine was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſuppreſſed on the fourth day, a ſtricture on the breaſt ſucceeded, with great difficulty of the deglutition, and with an earneſt deſire of drinking, he hardly could ſwallow a few drops of any liquid. The jaundice was diffuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly, leaving pale red ſpots on the joints. His ſpontaneous ſtools were highly foetid, black like foot, and full of white and red flakes, very ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar to parcels of teguments of the bowels. Never, never, were greater ravages and putreſcence ſeen in the human frame, except in the plague<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Yet the pulſe was regular. On the forenoon of the fifth day, our unfortunate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient got up and completely dreſſed himſelf. With an uncommon vigour he came down from
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:034311_0147_0FFC3E3C5533C3D0"/>a bed room, into the yard, to ſit and converſe with aſtoniſhed friends. No longer than half an hour was the deluſion of health and life given to him. Alas! an horrid look a deep yellow colour, and a blackiſh hue diffuſed over his face formed a countenance which could no longer deceive a medical obſerver. The motions of his body were now anſwered by pains in the abdominalia; his pulſe became convulſive; a tumultuous delirium marked his agony; and he died late in the night, when a great quantity of putrid blood burſt and was diſcharged from the bowels.</p>

                  <p>A young man, of about twenty-five, of a florid countenance, plethoric habit, of a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and irregular life, was ſeized with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fit of epilepſy in the ſtreet. He was taken up and carried to his bed in that ſtate of ſtupor which accompanies ſuch paroxiſins. His pulſe was depreſſed and intermittent; but, as ſoon as he was copiouſly bled, he vomited a great quantity of yellow bile, and an exacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of high fever immediately came on, which cauſed another bleeding to be preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, with an antimonial emetic, a few hours after. It did not produce the leaſt motion, although he had been bled twice, which I aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the higheſt degree of ſpaſmodic and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory diatheſis. In fact, his tongue and face were yet of a red fiery colour and his ſenſibility was not yet reſtored. I feared that an immediate bleeding could not bring any further relaxation, nor procure evacuations of the bile, and that I ſhould ſoon looſe my patient. In this perilous ſituation. I could truſt only to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The orifice of the bleeding was examined
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:034311_0150_0FFC3E3595E18060"/>and covered with a greaſed lint, and the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage was relaxed with the view of procuring, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the night, a ſpontaneous diſcharge of blood, leſt the next exacerbation ſhould be kept up too high, and leave again a tonic re-action. NO inſtructions were left to the attendants, for fear of dangerous miſapprehenſions. Nitrous and copious injections were ordered for every two hours, and a doſe of mercurial draſtic pills was given before the fever, and the ſame after it. All that had been foreſeen and wiſhed for happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The fever ſoon became ſo turbulent on the delirious patient, that the blood burſted out from the orifice which had been prepared, and continued to run to more than fourteen ounces, and until the patient was deluged with it. The fever than abated with a relaxation; as the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen had been refreſhed by many injections, the criſis happened to be more complete. The former emetic, and the mercurial pills, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all at once, and they cauſed, in every way, prodigious diſcharges of dark green bile, which, by its acrimony, excoriated the ſphincters of the fundament. Early the next day, I ſaw the patient in this favourable ſtate. He felt extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weak, but his pulſe, and his ſkin were good. I continued and kept up the flux and evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the bowels, until they appeared of a natural <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>It has been frequently ſeen, during the two laſt prevalences of the yellow fever in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, that the breaking of the malady was marked by an epileptical fit, as it often happens in the ſmall pox and ſeveral other caſes; for, in whatever pathology epilepſy is underſtood, it is admitted that it may originate from ſtrong ſpaſms in the ſtomach and inteſtines. That the effect or action of a highly malignant contagion can at firſt be entirely directed on the nervous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, is likewiſe beyond any doubt. With theſe previous hints, and with the certainty that the patient had never been ſubject to that complaint, nor particularly to any other, the circumſtance alone of the prevailing epidemic, juſtified an immediate treatment for the yellow fever. The continuation of the inflammatory ſymptoms af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two ſucceſſive bleedings, and the ineffica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of an antimonial emetic, evinced what has been already ſtated of the impoſſibility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the body of the contaminated bile, or of the ſpecific contagion, leſt an artificial or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural relaxation is timely brought on. The fact
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:034311_0152_0FFC3E304B3366B0"/>alſo proved, that I ought not to have heſitated for a third bleeding, in the firſt day, although two preceding ones proved inefficacious; but I yet queſtion whether the effect of the latter had been ſo well applied as the ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous bleeding, the meaſure of which I left to the force of the next exacerbation. Be it as it may, the profuſe diſcharge of dark green bile, was as ſudden as the reſiſtance had appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obſtinate. Another intereſting ground of obſervation occurs in the above caſe. What is the reaſon of its being evolved in ſo ſhort a time as three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="145" facs="unknown:034311_0153_0FFC3E2EC269B8B8"/>another reaſon ſtrikes us when we conſider that the iſſue of the malady muſt, neceſſarily, depend very much upon the effect or quantity of the ſpecific contagion that has been diffuſed from the bile into the blood. When the former is timely evacuated and renewed, the latter remains to be purified. This operation we have ſaid, nature may perform, within a certain ſpace of time, and with the help of artificial or ſpontaneous means; ſuppoſing thus that the contaminated bile has not had ſufficient time to communicate its virus to the blood, and that it has been ſpeedily all evacuated, nothing will remain to be done; and with this obtained ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the diſorder will be put to an end; but if, on the contrary, the blood has been infected, then the fever and all its ſymptoms attending the malignancy o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>H.

In attending the ſick, who had recovered, me took the infection. Although ſhe had all the uſual ſymptoms and puked much, ſhe thought but little of her caſe. She had herſelf bled copiouſly, applied a bliſter to her breaſt, and hardly permitted herſelf to be under me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical direction. I ſaw her late in the evening of the ſecond day, full of courage and ſpirits; but, as during the remiſſion of the fever, her pulſe was hard and tenſe, and as ſhe was in an unnatural agitation, her caſe was, at leaſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerious. The epiſpaſtic plaſter was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately taken of. Diluting drinks, and carmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and nitrous injections were ordered, with mercurial draſtics in pill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> at different times. All theſe remedies anſwered very well, and produced copious evacuations of green bile. On the fourth day, the pulſe was yet a little convulſive, and the exacerbation brought on a delirium. Thinking it not very neceſſary to
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:034311_0155_0FFC3E289F10A300"/>relax the ſyſtem, by means of bleeding, for fear of counteracting too much the organic ſtrength of an aged body, I gave a cathartico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emetic, with previous dilutings. One grain of antimoniated tartar, diſſolved with an ounce of ſalt of glaubert, in a quart of water, a half a pint of which was to be taken every two hours, cauſed little retchings, but produced a prodigious evacuation of yellow, green, brown, and clammy matters. The reſultion of the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was preſumed, and ſome opium was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered. Yet, on the ſixth day, we were threatened with a melancholic diſappointment. An eruption of ſmall red petechiae appeared on the breaſt, thighs, and arms; the root of the tongue was bordering on the black colour; the pulſe was had; the ſtomach threw up eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, without much anxiety to the patient, who ſeemed reduced to an alarming proſtration of ſtrength, and ſome black blood had been diſcharged by the ſtools. Two circumſtances only ſupported my hope; the jaundice was yet almoſt imperceptible, and flatulencies in the large inteſtines, with a tendency to local in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation and <hi>teneſmus,</hi> promiſed a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and determined criſis. Formentations were ordered on the abdomen and mercurial draſtics were given again, with alternative doſes of caſtor oil. At laſt a purulent and bloody

                  <p>In two inſtances, during this treatment, it ſeemed uncertain whether it was juſtifiable to have omitted more frequently bleedings. Yet this reſerve, I would never neglect in aged people, who are ſooner brought to a dangerous weakneſs, than to a ſalutary relaxation, whoſe fluids beſides are never of the ſame inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory degree as obſerved among young ſubjects. The good conſtitution of the patient, I own, helped her in theſe uninterrupted evacuations during nine days; but from this caſe what remarkable inductions of their importance may we not deduce notwithſtanding the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are dangerous, and although the patient ſhould be in momentary but deceiving appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of recovery.</p>

Two copious bleedings, a warm bathing, nitrous injections, diluting drinks, cathartico-emetics, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial draſtics, procured ſufficient evacautions of bile, and nothing altered the regularity of the exacerbations. On the fourth day, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable eruption of ſmall red petechiae broke out, almoſt all over the body, and the patient informed me of a violent pain felt in the paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid glands. A cool ſweat diffuſed all over his head, and he was in a great febrile anxiety. Foreſeeing a ſalutary criſis from the mouth, I rendered the draſtics more mercurial and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waited for the reſult. The ſwelling of the parotids rapidly came on. It broke out on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day with an inſupportable ſtench and the moſt profuſe ſalivation. The patient could not ſpeak, and large ulcers on the gums and fauces, rendered his deglutition very difficult. It was a pleaſing proſpect that this criſis would throw off the contagious matter from the inmoſt receſſes and happily terminate the yellow fever without any further neceſſary application; but
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:034311_0158_0FFC3E230D5D6EB8"/>the inflammation of the mouth grew ſo alarming that it threatened with danger of another kind, whilſt the patient could not ſwallow any nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and as the internal eroſions gave way to frequent ſmall haemorrhages. Such an irritat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe excited a ſymptomatic fever, attended with extreme anxiety of the mind and body. The infection from the ſalivary glands was ſo great that it was inſupportably ſmelt, even at a great diſtance from the patient, and in ſpite of an ardent chimney fire. It was indeed recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by many perſons; and upwards of two gallons of ſaliva was one day evacuated. Care was taken to relieve the gums, by cleaning the teeth and ſcrap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Yet, agreeably to the intention of evacuating the bile, it had been all preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated downwards, by the power of other draſtics, and after very particular obſervation; ſo that nothing or very little of that ſpecific medicine could remain in the <hi>primae viae,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſuch a ſalivation in a man of ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. It is true, that as ſoon as its approach was perceived and determined, more mercury was uſed; but always with the caution to direct its effects towards the bowels. It thus remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be concluded, that the criſis was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpontaneous, and ſuch as may ſucceed in every malignant fever, and once out of ten caſes in the yellow fever.</p>
                  <p>A remarkable circumſtance alſo fixes our attention in this ſubject. Whatever means of reſolution we have ſeen terminating the yellow fever, I do not remember of a ſingle inſtance without jaundice, except when the ſwelling and ſuppuration of the parotids have been ſpontaneous. If the morbid bile, thrown into the blood, conſtitutes the regular duration of the malignant diſorder, within a certain ſpace of time, with the viſible effect of jaundice, it is a fact, that, before this morbid fluid could
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:034311_0160_0FFC3E1DA81C47B0"/>be confined in the laſt receſſes of the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over the ſkin, it may be determined by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable laws, but almoſt unknown to us, to fix itſelf within the ſalivary glands, from where it will poured off, like a torrent, in a more diluted ſtate. This happy effect will, then, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the jaundice and evince the neceſſity of a criſis, to help the patient in getting rid of ſo great a quantity of noxious and morbid fluids. The above caſe, with one of the following, will alſo ſuggeſt further cautions to the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; for the infectious matter poured off by ſalivation appeared to be more intenſe, and of a more penetrating malignancy than is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly produced in other ſecretions. The operator who had cleaned the teeth of this patient, was immediately taken with an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid pain in the arm, and an eruption on it of a gangrenous nature, of which I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. As long as the ptyalſm is kept up, the enſuing diſcharges, which in theſe caſes are purulent, and form a ſediment, ſhould be received in veſſels prepared for the purpoſe, and half filled up with lime or any other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbant earth. The linen likewiſe, ſo often wanted to cover or wipe the mouth, ſhould be frequently changed and waſhed with the ſame care as above deſcribed, &amp;c.</p>

S. a gentleman upwards of forty, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent, robuſt, and healthful, lately from the European continent, prone to a ſedentary life, but regularly addicted to a wholeſome and light diet, was taken during the fever of 1793. Unacquainted with all the fatal circumſtances of the prevailing epidemic, he applied to ſome
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:034311_0164_0FFC3E146782FD80"/>ſimple evacuating remedies, until his ſtate grew very alarming, towards the end of the ſecond day. At this moment, a friend who ſlept in the ſame room with him, and who had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected during four days of ſickneſs, was dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. All theſe circumſtances threw him into dreadful convulſive motions. A vein being opened, the convulſions increaſed, and never ceaſed but by the means of an antimonial eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, the operation of which produced much good and gave ſome regularity to the courſe of the malady. At the firſt appearance of an exacerbation of fever, having propoſed blood letting, the patient, who never was bled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this attack of ſickneſs, and to whom the laſt bleeding had not appeared beneficial, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed to comply with this preſcription, and ſimple depleting remedies only were uſed.</p>
                  <p>On the fourth day he was in a great dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, dejection, and deſpondency of mind; livid and yellowiſh large petechiae appeared and covered his body: but a more alarming ſymptom was that of a violent ſingultus or hiccough immediately acceding. The reader muſt be informed, that the liberty of directing this treatment was every day checked by the patient. Although little hope was entertained, the opportunity of his delirium was ſeized to
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:034311_0165_0FFC3E12DC4AD028"/>adminiſter antiſceptic and draſtic injections, with bliſters. The jaundice, the petechiae, and the hiccough, ſeemed to be aggravated, and at laſt, to our great aſtoniſhment, on the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of his ſickneſs, ſymptoms were ſeen of a recovery which proved effectual and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

                  <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that medical theory had but little participation to this unexpected cure. Moreover, this was one of thoſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inſtances, and not uncommon indeed, in which particular laws and ſymptoms being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved, we are eſpecially deceived in our prognoſtics and miſtaken in our fears. It is to be lamented that, in ſuch caſes, the medical art is not in poſſeſſion of more deciſive rules than thoſe which are commonly obſerved; for there is no fatal prognoſtic, but we may find, although very ſeldom, its exception for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary iſſue, and no favourable admitted ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms but were alſo ſucceeded by unexpected death. No doubt, this limitation of human knowledge devoted, more than once, victims to a fatal or premature dereliction, and raiſed op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probious reproaches againſt the medical ſcience;
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:034311_0166_0FFC3E108C5A6A20"/>yet reaſon and experience will unite to juſtify human errors and ignorance, as long as we will be ſurrounded by myſterious laws in nature. But what we can ſay is that if every age has added new treaſures to our ſolicitous inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, why ſhould we deſpair to diſcloſe at laſt all the means that may concur to the ſafety of our life and preſervation of our health? With this juſt confidence, practitioners in phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic will never think that taſk ſuperfluous devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to them of attaining, by one way or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to that philoſophical ſtone of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, THE ART OF CERTAIN PROGNOSTICS. Its elements, it is true, are perhaps as extenſive as all the cauſes concurring for the phenomenon of life, and as much as the innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations that may counteract it; but let us indulge the conſoling hope, that that analyſis, which has ſubmitted to our ſpeculations, as many extenſive laws of nature, from the rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling planets and lightenings above, down to the ambient fluids which are unperceived by our ſenſes; the ſame analogies, I ſay, might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and with a far more glorious ſucceſs, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all the laws of nature, round the bed of a patient. This is a theatre, where we only can inveſtigate effects almoſt unknown, and ſeldom adverted to in ſchools and books; nay, effects
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:034311_0167_0FFC3E0E4C3B0EC8"/>unavoidably and often miſtaken by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of methods and ſyſtems. If I dare to declare it and to appeal to my judgment, I believe there is not a judicious and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced phyſician but whoſe opinion is ſettled ſafe and free, when conceived rather on the bed ſide of his patient, than when aided by any other authority.</p>
                  <p>By what expreſſion or power, in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a patient, without any reference to ſymptoms and circumſtances, are we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined? Is there not ſomething undefined in the motions, or in the muſcles, in the correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence of theſe with the mental faculties, that equally contradicts received opinions, ſymptomatic reſults, and ſuggeſts true prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtics? If we can point out frequent inſtances where our judgment has been ſtrikingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by means, thoroughly unaccountable, would it be impoſſible to analyſe them, or to direct our attention to many others? Let us rather fear, that, in fact, we are not ſufficiently acquainted with the laws or effects of life and health. Our phyſiological methods ſeem to have included a ſeries of moſt ſtriking circumſtances; and a veil has been thrown upon any thing apparently unattainable by the multitude. We judge of debility and we have no certain ſcale
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:034311_0168_0FFC3E0B1E84D9D8"/>of the vital ſtrength applicable to all ages and caſes. We remark ſeveral degrees of fever, and we remain abſolutely ignorant of its hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draulick and ſtatick cauſes. We conceive that life cannot be without motion, and it would be impoſſible for us to reconcile its acceleration with health, and its abatement with death. After long obſervations we have known, the degree of our animal heat, when in a ſtate of health, and of its variations neceſſarily reſulting from ceſſation of health, we could not exactly apply a ſingle one to any malady whatever. Infine, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the mind we ſubordinate to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of our art, and from thoſe of a patient we hardly could know how to derive ſome help for our ſucceſs. Many other points are bounds and limits of our knowledge, and will long render it imperfect. But if the few which I have mentioned give a true, though imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect idea of what it remains to us to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, to be unexceptionable good judges in human diſeaſes, I have ſufficiently juſtified unavoidable errors of practitioners in their prognoſtics, after having exemplified the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous and natural cure of one of the moſt fatal diſorders.</p>

                  <head>CASE—No. XI.</head>
                  <p>An unmarried woman, of thirty-ſix, of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine complexion, regular habits, and nimble body, went through the firſt ſtages of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, without any alarming ſymptoms. Our uſual applications were faithfully obſerved except in one point. She was ſo extremely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt the very name of mercury, that it would have been a very provoking meaſure to inſiſt on its exhibition, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing it. I therefore diminiſhed conſiderably the doſes, and involved them with aromatic eſſences. It was not perceived in the leaſt and nothing diſturbed our harmony; becauſe the known efficacy and ſtimulating power of that ſpecific on the ſalival glands could never take place. On the fourth day, while ſhe was in every way worſe than ever, ſhe complained of a dull pain in the parotids, without any apparent ſwelling; emollient fomentations were ordered round the neck and on the breaſt. On the ſixth day the ſwelling and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the mouth were ſettled; on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:034311_0170_0FFC3E074AB79F30"/>coming into the room of the patient, an inſupportable ſtench abſolutely ſimilar to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of foeces ſtruck me, and it could not be diſcovered to originate but in the ſaliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which continued near eight days, profuſe, regular, and ſucceſsful. No jaundice appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the body of the patient. The preſence of the infecting miaſmata could never be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely covered by fumigations and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients. Nobody came in the houſe of this female, until ſhe began to recover, but were immediately indiſpoſed or effectually took the yellow fever.</p>

                  <p>As the ſmalleſt quantity of calomel has been known ſufficient to promote a ſalivation among delicate and irritable conſtitutions, I would not deduce much from this inſtance, if I had not been obliged to employ means which were to counteract abſolutely ſuch effects. Moreover, it was never obſerved that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient felt any previous and gradual affection in her mouth, as it is ſo common and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be acted upon by that mineral ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific. It was no longer adminiſtered than was neceſſary for the evacuations of bile,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:034311_0171_0FFA6B954EF9E490"/>even ſince the third day: yet the criſis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly attained to the higheſt degree, with the perfect cure of the patient. It therefore reſted with me to judge this ſwelling and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration of the parotids, to be merely a ſpontaneous criſis, ſuch as occurs in malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fevers and in the yellow fever, but ſuch as is uſeleſs and dangerous to promote ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially, among thoſe who might be of a different tendency and cured by a different criſis.</p>

                  <p>I am of a bilious choleric temperament, and irritable nerves. The leaſt indiſpoſition, and chiefly the preſence of infectious exhalations, is ſo ſoon felt, that neither can obtain time enough to agravate itſelf. As often as I had percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the dangerous effluvia, I alſo experienced a ſubſequent indiſpoſition, of which, ſpeedy and proper means always prevented me from knowing any further conſequents. When I thought neceſſary to ſcrape the teeth of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of the above caſe, No. 10, which being covered with thick ſcales, exaſperated much
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:034311_0172_0FFC3E044E324318"/>more the inflammation of the gums, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally put too much my ſenſes, with my hand, in contact with a very ſubtile and infectious emanation. The conſequence was, that I ſoon felt a very numb pain at each ſide of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyles, on the lower extremity of my right <hi>os humeri.</hi> It is a very remarkable circumſtance, that, from an eminence of thoſe condyles, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral muſcles of the hand and fingers take their origin. The pain grew ſo inſupportable, while it was independent of my motions, that ſmall doſes of opium were requiſite for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary reſt. Emollient and reſolutive poultices really exaſperated the pain, and my anxiety, was as often renewed, ſince I could only form conjectures of its probable cauſe. A few days brought on a more ſerious diagnoſtic, a violent headach and diſordered functions, which ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuggeſted the neceſſity of an emetic. This was the firſt means of relief that I found to my pain; and while I was ſubmitting myſelf to the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of mercurial draſtics, I diſcovered that the infection of the yellow fever was the cauſe of my ſtrange indiſpoſition. On one part, copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us diſcharges of dark green bile, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly obtained, and on the other, my elbow ſwelled and inflammed. Numerous <hi>phlictenes,</hi> full of ſania, formed on it and broke out; thick teguments turned black and detached in a ſcab
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:034311_0173_0FFC3E01EA2CAD38"/>of two inches in diameter, with the abſolute ceſſation of any pain and a perfect reſtoration of health.</p>

                  <p>We have already ſeen, that Pouppe Deſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes notices the <hi>malady of Siam</hi> to be ſometimes remarkably preceded by ſuppurations of the joints, and dry ſpots of mortification on the ſkin. He accounted for theſe and other extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſymptoms, by the effects of a poiſon, which he called <hi>peſtilential,</hi> that ſometimes fixed itſelf in parts diſtinct from the viſcera. This poiſon is, moſt commonly, inhaled through the mouth, in reſpiration, whence it diffuſes through the alimentary channel, diſturbs, at firſt, all its functions, and contaminates all its fluids. The abſorbent lymphatic veſſels take their riſe from the ſkin, which may determine ſuch a ſingular caſe, whenever they come in contact with the infection, ſo immediately as I did when my hand and fingers were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the mouth of the patient. Whether the ſubſequent violent illneſs was ſymptomatic of the affection of the arm, or whether I had likewiſe received the infection in the bile, I am not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; though, to me, the latter ſeems moſt
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:034311_0174_0FFC3E0062BA6950"/>probable, as the pain remained invariably on the ſame point, and never extended further up the <hi>os humeri</hi>; and yet, the morbid cauſe in the viſcera was proved both by the illneſs and the evacuations. The cutaneous teguments which really mortified and formed a pretty thick eſchar, preceded by <hi>phlictenes,</hi> were my demonſtrative proofs of the virulence of a poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which had on the ſkin as much power as a a burn, when ſeconded by natural exertions, and emollient poultices, it exuded out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. This inſtance will, above all, juſtify my above theories and obſervations on the greater danger of infection from recovering patients: the more contagious miaſmata they throw off, the more certain is their recovery.</p>

               <p>I WOULD, perhaps, deſerve the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of having aſſumed too great and bold a confidence, if I now ſhould omit earneſtly to ſolicit your indulgence and that of the public
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:034311_0175_0FFC3DFE20D1AC20"/>The ſubject I have treated, requires undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly longer inveſtigations and many more of thoſe qualifications which are acceſſary to a writer. It is true, the language to which I was obliged to entruſt my obſervations, which never was that of my youth nor of habitude, could not be but a rugged and difficult road, where I ought to have feared to entangle my reader. To ſuch a conſideration, I had ſurely ſacrificed my emulation and my attempt, had I not been much more impreſſed upon with the duty of joining what I could of my views to all thoſe from which the whole nation expect to derive ſome relief againſt ſo great a calamity. Truth could never be attained, if diſcuſſions from various ſides and opinions were not alike inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by free and liberal communications. The public claims, as it were, that every one ſhould be liſtened to who thinks that he can contribute to the common welfare. It is of no importance if the learned are divided among themſelves, it always is and always will be ſo, until the truth comes out. There are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides principles or opinions which are not to be excluſively for the learned, whatever may be their conteſt and ſyſtems. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if theſe opinions are good and ſafe, they ſpread and propagate among the people at large, becauſe there is much reaſon and good
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:034311_0176_0FFC3DFBD236A0D0"/>ſenſe, and no party ſpirit among the people. This is the cauſe why it has happened ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that the public have adopted ſound and definitive opinions, while the learned had not yet ſettled their own variances. J. James Rouſſeau reports, that a peaſant of Sileſia had the honour of ſettling a great and ſerious ſcientifical conteſt among the learned in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, who could not agree, or explain, in the ſame way, how a child could be born with a golden tooth!! He firſt thought it neceſſary to eſtabliſh the fact, and this he took the trouble upon himſelf to do, which he proved to be a falſhood.</p>
               <p>Far be it from me, gentlemen, by relating this fact, to throw out any alluſion againſt phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians of this city, with whom, I am not ſo happy as to agree in opinion, on ſeveral of the above ſubjects; it will be ſufficient, perhaps, to declare that I profeſs the greateſt reſpect for many of them; but there are many inſtances to prove, that, in matters of fact and reaſon, the tribunal of the public opinion will, at laſt, be the beſt judge. It was thus in Marſeillies in the year 1720. While the plague was rapidly ſpreading and raging, phyſicians and ſurgeons publicly declared, that the prevailing diſeaſe was not the plague, nor even contagious; and
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:034311_0177_0FFC3DF8DB67B770"/>the famous Dr. Aſtruc had to contend againſt all of them, until the fact and the public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the plague. Unfortunately, Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia will be expoſed to the dreadful experience of more facts, and then the public will decide againſt all the alledged authorities and ſyſtems. Thus to the public, as a fellow citizen, I thought it my duty, to fulfil this taſk, and to you, gentlemen, as a phyſician, to preſent my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigations and experience. Beſides, if every man be indebted to the country and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to which he chooſes to belong, it is my peculiar ſatisfaction in being enabled to pay this tribute of gratitude to the citzens of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia. On theſe motives, therefore, I ground my claim for the indulgence I ſolicit for this publication; and, however imperfect it may appear, in the extent, diſcernment, and foreign dreſs of my obſervations, if, among the poſſible ſarcaſms of criticiſm, no kind of merit would be beſtowed on my work, ſtill it will remain as a proof of labour and philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; the one is the virtue of a citizen, and the other the character of a phyſician.</p>

               <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
               <p>IT has been without reference to anotomical or phyſiological diſcuſſions that I have explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the proximate cauſe of ſeveral ſymptoms and of the jaundice in the yellow fever, by the immediate paſſage of the infected bile into the blood from the <hi>pori biliarii</hi> into the vena cava, or at laſt by the ſimple and immediate abſorp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bile into the lymphatic veſſels, which exiſt in that viſcera as numerous as in many others, when it is ſtopped or obſtructed in its excretory ducts. I was led to that indifference by contemplating that each theory reſuming the ſame reſult of the admiſſion of the bile in all our fluids, it was unneceſſary to ſtate by what proceſs it had taken place. Another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument alſo ſtruck me in this acute diſorder, as well as in many others, in which the jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice is frequently an attending ſymptoms or a criſis, although I have not mentioned it in any of the above reflections. Each of our ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have more than one object of neceſſary
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:034311_0179_0FFA6B97140E2BA8"/>operation to fulfil for the animal economy. Thus it can be ſaid, that the ſimple perſpiration of the ſkin, while evacuating a ſuperfluous fluid, waſhes and opens the pores. The ſecretion of urine not only filtrates and reduces the blood to its proper degree of fluidity, but it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle intended to carry off any heterogenous ſubſtance admitted into it. The bile, prepared in the liver, beſides being a neceſſary liquor in the digeſtion, will be the means of diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the blood thoſe elementary ſubſtances which were created and added to it by the <hi>chyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> But, if the bile originally received its component parts from the blood, we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that as ſoon as its ſecretion is interrupted, the blood will retain all thoſe component parts; they will then gradually increaſe to ſuch a quantity that they will be by another law emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the receſſes of the circulation, and there form the jaundice. Therefore, in any theory we may admit three origins of <hi>icterus</hi>; one by the infuſion of the bile already formed, and poured from its excretory ducts into the laſt ramifications of the vena cava; another by the abſorbing lymphatic veſſels; and a laſt, by the biliary component parts retained and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the blood whenever that ſecretion cannot take place. Other circumſtances en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the poſſibility of this laſt means of jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:034311_0180_0FFA6B9B595E79F0"/>when we conſider how many cauſes may retard the circulation of the blood in the vena portarum, in conſequence of ſome inflammation or morbid action within the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, where are ſituated all the branches that form its trunk. It is alſo admitted, that, in warm countries, the powers of circulation are much enweakened, by which means the large veſſels may be diſtended, and the bile not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently renewed or diluted. Hence ariſe bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſorders and bilious evacuations, &amp;c. Such are the general grounds by which I ever thought that ſeveral ſymptoms as well as the jaundice in the yellow fever, might equally be underſtood in any of the above theories; but, I have ſince had the opportunity of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very ſolid objection againſt a preſumed cauſe of the jaundice in the yellow fever, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that, by obſervation and ſatisfactory experiments, it has been proved, that, in caſe of ſtoppage or obſtruction, the bile is ſooner, eaſier, and even immediately reſumed by the lymphatic veſſels, inſtead of the veins. This abſorption, it is ſaid, cannot originate but with a ſtoppage of the bile in its excretory ducts, or with an obſtruction in the liver; yet neither are found by diſſection or ſymptoms, in caſes of the yellow fever. Its jaundice, therefore, conſtitutes no ſimilarity with any other kind
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:034311_0181_0FFA6B9D095684A8"/>of remittent fever or bilious diſorder; and it is yet a problematic ſubject and a <hi>morbus ſui generis.</hi> This objection, I muſt own, came to me from a reſpectable quarter, and is connected with ſo many other authorities of facts and opinions, that it indiſpenſably demanded a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration of the ſubject, in order ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to correct my pointed errors, or to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the argument by ſatisfactory reaſons. In the mean time, to my medical reader it will obviouſly appear, that, my only motive for this controverſy, is from a conſiſtency and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the chief opinions of the ſubject upon which I have treated. Thus it will be ſtated,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> as a general view, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of jaundice in any caſe of the only ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of proper ſecretion of bile, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges ſo many probable cauſes, different from any ſort of obſtruction in the liver, that it could not be confined to the theory of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorption of lymphatic veſſels. We ſee the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of an inflammatory and morbid action in the abdomen from the inteſtines or the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and from the diaphragm, immediately diſtending or obſtructing the blood in the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous branches of the vena porta, and ſuſpending the circulation in that large veſſel, more probably ſo when we conſider
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:034311_0182_0FFA6BCAE2466DE8"/>that this heavy column of blood muſt be aſſiſted in its courſe, by all the ſurrounding motions and vibrations. Now, it will always be ſafe to conclude, that, if the blood does not ſecrete in the liver, and particularly ſo in acute fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the principal character of which is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed circulation, it will keep the bilious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent matter, which it ſhould loſe, in the liver, and from that muſt ariſe an accidental <hi>icterus.</hi> But it is objected, that, even in this caſe, bile ſhould be left in the blood, as it finds its elements in the liver. I deny that however, and very confidently, until it ſhall be proved that water could be obtained without <hi>oxygen</hi> or <hi>hydrogen;</hi> or that in any of our glands there is an inexhauſtible quantity of the component parts of <hi>oils, acids, ſalts, water,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The poſſible and immediate infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the bile from the <hi>pori biliarii</hi> into the minuteſt ramifications of veins and arteries, is by no means improbable or impoſſible, although it is granted that their lymphatic branches (as they appear to be) do not belong to the abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent ſyſtem; for injections have been made, with ſucceſs, from the <hi>hepatic dact</hi> into the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na cava and vena porta.</hi> But nothing could bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prove, this immediate infuſion of bile into the blood, than frequent caſes of ſudden
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:034311_0183_0FFC3DF5A58898C8"/>jaundice, by a wound on the head, by too great haemorrhages and profuſe bleedings, by a fit of paſſion or anger, and alſo by the effect of ſtrong and acrid medicines. It occurs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often alſo in practice, among ordinary and quite contrary caſes to any kind of <hi>hepatitis,</hi> when we find, chiefly towards the end, the eyes of our patients very yellow. This is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree of jaundice; yet it could not take place in conſequence of obſtructions, nor by the minute proceſs of all the windings of the abſorbent ſyſtem<note n="*" place="bottom">Some anatomiſts contend that nothing is more rapid in the circulation, than the abſorption of the lacteal veſſels and lymphatic veins. This I grant; but what will be ſaid if the fluid expoſed to abſurption becomes thick and tough?</note>. The bile has, therefore, been immediately ſqueezed and poured into blood veſſels.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Were the abſorbent power of the lymphatic veins the only means and cauſe of jaundice, it could not certainly proceed but by ſuch ſtoppages and obſtructions as after a while would force and open the valves of the mouth of the ſaid lymphatic veins; for, in any other ſtate, the abſorption of the bile could not be affected, as is proved by our uſual ſtate of health. But we ſee the contrary in the yellow fever; no previous ſymptoms
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:034311_0184_0FFC3DF12354DC60"/>induced us to ſuppoſe the formation of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Spontaneous and profuſe evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of bile, and a great quantity of it acrid, always diffuſed all along the alimentary chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, ſeems to prove, that the uſual excretory ducts are opened, and that the only quality of the bile is altered. Let us, then, turn the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in another manner. There is no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the liver nor ſtoppage of the bile in the yellow fever, yet the jaundice regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes place; this muſt, therefore, proceed from ſome other poſſible means of jaundice.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Is there no other ſtate in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glomerate glands, but that of obſtruction, that can diſturb the ſecretions and then expoſe their fluids to the effects of the abſorbent ſyſtem? Are they not ſubject alſo to a quite contrary ſtate, to that of <hi>atrophy</hi>? Although we cannot preciſely account for their mechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical functions, muſt we not ſuppoſe, that, what we call an obſtruction, when we ſee a hard exuberance, or feel a heavy ſwelling in ſome parts, that this ſtate has been preceded by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees of congeſtion and <hi>infarction</hi> which conſiderably diſtended the vaſcular, villous, or <hi>parenchimatous</hi> ſubſtances, and, of courſe, much better favoured the tranſudaton of certain fluids within the abſorbent ſyſtem. It is not
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:034311_0185_0FFC3DEF9B2B23A0"/>indeed when we feel an obſtruction in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or a ſkirrus, or any other unnatural al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, that we ſhould fear that other ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the lymphatic veins; becauſe in this ſtate, various fluids have no longer any circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation nor connection among themſelves; but on the contrary, this abſorption has more probably taken place when the obſtruction was forming, and when the fluids were yet ſufficiently liquid in their circulation. It is not, therefore, neceſſary, to have any viſible obſtruction in the liver or ſtoppage in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory ducts of the bile, to have a ſubſequent jaundice; this without the former happens in the yellow fever, and it is often ſeen without obſtructions, nor ſkirrus in ſeveral inſtances. It may then have originated ſolely from the enthickening of the bile in the <hi>pori billiarii,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let us never confine ourſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in narrower bounds, than thoſe which belong to the admirable laws of nature. Such a large and important viſcera as the liver muſt have more than one means to diſcharge the bile which it cannot empty. That of abſorption only would be eventually interrupted or inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The blood may reſume it, to a certain quantity and pour it into the kidneys, or into any other ſecretion, as known facts have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved. I alſo, readily believe, that the
<pb n="178"
                      facs="unknown:034311_0186_0FFC3DEE080DE7A8"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>lacteal veſſels may take it from the inteſtines, when there is nothing in them but bile, and diſcharge it into the <hi>thoracic</hi> duct, along with the lymphatic veins. I hope, therefore, that the above argument, the ground of which I had leſs the intention to remove than to explain, leaves principles enough with ſufficient means to the above theory on the yellow fever, and to all the ſubſequent opinions.</p>
               <p>A famous doctrine has been introduced into the medical world, and it is yet vigorouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and even improve by numerous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans. We may call it the doctrine of direct and indirect debility, or the ſtimulating ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. The ſupporters of it ſay, that it has ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the imperfect doctrine of ſpaſms and conſtrictions, the ſame as this latter had exploded the old and more imperfect one of viſcidity and lentor. It ſeems that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately that by thoſe methods of definition, modern and ancient diſcoveries are equally marked either with excluſive advantages or with reproachfull defects. Thus the ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious abuſe of words finally will divide lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, as it evidently created many heretics, and ſectaries during paſt ages of chriſtendom. Yet whatever may be the inflexible dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of thoſe who miſtake true learning, by praiſing only one doctrine, who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:034311_0187_0FFC3DEBC9588C30"/>but every judicious phyſician conſiders it as his duty to examine all doctrines, and all methods, with an impartial and unbiaſſed mind to call to his aid all the good reſults from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and principles. It was with the motive of avoiding the abuſe of words and definition that I introduced only the name of Dr. Brown in my note, p. 29, the author of the doctrine abovementioned; although I ought not to have omitted to obſerve that the actual profeſſor of the inſtitutes of medicine, was not preciſely ſubordinate to the Brownonian ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; ſince, on the contrary, he has improved on it, by his excellent views on <hi>morbid excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> on <hi>the preternatural and convulſive actions of the blood veſſels,</hi> on the inequality in fevers, of <hi>excitement and excitability,</hi> and on the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of abſtracting what we ſhould call in other words, ſpaſms, irritation, inflammation, &amp;c. and, in one word, ſuggeſting the relaxation without which no ſolutary criſis are ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid, in page 14, that as
<q>we have not any publication, collectively, from that body (the college of phyſicians) that could exhibit more, and ſtronger arguments than merely their opinion of its importation, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that is unneceſſary for me to ſay any thing either for or againſt the opinion.</q>
This might be deemed a material inaccuracy
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:034311_0188_0FFC3DE8CE880050"/>if I ſhould not add a neceſſary explanation. That body, has, in ſeveral circumſtances, publiſhed the authentic facts, by which it has appeared that the diſorder has been impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from foreign countries. The reader will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that I have not drawn the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy from any of the facts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the importation of the fever nor of of the means which have been alledged to have ſpread it. Their authenticity and moſt ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king circumſtances never could weaken the contrary belief, which implies the eventual generation of the fever on board of ſhips from tropical countries, and as it is contagious, we do not deny that an infected ſeaman might, of courſe, communicate it to his attendants. If a whole crew alſo or a part of it, came from a known infected place to another of very hot temperature, they ſurely may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. Theſe chances are acknowledged or granted; but, to ſuch chances we will not give up a matter of principles, of analogy, and an opinion, the arguments of which, in the conſtitution of the air, are even employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the opponent believers. Therefore, if the facts proving the importation to others, prove to me nothing elſe than the generation of the yellow fever on board of ſhips, it will not be improper to conclude, that with only ſuch arguments one ſide has nothing ſtronger than merely their opinion.</p>
