            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>are, too much as I have heard reported of lawyers uſing points of law, viz. To try to make the jury <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> it meant what they wanted it to mean, to anſwer their favorite purpoſes.

Agreeable to the forementioned ſimile, I obſerved that the LORD JESUS had declared his verdict how he ſhould fare with the nations of the earth, at the day of judgment, according as they had believed and obeyed the goſpel, or not. By a parable of a ſhepherd, having a large flock, conſiſting of ſheep and goats, dividing them apart,
<pb facs="unknown:034538_0003_0FFF23B0E7834F88"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſheep from the goats, Math.ch.xxv. The cloſe of CHRIST's verdict expreſsly ſays, the nations, viz. who had not fed and cloathed him, &amp;c. ſhould go away into everlaſting pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment ; but the righteous into life eternal. I aſked you what you underſtood the nations on the left hand could mean, if it was not the ſouls and bodies of the wicked, falſe profeſſors, hypocrites, and diſobeyers of the goſpel, riſen from the dead to the judgment, to receive their juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to the ſame purport.—You ſaid they meant mens' luſts and ſins; and added, you could make out by ſcripture, if I underſtood you, that our luſts and ſins were called men, women, and children. I was ſure I had never read any ſuch ſcriptures. Therefore concluded if it was made ſo to appear, it muſt be done by human and myſtical reaſonings, or caſting of figures, which tends to deceive the mind; I mean ſtrange comments upon obſcure texts of ſcripture.</p>
            <p>However your mind is bewildered. I expect I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce demonſtrative evidence to the unprejudiced, by a fair compariſon of expreſs ſcriptures, and undeniable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences drawn from expreſs ſcriptures, that you and all others are deceived, who believe and teſtify that Cain and all the old ſinners before the flood, Pharaoh and his magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, together with thoſe Iſaiah ſpeaks of, that ſhould be brought down to hell, alſo the ſtrong among the mighty, that ſhould ſpeak out of the midſt of hell, Ezek. ch. xxxii. Likewiſe the reprobate Phariſees, and Judas, a devil, as CHRIST declares he was, and all whoremongers, fornicators, covetous, liars, and abominable idolatous, who have died in their ſins and appeared to their exit, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the croſs of CHRIST; with their brethren, Gog and Magog. I ſay, that you, and all others who hold the aforementioned ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (ſo expreſsly condemned by GOD and all his inſpired witneſſes) are ſaved, you are deceived in a matter of great importance; and I cannot account for it, except it is bro't about by the ſpirit of ſorcery, which St. Paul mentions in Gal. chap. iii. if I underſtand him, he repreſents the falſe teachers as ſpiritual ſorcerors, and their doctrine, ſpiritual witchcraft. <hi>O fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth,</hi> &amp;c. As ſorcerors, by delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſes, make perſons believe they ſee that which they truly ſee not; ſo the ſpirit of error, by caſting a miſt

Sorcerors make uſe of dark and unintelligible words, and ſeem to be aſſiſted beyond their own ability, in their performances. So, erroneous ſpirits will generally quote the moſt dark and obſcure figures and texts of ſcripture in the Prophets, and the revelations, whoſe meaning is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, particularly to deſcribe, and ſeem to be ſtrangely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in giving a meaning to them, to anſwer their favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite purpoſes. Theſe things I have obſerved, to my aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, among the Shakers, and ſome deluded perſons in the vicinity of Hampſtead, ſome years paſt. The LORD <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lp all Chriſtians, who think they ſtand, to take heed leſt they fall.</p>
            <p>Having made this introduction, I proceed to conſider your anſwer of what is the meaning of the nations on the left hand, at the judgment-day; which you ſay are luſts and ſins, and not their ſouls or perſons. It looks to me, to talk of the exiſtence and puniſhment, pain and ſuffering of ſins, luſts, and evil principles in men, when ſeparated from thoſe who have tranſgreſſed the law of GOD; for ſin is the tranſgreſſion of law, and their perſons made happy, who have ſinned, is ſuch a perfect contradiction to expreſs ſcripture, to ſound reaſon, and ſo regupnant to common <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is difficult to conceive how any honeſt man can be ſatisfied with ſuch a meaning, or ever believe what himſelf advances, allowing him to have his ſenſes. How can we conceive that GOD or men could impriſon the crime of wilful murder, try it, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ng it, and at the ſame time let the perſon of the murderer be free from impriſonment, condemnation, and death? What would a notorious thief care, if he was proved ever ſo guilty of the greateſt theft, if the judge would only condemn the crime, but juſtify the perſon of the thief; and comfort him with the promiſe that he ſhould never feel a whip, nor hang in a halter, if he ſhould ſteal all the property of the country in which he lived? How would it ſound to reaſon or common ſenſe to hear the judge ſay, Curſed be your thieviſh luſt, for it is cruel; ſend it into everlaſting puniſhment: Curſed be your wicked actions, ſend them into everlaſting burnings. How can a mortal judge, or the judge of quick and dead, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh a crime ſeparate from the criminal? Have mere crimes
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034538_0005_0FFF23B3705AF3B8"/>got eyes to weep, or teeth to gnaſh with? For, among thoſe nations there is to be weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth, which is impoſſible for mere crimes to perform.</p>
            <p>Further, if you, by your comments on figures, can make out that ſins or luſts are called men, women, and children, as you imagine, I would aſk you if they are called virgins, or ſlothful ſervants, or if mere crimes can cry, LORD, LORD, open to us, or if they can do wonderful works in CHRIST's name? All theſe names and works were among the left hand nations, and if you cannot make out that luſts and ſins bear all the aforementioned names, and can perform ſaid wonderful works, ſeparate from the ſouls and bodies of rational perſons, your ideas are falſe and altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary; and appear a flat contradiction, both to the unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed teſtimony of the ſcriptures, and the nature and reaſon of things. For it is evident from the words that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared from the unfeigned lips of our LORD and judge, Mat. chap. xxv. that the ſlothful ſervants and fooliſh vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins were the ſouls and riſen bodies of hypocrites and falſe profeſſors, brought to judgment; which CHRIST, in the 5th chapter of John, calls the reſurrection of damnation.</p>
            <p>Further, conſider, Sir, another ſcriptural idea. St. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calls the day of judgment, a time of refreſhing to all that belong to the new covenant, Acts iii. 10. You hold, that all the perſons in the black catalogue, aforenamed, belong to the new covenant: St. Paul ſays, Heb. chap. viii. that ſuch as belong to the new covenant, their ſins and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities GOD will remember no more. And Peter ſpeaks of their ſins being blotted out, forecited Acts ch. iii. How is it poſſible their ſins can be remembered at the judgment, be publicly tried and condemned to everlaſting puniſhment, if all the human family belong to the right hand of CHRIST, as children of the new covenant? Can CHRIST and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſay, and unſay, about the ſame important point? One time declare their ſins ſhall not be remembered, but be blotted out, another time bring them into everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and condemn them to everlaſting puniſhment? Dear Sir, if you have any reaſon remaining in you, pauſe and ſee what contradictions and inconſiſtencies you have fell into in your mind, and behold how great is that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in you, which you call light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:034538_0006_0FFF23E3F99418D8"/>
Thus I have demonſtrated, both from the words of CHRIST, and his Apoſtles, and from the nature and reaſon of things, that the nations on the left hand of CHRIST, ſpoken of, Matt. chap. xxv. cannot mean luſts and ſins.— Some of your denomination, being ſenſible, I conceive, of the abſurdity of your ideas, ſay, that the nations on the left hand of CHRIST, mean devils.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge ſuch an interpretation doth not ſhock common ſenſe, ſo much as the aforementioned, becauſe dev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ils are capable of puniſhment, and ſins are not ſeparate from the ſinner; yet it flatly contradicts every threatning, expreſſed in the word of GOD, reſpecting the matter. For it is wicked men are threatened with puniſhment for their ſins, Mat. ch. xxv. not devils. CHRIST ſays the nations of the earth ſhall be divided, ſome on the right hand, and ſome on the left. Are the devils called the nations of the earth? no, it is a name not given them any where in the ſcriptures, they are the legion of hell. Are devils called to feed and cloath CHRIST's members? no, they are not under ſuch a law, neither are capable of ſo doing— But the aforenamed nations, on CHRIST's left hand, were ſent into everlaſting puniſhment, for not feeding and cloathing CHRIST, viz. in his members. Hence it is as ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident as words can make it, from CHRIST's own account, and the Apoſtles teſtimonies, the nations on the left hand, Mat. ch. xxv. conſiſts of the ſouls and riſen bodies of the families of Adam, and they muſt go into everlaſting pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, as ſure as the ſentence paſſed upon them, by the judge of quick and dead, is unalterable.</p>
            <p>If what I have written doth not convince you, will you believe, if I can produce the expreſs teſtimony of JESUS CHRIST; and the wiſe Solomon, and the learned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Paul's teſtimonies, that inſtead of ſins and luſts of wicked men, it is their ſouls muſt be puniſhed and loſt to all happineſs.

            <p>However, having a great deſire to convince you, and all who are led aſtray with you, or by your inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality, I will proceed to obſerve, further, if I am miſtaken, with the greater part of the Chriſtian world, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the true meaning of CHRIST'S verdict, pronounced in Mat. ch. xxv. if all Adam's family are to be finally ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not one of them is ſurely to die, as the ſerpent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to our mother Eve, we may ſurely expect the kind Redeemer, who is full of grace, and was ſent to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the truth, has ſome where in his laſt Teſtament, told us ſo from his expreſs word? For he ſays, <hi>The word which I have ſpoken ſhall judge him at the laſt day.</hi> Or if he has omitted it, we may juſtly expect ſome of his Apoſtles have declared it. Now, if there is not one ſentence in the New-Teſtament, by a fair compariſon of the whole, declares ſuch a doctrine, and on the contrary, if CHRIST, in many places, beſides the forecited Mat.ch.xxv. declares the fame truth concerning the final puniſhment of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if his Apoſtles likewiſe teſtify the ſame repeatedly, is it poſſible for a man, in his reaſon, who has a muſtard-ſeed grain of true faith, to embrace the abſurd and unſcriptural opinion, that there will not be one of Adam's family (who have rejected the atonement of CHRIST, diſbelieved the goſpel, and hated the croſs of CHRIST, even to their death) that will finally periſh?</p>
            <p>Beſide CHRIST'S verdict, Mat. ch. xxv. he ſays, ch. vii. <hi>Not every are that ſaith unto me, LORD, LORD, ſhall enter into
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034538_0008_0FFF23E5AB3D1780"/>the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Hence it is evident that ſome who cried LORD, LORD, will be ſhut out. Sins and luſts cannot cry LORD; therefore it muſt be the perſons of ſome of the children of Adam, ver. 22, <hi>Many will ſay to me, in that day,</hi> (viz.the judgment-day,) <hi>LORD, LORD, have we not prapheſied in thy name, &amp;c. caſt out devils, &amp;c. And then I will proſeſs, I never knew you, depart from me ye that work iniquity.</hi>—Dear Sir, lay your hand againſt your heart, and let conſcience ſpeak, can ſins and luſts propheſy in CHRIST'S name? or can devils caſt out devils? or, can ye that work iniquity, which are caſt out, be the works of iniquity? You muſt know the Engliſh grammar too well, not to ſee the diſtinction between thoſe that work iniquity, and the iniquity itſelf; or between the perſon, and the wicked works of the perſon. CHRIST further ſays, which muſt put it out of all diſpute, that, <hi>them which do iniquity, ſhall be caſt into a furnace of fire,</hi> and at the judgment-day, <hi>there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Mat. ch. xiii. Again, Mat. xii. 32. <hi>Whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</hi> And Mark ſays, <hi>He hath never forgiveneſs.</hi> Luke xvi. 22. <hi>The rich man alſo died and was buried: And in hell lift up bis eyes being in torment, &amp;c.</hi> It was not his ſins, which have no eyes, it was the perſon of the ſinner, lifting up his eyes and begging for a drop of water; but there was no favor could paſs over that great gulph of juſtice, that is pronounced by CHRIST'S verdict, Mat. ch. xxv. In hell, he that is filthy, and he that is unjuſt, muſt ſo remain, for the word of the LORD hath ſpoken it. Who, that have their ſenſes, can read thoſe texts I have quoted, with their connections, and yet poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuppoſe, that there will be no unbeliever, no refuſer of mercy, no rich worldling of the nations of the earth, that will be found on CHRIST'S left hand, and condemned to everlaſting puniſhment; when CHRIST expreſsly declares they ſhall, from his own ſacred lips, forecited Mat. ch. xxv. Further, to ſtrengthen the evidence of the deſtruction of the ſouls and bodies of thoſe who belong to the black cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of characters I have before named, which may be all ſummed up under the term, WICKED, I will quote ſome of the Apoſtles' teſtimonies, which will ſhew how they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it will fare with the aforenamed characters, at the judgment-day. 2 Cor. ch. ii. <hi>For we are unto GOD a ſweet

Further, 2 Theſſ. ii. 12. <hi>That they all night be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi> I will ſum up the Apoſtle James' witneſs in his own words, ch. ii. ver. 13. <hi>For he ſhall have judgment without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy:</hi> which muſt mean he ſhall be puniſhed eternally. St. Peter witneſſeth, as plain as words can expreſs, the matter in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; for he ſays, 2 Epiſ. ch. iii. <hi>The heavens and the earth are reſerved unto fire againſt the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men.</hi> Not ungodly luſts and ſins, but men. And again, he expreſsly teſtifieth, that GOD has reſerved the wicked to the day of judgment. For what? To be puniſhed. And, as though he foreſaw the error of the Univerſaliſts, and meant to prevent every evaſion, miſtake, and quibble that could be invented, he ſays, <hi>They ſhall utterly periſh in their own corruption, &amp;c.</hi> St. Jude teſtifieth of ſome falſe teachers, to whom is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The loving Apoſtle John, who ſpake more of the love of GOD, in proportion to the length of his Epiſtles, than any Apoſtle, is ſo far from thinking it inconſiſtent with the love of GOD, to ſpeak of the future and everlaſting puniſhment of the wicked, he teſtifieth reſpecting it more abundantly than any other Apoſtle. In his firſt epiſtle he ſays, <hi>All unrighteouſneſs is ſin,</hi> ch. v. and, <hi>There is a ſin unto death;</hi> aocordingly he would not give leave to pray for the pardon of it, as I conceive; therefore doubtleſs he meant the unpardonable ſin, that hath never forgiveneſs.</p>

Job and his friends, by the beſt account I can get, lived in the days of Moſes, or before: And by them we may learn what was the doctrine reſpecting the puniſhment of the wicked; and what would become of the hypocrite's hope, as it was taught and received by the people of GOD in their day. They ſay, <hi>What is the hope of the hypocrite, though he
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034538_0011_0FFF23BAC42A8740"/>hath gained, when GOD taketh away his ſoul; GOD ſhall caſt upon him and not ſpare. Yea, he ſhall periſh forever.</hi> Joh iv. 9. <hi>By the blaſt of GOD they periſh,</hi> ch. viii. <hi>ſo are the paths of all that forget GOD, and the hypocrite's hope ſhall periſh.</hi>— You ſay <hi>luſts,</hi> and <hi>ſins,</hi> they ſay <hi>hope.</hi> They ſay the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a wicked man from GOD, and the heritage appointed unto him by GOD, is, <hi>He ſhall periſh forever, &amp;c.</hi> The inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed king of Iſrael, David, GOD'S anointed, in his firſt Pſalm, ſpeaks expreſsly of the judgment, and pronounces the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, bleſſed; and the ungodly, curſed. He compares the ungodly to chaff, and ſays, <hi>Therefore they ſhall not ſtand in the judgment, nor ſinners in the congregation of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly ſhall periſh.</hi> Again, he ſays, <hi>Upon the wicked GOD ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt, this ſhall be the portion of their cup.</hi> He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, concerning the ungodly, <hi>Thou caſtedſt them down to deſtruction:</hi> which cannot be true, if they are happy. Again he ſays, Pſalm lxxiii. ſpeaking of the porſperity of the ungodly, <hi>I could not account for it, until I went</hi> (ſays he) <hi>into the ſanctuary of GOD, then underſtood I their end:</hi> (which was) <hi>thou caſtedſt them down to deſtruction.</hi> The end ſpoken of with the aforementioned horrible tempeſt of GOD'S fiery indignation, muſt mean, in the future world; for if the wicked were happy at death, or judgment, the firſt Pſalm could not be true and this paſſage would be a perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. And how could there be any other end to this deſtruction, when itſelf is declared to be their end. St. Paul, ſpeaking of the righteous, ſays, <hi>You have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life:</hi> and as the end of the righteous is everlaſting life—the end of the wicked is everlaſting deſtruction, according to the teſtimony of the Pſalmiſt and St. Paul. Solomon in the firſt chapter of his Proverbs, teſtifies, that ſuch as ſet at nought GOD's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, he will laugh at their calamity, &amp;c. when their deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cometh as a whirlwind, although they may call in their anguiſh, and ſeek GOD in their diſtreſs, he will not anſwer, neither ſhall they find him; how then can they be happy? Solomon further ſays, <hi>When a wicked man dieth his expectation ſhall periſh, and the hope of the unjuſt man periſheth.</hi> What words could more fully aſſert that the wicked after doeth ſhall be deprived of all good, which is the object of hope. Time would fail, and it would fill a volume, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034538_0012_0FFF23E802EBD550"/>of a ſhort Epiſtle, to take notice of all the witneſſes in the Old-Teſtament, reſpecting the final deſtruction of the wicked. I will therefore ſum them up from Iſaiah's time, to Malachi, who ſpeaks of a day that ſhall burn as an oven, &amp;c. in the words of Iſaiah, iii. 10, 11. <hi>Say ye to the righteous, that it ſhall be well with him, for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings. Wo unto the wicked! it ſhall be ill with him; for the reward of his hands ſhall be given <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And whereas the labours of love, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the righteous, has the promiſe of endleſs life and happineſs, can the threatnings of the contrary, to the wicked, be any thing but directly the oppoſite, viz. endleſs miſery and puniſhment? Let conſcience ſtand judge. If the united teſtimonies of the Old-Teſtament witneſſes may be ſummed up in the forecited text, the Univerſaliſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, I conceive, to be a full contradiction to them all; for the Univerſaliſts ſay, it ſhall be finally well with the ſouls or perſons of the wicked as well as the righteous.— How ſhall we know who bears the true witneſs? Iſaiah in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us how we may know, in ſuch a ſtrait, in all matters of importance. In the eighth chapter of his propheſy, he warns every ſincere, enquiring ſoul, inſtead of ſeeking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that have familiar ſpirits, and unto wizards that peep and that mutter, &amp;c. which I conceive to be the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual ſorcery mentioned by St. Paul; for erroneous ſpirits peep into certain dark paſſages of ſcripture, and obſcure figures, and ſay they find wonderful new light in them, and ſeem to make their ideas look, for a time, as much like truth as the magicians of Egypt, by their ſorcery, made their rods appear ſerpents like unto the rod of Mofes. But as the rod of Moſes ſwallowed up their rods, in the end, ſo all erroneous doctrines, when tried by the plain, expreſs law and teſtimony, are ſwallowed up: Eſpecially the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Univerſal Salvation, I conceive, contradicts every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs account of the day of judgment, ſpoken of by Daniel, by CHRIST and his Apoſtles, and thereby their beautiful arguments, and ſeeming reaſons, get ſwallowed all up.— Therefore Iſaiah directs us, ch. viii. ver. 20. to regard the law and the teſtimony, and ſays, <hi>If they</hi> (viz. the promulgat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of ſtrange doctrines,) <hi>ſpeak not according to this word, it
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034538_0013_0FFF23BD9A3317A0"/>is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> The Prophet Daniel teſtifies, ch. xii. ver. 2. <hi>And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who can read what I have written reſpecting the final puniſhment of the black catalogue of ſinners, beforenamed, and not be fully convinced that the wicked, who die in their ſins will be everlaſtingly puniſhed? If we had nothing but CHRIST'S own verdict to determine us reſpecting the matter, it is compleatly ſufficient. But I have produced the moſt noted witneſſes in the Old-Teſtament, with the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic, inſpired jury, declaring their verdict againſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named criminals, and they agree with and corroborate the verdict of the Supreme judge, who is King of kings, and Lord of lords. Their united declarations aſſure us that the wicked, who die in their ſins, will be puniſhed with an evenlaſting puniſhment in a future ſtate. I conceive the holy ſcriptures give us as full aſſurance of it, as we have that CHRIST JESUS is the Son of GOD, the Saviour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſinners. Verily, I do not conceive how we can doubt the teſtimonies I have produced reſpecting the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant verdict without calling the whole inſpired volume in queſtion. No witneſs recorded in the Bible has ſaid ſo much of the future puniſhment of the wicked as CHRIST himſelf; and the reaſon is plain, becauſe no one knew ſo much about it. We may ſurely expect our bleſſed Saviour and his inſpired witneſſes, when giving in their final verdict reſpecting of a matter that ſo nearly concerns all men of every capacity, has choſen words that are moſt plain and caſy to be underftood. Whoever has the daring confidence to aſſert the contrary, muſt anſwer for it at his peril.</p>
            <p>I never heard of any ſect in the chriſtian world, (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Univerſaliſts) that pretended to put any other meaning to the words, <hi>nations of the earth,</hi> than what the words plainly expreſs. And, I conceive, if neceſſity did not oblige them, being ſenſible that all their comments on other texts of ſcripture, with all the obſcure figures and myſterious metaphors that they preſs into their ſervice, would be totally confounded, even by that one verdict giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by CHRIST, Mat. ch. xxv. they never would have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch an unſcriptural meaning, and ſo inconſiſtent to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon itſelf, or ever had the confidence to ſay, that while they
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034538_0014_0FFF23EC2B15B190"/>allow the word, nations, on the right hand, means the ſouls and riſen bodies of men, &amp;c. the ſame word, nations, on the left hand, means ſins and luſts, or devils. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it might be ſaid, with as much ſenſe and propriety, that the word, nations, on the left hand of CHRIST, means the unelean ſpirits, like frogs, ſpoken of Rev. xvi. that came out of the mouth of the dragon, beaſt, and falſe prophet, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If the evidence which appears on the very face of theſe texts, I have produced, is to be confronted with, and ſet aſide by other texts, which the Univerſalifts muſt do or give up the point; it is evident they ought to be more in number—their teſtimony more poſitive and expreſs—or their meaning more conſpicuous, and leſs liable to miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; which I have the confidence to ſay cannot be done, without procuring another Bible.</p>
            <p>Origen, a learned teacher in the ſchool of Alexandria, according to the beſt account lean get from authentic hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was the firſt promulgator of the doctrine of Univerſal Salvation, ever heard of in the chriſtian world; which was about the middle of the third century: And to evade the evidence of CHRIST'S expreſs words, and the teſtimonies of his inſpired witneſſes againſt his doctrine, he maintained the neceſſity of rejecting the literal ſenſe of all ſcriptures, and ſo reduced, by his expoſitions, the whole bible into an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory, to ſupport his principle. A crafty ſcheme indeed, which would anſwer better in that ignorant age, than in our day. But, I conceive, he was a man of a diſtempered brain. For he held that all the fathers of the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ages were kept in hell till the death of CHRIST, when he went down into their priſon, preached the goſpel to them, and carried them with him to heaven. He held the ſtate between death and the reſurection, was a ſtate of ſleep in one common receptacle, called <hi>hades,</hi> by the Greeks; where the righteous and the wicked are repoſed together promiſcuouſly. Further, he held that the fire of the future world would puriſy the damned; ſo that after a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuffering of its ſeverity; in which, however, none could be held longer than 1000 years, all the damned ſpinits both of men and devils ſhall be finally delivered from their woes.</p>
            <p>He ſtrangely balanced his new-ſangled goſpel, by add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the higheſt favorite around the throne of GOD was ſtill left liable to fall from all his bliſs; and ſo to be remand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034538_0015_0FFF23BF70981BF8"/>back to a new ſtate of trial in an earthly body. And thus the whole celeſtial choir of men and angels would continue filling up an eternity to come in alternate falls, trials, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and reſtorations, one after another.</p>
            <p>I am informed that a number of great men, by Origen's influence, were entangled for awhile with ſome of his ideas; but in proceſs of time, they began to examine his doctrines by the law and teſtimony; and Jerome, (who ſome Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaliſts would ſignify was of their opinion,) was the very man that detected and publicly expoſed the errors of that ſcheme, and had them judicially condemned by the unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imous ſentence of the Synod of Alexandria, in the year 399. The diſciples of Origen were conſequently baniſhed from Egypt and Paleſtine, as enemies to religion, and a nuiſance to civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>Muſt it not look ſtrange, even to yourſelf, dear Sir, and thoſe brethren entangled with you, to think that 250 years ſhould roll round, after the doctrine of CHRIST was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a periſhing world, declaring that <hi>he that believeth ſhall he ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall he damned;</hi> and not one martyr, nor miniſter of JESUS ſhould find out that all the New-Teſtament, with its laws and penalties, as well as the Old-Teſtament, was a mere allegory: And although the judge of all ſays, that <hi>all that are in their graves ſhall come forth, they that have done good to the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the reſurrection of damnation:</hi> that it is not ſo, it is no more than a ſigure of ſpeech. I conceive the Univerſaliſts to this day are obliged to make the ſame miſerable ſhift, having nothing better to ſupport them. If appears to me, if Chriſtians who embrace ſuch unſcriptural ideas, are not in a religious delirium, or bewildered with the ſpirit of ſorcery, theſe cannot be ſuch a thing.</p>
            <p>The learned Dr. Chauncey being ſenſible, I conccive, of the fallacy and abſurdity of ſuppoſing the nations on CHRIST'S left hand, Mat. ch. xxv. mean either ſins, luſts, or devils, acknowledges, (if I underſtand him,) they mean what CHRIST ſays, viz. fooliſh virgins, hypocrites, ſlothful servants, workers of iniquity, &amp;c. He grants ſuch ſhall surſer the ſecond death. But where as he had formed a ſcheme finally to ſave the whole family of Adam, he was aware that it would not do to let the ark of the covenant, nor the teſtimony ſtand where the holy ſcriptures have put
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034538_0016_0FFF23EE0DEB1470"/>them, according to our Engliſh tranſlation: And as he could not procure any of the ſons of Levi to carry it on their ſhoulders, as was the divine order under the oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Moſes; neither any ſuitable milch-kine among the Philiſtines to remove it where he would have it. Neceſſity being conſidered above law, and his need being exceeding great to have the ark removed, or his whole ſcheme would be loſt forever; he has yoked up his grammatical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Greek and the doctrine of purgatory to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and with this novel team and his ſkill in driving it, it appears to me he has trailed it, having no new cart to put it in, about on the line between the land of Iſrael and the border of the Philiſtines, where the tribes of Iſrael have no divine warrant to aſſemble for divine worſhip. But the worſhippers of Dagon may draw near, the ark being partly ſet within their line, if they can but procure a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of golden emerods and golden mice to make atonement to the GOD of Iſrael, 1 Sam.ch.vi. they may all be deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, peradventure, from all their plagues, if they have been in hell ages of ages ſuffering the ſecond death, and be brought finally to give glory to the GOD of Iſrael.— Notwithſtanding the Doctor's new meaning put to ſome words, I expect the tranſlators of our Engliſh bible have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued ſaid words truly: and had the Doctor underſtood CHRIST'S ſaying, in John ch. vii. <hi>I go unto him that ſent me. Ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall not find me: and where I am thither ye cannot come,</hi> he would have bluſhed and dropped his pen, and not have undertook by his new meaning, put to ſome Greek words, to deliver the damned out of hell, and ſend them where CHRIST is, contrary to CHRIST'S expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</p>
            <p>But to abridge the anſwer to the new meaning of the Engliſh words, <hi>eternal, everlaſting, forever, forever and ever,</hi> and <hi>never, &amp;c.</hi> which the ſaid Chauncey has put upon them, I will ſum it up as follows: The Greek word which is uſed ſix times to expreſs the duration of the puniſhment of the wicked, and tranſlated eternal and everlaſting (ſays a learned divine) is to be found in above ſeventy places in the New-Teſtament: and it every where is evidently uſed to expreſs an endleſs duration, unleſs thoſe ſix places which ſpeak of the duration of future puniſhment, be excepted. And is not this ſufficient to aſcertain the meaning of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034538_0017_0FFF23C3D9597C98"/>word, if we had no other way to determine what it is deſigned to expreſs? This word is <hi>Aionios,</hi> and is derived from <hi>Aion;</hi> which is uſed above an hundred times in the New-Teſtament, and does not mean any certain, definite, but an indeterminate duration, unleſs it be limited by the words or ſubject, with which it is connected. And when the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>eis,</hi> is put before it, whether it be uſed in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular or plural number, it always ſignifies an endleſs du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and is generally tranſlated <hi>forever,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>never</hi>; of which there are near forty inſtances, only two of which reſpect, the duration of future puniſhment, viz. 2 Pet. ii. 17. Jude ver. 13. and no reaſon can be given why it ſhould not be underſtood here, as it muſt be in other places, where it is uſed. When the words are doubled, they are more emphatical, and are tranſlated <hi>forever and ever.</hi> There are twenty-two inſtances of this, nineteen of which expreſs a duration which is certainly endleſs. In the remaining three, the duration of future puniſhment is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed agreeably to what has been obſerved. From this ſtate of the caſe, is it not eaſy to determine whether theſe words, which in all other inſtances are uſed to expreſs a duration which is endleſs, mean only temporary, when they are uſed with a deſign to let us know what is the duration of future puniſhment? This expreſſion, <hi>forever and ever,</hi> is ſound twenty-two times in the original, in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is uſed eight times in the Epiſtles of St. Paul and Peter, where they aſcribe glory, honor, praiſe, and dominion to GOD, <hi>forever and ever.</hi> It is found fourteen times in the book of Revelations, and a number of them is uſed to mark GOD'S eternity: and the word is uſed three times in the ſame book, by the ſame writer, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the duration of future puniſhment. Is it poſſible to miſtake the meaning, and think that in theſe three inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only, theſe words mean a finite duration? Such a ſhift is offering violence to the ſcripture.</p>
            <p>As ſure as the ſcriptures referred to, mean in the original, what has been obſerved, Dr. Chauncey's knowledge of the Greek cannot move the ark; but his ſcheme is fallen, as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon did of old time, upon its ſtumps. Likewiſe, his ideas of damned ſouls being delivered from the ſecond death and purged by what they ſuffer, and go finally to heaven, after ages of ages, I think they are altogether unſcriptural and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034538_0018_0FFF23EFF28D2D68"/>imaginary. There is no more expreſs ſcripture to ſuppors his opinion, than that there is a place of purgation in the moon to qualify the ungodly for the joys of heaven. The words of father Abraham, as they are ſet forth by him who is to be judge at the laſt day, will confound all his arguments for the reſtoration of the danmed, Luke xvi. 26. <hi>And beſides all this, between us</hi> (the righteous) <hi>and you</hi> (the wicked) <hi>there is a great gulf fixed: ſo that they which would paſs from bence to you, cannot; neither can they paſs to us, that would come from thence.</hi> This text informs us fully, that there can be no intercourſe between glorified ſaints and damned ſinners; but the ſtate of ſouls, both in heaven and hell is unalterably fixed, as the oath of GOD is unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>I have ſworn, ſaith the LORD, that they ſhall not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my reſt</hi>: and damned ſinners will never get out of the ſecond death through ſuch a gulf.—Thus it is evident from expreſs ſcripture, the Doctor nor any of his opinion, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remove the ark nor the teſtimoay from where the LORD has fixed it in its place.</p>
            <p>Thus I have finiſhed my examination of the teſtimony of CHRIST and his inſpired witneſſes reſpecting how the fooliſh virgins, ſlothful ſervants, hypocrites, and all unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers who die in their ſins, will be condemned and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed at the great day of judgment. I have mentioned in the foregoing Epiſtle ſomething concerning the doctrines of devils. And as it is of great importance for us to know the difference between the ſpirit of truth, and the ſpirit of error, I ſhall obſerve St. Paul informs us, in 2 Cor. ch. xi. of deceitful workers, and ſays, <hi>No marvel; for ſatan himſelf is transformed into an angel of light.</hi> Therefore it is no great thing if his miniſters alſo be transformed as the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of righteouſneſs; whoſe end ſhall be according to their works; that is, I conceive, working deceitfully, preaching for their maſter ſatan; and perhaps they may be ſelf-deceived, thinking they are miniſters of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs: ſuch may appear among all denominations; and that we may know how to diſtinguiſh them apart, St. Paul informs us in his Epiſtle to the Hebrews, ch. xiii. <hi>Remember them which have the rule over you,</hi> (viz. the Apoſtles) <hi>who have ſpoken unto you the word of GOD, &amp;c.</hi> and adds, <hi>Be not carried about with divers and ſtrange doctrines, &amp;c.</hi> Hence it is evident every doctrine which is divers and contrary
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034538_0019_0FFF23C5F8E67B88"/>to the expreſs doctrine of CHRIST and his inſpired witneſſes, is a ſtrange doctrine; which I underſtand, St. Paul means by the doctrines of devils, that in the latter times, ſome, by departing from the faith and giving heed to ſeducing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, would fall into, 1 Tim. ch. iv. We find the ſpirit of error is moveable, it is hard to trace it; for one ſays this doctrine is right, another ſays a contrary doctrine is right, and all cloaked under a pretence that the ſcriptures mean as they ſay. We muſt obſerve the devil was to go upon his belly, after he told the lie to our mother Eve, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſurely die;</hi> that is, he was curſed to be a creeper, never more to dare appear in his own name, and ſay I am a devil; but always be obliged to creep under the names of great-light, wonderful-truth, and real-friendſhip to the ſons of men, or ſome other borrowed name or friendly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Therefore, to give as plain and ſhort a ſpecimen, or ſample of the doctrines of devils as I can, I will ſay.</p>
            <p>Glad tidings, glad tidings, rejoice all ye ſons of Belial, ſhout aloud ye workers of iniquity, join all ye that contemn experimental, heart religion, and real piety, who are puff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with pride and drowned in wantonneſs, with all that hate the daily croſs of CHRIST; like wiſe all the children of diſobedience of every character, even all that have blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and have done deſpite to the ſpirit of grace, I have glad tidings to proclaim to you all. You ſhall not ſurely die, that is, finally. This is ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. You may read it aſſerted in Gen. iii. 4. and if you doubt it becauſe a fallen angel ſaid it, you may obſerve he did not loſe his light and knowledge of things, although he left his beginning. It is evident from expreſs ſcripture, he ſeveral times ſpake the truth, and why not in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited text: but if you are not ſatisfied, I can produce you abundant proof from the ſayings of CHRIST and his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and you may judge whether it does not plainly declare the ſame ſenſe with the forecited text. CHRIST ſays, he did not come into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved. Can you think he will fail of anſwering the end he came for!—Again, it is written, he taſted death for every man, and is a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſins of the whole world. Do not theſe texts ſully prove what was declared to our mother Eve, in the ſorecited texs, Gen. iii. 4.? Are they not ſull to the point
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034538_0020_0FFF23F3E5C261C0"/>as I have quoted them? Judge for yourſelves. Be not frighted by a parced of ſniveling prieſts, trying to ſcare you to death by fire and brimſtone, that that eternal hell which has been ſo often a terror to you, and ſometimes reſtrained you in your wild career, and often embittered your golden cup of pleaſure, is now no more. We have got a diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery in this age of reaſon, of true ſcripture light, and find that hell and damnation is to take place only on your ſins and luſts. Our antient and modern divines have made a miſtake, and miſapplied it as Job's friends in another caſe did concerning him. Cheer up ye ſinners of every charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, your precious ſouls and riſen bocties are all to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritied in heaven forever, after the day of judgment; for CHRIST has been lifted up upon the croſs, has bore the curſe and put an end to ſin, and declared with his own bleſſed lips, he will draw all men unto him. This damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hell and everlaſting puniſhment that has been ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your ear-drums from every pulpit for ages paſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all denominations of Chriſtians, excepting us the univerſal friends, of all men, we have found to be mere prieſt-craft, or at leaſt, a great miſtake among the beſt of them. The LORD JESUS never intends finally to execute any threatnings contained in the New-Teſtament, againſt any perſon or perſons whomſoever. For it is written, <hi>He taſted death for every man:</hi> And if you want all I have ſaid proved, read 1 Tim. ii. 4. <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Now judge, all ye jovial ſinners, of every character beſoronamed, if I have not proved to a demonſtration, that what was told our mother Eve in the garden, forecited Gen. iii. 4. is exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the declarations of CHRIST and his holy Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>In this ſample of the doctrines of devils, you may ſee what St. Paul calls deceitful working, 2 Cor. ch. xi. or uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubtilty, as he ſays the ſerpent beguiled Eve, ver. 3. I have took as much of a ſentence of ſcripture as ſerved my purpoſe, deſignedly, leaving out that part which would have made a diſtinction; and by a fair compariſon of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſcriptures, which ſpeak particularly reſpecting the final deſtruction of the characters beforenamed, would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together changed the ſenſe I have put upon them. Thus by handling the word of GOD deceitfully, in the ſeveral texts I have quoted, I have ſeemed to prove that the dev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034538_0021_0FFF23CAD938E8C0"/>who is recorded a liar from the beginning, John ch. viii. and the holy Son of GOD, who is the way, the truth, and the life, with his holy Apoſtles, have unitedly bore one and the ſame reſtimony, reſpecting mens' final end. Whereas it is evident from a fair compariſon of expreſs ſcriptures, as I have already manifeſted, in examining the united verdict of the inſpired witneſſes of both Teſtaments, there is no more concord between their teſtimonies reſpecting the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the declaration of the devil, than there is between heaven and hell.</p>
            <p>I have not ſo much as mentioned any neceſſity of believing in JESUS, in order to be juſtified; nor any need of repenting of ſin, or obeying the goſpel that our ſins may be blotted out, nor any need of forſaking all our carnal delights, taking up our daily croſs, and following the LORD JESUS in keeping his commandments; this would have ſpoiled my joyful ſound, in the ſample, and overthrown all the glad tidings I proclaimed, in the ſenſe I propoſed them. Nevertheleſs, it is a truth too ſerious and important for me to forget, and I pray GOD that all Chriſtians may ever remember it. The LORD JESUS has ſaid, without faith, repentance, and taking up the daily croſs, aforementioned, we cannot be his diſciples: And what mortal dare contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the judge of the quick and the dead, as it were, to his very face? I think none but the miniſters of ſatan, who are led blindfold at his nod, would dare creep under the ſweet name of glad tidings, and leave out the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned truths. For every experimental Chriſtian muſt know, he can no more enjoy fellowſaip with the Father, with the LORD JESUS, and with the living brethren; nor have his calling and perſonal election made ſure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without poſſeſſing and practiſing the aforementiomed truths; than a ſinner can truly ſee the kingdom of GOD, in its ſpiritual beauty, without being born again, or from above. The one cannot, is as certain as the other, for the mouth of the ſame LORD hath ſpoken it.</p>
            <p>I have put a falſe ſenſe upon every text I have quoted in the ſample, and the conſequences are falſe accordingly; ſo that the whole ſumple is one continued compound of lies in the ſenſe I have proclaimed it to the aſorenamed characters. For, according to the ſenſe I have put upon ſeveral texts, I have denied the execution of any thread
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034538_0022_0FFF23F59CF9FFD0"/>nings, declared in the New-Teſtament, againſt any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſinner whatſoever, finally; for I have not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that have committed the unpardonable ſin, which CHRIST has particularly excepted, three times, in his laſt will; and declares it never ſhall have forgiveneſs. Yet I have ſeemed to prove it, to an inattentive mind, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe who would be glad to have it ſo.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you my ideas how the devil appears like an angel of light, to ſinners who are under the power of a fleſhly mind, and how his miniſters appear like miniſters of rightcouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Sir, if you, who in years paſt could, as it were, have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me your eyes, will not now count me your enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I tell you the truth, I will yet ſpeak, and further ſay, that I conceive the ſample, forecited, is what I can make appear by ſeveral publications of the Univerſaliſts and their catechiſe, to be the very doctrine they proclaim for the true Apoſtolic goſpel; as to the general ſenſe of it: and they have put the ſame general ſenſe upon the texts I have quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the forenamed ſample, if I underſtand their writings. Perhaps you will ſay they do not proclaim their goſpel in the bold, plain manner that I have. I grant it. But the only difference, I think, is this, viz. creeping on the belly, and leaving that part of revealed truth, or perverting of it, that does not ſinit their favorite purpoſe, and making, as it were, any thing, and every thing, of texts, where the letter of thern ſeems to ſound ſuitable to their minds, frequently ſeparating them from their connexions. Whereas, in the forenamed ſample, I have ſet the doctrines upright upon their proper foundation, as I conceive, viz. the lie ſpoken of, forecited, Gen. iii. 4. I have expoſed the belly of the doctrines, inſtcad of being hid in the duſt, or under leaves, graſs, or buſhes. And I honeſtly ſay, as in the fear of GOD, I ſee no other real difference between the doctrines contained in the ſample, and the principles of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaliſt, but my want of ability to communicate the matter in ſuch a maſterly manner as ſome univerſaliſt may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do. Yet, let it be obſerved, I do not ſay any uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaliſt perverts the aforecited texts, or any other deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adly, as I have done in the ſample.</p>
            <p>I expect, that you, Sir, and many others, think you are doing GOD ſervice, while you are preaching and doing
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034538_0023_0FFF23CC63AC8D98"/>many things, as I conceive, contrary to the name, author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and expreſs verdict of JESUS CHRIST and his inſpired witneſſes, reſpecting the day of judgment, and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of becoming holy here in time, <hi>without which,</hi> GOD's word teſtifies, <hi>no man ſhall fee the LORD.</hi> Likewiſe, your denying that the penalty of the law of CHRIST is finally executed upon any ſoul of man, inſtead of every ſoul of man that doth not obey the truth, but doeth evil, as the apoſtle teſtifies.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, Sir, there is a query ariſes in your mind, that if I have perverted the true ſenſe of a number of texts, to make out my proclamation in the forementioned ſample, I ought to give the ſcriptural, conſiſtent ſenſe of them.— I will endeavour to do it—according to my ability.</p>
            <p>It is evident from the ſcriptural account given us, that the bar which was in the way of the ſalvation of any one of mankind, was the broken law of GOD; in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to have ſaved Abel only, the law muſt have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly fulfilled, juſtice ſatisfied, the Deity atoned, and every divine perfection harmonized: ſo that peace and good will might take place upon Abel, conſiſtent with GOD's higheſt glory. In point of merit, therefore, CHRIST has fulfilled the law, and anſwered every demand GOD the Father could call for, by virtue of it. Accordingly, the Father has committed all power in heaven and upon earth into his hands, as Mediator, to kill or make alive, to wound or heal at his pleaſure. He has in this reſpect ſaved all the family of Adam from the penalty of the law falling upon them, immediately; ſo that if a ſinner ſhould live an hundred years, and then die accurſed, the long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from the grave and hell, would be owing to the redemption of CHRIST, with all the mercies, more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than the hairs of his head, that he had received in his life time.</p>
            <p>There muſt have been as much done to harmonize the divine perfections in ſaving Abel, as to ſave all Adam's family. Had it not been for the ample atonement made by CHRIST, the ſins of men had barred the way of their ſalvation, and mercy could not have been extended to them. CHRIST, in making atonement for the tranſgreſſion of the law, has received power, as Mediator, over all fleſh, yea, all power in heaven and in earth is given unto him.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034538_0024_0FFF23F7287C3260"/>In this ſenſe, which is a ſcriptural and proper ſenſe, <hi>He has taſted death for every man, and is the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> This ſenſe opens an eaſy, plain, and important meaning to the paſſages aforenamed in the ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to all other texts of like import in the new-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In this ſenſe, he bought them which <hi>bring in damnable hereſics, even denying the LORD that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction,</hi> 2 Pet. ii. I. In this ſenſe, the reprobate Jews, after all things were ready, were invited, there being ſufficient proviſion, and to ſpare, in point of righteouſneſs and merit, the aforenamed bar being removed, and nothing hindered but the bar of their unbelieving hearts and proud wills, deſpiſing and making light of the heavenly invitation, which was the cauſe of their never being admitted to taſte of the ſupper. In this ſenſe, <hi>he gave himſelf a ranſom for all, he died for all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will draw this conſequence, as many others do who are not of your principle, viz. If CHRIST died for all men, then all will be ſaved, or elſe he died and ſhed his blood partly in vain. I anſwer that it does not follow, but is an unſcriptural and imaginary conſequence. The immediate fruit and effect of CHRIST'S death, is not the actual diſcharge of any perſon from guilt, but as CHRIST himſelf has aſſured us, that <hi>whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> John iii. 16. Our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is conſidered in ſcripture in a two-fold view, viz. as it is wrought by CHRIST'S merits, and as it is applied by the ſpirit to the believer through the word. In the ſirſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a foundation is laid for our deliverance; in the laſt, we experience, through faith, actual and perſonal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. It is as true as the bible, that many are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by price, as before obſerved, who are not redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by power, I humbly conceive. David ſpeaks of ſuch as had experienced the power in Pſal. cvii. Let the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed of the LORD ſay ſo, <hi>whom he hath redeemed out of the hand of the enemy. Thoſe are the redeemed who ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gladneſs and joy, and from whom ſorrow and mourning ſhall flee away,</hi> Iſa. li. 11. They who are bought by price in the ſenſe before mentioned, but not by power, <hi>who repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated themſelves by denying their LORD,</hi> are ſpoken of foreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 2 Pet. ii. It would fill a ſmall volume to quote all the texts that teſtify the fact and makes the diſtinction I
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034538_0025_0FFF23CDEFA60B38"/>have obſerved. In 1 Tim. iv. 10. St. Paul makes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction I have been obſerving, as plain as words can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it. For he ſays, <hi>GOD is the Saviour of all men, ſpecially of thoſe that believe.</hi> It is only the blood of CHRIST, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the ſpirit, which effects the perſonal <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> Col i. 14. <hi>purges the conſcience of the believer from dead works,</hi> Heb. ix. 14. If you ſtill object, that if CHRIST has ſatisfied law and juſtice, they can have no claim on the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This objection only befits ſuch as hold eternal juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; notwithſtanding it is made the reſort of numbers of different deſcriptions. But if divine juſtice has no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand againſt ſinners for whom CHRIST has taſted death, as before deſcribed, then ſuch were never perſonally chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, nor under the curſe; neither can there be any perſonal deliverance from ruin, to which they were never perſonally expoſed. If reaſoning according to the objection be juſt, the teſtimonies of ſcripture, and ſpiritual illumination are mere deceptions of the ſenſes, as philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay of colours. But to anſwer the objection. If a creditor ſhould exact a juſt debt of a number of inſolvent debtors, and they were both unwilling and unable to pay, and muſt immediately ſuffer the rigor of the law. Provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſurety anſwered all demands to the honor of the law, and took the inſolvent debtors into his hands, are not the debtors, according to all law and equity, in the power of the ſurety? and to be dealt with by him according to law, or mercifully to have his or their debts remitted, in ſuch a way as the ſurety ſhall propoſe? How repugnant to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and common ſenſe would it appear to hear the debtors ſay, they were clear of all their debts; for a ſurety had paid them: although they had not paid ſaid ſurety a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor had thanked him, nor received any diſcharge from him. Thus, I conceive, <hi>JESUS the ſurety of the new covenant,</hi> Heb. vii. <hi>comes to ſulfill his Father's will,</hi> Heb. x. pays the debt of duty and ſufferings which man could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pay, and thus <hi>taſted death for every man</hi>; and thus buys not only Jews, but the heathens alſo, with the inhabitants of the uttermoſt parts of the earth. GOD the Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizes his right—all power reſpecting the family of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam devolves upon him—<hi>he is anointed as mediator with the oil of gladneſs above his ſellows,</hi> Pſal. xlv. The 2d Pſalm deſcribes this ſubject very clearly. The Father ſays, <hi>aſk
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034538_0026_0FFF23F8E0CA5920"/>of me</hi> (and not a deſtined number of individuals only) <hi>but I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion</hi>; but thoſe, who refuſe his rule and government, <hi>he will break with a rod of iron, and daſh in pieces like a potter's veſſel,</hi> ver. 8 and 9.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed a ſcriptural ſenſe to all thoſe texts aſorementioned, reſpecting CHRIST'S dying for all, and being a Saviour of all men, &amp;c. This plain account of the end, and immediate effect of our <hi>Saviour's ſufferings, obedience and death, for which he was crowned with reſurrection, glory and honor,</hi> Heb. ii. 9. furniſhes a full anſwer reſpecting CHRIST'S being <hi>liſted up and drawing all men unto him,</hi> John xii. 32.— <hi>for he ſpake it concerning the manner of his death.</hi> Occaſion was given by being lifted up upon the croſs unto death, to give teſtimony unto all men of his power to raiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the dead; and that he will by the ſame power raiſe the whole family of Adam from the dead, Acts xvii. 32. <hi>and will draw all men unto him to judgment</hi>; that is, <hi>he will gather together all nations,</hi> Matt. xxv. St. Paul ſo fully clears up this ſenſe of the forecited text, in the 15th chap. of his iſt epiſtle to the Cor. it needs no other comment.— I proceed to conſider the meaning of the laſt mentioned text in the ſample, viz. 1 Tim. ii. 4. <hi>who will have all men to be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> I intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſample, that the word WILL was GOD's decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative, intentional, authoritative will, that never can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered nor diſobeyed. If the text means ſo, it would be as unalterable as the verdict aforementioned, and would be as full a contradiction to the teſtimony of CHRIST and his inſpired witneſſes, reſpecting the end of finally impenitent ſinners, as nay is to yea. Therefore, in order to reconcile this text with all of like import, and ſhew its agreement with the aforementioned verdict, I muſt conſider ſome ſcriptural ideas reſpecting election, or GOD's decreeative will: which would not be difficult to deſcribe, if there had not been heretofore ſuch ſtraining, racking and crowning with thorns, and even cruciſying of ſeveral texts of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as far as can be done, I conccive, to anſwer favorite purpoſes. While one ſect ſays, GOD's decreeative will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſcriptures, is to ſave all Adam's family, and no more. Others ſay it means to ſave all the fallen angels. Others ſay in means to reſtore all things, even the whole
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:034538_0027_0FFF23CF8D6D4568"/>creation of beaſts and creeping things, &amp;c. Others ſay it means a remnant of the human family only, who have been already brought forth by the womb of time, ſince the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But they further ſay GOD's will is to regenerate millions in the latter end of time, during a number of ages, ſo that when the general judgment ſhall take place, there will be more ſaved than will be loſt in perdition. If equal credit may be given to all the aſorementioned opinions, what a variety of unalterable wills exiſts in the Deity; and how different their intentions and extent. All the aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned opinions are agreed in one thing, viz. that GOD's decreeative will reſpecting theſe matters was before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. Others, with equal confidence ſay, concerning ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſalvation or damnation. GOD's decreeative will determines nothing before they have a day of viſitation: and if they, in ſaid day, chuſe GOD for their portion, then GOD chuſes them for his inheritance. Hence we may learn the conſequences of undertaking to look into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret things which belong to GOD only to know, and bring to paſs. Such, I conceive, would do well to learn what that meaneth, where GOD ſmote fifty thouſand three-ſcore and ten of the inhabitants of Beth-ſhemeſh for looking into the ark, 1 Sam. ch. vi. How many thouſands of profeſſed chriſtians have been ſmote with death, in a religious ſenſe, and have cauſed diviſions and contentions contrary to the plain doctrine of CHRIST and the law of brotherly love, through the chriſtian world, by peeping and trying to look into ſuch ſecret things as are not particularly explained in the holy ſcriptures, and making them mean what they would have them, by their artful reaſonings and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Hence ariſes the confuſion of opinions aforenamed, with many heretical principles of different ſects. Some holding the juſtification of ſinners from eternity, having no regard to the moral agency of men; but drown all our ideas in the decreeative will, both concerning the ſalvation and damnation of the ſouls of the family of Adam. Others, by their reaſonings and conſequences make the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeative will a mere nullity. Indeed, the confuſion of ideas is ſo great, as to what is the meaning of GOD's decreeative will, that if one man ſhould aſk another what religious proſeſſion he was of, and he ſhould anſwer, I am a ſincere believer that JESUS CHRIST is the Son of GOD, I am fully
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:034538_0028_0FFF23FB35F5D3D8"/>perſwaded that unleſs a man be born again, or of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he cannot ſee the kingdom of GOD in its ſpiritual beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it conſiſting in righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; and truſt through grace I have experienced it; and proſeſs to be an honeſt, apoſtolic chriſtian, fully believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the principles of the doctrine of CHRIST, as expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the New-Teſtament; and find myſelf bound, and willing to obey the laws and ordinances enjoined therein, according to my ability: how ſhould we know by all he profeſſed whether he is ſound in the faith? We could not judge but little about it, according to the opinion of many, becauſe he had not declared in what ſenſe he underſtood GOD's decreeative will, or election; that being the great criterion by which he muſt be deemed ſound, or heterodox.</p>
            <p>If the man had ſaid, I am a Lutheran chriſtian, or a Calviniſtic chriſtian, an Arminian chriſtian, a Methodiſt, a Univerſaliſt, or an Hopkintonian chriſtian, he would have been underſtood. If he had owned either of the aforenam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leaders opinions, doubtleſs he would be pronounced ſound in the faith, by one ſect, and perhaps condemned as erroneous by all the others. But from whence aroſe the puzzle? Becauſe the man profeſſed the apoſtolic chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and did not diſtinguiſh his principles by any modern name. Hence we ſee what a confuſion the preſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of chriſtians are in, by hearkening to thoſe popular leaders of modern date, and paying more attention to ſome of their myſtical and allegorical reaſonings, and comments upon certain texts of ſcripture, than to the ſcriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fairly compared with each other. Can any chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian deliberately judge, that what was neceſſary to be known, to teach men GOD's will and our duty, in order for our happineſs here and glory hereafter, ſhould be taught by the Holy Ghoſt in ſuch an unintelligible manner, as it were to the halves; and want hundreds of modern teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to finiſh it. I think the entertaining of ſuch a thought, would be an impeachment of the holy ſcriptures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to reaſon itſelf. Let it be obſerved, that I have not mentioned the confuſion of opinions about election, or GOD's decreeative will, becauſe I would make light of it, or oppoſe the doctrine: GOD forbid. I fully believe what the ſcriptures ſay concerning it. I only oppoſe the ſtrange comments that many have made thereupon. It is plain,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034538_0029_0FFF23D3225E1498"/>I think, from ſcripture, whoever makes election and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination blanks in their creed, had as well renounce the Bible itſelf: For if there is no election there is no elect JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS nor any grace. Therefore I will examine what the ſcriptures ſay concerning the main leading ideas that GOD has been pleaſed to reveal.</p>
            <p>The firſt time I remember the word, elect, is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning redemption and ſalvation, is in Iſa. xlii. 1. <hi>Behold my ſervant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my ſoul delighteth, &amp;c.</hi> Read to the tenth verſe, and you will learn what GOD choſe him for, and what he was to do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we read which way GOD choſe to ſave ſinners, viz. according to the election of grace, and not of works, read Rom. xi. 5, 6. You will find it more particularly explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Rom. ch. ix. where, under the types of Eſau and Jacob, the Apoſtle illuſtrates the difference of works and grace. Saying ver. 11, <hi>For the children being not yet born, neither hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done any good or evil, that the purpoſe of GOD according to election might ſtand.</hi> Mark what purpoſe, the purpoſe of ſaving ſinners. How? Not of works but of him that calleth, viz. the LORD JESUS, the wiſdom of the Father, who ſaith, <hi>To you O men I call, &amp;c,</hi> Thus it appears GOD's choice in ſaving ſinners is in the way of grace, and not of works.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we read by what rule, viz. <hi>Elect, according to the fore-knowledge of GOD the Father, through ſanctification of the ſpirit unto obedience, &amp;c.</hi> And again, St. Paul informs us Rom. xi. 2. <hi>God hath not caſt away his people which he fore-knew</hi>; but further teſtifies, Eph. i. 4. that his choice was exiſting before the foundation of the world. And tells his Epheſian brethren, they had obtained their inheritance, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> truſted in CHRIST, being predeſtinated according <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the purpoſe of him who worketh all things according <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſcripture, when ſpeaking of GOD's decreeative will, may be ſummed up in the teſtimony recorded, Iſa. ch. lv. where GOD ſaith, his ways and thoughts are as much higher than ours, as the heavens are higher than the earth, and cauſeth the rain and ſnow, without our leave, to anſwer his deſigns, <hi>So ſhall my word be that goeth ſorth out of my mouth, it ſhall not return unto me void; but it ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe, and it ſhall proſper in the thing where to I ſent it,</hi> ver. 11.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:034538_0030_0FFF23FF281379C8"/>
Thus I underſtand GOD's intentional, decreeative will, is eternally and unalterably the ſame. And what can any ſinner know reſpecting his perſonal election, by all that I have quoted, and by all the ſcriptures further ſay about it? It is evident he can know nothing in this way; neither did GOD mean he ſhould. The way to know our perſonal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, is to look into what GOD's preceptive will ſays. By GOD's preceptive will, I mean that part of GOD's will which is plainly and particularly revealed, by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, commands, precepts, promiſes, and threatnings to men, as moral agents, and accountable beings. Which preceptive will, contains every eſſential point, neceſſary for us to know, in order to obtain ſalvation, perſonally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually; or it would not properly be a revelation. For as GOD correſponds with man only by his conſcience, reſpecting his ſalvation or damnation; ſo the Apoſtles, bringing a divine revelation, ſuitable to all capaſities, did not addreſs mens paſſions by the inſinuating art of human reaſonings, or an artful chain of philoſophic arguments; but they conſidered men as intelligent, moral agents; and declared GOD's preceptive will to every man's conſcience. They entered into no parley with mens reaſonings; but preſſing forward to their conſciences, placed them before GOD, and converſed with them there. All the commands, precepts and inſtitutions of the New-Teſtament, are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſciences of men, as moral agents. There is no doubt but GOD can make any of his creatures whatever he pleaſes, conſiſtent with his purpoſes. But as it has pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed GOD to make men moral agents, they are thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for their conduct. But without the power of moral agency, they could not be obedient to GOD precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive will, nor diſobedient; and conſequently not accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their actions, nor the ſubjects of rewards or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the account of them. It is worthy to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that GOD's decreeative will never juſtifies nor <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the conſcience of any ſinner, as an abſolute decree. If a miniſter was to preach an hundred years, upon GOD's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeative will, it could not reach the conſcience of any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſaid decrees being the ſame before creation exiſted that they are now, and ever will be. Therefore the ſurety aforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, to whom all power is committed, has revealed a part of his will and purpoſes, by way of commands, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:034538_0031_0FFF23D64041FAA0"/>promiſes and threatnings. And this part of his will reſpects the moral agency of rational beings; and in this view, GOD ſays come let us reaſon together. And altho the original creditor could not forgive the leaſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his law, nor admit of any repentance or reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rebel ſinner; but annexes a curſe upon the leaſt fault. JESUS CHRIST, the ſurety, can forgive ſins, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of repentance; if we are willing to receive him as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in the goſpel. He teſtifies in his great commiſſion, that repentance and remiſſion of ſins can take place through his name; and has promiſed for our encouragement, that he that believeth in him, ſhall be ſaved. But if any deſpiſe, diſbelieve, and make light of the goſpel, it is evident divine juſtice does not now proceed againſt the ſinner according to the covenant made with Adam (as it is called by many) but according to a new denunciation of wrath, under the Mediator's government, viz. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Whoſoever loveth not our LORD JESUS CHRIST, let him be anathema, maranatha.</hi> Adam knew nothing of ſuch a denunciation of wrath upon the footing he ſtood in his innocency. St. Paul ſays, Tit. ii. II. <hi>The grace of GOD that bringeth ſalvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that, denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c.</hi> This is a great goſpel truth, and GOD's precepts expreſsly declare it to be his will, that all men, viz. who hear of this grace, ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth, upon the footing of this goſpel grace, and be ſaved; according as it is revealed in the New-Teſtament; this is GOD's preceptive will. Accordingly he commands all men every where to repent, Acts xvii. 30. I conceive that St. Paul, knowing when he wrote the ſecond chapter of his firſt epiſtle to Timothy, that it was the expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and preceptive will of our Saviour, who is GOD, that the goſpel ſhould be preached to all men, that they might come to the knowledge of the truth and be ſaved; unleſs they ſhould obſtinately reject it; therefore, in this ſenſe, the text under conſideration, was properly expreſſed. This is a ſcriptural eaſy and conſiſtent ſenſe, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agrees with the many texts that teſtify the eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all, who in this life, reject the goſpel. This ſenſe of the text agrees with the aforementioned unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble verdict, Mat. ch. xxv. This preceptive will of GOD
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034538_0032_0FFF2400EA760690"/>can be, and has been broken, from the time that GOD wrote part of his will, with his own ſinger on tables of ſtone, Exod. ch. xxxi. until now. It was GOD's will that Iſrael ſhould not worſhip idols; but how often did they commit idolatry.</p>
            <p>The preceptive will of GOD, made known by the law, and all the prophets, as interpreted by our LORD JESUS, conſiſts in loving GOD with all our heart, and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as ourſelves. I need no more proof of the matter, than to aſk the conſciences of every moral agent, under the light of the goſpel, whether they have not broken this will of GOD, viz. this law of love. To ſum up a cloud of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture witneſſes, by one inſtance, I will quote Mat. xxiii. 37. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not, &amp;c.</hi> Here is the ſame word in the Greek, ſays a learned author, as in the text, 1 Tim. ii 4. tranſlated WILL; and in this paſſage WOULD, and might have been rendered in our Engliſh language, <hi>How often have I willed together thy children, &amp;c.</hi> It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in this text, CHRIST repreſents himſelf as willing the ſalvation of the inhabitants of Jeruſalem; and it is equally evident they prevented his will taking effect, by their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate refuſal of his kindneſs. CHRIST had made full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, in point of merit, for their ſalvation; and publicly proclaimed his will, by an invitation for them to come, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring all things were ready for their refreſhment; and had they accepted it, they would have been ſaved; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, they periſhed becauſe they would not comply with his invitation. Thus it is evident the text, in 1 Tim. ii. 4. is ſo ſar from affording the leaſt evidence of the actual ſalvation of all men, that it exactly agrees with the united verdict of CHRIST and his inſpired witneſſes, that numbers of the children of the kingdom, viz. the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Jews, were caſt into outer darkneſs, &amp;c. And CHRIST teſtifies they never ſhould taſte of his ſupper.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewed, that all the texts I have pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſenſe of, in the ſample, will bear a ſcriptural mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with the verdict of CHRIST and his inſpired witneſſes, reſpecting the everlaſting puniſhment (not of the works of iniquity) but of the workers of iniquity themſelves, in their
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:034538_0033_0FFF23D7CD468770"/>riſen ſouls and bodies, at the day of judgment For want of conſidering the ſcriptural diſtinction, I have obſerved between the intententional, decreeative part of GOD's will, and the preceptive part, as it reſpects moral agents, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is, that all the conſuſion aforementioned hath taken place. In every inſtance, where the apoſtles ſpeak of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal election, it was to them only, who, having believed the goſpel, made their perſonal election ſure; by keeping the faith and a good conſcience; or, as St. Peter expreſſeth it, 2 Pet. ch. i. ſuch who give diligence, to add to their faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, godlineſs, &amp;c. Such perſons have the ſpirit witneſſing with their ſpirit, that they are the elect children of GOD.</p>
            <p>The knowledge of GOD's purpoſes being unchangeable, is of great ſervice to ſuch, to ſupport them under perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and trials; in this ſenſe, the Apoſtles ſpeak of it to comfort and ſtrengthe the ſaints. This ſecret of GOD is only with the righteous, Prov. iii. 32. they only can read their new name in the white ſtone, which no man knoweth ſaving he that receiveth it. The Pſalmiſt expreſſeth it full and clear, Pſal. xxv. 14. <hi>The ſecret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and be will ſheen them his covenant.</hi> They are ſuch individuals, who can take comfort in the belief of GOD's unchangeable, decrecative will and purpoſes, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through grace, their right in the exceeding great and precious promiſes; which may be ſummed up in the words of our LORD JESUS, John xiv. 19. <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> And it was GOD's purpoſe to ſave every one, that ever was, or will be ſaved, through the ſanctification of the ſpirit and the belief of the truth, 2 Thef. ch. ii. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, GOD calls them by the goſpel: And upon tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believing the record GOD has given of his Son, any one may know his perſonal election: and GOD has revealed no other way for any ſinner to have knowledge of it, any more than if there had not been one word written, that ever GOD had any abſolute decrecative will, or not.</p>
            <p>Therefore, it ought to be carefully obſerved, whenev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the ſcriptures ſpeak of GOD's decrees, as ordaining men perſonally to eternal happineſs, or miſery, they have always reference to them, under the characters, to which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and threatnings are made, by GOD's preceptive will, For inſtance; GOD promiſes to juſtify the believer, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:034538_0034_0FFF2403468C48E8"/>the penitent, and will glorify the perſervering ſaint.— So he decreed from eternity, to juſtify, pardon, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy ſuch: And on the other hand, he as abſolutely ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from eternity, that the finally unbelieving, impenitent, diſobedint ſinner, as ſuch, ſhould be puniſhed with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction, 2 Thef. i. 9. This ſtate of the caſe cannot be denied by any, without giving the lie to a conſiderable part of the New-Teſtament ſcriptures, which ſpeak of thoſe important points. This being a ſcriptural fact, I conceive it is preſumptuous, and very daring, for any mortal to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to preach, or write his ideas reſpecting the decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative part of GOD's will, when he is at beſt a mere gueſſer; and by his myſtical reaſonings, to aſſert many things which expreſsly contradict the preceptive part of GOD's will, which is plainly revealed by the word which ſhall judge us at the laſt day, as ſurely as CHRIST's teſtimony is true, John xii. 48. <hi>The word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge him in the laſt day.</hi> Yea, boldly deny the expreſs teſtimonies of CHRIST and his inſpired witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Where, Sir, do you get your commiſſion and authority to proclaim to a world of ſinners, the intentional, decreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of GOD's will, firſt? when it is evident as words can expreſs it, that CHRIST commiſſioned his Apoſtles to go and preach the preceptive part of his will to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; firſt witneſſing to every man's conſcience, that if they believed their teſtimony, they ſhould be ſaved; if not, they ſhould be damned. They further teſtified, that the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fixed by CHRIST, the great ſurety, aforenamed, for all ſuch as did not repent and obey the goſpel, was everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the LORD.</p>
            <p>I pray you to remember that the ſcriptures do not ſay, in one inſtance, that ever CHRIST repented for any ſinner, or credited his own record for any, hoped or obeyed the goſpel for any ſinner: Theſe are acts of a moral agent, and as neceſſary, in order to our perſonal knowledge of our election, as that the elect JESUS ſhould atone the deity, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a way for our return to GOD's favor.</p>
            <p>He obeyed the law for ſinners, it is true, but we muſt credit it, each one for himſelf, in order to be perſonally juſtified; and each one obey the goſpel, or periſh; as ſure as the word which will judge us at the laſt day, is true.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:034538_0035_0FFF23D9D0C916B0"/>
Pleaſe, Sir, to pauſe one half hour, and conſider whether you do not preach your goſpel wrong end foremoſt; teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to ſinners, that their names are all written in the white ſtone, by GOD's intentional, decreeative will; whether they have received it, or can even, read it, or not, you are perſwaded their names are all there.</p>
            <p>And now, if ſinners will but pin their faith upon your gueſs, or only believe your opinion of the ſcriptures, they may find reſt to their ſouls, immediately, whether they take CHRIST's yoke upon them, or the devil's, for the preſent, no matter; all will be finally ſaved. O aſtoniſhing! If ſuch doctrine is not ſewing pillows to all arm-holes, and trying peace where GOD ſays no peace, I know of no way it can be performed.</p>
            <p>I can ſpeak the truth in CHRIST, and lie not, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience bearing me witneſs by the teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt, that the Apoſties did not preach their goſpel in ſuch a manner, but contratiwiſe. I leave it as my dying wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this generation, and to them who may be born in ages to come, if they ſhould read theſe lines, that there is not one text in the Bible, that ſays GOD's intentional will, is to ſave the ſouls or perſons of all Adam's family, and puniſh their crimes only. Neither is there a ſentence that can properly bear ſuch a meaning, excepting the lie told our mother Eve, Gen. iii. 4. Our great judge, with his inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed witneſſes, have teſtified the contrary; and ſurely no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal can be made from our Saviour's deciſion.</p>
            <p>May the LORD grant you, and all that are entangled and bewildered with you, candidly to conſider the ſcriptural teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies I have offered to your conſideration. So, wiſhing you, with myſelf, and all of every denomination, wherein we are miſtaken, in any religious point, may experience the bleſſing recorded in Iſa. xxix. 24. <hi>They alſo that erred in ſpirit ſhall come to underſtanding, and they that murmured ſhall learn doctrine.</hi>—</p>
