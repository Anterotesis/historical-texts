            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>IT is matter of ſorrowful, Obſervation, That <hi>New-England's</hi> primitive Ways are not now ſeen among us in their former Glory and Beauty; but we have too ſadly <hi>left our firſt Love</hi>: and Cuſtoms, of ill fame, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with that Profeſſion we make of the pureſt Reformation, are viſibly ſpreading in the midſt of us.</p>
            <p>IN particular, it is for a Lamentation, that many Perſons do unneceſſarily frequent <hi>Taverns</hi> and <hi>Publick Houſes</hi>; even to a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and to the manifeſt Prejudice and Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002780_0004_0FE6325CAB1E1DD0"/>WE do therefore hold our ſelves oblig'd, in faithfulneſs to our great Lord &amp; Maſter, the Credit of the Goſpel, and the Welfare of precious Souls, to joyn in the following <hi>Serious Addreſs</hi> to our Neighbours. Which, ſome of us having had the Compoſing, and others the Peruſal of, we all concur to the Scope &amp; Subſtance; as apprehending it to be a ſeaſonable and needful Teſtimony: And do earneſtly (in the Meekneſs of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and yet with his Authority) exhort all into whoſe hands it may come, <hi>Thoſe</hi> particularly who are under our more immediate Inſpection and Charge, (for whoſe Souls we would watch as they that muſt give Account; that we may do it with Joy, and not with Grief; for that is unprofitable for them) to take what is here offer'd, into their moſt ſerious Conſideration, and to ſubmit their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences unto the Mind and Will of GOD, as it is herein preſented to them.</p>
            <p>THE Addreſs is made in this moſt publick manner; Partly becauſe if there be any ſo <hi>ſecret</hi> in their practice of the Evil witneſs'd againſt, as to eſcape our Notice and perſonal Applications, we hope this Admonition by the way of the <hi>Preſs,</hi> may find them out: Partly alſo that thoſe upon whom a tranſient oral Diſcourſe is apt to make but little Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, may by having a <hi>printed</hi> one in their
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002780_0005_0FE6325DAFFE2DB8"/>
hands, have opportunity more <hi>deliberately</hi> to weigh our Advice: And partly that we might in this way <hi>reach</hi> thoſe whom we can't ſpeak to from the <hi>Pulpit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Admonition is primarily intended for <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſors,</hi> of whom we wou'd hope that ſome are among the Faithful in CHRIST; who will be diſpoſed to ſay with the Royal Pſalmiſt, <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a Kindneſs</hi> —. And as Brethren, we wou'd reſtore ſuch in the ſpirit of <hi>meekneſs,</hi> conſidering our ſelves as Men ſubject to like paſſions with others. Yet it muſt be obſerv'd, that in the courſe of this Addreſs, here and there are mingled ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Hints, more eſpecially pointed at the groſly <hi>Scandalous,</hi> who deſerve to be <hi>ſharply rebuked,</hi> and often have been.</p>
            <p>WE wou'd not be underſtood to involve all that are faulty, in one common Charge of Guilt, without diſtinction: or to impute every ill property and effect of the Tavern-meetings, in the ſame degree, to every one. Nor is it deſign'd to caſt <hi>Reproach</hi> on any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons; but We ſincerely aim (by the Grace of GOD) at the Reforming of ſuch as are fallen into ſo unhappy a Practice, and the Warning of others who are like to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002780_0006_0FE6325DB3704A08"/>WE beſeech all concern'd, ſolemnly to examine themſelves, to ponder the path of their feet, and prove their own ways; and make particular application of the Reproofs and Warnings here given, as an inform'd Conſcience ſhall direct: Awfully remembring this matter will quickly be judg'd according to the Goſpel, at the enlighten'd Tribunal of CHRIST, <hi>Whoſe We are, and whom we ſerve.</hi>

Brethren, We are jealous over you with a godly Jealouſy; and are afraid leſt by any means, as the <hi>Serpent</hi> beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> by his Subtilty, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in CHRIST; as the Apoſtle ſpake to his Friends at <hi>Corinth,</hi> not in the Language of Prejudice &amp; Diſaffection, but of his abundant Love and good Will to them. We fear what Miſchiefs &amp; Ruins ſuch a Practice may bring on many, whoſe beſt Intereſts we are very much concern'd for; if there be not a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſtop put unto it.</p>

your everlaſting Good. O that our Counſel may be acceptable to you! We wou'd ſpeak the words of Truth &amp; Soberneſs. GOD by his Bleſſing make them words of Power; and make us wiſe Reprovers upon <hi>obedient Ears!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come then &amp; let us reaſon together. Hear now and conſider, while we plead with you. It is an important caſe we are upon, and we intreat you to allow it an impartial &amp; ſerious Trial. Will you give us leave to expoſtulate the matter with a juſt freedom, and with all plainneſs of Speech, under the following particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Are you not chargeable with a very faulty <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> of <hi>TIME,</hi> while you go ſo often, and tarry ſo long at the Tavern, or other publick Houſes!</p>
            <p>Do you not very often ſpend your long Hours there, without diſpatching any Buſineſs at all; without doing or getting any real Good, whether as to Eſtate, Body, or Soul; without ſerving any of the valuable Ends of the Rational Life, much leſs of the Chriſtian! Hence, Is it not a ſort of more ſolemn Idleneſs you are guilty of! And then, Is it nor an Aggravation, that you ſpend ſo <hi>many</hi> Hours in your Tavern-Interviews! The Frequency and Length adds not a little to the Guilt &amp; Miſchief of them, by a dreadful Conſumption of precious Time; which is a Talent we muſt all Account for, and being but of ſhort Continuance, we hadn't need be prodigal of it. Brethren, the Time is ſhort, and much of it runs off in Sleep, and in neceſſary Refreſhments, and unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Avocations from Buſineſs. Inſtead therefore of contriving Methods to paſs away the Time which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, you had need ſtudy all poſſible ways to <hi>redeem</hi> it, by doing <hi>with Might</hi> what your hands find to do<note n="*" place="bottom">

Carefully gather up the fragments of Time, that nothing be loſt. Talk not of <hi>ſpare-Hours,</hi> — that you can afford the Time, or that you take only the <hi>Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> to refreſh your ſelves after the Labours of a weary

Surely too great to obtain the Divine Allowance. — And do you conſider (Sirs) that you have much weighty Buſineſs (beſides your ſecular Affairs) lying upon your hands, which beſpeaks the moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, the moſt vigorous Application of all your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; being eno' of it ſelf (had you no other Concern) to fill up the narrow ſpace of this ſhort Life!

            <p>Alas! What are the Diſcourſes that ſwallow up your Tavern-Hours! How ſeldom after a long Evenings Talk,

            <p>It is written <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall: neither let us tempt chriſt</hi> — We ſhou'd beware of Sin, and of every thing that looks like it, or leads to it; ſhould guard againſt all the Occaſions and Incentives of Sin; ſhou'd watch &amp; pray that we enter not into Temptation: and beſure then we ſhou'd be cautious that we don't at any time volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily or unneceſſarily put our ſelves in the way of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. This is to lay our ſelves open to the power of Satan, and forfeit the Divine Protection.</p>
            <p>Now, Brethren, judge ye, whether Taverns and ſuch like Houſes are not generally Places of Temptation, much Temptation. We appeal to your own Conſciences and impartial Reflections &amp; Experience.</p>
            <p>Do you not find your ſelves there in hazard of falling into the <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>ill Perſons</hi>; and ſo of contracting a dangerous Acquaintance, of learning their pernicious ways, or at leaſt of ſuffering Sin upon them!</p>
            <p>Are you not alſo in danger of making too near Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the Sin of <hi>Intemperance,</hi> while you ſit ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Temptations to it? Don't you run the hazard of being drawn on, before you are aware, from a more tranſient Chat over the Glaſs, to a Tarrying long at the Wine; from taking a Sip, to ſwallowing down a Draught; and from one Draught to another, until at the laſt, it bite like a Serpent and ſting like an Adder!</p>

Or of leading others into them, by making wrong Repreſentations yourſelves?</p>

               <hi>give themſelves</hi> to theſe things in their Seaſon, and ſtudy to redeem as much Time as they can for them. And judge ye, whether the Time you ſpend at the Tavern, and in particular the <hi>Evening,</hi> which is one of the peculiar Seaſons of Devotion, wou'd not be ſpent to much better purpoſe, and turn to far better Account in the Day of Reckoning, if devoted (in part, at leaſt) to ſacred Retirements! Or, if it were employ'd in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Aſſociations,</hi> in reforming Societies, and the like; wou'd not this be abundantly more for your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction both at preſent and hereafter? Nay, if you employ'd the Time (part of it) in reading of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or ſtudying any pleaſant &amp; uſeful <hi>Science,</hi> to cultivate your Knowlege, and furniſh you to do greater Services for your Generation: or in friendly <hi>Viſits</hi> among ſober and good Neighbours, under a wiſe &amp; chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, and ſeaſonably concluded; wou'd not this be much more for your preſent Edification, and future Peace &amp; Comfort!</p>

               <hi>Men &amp; Brethren,</hi> We wou'd not be miſunderſtood, as if we meant to inſinuate, that a due Purſuit of Religion is inconſiſtent with all manner of <hi>Diverſion</hi>: No, We ſuppoſe there are Diverſions undoubtedly innocent, yea profitable &amp; of uſe, to fit us for Service, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening &amp; fortifying our frail Nature, invigorating the Animal Spirits, and brightning the Mind, when tired with a cloſe Application to Buſineſs. — But then conſider, the moſt harmleſs Recreations may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very culpable, and hurtful, for want of obſerving propel <hi>Rules,</hi> with regard to the <hi>Time, Place, Company, Manner,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are weighty Circumſtances, &amp; call for a more careful Obſervation, than is commonly found among Men, in the ordering of their Diverſions.

We fear this is a very <hi>rare</hi> Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Few have the Skill to avoid, or Strength to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Temptations that mingle themſelves with their Diverſions. They drink down Poiſon in their pleaſant Cups, and perceive it not. They take Fire into their Boſoms, and hug it there, until at the laſt they mourn, when their Fleſh is conſumed, and their Souls deſtroy'd! Carnal Pleaſures have prov'd ſome of the moſt fatal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to Religion; have carry'd many down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Hell, and exceedingly retarded others in their Progreſs to Heaven. In particular, the Diverſions of the <hi>Tavern</hi> have been very miſchievous.

And have you not known others, that perhaps have not totally fallen away, who yet from their firſt liſting into a Club, have viſibly declined in their Zeal &amp; Watchfulneſs, and become leſs diſpoſed for ſuch religious Exerciſes and Societies as once they bore a figure in! —We beſeech you, make a ſtand, and ſuffer Conſcience to enter into theſe Inquiries, &amp; give a faithful Report. Let every Man prove his own Work; and be not deceived. Fear, leſt any of you ſhou'd <hi>ſeem to come ſhort.</hi> Fly the Places of Temptation, where ſo many have, 'ere they were aware, been betray'd into Sin &amp; Ruin; <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou alſo be not only tempted and entangled, but even overcome,</hi> and the latter End be worſe with thee than the Beginning!</p>

Are not the Children and Servants likely to wander from home too, and will not they be tempted to tarry out late, at leaſt ſometimes, if the Heads of the Family do it? And if one Head does it, will not the other be apt to do it alſo? But what Confuſion muſt there needs be in ſuch a Houſe! And how muſt Diſorders grow in a <hi>Town,</hi> where there are <hi>many</hi> ſuch Houſes, as 'twere left deſolate! How much more, if it were the univerſal Practice, and almoſt every Family were uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at Evening in ſuch a Caſe! The Heads abroad! And the Young People abroad! Some here, others there; and all upon their Diverſions! What a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Gloom wou'd this caſt upon the Town! How doleful the Appearance! Can you bear the Tho't of it! But now why may not <hi>all</hi> run into the Practice, if it be juſtifiable in to many &amp; ſuch Perſons as do allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in it? And who knows how <hi>extenſive</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of your ill <hi>Example</hi> may be? (of which we ſhall ſpeak more particularly under the next Article.) Surely then a Regard to the Welfare &amp; Reputation of the Town, a Reverence for Order, as well as a ſerious View to the Benefit of your Children &amp; Servants ſhou'd conſtrain you to leave off the evil Cuſtom. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a juſt Reſpect for your Conſorts, ſhould influence you to ſpend your Evenings at home as much as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Buſineſs will allow. May we not in this caſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that Admonition of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts Parents &amp; Maſters, to love their Wives &amp; Children, and give unto their Servants that which is juſt &amp; equal; and (therefore) to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>watch</hi> in the ſame with Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; <hi>withal Praying</hi>

            <p>But do not you, our Friends, fail of a due Reſpect to your Conſorts, while you ſo conſtantly prefer the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments of Tavern-Converſation, before the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Company? —And then do you not take an unhappy Method to <hi>hinder</hi> your Family-Prayers by this Cuſtom? If it don't breed Contention, yet it ſhou'd ſeem, it muſt needs too often infer Diſorder, and hurt the Devotions of the Houſehold; eſpecially if you tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out late in the Evening, as we fear the manner of ſome is. Do you not hereby loſe one ſpecial Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for the Inſtruction of your Houſeholds? And do you not take a Courſe to disfit your ſelves too much for the Duties of GOD's Worſhip? When the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath been conſum'd in Vanity, and the beſt Seaſon in it for Family-Worſhip paſſed away, are not the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it like to be (in part, at leaſt) joſtled out or hurry'd over in a ſlighty drowſy manner; be but lean Sacrifices, &amp; of little Account with the Holy GOD, who has ſaid, <hi>I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me.</hi> 
               <q>When the the Strength &amp; Spirits of the Mind have been laid out on the World, in the Day, and waſted on trifling Diverſions in the Evening, what remains but Indifference &amp; Luke warmneſs, for Objects of a religious Concern!

            </p>
            <p>To conclude this Head, We pray you ſeriouſly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on what you read of <hi>David,</hi> that Man of GOD, and of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>:—After the Labours of the Day, in removing the Ark<note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19, 20.</note>, <hi>All the People departed every one to his Houſe: Then</hi> David <hi>returned to bleſs his Houſehold.</hi> And wou'd it not be well for you, O our Friends, if you wou'd <hi>go &amp; do likewiſe</hi>?

to the Tavern; from Buſineſs, to inſnaring Diverſions; had you not better <hi>return</hi> (with <hi>David</hi>) <hi>to bleſs your Houſeholds</hi>; even to bleſs them with your Prayers, and Counſils, and good Converſation in CHRIST! <hi>It is written</hi>

               </note>, The Commandments of the Lord, Thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them, <hi>when thou fitteſt in thy Houſe</hi>; when thou lieſt down, &amp; when thou riſeſt up.

               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Mayn't the <hi>Example</hi> you ſet, be of <hi>ill</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, &amp; <hi>hurtful to Others</hi>?</p>
            <p>Example is a very attractive thing; eſpecially <hi>bad</hi> Example: This is a <hi>Root of Bitterneſs,</hi> which wherever it ſprings up, is generally fruitful of pernicious Effects, and thereby many are defiled; many deſtroy'd. It is like <hi>Leven,</hi> which works ſecretly, inſinuates it ſelf inſenſibly, and ſpreads very ſwiftly. It's like the noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> which ſilently aſſaults Men, and yet with a mighty Power, &amp; mortally wounds, almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſuſpect any Danger. Eſpecially bad Examples ſet by Perſons of <hi>Note</hi> &amp; in ſuperior Rank, or making a <hi>peculiar Profeſſion</hi> of Religion, or pretending to be Men of higher <hi>Knowlege,</hi> &amp;c. do carry with them an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Contagion. By ill Examples, whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities have ſometimes been endanger'd, &amp; Cities bro't into a Snare. By this means often <hi>one Offender deſtroys much Good.</hi> And the Example of Profeſſors &amp; Superiours, <hi>particularly</hi> in this matter of needleſs frequenting the <hi>Tavern,</hi> and ſpending the Evening there, we fear will be &amp; has been of miſchievous Conſequence.</p>
            <p>Has it not a Tendency to <hi>harden the Wicked,</hi> who are apt to juſtify themſelves by the Example of others, eſpecially of their Betters, againſt the known Laws

of Virtue &amp; Wiſdom! Do you not in a ſort herd your ſelves with the debaucht Crew, while you ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go to the Place of <hi>their Reſort</hi>? Do you not too much <hi>conform to this Worlds,</hi> and in a ſenſe <hi>ſit with vain Perſons,</hi> by frequenting the ſame Houſes that they haunt; by ſitting ſo often on the Drunkards Bench and in the Seat of the Scorner? And tho' you run not with them to the ſame Exceſs of Riot; yet is there not exceeding hazard, that your ſo far Symbolizing with them, will embolden them in their Wickedneſs? And are you not like to become (in another &amp; worſe ſenſe, than that in which it was ſaid of <hi>David) the Song of Drunkards,</hi> their Joy &amp; Laughter, tho' the Grief of your ſober thinking Friends! Moreover, Is there not Danger of Others being <hi>ſeduced</hi> by your Example, into the paths of the Deſtroyer; particularly <hi>Young Perſons,</hi> Children, Apprentices &amp; Servants? Will not ſuch be apt to (nay do they not already) follow you to the Tavern? And if <hi>you</hi> tarry <hi>late,</hi> will not <hi>they</hi> too? And if you have your <hi>free</hi> Converſation, will not they have their <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Jeſting, &amp; <hi>corrupt</hi> Communication? And if you take your Glaſs freely, tho' perhaps never to ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Beſotment; will not they be in danger of drinking to a vile <hi>Exceſs</hi>? And ſtill call it but good Fellowſhip, and colour all over with your Example, imagining they have your Patronage! O how ſhocking the Tho't! Dwell upon it, we pray you, till you feel the force of it; &amp; let it be an abiding powerful Reſtraint upon you.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe you are either ſtrong to drink Wine; or are really abſtemious, do always keep within the bounds of Temperance, and are able to ſtand in the Hour of Temptation: yet by your Example you may draw <hi>others</hi> into a <hi>Snare,</hi> who perhaps think they may with Security follow <hi>you</hi>; but alas! the Temptation proves too hard for 'em, &amp; often miſerably foils them. — <hi>Again,</hi> Suppoſe <hi>You</hi> have your Converſation chiefly with <hi>fober</hi> Friends, &amp; by that means are not ſo much in danger; yet <hi>others</hi> that are ſeduced by your Example, may fall into <hi>bad</hi> Company; of which there's generally no great Scarcity any where, but in places of Diverſion almoſt always a Plenty.

And ſome have, it may be, the <hi>firſt</hi> time they went to a Tavern, met there the Inſtruments of their Ruin.</p>
            <p>In a word, Admit your Tavern-meetings to be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves lawful &amp; innocent; yet if they become an <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sin</hi> unto others, &amp; you thereby caſt a <hi>ſtumbling Block</hi> before the Weak, you muſt certainly allow, you <hi>ought</hi> to forbear. In matters of ſtrict and abſolute Duty indeed, we know of no Obligation upon Men to forbear, left others ſhould take Offence, and makes an ill Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our Example. Yet in Caſes of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in matters of Liberty, the Rule will hold. <hi>Take heed then leſt by any means this Liberty of yours become a stumbling Block to others.</hi> For if any ſee Thee which <hi>haſt Knowledge,</hi> cuſtomarily fitting at meat or taking your Glaſs in the Tavern; ſhall not the Conſcience of him that is <hi>weak,</hi> be embolden'd to take the like Liberty, and being too weak to encounter the Temptation, fall into Sin?

            <p>They are not a few preciſe &amp; humorous Perſons, that diſapprove of this Cuſtom; but many of the more ſober and watchful &amp; wiſe Chriſtians among us, <hi>behold you and are grieved.</hi> Now as Charity requires that we mourn the Sins of others; ſo it requires that we <hi>bear on another's burdens</hi>

            <p>One very juſtly obſerves, <q>It is to be conſider'd that in judging of the Lawfulneſs of a Diverſion, I ought not to be concluded by my ſingle Opinion, contrary to the ſenſe of other pious &amp; good People.

ſhou'd have ſome Influence on <hi>my Practice.</hi> Charity obliges me to ſhow to much Regard to the Peace of a Fellow-Chriſtian, as not to grieve him by doing an Action he thinks dipleaſing to GOD, and which might be as well omitted. — And then (he goes on) I wou'd propoſe it to your further Tho'ts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not a Duty to ſtand more upon your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi> than to part with any portion of it, for the ſake of a Diverſion; and whether we ought not to value more the Eſteem of good Chriſtians, than to forfeit it rather than forego the Uſe of our lawful Liberty in a matter of Recreation only.</q>—<q>With all this remember <hi>Paul</hi>'s Exhortation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. where among other marks &amp; characters of thoſe things that he recommends to our practice, this is one, <hi>That they be of good Report</hi>—. Tho' I <hi>defer</hi> not ſo much to <hi>Opinion</hi> &amp; <hi>Custom,</hi> as to think they can alter the intrinſic Nature of Actions; ſo that Vertue ſhall become Vice, or Vice Vertue: yet I can't forbear being of the mind, That an Action in it ſelf indifferent, may become by Accident ſinful, when ſtamp'd with an ill Name by general Suffrage or by a number of Conſcientious Chriſtians.</q>

            <p>But to proceed,—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next place,</hi> The Practice we are reproving, isn't it what your <hi>pious Fore-fathers</hi> were very much Strangers to? <hi>Your ſelves know how ye ought to be followers of them,</hi> who thro' Faith &amp; Patience inherit he Promiſes; to follow them in the Things that are

               <hi>pure &amp; lovely!</hi> But now Judge within your ſelves: Do you not think, in this unhappy Practice, you've widely departed from the Example of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Primitive Times? Do you not ſhew a Spirit very different from that which poſſeſs'd the firſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of GOD's People in this Land? Did They (think you) ſo frequent Drinking-Houſes, and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily trifle away their Evenings there, as many now a-days do? Alas! Are we thus quickly turning out of the good Way, which our Fathers walked in! Do we thus early riſe, &amp; corrupt our Doings! Some of you that give into this Cuſtom, have perhaps had eminently pious Anceſtors, in whoſe Lives no ſuch Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was to be ſeen. And may you not well <hi>bluſh</hi> to think how their Example reproaches you, and what a different Figure (in this regard,) you make from them! Return, we beſeech you, and ſee &amp; ask for the <hi>Old Paths,</hi> the good way, and walk therein, and ye ſhall find reſt for your Souls.</p>

We appeal to you; Has not Conſcience, in ſome moments of ſerious Reflection, and particularly when you have ſometimes heard this Cuſtom borne Teſtimony againſt, by your faithful Reprovers, begun to finite you! And have you not under ſuch Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons entertain'd ſome thought of leaving off the evil Practice; yea &amp; perhaps forborne for a Seaſon? Yet have you not return'd to the old Wont? But <hi>why have ye done this?</hi> Were thoſe inward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rebukes (think ye) from <hi>above,</hi> Fruits of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> or not? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you can't imagine them to be from <hi>beneath,</hi> Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an <hi>Evil</hi> Spirit. The Devil is unqueſtionably more a Friend to the ſinful Cuſtom (in which ſo many are like to be enſnar'd) than to be the Author of thoſe good Diſpoſitions — And if they were (as they muſt needs be) Motions of the Holy Spirit; then conſider, You muſt give an Account to GOD, of the Slights and Affronts you have put upon Him, by <hi>quenching His Spirit,</hi> and reſiſting the Checks &amp; Warnings of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.

However, we will readily allow, that Town-Dwellers may ſometimes find a Conveniency in having a publick Houſe at hand to ſtep into upon Occaſion.

Houſes generally perverted from the true Deſign of them!

            <p>However, Let what Good or Advantage you will, be pretended, by theſe Evening-Interviews at Publick Houſes, we apprehend if matters be duely weighed, that the Evils &amp; Inconveniences &amp; Temptations that attend them, will vaſtly preponderate &amp; more than countervail.

            <p>
               <hi>WHETHER it be Lawful for a Church-Member among us, to be frequently in Taverns</hi>?</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the following <hi>PROPOSITIONS,</hi>
