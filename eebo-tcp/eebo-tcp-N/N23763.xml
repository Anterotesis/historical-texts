            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I SEND herewith, a copy of the Treaty of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Limits, and Navigation, concluded on the 27th of October laſt, between the United States and his Catholic Majeſty. This treaty has been ratified by me, agreeably to the conſtitution; and the ratification has been diſpatched for Spain, where it will doubtleſs be immediately ratified by his Catholic Majeſty.</p>
            <p>This early communication of the treaty with Spain has become neceſſary, becauſe it is ſtipulated, in the third article, that commiſſioners, for running the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary line between the territory of the United States and the Spaniſh colonies of Eaſt and Weſt Florida, ſhall meet at the Natchez, before the expiration of ſix months from the ratification. And as that period will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly arrive before the next meeting of Congreſs, the Houſe will ſee the neceſſity of making proviſion, in their preſent ſeſſion, for the object here mentioned. It will alſo be neceſſary to provide for the expenſe to be incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in executing the twenty-firſt article of the treaty, to enable our fellow-citizens to obtain, with as little delay as poſſible, compenſation for the loſſes they have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the capture of their veſſels and cargoes by the ſubjects of his Catholic Majeſty, during the late war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween France and Spain.</p>
            <p>Eſtimates of the monies, neceſſary to be provided, for the purpoſes of this and ſeveral other treaties with foreign nations and the Indian tribes will be laid before you by the proper department.</p>
