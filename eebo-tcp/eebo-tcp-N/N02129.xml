            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And that <hi>this People</hi> have ſadly done ſo, cannot but be own'd by every one who knows any thing of <hi>New-England's firſt Ways,</hi> and has his Mind at all exercis'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern things of this Nature. It is alſo as evident that GOD hath been <hi>reſtifying</hi> againſt our Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp; puniſhing us therefore, in a <hi>Series</hi> of various &amp; very awful Judgments.

               </gap>y, ſo alſo of Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Our Fathers indeed met with their Trials in their day; their GOD did prove and chatted them: But ſtill He was remarkably preſent with them; the Hand of his Mercy, and the Arm of his Power, were often made bare, for their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and <hi>his Salvation was openly ſhewed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002530_0003_0FDB5DD5972D3658"/>not confounded; they cried to him, &amp; were delivered. He anſwered them by terrible things in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> upon their Enemies. They have told us what GOD did for them in their day, in the time of old; and we ſhould ſpeak of it to our Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to thoſe that ſhall come after us, that our Fathers GOD may be exalted.</p>
            <p>BUT as there has been a viſible Alteration in our Carriage to him of later Years, ſo there has been a ſignal Change in the Courſe of his Providence towards us; which may cauſe us to take up this mournful Lamentation, <hi>Oh that it were with us as in</hi> Years <hi>paſt, as in the days <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>NOW that which GOD expects of us is, That we be HUMBLED, that we FEAR,

This</hi> is the Call of the preſent day: Highly reaſonable in it ſelf, and of the laſt Conſequence to us: For it is the only likely Way to obtain the Removal of the Judgments, under which we are languiſhing, and the Return of GOD's Favour to us in which our whole Happineſs is bound up. This the Nature of the Duty, the Commands and Promiſes of GOD in his Word, and the Experiences of the People of GOD do abundantly prove.</p>
            <p>AND <hi>this</hi> is what we are call'd to in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Diſcourſe;</hi> wherein the Nature of this Duty is plainly and fully deſcribed, and, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Motive to it, the fatal Conſequence of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibleneſs under Divine Judgments is awfully repreſented. The <hi>Lecture Day</hi> before that on which it was deliver'd, was turn'd into a day of ſolemn <hi>Faſting &amp; Prayer,</hi> particularly on account of the War, and the Drought which was then prevailing: And the Author well Judg'd it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to follow that day with ſuch a Diſcourſe as this. And I deſire heartily to bleſs GOD who led his Servant into ſuch a Subject, and aſſiſted his Preparations on it; gave the Sermon ſuch Acceptance and Influence in the Delivery, and has inclin'd him to publiſh it.</p>
            <p>IT comes abroad (at the Deſire of ſome pious and well-diſpos'd Perſons who heard it) juſt as it was preach'd; without tranſcribing or altering much: only he has (as he was deſir'd) inlarg'd
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002530_0005_0FDB5DDA7B70F6F8"/>the firſt <hi>Propoſition</hi> under the firſt <hi>Doctrine,</hi> by adding what he deliver'd ſome time ago from the ſame Text on a Faſt-day; which has ſwell'd the Diſcourſe ſomething beyond the Dimenſions of a ſingle Sermou. And tho' I know it was not the deſign of my <hi>dear and worthy Brother,</hi> in asking me to preface this his Sermon, that I ſhould give any <hi>Encomium</hi> of him or his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, which, (as he does not need it from any one, ſo) it would not be decent for me to go about; yet I will take the Liberty to ſay, that as the Subject is important, and very ſeaſonable for this People at this day, ſo it is handled in ſuch a manner as evidently ſhews the Breathings of a pious Spirit, and a hearty Concern for the great Intereſt of this People; and, I think, it cannot fail of being highly acceptable to every true Lover of Religion, and ſincere Friend of our <hi>Zien.</hi> And as to my putting a Preface to it, (which ſome perhaps may think needs an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe) I ſhall only ſay, That this my Brother and I, are not only united in the Bonds of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Intimacy, but in carrying on <hi>alternately</hi> the laſt Turn in the <hi>Thurſday-Lecture:</hi> This made me think with him there would be but a Propriety and Harmony in it, if I ſubmitted to the Deſires of Him, and the Publiſhers, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it to the Preſs with my humble and earn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THIS forty fourth Chapter of his Book, out of which I have taken my Text, begins with an awakning Sermon, which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> preach'd to the Jews in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Wherein the Prophet firſt reminds them of thoſe deſolating Judgments, that were brought upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and upon themſelves. Then he obſerves to them the procuring Cauſe of their Miſeries, <hi>viz.</hi> Their own Wickedneſs. In the next place, he puts them in mind of the Warnings they had had, and the Pains that God had taken with them to bring them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; upbraids them with their former Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in their own Land, and with the fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of it; upbraids them with their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd Impenitency and repeated Idolatries now in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and expoſtulates with them upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs and Madneſs of their Conduct; and finally threa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WHAT may be further needful for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the words, may be given in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctrines that I deſign to treat upon, which are theſe. (1.) GOD expects it of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under his Judgments, that they <hi>humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>walk in his Law.</hi> (2.)

When a People are finally irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamable, GOD <hi>will ſet his Face againſt Them for Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOCT. I. <hi>GOD expects it of a People under his corrective Hand, that they humble themſelves, and fear, and turn their Feet unto His Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, to walk in his Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE are Three comprehenſive Articles of Duty, which might all be profitably expatiated upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002530_0012_0FDB5DEB5AF3B438"/>
PROP. I. <hi>A People under GOD's Judgment's ſhould</hi> humble <hi>Themſelves.</hi> The Complaint in our Text, <hi>They have not humbled themſelves,</hi> ſheweth GOD's Expectation of it from them; and this muſt be founded upon the ſtrongeſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the Demands of his own Law. The Call of GOD to an afflicted People runs in ſuch Language as that, Jam. 4.9, 10. <hi>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your Laughter be turned to Mourning, and your Joy to Heavineſs. Humble your ſelves in the ſight of God.</hi> It is expreſly <hi>required</hi> by many Divine Precepts, that we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves under GOD's Judgments; which ſpeaks it our indiſpenſable Duty. And then the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of things beſpeak it at out hands. The Calamities we are groaning under, do loudly preach to us of the Power of GOD, of his Holineſs and Juſtice, his Diſpleaſure at us for our Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are ſo many grounds and motives of Humiliation. Hence it is but <hi>our reaſonable Service,</hi> and a juſt Comportment with our State and Circumſtances. Moreover this will be our <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Intereſt.</hi> If we are truly humbled, it will diſpoſe us to ſeek to GOD, and to engage in a ſaving, thorow, and laſting work of Reformation; and ſo give ground to hope for, and prepare us to receive the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which GOD has promis'd to a reforming and repenting People. <hi>GOD will not forget the humble;</hi> the Poor of the Flock ſhall truſt in Him: They ſhall truſt in Him, and <hi>ly down in in Safety.</hi> They ſhall <hi>rejoice</hi> in the Holy One of Iſrael, and ſhall <hi>tread down the Haughty under their feet.</hi> When once a People are brought to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002530_0013_0FDB5DECEEC9F378"/>humble themſelves under GOD's Judgments, it bodes Deliverance, and preſages the return of good Times. According to that of the Apoſtle, 1 Pet. 5.5, 6, 7. <hi>Be clothed with humility: for GOD reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble your ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of GOD, that he may exalt you in due time: Caſting all your care upon him, for be careth for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT here the Inquiry ariſes, <hi>What is that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelves,</hi> which GOD expects from a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under the Rebukes of his Providence. To which I anſwer, it implies ſomething inward, in the Heart, and ſomthing external, in the Life.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT may be conſider'd as <hi>internal,</hi> in the Heart; and ſo it implies many gracious Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Actings of Soul. And indeed it is this inward Humiliation, that is principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For GOD looks at the <hi>Heart</hi> chiefly. The Sacrifices of GOD
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.17.</note> are a <hi>broken Spirit,</hi> and a <hi>contrite Heart.</hi> To this Man will I look, ſaith the Lord
<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2.</note>, even to him that is <hi>Poor,</hi> &amp; <hi>of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Spirit.</hi> The Lord ſeeth not as Man ſeeth
<note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7.</note>: for Man looketh on the <hi>outward Aſpearance,</hi> but the Lord looketh on <hi>the Heart.</hi> And if we be not of a humble <hi>Spirit,</hi> we do not truly humble our ſelves <hi>in the ſight of GOD.</hi> To humble our ſelves outwardly, and in the fight of <hi>Men</hi> only, will not ſuffice: we muſt humble ourſelves in the ſight of GOD alſo. The Heart muſt be humbled: and this includes a variety of religious Frames, &amp; devout Affections; which I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſum up in the following heads.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002530_0014_0FDB5DEE53F1AAC8"/>
Firſt, IT implys, as the foundation of it, a deep <hi>Conviction of Guilt,</hi> the fruit of a thorow Self-examination, and impartial Self-judging. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Judgments of GOD, it becomes a People to judge themſelves. We ſhou'd ſearch our Hearts, and try our Ways, to find out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking Evils, that are the unhappy Grounds of GOD's Controverſy with us. GOD expects to hear us inquiring every one, (as in Jer. 8.6.) <hi>What have I done?</hi> We muſt be very accurate, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and thôrôw in this Inquiry; willing to know the worſt of our ſelves, the moſt of our guilt. And wherein we have done Iniquity, our <hi>Hearts</hi> muſt <hi>condemn us,</hi> our Conſciences <hi>accuſe</hi> us, charge upon us our Sins, and read our Doom to us from the Law of GOD.</p>
            <p>IN the next place, being thus convinced and condemn'd in our ſelves, there muſt be a deep <hi>Self-abaſement, Shame,</hi> &amp; <hi>Remorſe</hi> of Conſcience, an holy <hi>Indignation</hi> at our ſelves, and a humble <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to the Will of GOD.</p>
            <p>THERE muſt be a godly <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Self-abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> under the ſenſe of our guilt and vileneſs. As becomes ſelf-condemned Malefactors, we muſt be filled with Shame, and Confuſion, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our Faults.

Knowing every man the plague of his own Heart, we muſt be vile in our own eyes, and as <hi>Job</hi> when he ſaid

            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, there muſt alſo be a godly <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> and <hi>Remorſe</hi> of Conſcience; a ſpirit of holy Mourning, and true Contrition of Heart. This is required. Jer. 2.19. <hi>Know and ſee that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forſaken the Lord thy GOD.</hi> And (as it follows, Chap. 6.26.) <hi>Make thee Mourning, as for an only ſon, most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lamentation.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> after the denial of his Lord, is an Inſtance of this; of whom it is ſaid, Mat. 26.75. <hi>He went out, and wept bitterly.</hi> And now the Call of GOD to us, to every one of us, is in the words of our Saviour (Luk. 10.37.) <hi>Go, and do thou likewiſe.</hi> It was propheſy'd of ſome, Ezek. 7.16. <hi>They ſhall be like Doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his Iniquity.</hi> The Apoſtle gives that Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (2 Epiſt. 7.9, &amp;c) <hi>Ye ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed to Repentance; ye ſorrowed after a godly ſort. For godly ſorrow worketh Repentance unto Salvation
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002530_0016_0FDB5DF458BF3868"/>not to be repented of.</hi> Such penitent Mourners muſt <hi>we</hi> be, if we wou'd approve our ſelves truly humbled. Our Sorrow muſt be inward and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feign'd. We muſt be pricked at the Heart; our Spirits wounded; our Souls melted into peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Tears. Joel 2.12, 13. <hi>Now ſaith the Lord, Turn ye even to Me with all your Heart, and with faſting, and with weeping, and with mourning: and rent your Heart &amp; not your Garments.</hi> We muſt afflict our Souls: our Hearts muſt be rent and broke with a mighty ſenſe of Sin, and as 'twere ground to pieces with a prevaling Sorrow: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at a time when we are bewailing not only our own perſonal Sins, but alſo the Sins of others and of the Land, our Hearts muſt indeed be <hi>full.</hi> A great &amp; deep Sorrow becomes us, proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the grounds and occaſions of grief that are before us, and which are (alas) at this day how very plentiful! Very numerous, and great! Yet the mournful Penitent muſt keep his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Paſſions within due Bounds; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the Apoſtle's Caution, 2 Cor. 2.7. <hi>Leſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſuch a one ſhould be ſwallowed up with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Sorrow.</hi> — And as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Sorrow muſt be hearty and deep, ſo it muſt be <hi>univerſal</hi> and <hi>impartial.</hi> Indeed if it have the former Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, it will have the latter. We muſt mourn after this godly ſort for <hi>all</hi> our Sins: We muſt not flatter any favorite Vices in our ſelves. While we pretend to humble our ſelves for one Sin, (a Sin, which perhaps thrô ſatiety, or ſome evil effects felt, is become grievous and irkſome to us) we muſt not rejoice in another, that is more agreeable to our Humour, or appears
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002530_0017_0FDB5DF91DC6F490"/>to be more for our worldly Advantage; as it may be the manner of ſome is. No, but we muſt repent of <hi>all</hi> our Sins, without any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our Hearts muſt be broken for, and broken off from our moſt beloved Luſts. — And as there muſt be no Partiality, with reference to our own Sins, ſo neither as to the Sins of <hi>Others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Each (ſays one) muſt mourn the Sins common to all; and the groſs Treſpaſſes of each ſort muſt be bewailed by every ſort.</q> Ezek. 9.5. <hi>Set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that ſigh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midſt thereof.</hi> We muſt bewail all the Sins of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milys; all the Sins of the Town and Land we live in, and of the Nation we belong to. No conſideration of Intereſt may bias us to tenderneſs in any point, to ſpare any particular Sin, and except it out of our Lamentations. No pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reverence to our Fore-fathers, or to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of our Rulers or Miniſters; no regard to the Intereſt of any ſort of Men, or to the Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Cuſtom of the multitude, nor fondneſs for a Party, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to have any Influence in the matter. We muſt not <hi>cover</hi> the Sins of others, any more than our own. No ſiniſter Views, no private Affections, or the like, may leſſen our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of their Miſcarriages, or diſpoſe us to palliate, and excuſe, or extenuate them. Hear in what ſtrains the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> bewails the publick Guilt. Dan. 9, 7, 8. <hi>O Lord, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs belongeth unto Thee: but unto us Confuſion of face, as at this day! to the Men of Judah, and to the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and unto all Iſrael that are near, and that are afar off: to our Kings,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002530_0018_0FDB5DFB2ACDB7C8"/>to our Princes, and to our Fathers; becauſe we have ſinned againſt Thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now in conſequence of this Shame and Sorrow for Sin, there muſt be an holy <hi>Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> at ourſelves. We muſt conceive a Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at our ſelves, like the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Penitents, in whom the Apoſtle commends this Self Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as a fruit and argument of their godly Sorrow. 2 Cor. 7.11. <hi>Behold, this ſelf-ſame thing that ye ſorrowed after a godly ſort, what carefulneſs it wrought in you; yea, what clearing of your ſelves; yea, what Indignation; — yea, what Revenge!</hi> If we are truly penitent, our Hearts will be hot within us, in reſentment of our Follies: a holy, Anger at our ſelves will kindle in our Breaſts, and Conſcience will ſtir up it ſelf to ſcourge and ſmite us.</p>
            <p>FURTHER MORE, where there is a true Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation under GOD's Hand, there will be a chearful <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to his Will in all the afflictive Diſpenſations that befall us. This is made one ſign and character of a due Humiliation, Lev. 26.41. <hi>If then their uncircumciſed Hearts be humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and they then accept of the Puniſhment of their Iniquity; then will I remember my Covenant with Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. &amp;c.</hi> So Lam. 3.27, &amp;c. <hi>It is good for a Man, that he hear the yoke in his youth. He ſitteth alone, and keepeth ſilence, becauſe he hath born it upon him. He putteth his mouth in the duſt, if ſo be there may be Hope.</hi> Ezek. 16.63. <hi>That thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more; becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified toward thee, for all that thou baſt done, ſaith the Lord.</hi> We muſt never open our mouths
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002530_0019_0FDB5DFCDA51D2D0"/>in any way of Murmuring or Complaint. We muſt not ſtout and brave it againſt GOD; nor exalt our ſelves againſt the Lord, and deſpiſe his Chaſtnings, and ſtrive with our Maker; as they did, of whom we read, Iſa. 9.9, 10. They <hi>ſay in the pride and ſtoutneſs of heart. The Bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn ſtones: the Sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into Cedars.</hi> Far from us be ſuch a Spirit and Carriage. The Temper &amp; Conduct of holy <hi>Job</hi> becomes us in all our Afflictions, who ſaid (Chap. 40.4.) <hi>Behold, I am vile! What ſhall I anſwer Thee? I will lay my hand upon my Mouth.</hi> So the Pſalmiſt ſaid (Pſal. 39.9) <hi>I was dumb; I opened not my mouth: becauſe Thou didſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as there muſt be a meek &amp; patient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to GOD under all his dealings with us; ſo where there is this, there will (and ought to) be <hi>a thankful Notice</hi> taken of the <hi>Mercies</hi> mixed with Divine Judgments and a due ſenſe of our own Unworthineſs. That will be the humble diſpoſition and Language of our Souls, Ezr. 9.13 <hi>After all that is come upon us, for our evil Deeds, Thou our God haſt puniſhed us leſs than our Iniquities deſerve.</hi> And (Gen. 32.10.) <hi>I am not worthy of the least of all the Mercies, and of all the Truth, which thou bast ſhewed unto thy ſervant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN a word, there will alſo be the exerciſe of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> in GOD, through Jeſus Chriſt, for the Pardon of Sin, the removal of the Grounds of GOD's Controverſy with us, and putting a happy Period unto it.

It is good that a Man ſhould both hope and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly wait for the Salvation of GOD. Truſt in the Lord at all times, O ye People, pour out your Hearts before Him: GOD is a Refuge for us, through Jeſus Chriſt. Fly for refuge, to lay hold on the Hope ſet before you.

THUS I have mention'd ſome of thoſe <hi>inward Affections</hi> and Graces which are imply'd in the Humiliation requir'd. We muſt thus put on humbleneſs of <hi>Mind.

            <p>THUS, It implys proper Acts of <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Self denial.</hi> There muſt be a kind of pious Self-revenge, and Self-affliction for Sin. We muſt inflict proper Severities upon our ſelves, in a way of juſt Correction for our follies. I do not here mean any ſuch abſurd Diſcipline, as the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Penances, the going on a Pilgrimage, the macerating our Fleſh unreaſonably, the mutila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wounding, or whipping of our Bodys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet I mean a treating our Bodys (the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Sin) with ſomething of Auſterity, as well as an afflicting our Souls by a more ſpiritual and rational Diſcipline. We muſt labour to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify the Fleſh, to mortify the Members that are upon the Earth, that the Body of Sin may be deſtroy'd, that hence forth we may not ſerve Sin. We muſt endeavour to pluck out the right eye, and to cut off the right hand; muſt deny our ſelves, and take up our Croſs; abridge our ſelves of many lawful Gratifications, as well as of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002530_0022_0FDB5E076BE1A098"/>all ſinful Extravagances. The Apoſtle commends ſuch a Conduct in the <hi>Corinithians</hi> (among other things) as a fruit and argument of their true Repentance. Forecited 2 Cor. 7.11. <hi>Behold, this ſelf-ſame thing that ye ſorrowed after a godly ſort, what Carefulneſs it wrought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So ſhou'd we on our ſelves by ſolemn Faſtings and Watchings, and by a daily courſe of Abſtinence, Self denials, and Mortifications. In a time of public Judgments, if a People wou'd humble themſelves aright, it becomes them to obſerve many ſolemn Days of Faſting and Humiliation. That is the Call of GOD to them, Joel 1.14. <hi>Sanctiſy ye a faſt, call a ſolemn aſſembly, gather the elders, and all the inhabitants of the land into the houſe of the Lord your GOD, and cry unto the Lord.</hi> And as it follows in the next Chapter, <hi>Turn to the Lord with all your Heart, and with Faſting, &amp; with Weeping, and with Mourning.</hi> Thus <hi>Joſiah</hi> humbled himſelf, 2 Chron. 34.27. <hi>Thine Heart was tender, and thou didst humble thy ſelf before GOD, and didſt rend thy clothes and weep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</hi> So we read of <hi>Ninevites,</hi> (Jon. 3.5, 6.) <hi>So the people of Nineveh believed GOD, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a faſt, and put on ſackloth, from the greateſt of them even to the leaſt of them.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002530_0023_0FDB5E0A209650D0"/>general practice among ſuch a People. In the day of Trouble we thou'd deny our ſelves in the uſe of many lawful Liberties; retrench our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſtary expences; and lay aſide our Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; cloth our ſelves with Humility, and be modeſt and lowly in our whole Appearance. Surely it very ill becomes a <hi>Poor</hi> and an <hi>Afflicted</hi> People to affect Gaiery &amp; Pomp in their Apparel, Luxury at their Tables, Mirth and Jollity, and great Delicacy of Living, or the like. Hear how the Prophet complains of and rebukes this in GOD's People of old, Iſa. 22.12, 13. <hi>In that day did the Lord GOD of Hoſts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE, the Humiliation requir'd implies a due <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of our Sins to GOD. There muſt be a moſt hearty Confeſſion of Sin, in all the Inſtances, and in all the Aggravations of it; an open and ingenuous and full Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of our Offenſes unto GOD. This is every where in Scripture repreſented as the Duty of an afflicted People, and the Property of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging Penitents. Lev. 26.40, 41. <hi>If they ſhall

SUCH a Fear there ought to be in us at all times, and particularly under the Divine Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Iſai. 8.13. <hi>Sanctify the Lord of Hoſts Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and let Him he your Fear, and let Him be your Dread.</hi> Where there is a due Humiliation, there will be this godly Fear: and where there is ſuch a Humiliation &amp; Fear, there will be the laſt thing in the Text, as the Effect thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; Obedience. But this brings me to the other Propoſition.</p>
            <p>PROP. III. A People under the Divine Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould <hi>turn their Feet unto God's Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to walk in His Law.</hi> In the day of Adverfity we ſhou'd conſider: Confider GOD, and be afraid: conſider our ſelves, and be abaſed: conſider our ways, and repent: conſider GOD's Statutes, and turn our feet unto His Teſtimonies: conſider our profeſſed Humiliation, and bring forth Fruit meet for Repentance; for ſaking the Sins we pretend a ſhame and ſorrow for: conſider the Vows we make in the time of our Diſtreſs, and ſet our ſelves daily to perform them: conſider the Calls of Providence, and hear the Rod, and turn at GOD's Reproof; who chaſtens us for our Profit, that we may be made Partakers of His Holineſs, and who expects that we be reformed by theſe Things. If we are indeed humbled, this will be one ſpeedy and viſible Effect. Where there is a broken Heart, there will be a reformed Life.

The <hi>Fear</hi> of the Lord is to depart from Evil: and this is the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD, that we keep His Commandments. — Deut. 10.12. <hi>And now Iſrael, What doth the Lord thy GOD require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy GOD, to walk in all his ways, and to love Him, and to ſerve the Lord thy GOD with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul?</hi> So Mic. 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with thy GOD?</hi> This is what GOD calls us to by his Judgments: and the Promiſe of Salvation is ſuſpended on this Condition, 2 Chro. 7.14. <hi>If my People which are called by my Name, ſhall</hi> humble <hi>themſelves, and pray &amp; ſeek my Face,</hi> and turn from their wicked Ways; <hi>then I will hear from Heaven, &amp; will forgive their Sin, and will beal their Land.</hi>

            <p>WE ſee then what is the Duty and Buſineſs of the <hi>preſent Day.</hi> We in this Place &amp; Land are an afflicted People, groaning under a variety of awful Judgments. And from the Premiſſes, we may learn what Tempers and Deportments

O that we may be found ſuch! Let us every one perſonally humble our ſelves, and fear, &amp; reform and be obedient. And then in our ſeveral places lay out our ſelves to promote ſuch a Diſpoſition and Conduct in all about us. This wou'd be a ſure Token for Good, and afford the moſt defirable Prognoſtick of a happy Change of Times approaching.

They love Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds are evil. Their Hearts are fully ſet in them to do Evil, and they go on frowardly in the ways of their own Eyes. And if any one ſtand in their way, to check them in their wild Career, they take it heinouſly. They ſay to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers, <hi>Get you out of the way,</hi> and let us alone. Sometimes they banter, and ſcorn, and deride them. Sometimes they brow-beat, and hector, and revile them, They lift their Horn on high, and ſpeak with a ſtiff Neck. They ſwell and rage, they huff and threaten. <hi>Amaziah</hi> is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this; who being reproved by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, it came to paſs as he talked with him, that the King ſaid unto him, <hi>Art thou made of the King's Counſel?

Thus wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> took <hi>Micaiah,</hi> (who had propheſy'd Evil of him) and put him in Priſon, there to be fed with Bread of Affliction, and with water of Affliction. And good <hi>Aſa</hi> himſelf was once wroth with <hi>Hanani</hi> the Seer, for reproving him, and he put him in a Priſon-houſe; for he was in a Rage with him, becauſe of this thing. And thus the <hi>Jews</hi> deviſed Devices againſt <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and ſmote him with the Tongue, and digged a Pit for his Soul, and hid Snares for his Feet.</p>
            <p>THESE are ſome of the <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of an unhumbled Spirit &amp; rebellious Heart: which are too often viſible among a People under Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

            <p>BUT this is not <hi>always</hi> the Caſe even where a People may be ſaid to be unhumbled.

And yet after all, there is nothing but the thin ſhadow of a Faſt; nothing but the empty Appearance of Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nothing but the bare Promiſe of Reformation.

He compaſſes our Path; He trys our Hearts, and weighs our Actions. He obſerves Men's Conduct at all times, in all places, and under all his dealings with them. Particularly, he obſerves how they carry it under his <hi>Rod;</hi> what their Tempers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments are; whether they are duly humbled
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002530_0041_0FDB5E30A112C430"/>for their Sins; whether they are afraid of his Judgments; whether they turn from their evil Doings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He takes notice if they neglect theſe things. If they are impenitent, obſtinate, and irreclaimable, he marks it againſt them. He critically obſerves this Miſconduct in a People in general, and in every Perſon in particular. His Eye is upon every one of whatever Rank, Age, or Condition; taking an exact notice of their Thoughts, Words, and Actions under his Afflicting Hand, &amp; noting all down in His Book of Remembrance.</p>
            <p>NOW this <hi>O ſervation</hi> is in order to <hi>Judgment</hi> upon their Conduct, and the ſuting GOD's fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſpenſations to their Caſe. For He does not act therein as a careleſs, indifferent Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Human Affairs, but as the Lord &amp; Judge of the World. Hence we read, Jer. 17.10. <hi>I the Lord ſearch the Heart, I try the Reins, even to give to every man according to his ways, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fruit of his doings.</hi> The Lord is a GOD of Judgment. He is righteous in all his ways, and all his Works are done in Wiſdom. He concerts the beſt methods for managing his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Government, and be ordinarily obſerves a Rule in his Diſpenſations towards a People. Infinite Wiſdom and Juſtice proportions the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to the Provocation, ſo that commonly a People's Sufferings are greater or leſſer accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the kind and degree of their Sins. Now in order to this, a right Judgment muſt be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on Men: and to this an accurate Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them is neceſſary. Hence GOD is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as taking the moſt critical obſervation of

            <p n="1">1. GOD will <hi>ſet His Face against them.</hi> It imply's Reſentment and Diſpleaſure in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative degree.

He will withdraw his directing and protecting Preſence, and no more be their Guide or Guard: his ſanctifying Preſence, and will take away his holy Spirit from them: his Symbolical Preſence (in the end) and will take away his Kingdom from among them, remove their Candleſtick out of its place, and put out their Light in obſcure Darkneſs.</p>

When they faſt, He will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, and when they offer an Oblation, He will not accept them; for he remembreth their Iniquity, that they loved to wander, and would not return from their ways; They refuſed to hearken, and pulled away the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſtopped their Ears that they ſhould not hear. Yea, they made their hearts as an Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant-Stone, leſt they ſhou'd hear the Law: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is now come to paſs, that as GOD cried, and they would not hear; ſo when they cry, He will not hear.

2. HE will ſet his Face againſt them <hi>for Evil.</hi> He will not only withdraw his Favour from them, but will pour out his Indignation upon them. He will not only reject their Prayers, and deny them an Anſwer of <hi>Peace:</hi> but will anſwer them in <hi>terrible things</hi> by Righteouſneſs. His Heart is turned from them, &amp; his Preſence gone, which is the Safety and Happineſs, the Strength and Glory of a People. His Face is ſet againſt them, and Wo to them that are in ſuch a Caſe. Who knoweth the power of his Anger? It is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to fall into the hands of the living GOD. When GOD is angry with a People, &amp; cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth his Fury to reſt on them, all manner of Evils will break in upon them, as a Flood, or as a conſuming Fire. When GOD ſets his face againſt a People, &amp; forſakes them, Iniquity will abound more and more, until Wrath comes upon them to the uttermoſt. Their miſery will be great upon them; and the very Bleſſings that may be ſpared to them for a while, will be turn'd into Curſes, and become a Snare to them.</p>
            <p>IF a People are finally impenitent, GOD <hi>will</hi> thus ſet his face againſt them for Evil. He may bear long with them, but he will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. He is a GOD gracious, and longſuffering: but if his Patience be abus'd, and his Grace turned into wantonneſs, it will kindle his Anger,' &amp; he will puniſh at laſt. If a profeſſing People forſake the Lord, then he will turn, and will do them Hurt, after that he has done them Good; and if they finally forſake GOD, He will be angry with them till he conſume them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</p>

THAT GOD <hi>will</hi> thus ſet his Face againſt a People for Evil, if they are obſtinately impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>appears</hi> from the many awful <hi>Threatnings</hi> in the Word of Truth.

               </q> Thus GOD threaten'd the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation of old. And in like manner he threaten'd <hi>Iſrael's</hi> evil <hi>Neighbours,</hi> the Heathen Nations bordering upon <hi>Judea,</hi> as in Jer. 12.17. <hi>If they will not diligently learn the Ways of my People to ſwear by my Name, I will utterly pluck up, and deſtroy that Nation, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And it ſeems to be a ſtanding Law of his Providential Government, that, Jer. 18.9, 10. <hi>At what time I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, or a Kingdom, to build and to plant it: If it do Evil in my ſight, that it obey not my Voice, then I will repent of the Good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit them.</hi> And a like Text we have relating to Goſpel-times, Iſa. 60.12. <hi>The Nation and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that Will not ſerve Thee</hi> [or will not ſubmit to Chriſt's Sceptre] <hi>ſhall be utterly wasted.</hi> — Now GOD is <hi>true,</hi> that hath thus threatned. <hi>Hath He ſaid it, and will He not do it?</hi> Yea ſurely; tho' the Sentence be not ſpeedily execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet it ſhall not always be delay'd. Tho' He be ſlow to Anger, yet He will be true to His Threatnings, and not one Iota of them ſhall fail.</p>
            <p>WE may confirm this Argument from the many known <hi>Examples</hi> of Divine Vengeance. There have been ſad and lamentable Inſtances of a People's being ruin'd by their Iniquity, and Provoking GOD to Anger, till He has ſet his
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002530_0047_0FDB5E3E98BF1158"/>face againſt them to deſtroy them. Many Citys and Countries, that were once lifted up to Heaven, have long ſince been bro't into Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their Sins. Great <hi>Babylon,</hi> which in its day, was the wonder of the World, the glory of Kingdoms, has long ſince been totally and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably deſtroy'd, as when GOD over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rew Sodom &amp; Gomorrha. So <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that was the Beauty of <hi>Jadea</hi> &amp; the Joy of the whole Earth, The place which GOD once choſe for his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, where he had his Temple; and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Tribes went up, the Tribes of the Lord unto the Teſtimony of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> where were ſet Thrones of Judgment, the Thrones of the Houſe of <hi>David;</hi> within whoſe walls were Peace, and Proſperity in all her Palaces; a Place (if any ever in the world) lift up to Heaven; yet even this place is long ago ſunk down to Hell, laid deſolate, bury'd and loſt. The Jewiſh Nation, for crucifying the Lord of Glory, were rejected of GOD from being any more his People, and their City, and Land made an utter Deſolation. And the like Fate has befallen many places fince, that in the early ages of Chriſtianity were flouriſhing &amp; populous. Many famous <hi>Churches,</hi> that were once the beauty and glory of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, are long ſince for their Apoſtaſy and Impenitence, reduced to Shame and Ruin; become the Habitations of Cruelty, the Seats of Barbarity, &amp; Idolatry, &amp; are pin'd away in their Iniquitys. — Now theſe <hi>Examples</hi> do read loud Lectures to us upon our <hi>Text,</hi> and afford clear Conviction of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rine before us. And we may expect that GOD will <hi>deal alike</hi> with <hi>others</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:002530_0048_0FDB5E454A112600"/>that are <hi>alike guilty.</hi> For GOD ſeems to have one Rule of dealing with a profeſſing People, and the Meaſures of Providence are uſually the ſame. Indeed, He reſerves a Sovereign Liberty to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to the Circumſtances of his Diſpenſations, in which there is often a Variety. Some have gentler diſcipline than others; ſome have a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſpace to repent, than others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However, in the general, there is one ſtated Rule, according to which GOD in his Providence impartially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, eſpecially with a profeſſing People. Hence He ſends backſliding <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſelf-ruin'd <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh,</hi> to view his Judgments there upon his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious People; and puts them in mind of the Ruin of the <hi>Ten Tribes:</hi> that by comparing Caſes, they might draw proper Concluſions for their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Conviction. As we have it, Jer. 7.12—15. <hi>Go ye unto my place, which was in</hi> Shiloh, <hi>where I ſet my name at the firſt, and ſee what I did to it, for the wickedneſs of my people Iſrael. And now, becauſe ye have done all theſe works, ſaith the Lord, — Therefore will I do unto</hi> you— <hi>as I have done to Shiloh. And I will cast you out of my ſight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole ſeed of Ephraim.</hi>—All theſe Judgments <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to them for Enſamples:</hi> And the Record of them was made for <hi>our Learning and Admonition,</hi> upon whom the Ends of the World are come. As one ſaith, <q>GOD writes his ſevere Truths with the <hi>Blood</hi> of his diſobedient Subjects, and makes their ruinous Heaps to proclaim Knowledge and Counſil to the reſt of the World. <hi>Sodom's</hi> Aſhes, <hi>Shiloh's</hi> Fire, <hi>Jeruſalem's</hi> Deſolation, are Uſes of Inſtruction &amp; Warning to all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002530_0049_0FDB5E4639EA6E68"/>of the Earth.</q> 
               <hi>They</hi> fell by their Iniquity, and ſuch as tread in their wicked ſteps, may expect to fall by the like Judgments. <q>For GOD is uniform, and of a piece with Himſelf in his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Proceedings. 'Tis a Rule of Juſtice, <hi>Ut Parium par ſit Ratio;</hi>
               </q> That the equally guilty ſhou'd be puniſh'd alike. Luk. 13.3. <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, as to the <hi>Reaſons</hi> and Foundations of GOD's judicial proceedings with any People, eſpecially a profeſſing People, they ſeem to be very clear &amp; obvious. The <hi>Honour</hi> of his own Name calls for ſuch a Conduct towards an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent People. His Glory is eſpecially concern'd in the matter; the Glory of his Holineſs, and of his Faithfulneſs, and Wiſdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſeems bound in Honour to thoſe Attributes, to witneſs againſt the Apoſtacys of his People, by inflicting Judgments upon them. Otherwiſe His Name will peculiarly ſuffer by their Wickedneſs and Impenitence. Hence He tells Iſrael of old, Amos 3.2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Families of the earth: therefore I will puniſh you for all your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN a word, The Honour of Divine <hi>Juſtice</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the puniſhing a ſinful People, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, if finally impenitent. Will not the Judge of all the Earth do right? Is there any Iniquity with GOD? Will he not render to every Man according to his Work? And to every Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple according to the fruit of their Doings? Verily He will render a Reward to the Proud. There is no Unrighteouſneſs in Him. As He is oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in Juſtice, He will not let a rebellious People goun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſh'd.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002530_0050_0FDB5E4796A65AE8"/>Indeed as to <hi>Individuals</hi> or particular Perſons, there may poſſibly be ſome Exceptions, during the preſent State: Some Sinners may have almoſt all their Puniſhment reſerv'd to the future World: But if we conſider Men as united in <hi>Society,</hi> and making up diſtinct Provinces, Kingdoms and Nations, we ſhall find the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of God's Providence towards them is vaſtly different in this particular. <hi>National Guilts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer National Judgments.</hi> God exerciſes a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over Men, as they coaleſce into diſtinct Communities Pſal. 22.28. <hi>For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is the governour among the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> And his Government is infinitely wiſe, and good, and juſt, and holy. He governs them by Law and Rule: And He judges them according to their doings. Now methinks, we muſt have very odd notions of Things, if we imagine that human <hi>Societies,</hi> as ſuch, have any reference to the future State, or can be judged in another World. Hence, if ever God puniſh them, it muſt be in the preſent State. Divine Juſtice ſeems more concern'd then to puniſh <hi>Nations,</hi> than <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> in the Life that now is.</p>
            <p>GOD <hi>can</hi> puniſh whole Nations as eaſily as particular Perſons. He has National Judgments; Puniſhments of a publick Aſpect and general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. And if a People fin, they lay themſelves open to ſuch Judgments. And if they are finally impenitent, Divine Juſtice calls a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oud for their utter Deſtruction. When a People are obſtinate and irreclamable, after a long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me of Trial and much waiting upon them, God repreſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as weary with repenting, and oblig'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002530_0051_0FDB5F1993A64600"/>to their Deſtruction. Jer. 15.5, 6. <hi>For who ſhall have pity upon thee, O Jeruſalem? or who ſhall bemoan thee? or who ſhall go aſide to ask how thou doest? Thou haſt forſaken me, ſaith the Lord, thou art gone backward: therefore will I ſtretch out my hand againſt thee, and deſtroy thee: I am weary with repenting.</hi>—He may <hi>very juſtly</hi> do ſo. For exceeding aggravated is the Provocation that ſuch a People offer unto God; very great the Affronts they put upon Him. It is the higheſt Inſtance of <hi>Stubborneſs</hi> and Rebellion againſt God, to be incorrigible, and unhumbled, under very humbling Diſpenſations, and not afraid of the Conſequence. It is in effect a <hi>bidding Defiance</hi> to God, a challenging his Vengeance to do it's ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. 'Tis the higheſt <hi>Inſolence</hi> and Contempt of God, and muſt needs be extremely provoking to Him. He may well therefore ſet his Face againſt ſuch a Rebellious People. Shall not God viſit ſuch a Nation as this?</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, It <hi>defeats the Deſign</hi> of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in afflictive Diſpenſations. The great End ordinarily is to bring a People to Repentance: and for this purpoſe, Divine Judgments are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily for a long while temper'd with much Mercy, that by the Goodneſs of God we may be led to Repentance. It his method to try a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by leſs and lighter Judgments at firſt; and if theſe are ineffectual, he brings greater and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier. And if after all they will walk contrary to God, and will not be reformed by theſe Things, but defeat his gracious Deſign by a perſevering Impenitence; how reaſonably, how juſtly may his abuſed Patience turn into flaming Indignation?
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002530_0052_0FDB5E4D199679E0"/>His Anger may well burn againſt them, and his Fury be pour'd out like Fire, to conſume them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly! <hi>When a People have out-ſtood all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Reformation, they are completely ripe for Ruin.</hi> They have fill'd up the meaſure of their Iniquity: they have provoked GOD to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.

            <p>BUT now to <hi>apply</hi> this Doctrine in a few Hims.</p>
            <p>USE 1. <hi>THIS affords a ſad</hi> Progn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſtick <hi>to a People that have</hi> long <hi>continu'd</hi> Impenitent <hi>under a Courſe of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ictive Diſpenſations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT tells us, They are like to have the bleſſed GOD ſet his Face againſt them. If they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd upon Sinning, He is reſolv'd upon Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. GOD is jealous, and the Lord revengeth: the Lord will take Vengeance on his Adverſaries, and He reſerveth Wrath for his Enemies. Tho' He be ſlow to Anger; yet He will not at all acquit the Wicked. How miſerable then are a People, ſecure and ſtupid under many Judgments, like to be in the Iſſue! They muſt expect the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance and Aggravation of their Calamities. There's no proſpect of any Period to their Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; unleſs GOD is pleas'd to have done ſtriving with them: and that is the moſt
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002530_0053_0FDB5E4E5A2EC628"/>formidable Judgment in the World. Indeed ſometimes Sovereign Divine Grace is exalted and triumphs in the Converſion of a Perſon or a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, after they have long ſtood it out againſt all means. Iſai. 57.17, 18. <hi>I was wroth &amp; ſmote him; I hid me and was wroth: and be went on frowardly in the way of his heart. I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him.</hi> But this is an extraordinary Caſe. If we conſider the common Courſe of Providence, and the conſtant Tenour of the Covenant, They both (with united voices) read Lectures of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and ſpeak ſadly, to ſuch a People. From hence <hi>We</hi> may learn, <hi>What we have to fear,</hi> if we do not repent, and turn to GOD. We have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and GOD hath a Controverſy with us: Tho' hitherto he has dealt very tenderly &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionately with us; in wrath remembring Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But if we go on ſtill in our Treſpaſſes, we muſt expect GOD will heap on us more ſevere and heavy Judgments, than ever yet we have felt. We may expect fearful Tragedies to be acted on the Stage, before GOD has performed His work, whether it be of Mercy or of Vengeance.</p>
            <p>USE 2. <hi>WHAT has been ſaid may help to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for thoſe dark Appearances of Providence, wherein GOD ſeems to be ſetting his Face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this People, at this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are fallen by our Iniquity: GOD has viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our Sins upon us from time to time, by Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, by epidemical Sickneſſes, by War in our Borders, Piracies at Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By various Judgments we have many times been brought low. And how are our common Calamities grown &amp; aggravated
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002530_0054_0FDB5E4FD735B238"/>at this day! It is in many reſpects a time of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Trouble. It is particularly a day of <hi>Battel &amp; War,</hi> wherein we are frequently made to bleed by the Sword of the Wilderneſs: and a ſcorching ſeaſon, wherein GOD is with-holding the <hi>Rain</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and making the Rain of our Land powder and duſt. Our diſtreſs &amp; perplexity is great on theſe accounts, and others. And GOD ſeems to be threatning us with greater Calamities. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Aſpects of Providence upon us in our moſt important Intereſts, how frowning are they! Above all the too ſenſible Withdraw of the Spirit of GOD from among us, affords the moſt awful Symptom, that GOD is ſetting his Face againſt us.</p>
            <p>AND what is the ground of all? Why, <hi>becauſe we are not humbled, even to this day.</hi> The People turneth not to Him that ſmiteth them: and therefore his Anger is not turned away, but his Hand is ſtretched out ſtill; notwithſtanding the many days of Humiliation we have ſolemnized. I deſire to lay my hand on my own Breaſt in the firſt place: but ſuffer me to ſay, Doubtleſs we have <hi>in general</hi> too much reaſon to condemn our ſelves, as the faulty Cauſes of our own Diſtreſſes: It is becauſe we are ſtill unreform'd, that GOD will not put an End to his Controverſy with us.</p>
            <p>USE 3. <hi>LET us ſee &amp; admire the Patience of GOD towards us in this Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O the Riches of the Patience, &amp; Forbearance of GOD; who, tho' He has not ſuffer'd us to go unpuniſht, yet has <hi>debated with us in meaſure,</hi> and <hi>stay'd his Rough Wind</hi> in the day of the Eaſt Wind.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:002530_0055_0FDB5E54C754E078"/>A great many Mercies have been mingled with his Judgments. He hath not rewarded us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Iniquities. He hath not in anger ſhut up his Bowels, but is long-ſuffering to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not willing that we ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance. Indeed He is awfully contending with us by various Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, avenging the Quarrel of his violated Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and is making progreſs in his Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy with us: yet He takes but very ſlow Steps, and makes many Pauſes, giving us a <hi>Space to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and <hi>waiting to be gracious.</hi> Surely He is a GOD ſlow to Anger, long-ſuffering, and abundant in Goodneſs &amp; Mercy. Surely it is of the Lord's Mercy, that we are not conſumed. O let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize the Divine Lenity &amp; Forbearance towards us, and give to GOD the Glory of his infinite Patience.</p>
            <p>USE 4. WHAT has been ſaid <hi>warns us to beware of continu'd Impenitency, and calls upon us to humble our ſelves in the ſight of GOD,</hi> leſt He be provoked to abandon us utterly.</p>
            <p>RETURN thou backſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe my Anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, and I will not keep Anger for ever. Turn, O backſliding Children! Circumciſe your Hearts to the Lord, leſt my Fury come forth like Fire, and burn that none can quench it, becauſe of the Evil of your Doings, ſaith the Lord. Be ye not ſtiff-necked, but yield your ſelves unto GOD, that the Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Wrath may turn away from you. He will not turn away his Face, if ye return unto
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002530_0056_0FDB5E5755404308"/>Him. He will not hide Himſelf for ever. O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, waſh thine Heart from Wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved. <hi>How long ſhall thy vain Thoughts lodge within thee? How long wilt thou refuſe to humble thy ſelf before me,</hi> ſaith the Lord. How long will this People provoke Me? Do they provoke Me to Anger, ſaith the Lord! Do they not provoke themſelves <hi>to the Confuſion of their own Faces!</hi> Do ye provoke the Lord to Jealouſy! Are ye ſtronger than He! O fooliſh People, and unwiſe! Shall Briars and Thorns be ſet in array againſt devouring Fire! Verily He is a jealous GOD, with whom we have to do, and He is a ſtrong Lord. Who knoweth the power of his Wrath? Who can ſtand before Him, when once He is angry? Why then ſhould we incenſe him yet more, by a perſevering Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency!

But if we continue unhumbled, we muſt expect more ſevere and terrible Diſpenſations of his Wrath. O why then ſhould we any longer harden our Hearts! Have we not ſmarted enough already! Why ſhould we oblige Him to inflict heavier Judgments upon us! O let us not be ſo egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly fooliſh! Remember, Divine Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are ordinarily <hi>Progreſſive,</hi> and do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly riſe in proportion to a Peoples Guilt.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002530_0057_0FDB5E58F92597C8"/>And ſhould we not tremble then to think of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſtill in our Provocations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Verily GOD hath not yet done with us. He hath not ſhot all his Arrows yet: the worſt are ſtill behind: and <hi>there ſeems to be a ſharp and terrible one at this day upon the String!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O let us then fall down at GOD's feet, and humble our ſelves, and cry mightily to Him, and turn every one from his evil way. Who can tell if GOD will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce Anger, that we periſh not! O let us not dare GOD, and force him to take more rigorous Methods with us. It is high time for us to awake out of our carnal Sleep; to look about us, and ſee if there is any way to eſcape, that we be not conſumed. O let us make Haſt, and not delay; but as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, To day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts. Be thou inſtructed, O Jeruſalem, leſt my Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Thee; leſt I make thee deſolate, a Land not inhabited. Who is He that will love Life, and ſee good Days? Let him eſchew Evil, and do Good. For the Eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous, and his Ears are open unto their Prayers: but <hi>the Face of the LORD is againſt them that do Evil.</hi>
