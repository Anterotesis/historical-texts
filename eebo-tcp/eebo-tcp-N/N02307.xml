            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter we have holy <hi>Job</hi> religiouſly meditating on the <hi>Life</hi> &amp; <hi>Death</hi> of Man; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning with his own Heart, and expoſtulating with GOD.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt <hi>6</hi> verſes, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the ſhortneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of our Lives, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity &amp; vexation of the World, the Pollution of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, and the ſettled Period of human Life: and urges theſe Conſiderations with GOD, as ſo many Pleas for Mercy and Forbearance. <hi>Man, that is born of a Woman, is of few days,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IN the next place he turns his Tho'ts upon
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002743_0003_0FE61F8FB5274108"/>
DEATH, &amp; affects himſelf with the dreadful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Conſequences of it; groaning out his Soul in various Complaints, Requeſts, and paſſionate Expoſtulations. He realiſes it to himſelf, that Death is an awful &amp; final Remove out of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World; but then refreſhes himſelf with the Proſpect of a future Reſurrection, &amp; his Exiſtence in another &amp; better World. ver. 7 — 15. <hi>For there is hope of a Tree, if it be cut down,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>HAVING ſaid theſe things, he falls again into complaining Language; and tho' not utterly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, yet is hard put to it to bear up under his preſent Troubles. He complains of GOD's Sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in his dealings with him, as if he was ſtrict to mark Iniquity againſt him; ver. 16, &amp; 17. <hi>For now thou numbreſt my ſteps,</hi> &amp;c. In the next place he obſerves the decaying Condition and Mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all Earthly Things: and then he ſpeaks of it as the common Lot of all Mankind to die; and mentions the power, the terror, and the agonies of Death: ver. 18. to the end, <hi>And ſurely the mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain falling cometh to nought,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>ALL things in Nature are ſubject to continual Viciſſitudes, to Decays, and Deſolations; even <hi>Man</hi> (the nobleſt of viſible Creatures) not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We are of the Earth, earthy, ſprang original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Duſt, and muſt return to our native Earth. The very <hi>Mountains</hi> &amp; <hi>Rocks</hi> have not ſuch a Stability, but that they may be unfixed from their places, be removed &amp; broken to pieces, or gradually moulder away. No marvel then if frail Mankind be in a waſting Condition. The very ſtrongeſt, the moſt healthy &amp; moſt powerful among
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002743_0004_0FE61F917519FE80"/>
Men, are ſubject to Mortality, as well as others. Tho' they ſee many days, &amp; laſt a long time, yet ſooner or later, they are worn out, as the Rocks in the Sea wax old and Stones wear away with the continual dropping of Water upon them. — And as to the Generality of Mankind, they are eaſily carry'd away, &amp; often ſuddenly, as Flowers of the Field, and tender Herbs which <hi>grow out of the dust of the Earth,</hi> by a ſweeping Rain, which (as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves) leaveth no Food, but cuts off the Expectations of the Husbandman, &amp; when he looketh for much, bringeth it to little.</p>
            <p>THUS ſaies <hi>Job,</hi> directing his Speech to the ALMIGHTY,— <hi>Thou waſheſt away the things that grow out of the Duſt of the Earth; and thou deſtroyeſt the Hope of Man. Thou prevaileſt for ever againſt him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>HERE (1.) WE have an acknowlegement of GOD's <hi>Dominion</hi> and Agency in the Affair of our <hi>Death. — Thou</hi> deſtroyeſt <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) WE have a <hi>Deſcription</hi> of Death, by ſome of it's Properties, and Effects.</p>
            <p>IN our Text he obſerves, <hi>It deſtroys the Hope of Man,</hi> puts a Period to all our Worldly Hopes and Projects, &amp; to the preſumptuous hopes of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite. In the following verſes 'tis obſerved:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IT prevails for ever againſt him, and he paſſeth away.</hi> The Stroke of Death is irreſiſtible, &amp; often makes quick diſpatch. The Blow is many times given ſuddenly, &amp; the Man paſſes away; makes a ſpeedy flight, as a timorous Bird haſtens out of it's Neſt when diſturb'd, or as a conquer'd Soldier ſlys before his purſuing Adverſary. — 'Tis added,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002743_0005_0FE61F9182603B08"/>
               <hi>IT changeth his Countenance</hi>; it's Approach is terrible, and diſcompoſes the Mind; and it's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution alters the looks, ſlurs the Beauty of the Face, and turns it into Paleneſs &amp; Deformity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IT ſends him away,</hi> — with Speed &amp; Force; out of Time into Eternity; out of a State of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation into a State of Retribution. Finally, <hi>His ſons come to Honour, and he knoweth it not, &amp; they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conſider at preſent only the Beginning of the Account here given of Death. And ſhall ſpeak to it under theſe two Obſervations.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. GOD is the Sovereign Diſpenſer of Death.</item>
               <item>2. DEATH deſtroys the Hope of Man.</item>
            </list>
            <p>PROP. I. <hi>GOD is the Sovereign Diſpenſer of Death,</hi> and the abſolute Diſpoſer of all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Conſequences of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>JOB</hi> attributes all to GOD, — <hi>Thou</hi> deſtroyeſt the Hope of Man; <hi>Thou</hi> prevaileſt for ever againſt him,— <hi>Thou</hi> changeſt his Countenance, and ſendeſt him away. — Thus he aſcribes this great Event, in the ſeveral Circumſtances &amp; Conſequents of it unto GOD.</p>
            <p>AND this Truth might be confirm'd from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Paſſages in ſacred Writ. I ſhall here only mention that one place, where GOD himſelf aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts his Dominion over human Life, and challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it as his Prerogative to diſpoſe of it. Deut. 32.29. <hi>See now, that I even I am HE, and there is no God with me: I kill &amp; I make alive; I wound &amp; I heal; neither is there any that can deliver out of my
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002743_0006_0FE61F9AC9CF7D68"/>
hand.</hi> He orders &amp; diſpoſes every thing relating to the Death of every one; the Time, the Place, the Manner, together with all the Effects, and Things which follow.</p>
            <p>DEATH is no contingent or accidental Event, the fruit of Chance, but the Reſult of Divine Counſil &amp; Efficiency. It may be ſaid indeed to be fortuitous or caſual with reſpect to us, who are ignorant of futurities, and meet with many things we could not foreſee, or did not expect. But GOD is perfect in Knowlege, &amp; foreſees the moſt diſtant Events; and with reference to him nothing can be call'd a Contingency, Accident, or Chance. He worketh All things according to the Counſil of his own Will: &amp; in particular, He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in the great affair of Death. Thus ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 12.9, 10. <hi>Who knoweth not in all theſe, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this? In whoſe hand is the Soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</hi> It is he turneth Man to Deſtruction, &amp; bringeth us to the Houſe appointed for all Living. The Decree (wherein it's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Man once to die) came out of his Mouth; and the Execution is done by his powerful Hand. Men don't die at random, juſt when &amp; as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens: but our times are in GOD's hand; He meaſures out our Life, &amp; determins our days; the number of our Months is with him; He hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed our Bounds that we cannot paſs. And when the ſet time is come, he gives the fatal Blow, takes away our breath, and lays us in the duſt. There is the hand of GOD in every one's Death, whatever be the way, &amp; means; whether it be a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002743_0007_0FE61F9AD34939B0"/>
natural or a violent Death; by Diſtempers or Diſaſters; if he be ſlain in Battel, cut off by the Sword of Juſtice, or ſtab'd by an <hi>Ehud</hi>'s Dagger <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All comes to paſs by the Determination &amp; Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of GOD. It was <hi>according to the determinate Counſel &amp; Fore-knowledge of God,</hi> that our <hi>bleſſed Saviour</hi> was by <hi>wicked Hands crucify'd &amp; ſlain.</hi> GOD directed the Arrow, when a certain Man drew his bow <hi>at a venture,</hi> and ſmote the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> between <hi>the Joynts of the Harneſs.</hi> 
               <q>It is appointed to us, not only once to die, but <hi>how</hi> and <hi>when</hi>: the particular Time of our <hi>Birth</hi> is not more fully ſettled in the Counſels of GOD, than the Time of our <hi>Death.</hi>
               </q> There is a Time to be born, and a Time to die; a <hi>ſet</hi> Time for both: and GOD <hi>determineth the Times fore-appointed.</hi> 
               <q>It is the ſame Inviſible Hand, which <hi>writes down</hi> our Names in <hi>the Book of the Living,</hi> and <hi>blots</hi> them out too.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is a Truth we ſhould often meditate upon; that GOD hath the power of Life &amp; Death; and we ſhould make a wiſe application hereof to the Ends of Holineſs and ſpiritual Comfort.</p>
            <p>THIS Reflection ſhould ſerve to <hi>greaten and elevate our Apprehenſions of the Divine Majeſty.</hi> Death is one of the weightieſt and moſt important Events. 'Tis the Deſtruction of an human Body, which infinite Wiſdom hath fearfully and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made. 'Tis the diſlodging of an immortal Soul; a changing of its State, &amp; tranſlating it from a world of Senſe to a world of Spirits, from a State of Trial, to a State of Rewards unknown and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. It is therefore a great and very awful
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002743_0008_0FE61F9C98266368"/>
Thing to die. And it is no ſmall Exerciſe of the Divine Dominion, which is ſeen in this Affair. Hence we ſhould maintain a profound Reverence of GOD, in whoſe hand our Breath is, and ſhould have exalted Tho'ts of Him on this account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> THE Thought of this ſhould <hi>ſtrike a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror on rebellious Sinners, and excite them to a ſpeedy Repentance.</hi> This tells you, that your Lives are under a Divine Inſpection, the moſt ſtrict, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, and never-ceaſing. The LORD of all has his Eye upon you continually, obſerving how you fill up the meaſure of your Iniquity, and waiting the fit ſeaſon to turn the Keys of Death &amp; Hell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. O Conſider this, &amp; tremble. Your Death will certainly be a miſerable one, if you die in your Sins. And you know not how ſoon or ſuddenly you may have the fatal Summons ſerv'd upon you. The Providence of GOD is at this day calling aloud on you in ſeveral ſudden Deaths. It is owing intirely to the Patience &amp; Forbearance of a good and merciful GOD, that you are ſpared, &amp; have had your Lives lengthen'd out hitherto. You are continually abuſing this Patience by your Rebellion and Impenitence. And if you go on in your Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, there is hazard leſt abuſed Patience ſhould break out into inflamed Wrath, &amp; cut you down as Cumberers of the Ground, &amp; caſt you as fit Fewel into the Everlaſting Burnings. GOD has ſaid, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man.</hi> O ſecure Sinners, think of this, &amp; tremble leſt Divine Vengence ſhould kindle againſt you, &amp; burn to the loweſt Hell. — The Doctrine before us reads loud Leſſons of Terror to the Wicked. O that ſuch
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002743_0009_0FE61F9C9F771D60"/>
would hear &amp; fear &amp; no longer harden their Hearts, but to Day while it is called to day, hearken to the Caſts of the Goſpel, &amp; turn from their evil ways, that they periſh not. But then further,</p>
            <p>IT reads ſweet Lectures of <hi>Conſolation to the Children of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UNDER the Difficulties &amp; Troubles of Life, in <hi>general,</hi> it ſhould miniſter Support &amp; Comfort to Believers, to conſider that GOD is the Sovereign LORD of Life &amp; Death. However your Lives may be embitter'd to you by a Variety of Afflictions; ſo that you may be even weary of Life, and be tempted (with <hi>Job</hi>) to wiſh for Death, yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it is GOD who continues your Lives, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays your Death; HE performeth the Thing that is appointed for you; and let this Tho't teach you a humble Submiſſion &amp; patient Waiting. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that er'e long He will command Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for you; will give you a Quietus, and bring you to the Reſt which remains for the People of GOD. The proſpect of this ſhou'd calm your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and make you eaſy under all your preſent Trials —.</p>
            <p>BUT in particular, under <hi>Bereavements,</hi> the Tho't of GOD's Dominion over Death ſhould be quieting to you. <hi>Job</hi> compoſed himſelf with this conſideration, — <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,</hi> (Job 1.21.) Let ſuch as are Mourning under bereaving Diſpenſations, eye the hand of GOD. You may not with the ignorant &amp; fooliſh <hi>Philiſtins</hi> make a Doubt, Whether it is GOD who hath done this Evil, or whether it is a Chance that hath happened to you. You muſt not impute it to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002743_0010_0FE61FA771D8AA78"/>
ſecond Cauſes merely; but look above &amp; beyond Inſtruments &amp; Means to the Prime Efficient, and acknowledge with <hi>Naomi,</hi> That <hi>the Hand of the Lord</hi> is gone out againſt you. Realize the Agency of Divine Providence in your Afflictions, and in the midſt of your diſquieting Tho'ts within you, let this Reflection comfort you. Remember <hi>Who</hi> it is that has laid you under theſe bereavements. He is One abſolutely <hi>Sovereign</hi> and giveth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any of his Matters. Why then ſhouldeſt thou ſtrive againſt Him? Wo to him, who ſtriveth with his Maker! Behold, He taketh away, and who can hinder him, or who may ſay to him. What doeſt Thou? Behold in this thou art not juſt: I will anſwer thee, That GOD is greater than Man! Again, He is One Infinitely <hi>Wife</hi>; and therefore knows what is beſt &amp; fitteſt to be done, and even how to bring Good out of Evil. Is it not then both a Duty and a Decency in you to acquieſce in his Pleaſure, with the higheſt Satisfaction? Moreover, He is infinitely <hi>Good</hi> &amp; Gracious, and has engag'd himſelf by his faithful <hi>Promiſe,</hi> to employ his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom &amp; Power in making all things work together for your final and beſt Advantage; ſo that you ſhall be ſpiritual Gainers by your temporal Loſſes &amp; Bereavements. O how ſhould this Tho't ſuſtain, animate &amp; comfort you! I ſhall only ſubjoyn, You may fetch in additional Conſolations from the proſpect of that <hi>Happineſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Glory,</hi> which ſuch of your deceaſed Friends, as were Pious, are gone to inherit, and which ſhall be abundantly increaſed at their future Reſurrection. It is GOD who has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them away; and you muſt needs conclude
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002743_0011_0FE61FA778CD1788"/>
from his Love to his People, and from his gracious Promiſes to them, that he has remov'd them into a State more excellent &amp; happy, than that they were in here; and that he will raiſe up their Bodies at the laſt day, to Glory, Bleſſedneſs &amp; Immortality. So that not a Tear nor Sigh is due on the ſcore of the departed Godly, who are pleaſed with the Change which we lament. Wherefore comfort one another with theſe words. Take them for a Spunge, to dry up all your exceſſive Tears; and let not immoderate Reſentments prevail over you, to the diſhonour of GOD, and the prejudice of your own Souls. At leaſt, let your Reſentments turn upon <hi>Sin,</hi> the grand Occaſion &amp; Procurer of Death: <hi>Hear the Lord's Controverſy with you,</hi> and inquire into the Grounds of it; O humble your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his mighty hand, and learn Righteouſneſs from his Judgments; knowing that He will one day call you to an Account for your Afflictions, as ſo many Talents, put into your Hands to improve for his Glory.</p>
            <p>Further, THE Doctrine before us ſhould teach us all to be <hi>Thankful to GOD for the Preſervation of our Lives hitherto,</hi> and <hi>to truſt in him for the future Continuance of them.</hi> We live in the midſt of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, are encompaſs'd with innumerable Evils; and it is of the Lord's Mercies we are not conſumed. To him give the Glory of paſt Preſervations; and in him let us put our Confidence for the future. What Time we are afraid, let us truſt in the Lord: when our Lives are in hazard by Sickneſs, by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, by the Rage of Creatures, let us confide in GOD, and be quiet from the fear of Death. If
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002743_0012_0FE61FA886A9F2A8"/>
He cover us with his Feathers, we are ſafe, and need not fear whrt Men or Devils can do unto us. Prov. 26.2. <hi>As the bird by wandring, as the ſwallow by flying, ſo the curſe cauſeleſs ſhall not come.</hi> We ſhould truſt in GOD as the GOD of our Life, for the preſervation of it, and for all the Bleſſings need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſweeten it to us: and we ſhould reſign to his Will, as to the Time &amp; Manner of our Death. We ſhould daily by Faith be putting over ourſelves into his ſafe and glorious Hands, and commit the keeping of our Souls, and ordering of our Bodies and all our Concerns wholly unto Him; from a realiſing view of his Sovereignty, Goodneſs, and Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Finally, WHAT has been ſaid ſhou'd <hi>give Check to all inordinate Fears of Men,</hi> however they may ſet themſelves againſt us, or any of GOD's People. Are we apprehenſive of Danger to ourſelves, or to the Publick, or to the Church of GOD abroad, from ſubtil &amp; powerful Enemies? Do Tyrants &amp; Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors ariſe, and do they breathe out Threatnings and Slaughter? This is our Comfort, Their Breath (as well as ours) is in GOD's hand; and tho' they may be called gods, they ſhall die like men. The LORD, when he pleaſeth, can daſh them to pieces with his ſtrong Arm, and cover them with ſhame, can bring down the glory of their high looks, and caſt their Throne down to the Ground, by one eaſy inſtantaneous Blow, either with or without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. It was the Word of the LORD to the Prince of <hi>Tyre,</hi> Ezek. 28.8—10. <hi>They ſhall bring thee down to the pit, and thou ſhalt die the deaths of them that are ſlain in the midſt of the ſeas. Wilt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002743_0013_0FE61FA89024A120"/>
thou yet ſay before him that ſlayeth thee, I am God? but thou ſhalt be a man and no God in the hand of him that ſlayeth thee. Thou ſhalt die the deaths of the uncircumciſed, by the hand of ſtrangers: for I have ſpoken it, ſaith the Lord God. — Pharaoh,</hi> that oppreſſor of GOD's Iſrael, was drowned in the Red Sea. So <hi>Herod</hi> the King who vexed the Church, was ſmote by the Angel of the Lord, &amp; devoured of Worms. Thus thoſe Perſecutors were ſtopt in their furious Career; by the Blaſt of GOD, they periſh'd out of the Earth, &amp; went where the Wicked ceaſe from troubling. Wait on the Lord then, &amp; keep his way. Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of evil doors; neither be afraid of Dying Creatures tho' they plot againſt the juſt, &amp; bend their Bow, to ſlay ſuch as be of upright Converſation. The wrath of Man ſhall praiſe GOD, &amp; the Remainder thereof ſhall be reſtrained. Lo, I have ſeen the Wicked in great power &amp; ſpreading himſelf like a green Bay-Tree, yet he paſſed away; and lo, he was not. The Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Righteous is of the Lord, and unto GOD belong the Iſſues from Death, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.14. <hi>He ſhall redeem their Soul from deceit and violence: and precious ſhall their blood be in his ſight.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? But and if ye ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled</hi>;</p>
            <p>I come now to the other Obſervation.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>DEATH deſtroyes all Earthly and Falſe hopes,</hi> and puts a period to the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; Projects of the Men of this World.</p>
            <p>SO in our Text — <hi>Thou deſtroyeſt the hope of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002743_0014_0FE61FB10BFD1398"/>
Man.</hi> 
               <q>Death is the Deſtruction of all thoſe Hopes which are built on Worldly Confidences, and confin'd to Worldly Comforts. Hope in Chriſt and hope of Heaven [well grounded] Death will conſummate and not deſtroy.</q> But it deſtroys the Hope, which is Worldly or Falſe. We read 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.15. <hi>Our days on Earth are a ſhadow, and there is none abiding,</hi> or no Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it might be render'd, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.7. <hi>When a wicked man dieth, his expectation ſhall periſh: and the hope of unjuſt men periſheth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>IT puts a period to all Worldly Projects, to all Earthly Hopes,</hi> and the proſpects of Temporal Glory and Happineſs, which vain Man is ſo apt to flatter himſelf with. Death puts an end to his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Life and Abode here on Earth; and together therewith, to all his Worldly Employments and Deſigns, as well as Enjoyments and Poſſeſſions. Death turns us out of our ſeveral Callings, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; Secular Capacities, &amp; leaves us no more opportunity to attend the common works of Life, and purſue any deſigns relating to the preſent World. Thus we read, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 9.10. <hi>There is no work, nor device, nor knowlege, nor wiſdom in the grave whither thou goeſt.</hi> So Pſal. 146.4. <hi>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts periſh.</hi> The meaning is not, that the Soul then paſſes into a tho'tleſs, ſtupid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent State, &amp; loſes its power of Cogitation, No, but it imports, that a Period is then put to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns they formed for this World. When Death comes, they can no longer proſecute the Schemes they have laid for Worldly Gains, Pleaſures or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002743_0015_0FE61FB1141FD330"/>
In that very day the Plans they have laid periſh: "their deſigns die with them, their Thoughts vaniſh with their Breath! — In one Moment all their Hopes are daſh't; their Deſires, and their Expectations periſh forever.</p>
            <p>HENCE, <hi>Let us not put our Truſt in Men</hi>; whoſe Lives, however important &amp; uſeful, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; and therefore our Expectations from them very precarious, &amp; eaſily defeated. Hear the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's Advice, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.2 2. <hi>Ceaſe ye from man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils: for wherein is he to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of</hi>? Surely Man is like to Vanity; his days are as a Shadow that paſſeth away. Men of low degree are Vanity: and Men of high degree are a Lye. Hear the Pſalmiſt's Advice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.3, 4, 5. <hi>Put not your trust in princes, nor in the ſon of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts periſh. Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whoſe hope is in the Lord his God</hi>: "This is a Life, &amp; Will, &amp; Power we may depend upon".</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>LET us not be high minded and truſt in uncertain Riches.</hi> We muſt not fix our Deſires and Hopes on the things of Time &amp; Senſe: we muſt not conceive too big Hopes, nor indulge too perempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory Expectations; but always project &amp; act with an abſolute Reſignation to GOD, &amp; ſit looſe from the World, as Pilgrims &amp; Strangers upon Earth. Let us not put on too much Confidence, nor flatter and pleaſe ourſelves too much with Worldly Hopes and Views at any time. Hear the Wiſe Man's Caution, Prov. 27.1, 24. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002743_0016_0FE61FB2BA5745B0"/>
forth. — For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation</hi>? Remember the Admonition of our Saviour, in the Parable of the Rich Fool, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.16—22. And that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.13—15. [Which, you'l do well to turn to and read.]</p>
            <p>LET us not be immoderately <hi>anxious,</hi> nor ſpend too much of our Time in unprofitable Projections, about the periſhing Enjoyments of the Life which now is. But let us be laying Schemes for <hi>Eternity,</hi> which will never periſh; and be forming Deſigns of Good (Spiritual Good) to coming Generations. We ſhould be projecting proper Methods to ſerve Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as well as the preſent Generation in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Intereſts: particularly by devoting of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates to Pious Uſes, by the Pious Education of our Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus we ſhall lay the Foundations of peculiar Benefit &amp; Service to the World, after we are Dead. But eſpecially we ſhould be wiſely lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Schemes for a <hi>Bleſſed Immortality</hi>: we are hidden to lay up Treaſures in Heaven, to lay up in ſtore a good Foundation againſt the time to come, that we may lay hold on Eternal Life. — We are here upon our good Behaviour, in a ſtate of Trial for Eternity. Great then is the Folly of the Men of this World, who only ſeek a Portion under the Sun, and terminate all their Tho'ts &amp; Cares &amp; Hopes upon Sublunary things. They ſet their Hearts on that <hi>which is not,</hi> &amp; neglect the great Salvation which is the <hi>one thing needful.</hi> Verily this their Way is their Folly. O let us beware of ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious Folly. Eccl. 11.8. <hi>But if a man live ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, and rejoyce in them all; yet let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

the days of darkneſs, for they ſhall be many. All that cometh is vanity.</hi> Let us ſhew our ſelves <hi>Men,</hi> by applying all our Powers to ſecure the great Intereſts of our Souls &amp; Eternity, which will never fail, &amp; which are of the higheſt poſſible value and importance. Let us look off from this preſent World, retire from it in our Thoughts, Affections and Purſuits; live above its frowns &amp; flatteries, and paſs the time of our Sojourning here in the fear of GOD. Let us look into the coming World, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our Cares, Deſigns &amp; Hopes beyond the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of fleeting Time; and ſeek another Country even an Heavenly. Let us make it the great Buſineſs of our Lives to provide for the next World, and ſecure to our ſelves an Inheritance among the Saints in Light. And conſidering the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of our opportunities, <hi>let us make Haſte.</hi> We are frequently warned of GOD, both in his Word &amp; Providence, to prepare for Death. The Voice of the Lord crieth aloud to the City, (in the late ſudden Deaths, which have alarm'd the Town) in ſuch moving Language as that—BE YE ALSO READY, <hi>for ye know not the day nor the hour.</hi> O let us fear GOD, and receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: let us number our days, &amp; apply our Hearts unto Wiſdom. Hear, ye Old Men, and be wiſe, &amp; underſtand this. And hear, ye Children! O Young Man Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy Youth, leſt the Iniquity of thy Heels overtake thee, &amp; thou be ſnared in an evil time, and mourn at the laſt, ſaying How have I hated Inſtruction! Verily Death (that irreſiſtible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of all falſe hope &amp; peace) is coming, yea it
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002743_0018_0FE5F415EB86CAB0"/>
haſtens greatly upon us, when the day of Salvation will end. Now is the day of Salvation; now is the accepted time. Death will conclude the ſeaſon of Grace: and then there will be no retrieving loſt opportunities; 'twill be too late to Repent, too late to obtain Mercy, too late to work out our Salvation. It muſt be done <hi>Now or Never.</hi> When we have once put off the Body, we ſhall never return into it, to redreſs the Errors of our former Lives; but muſt receive our Reward, according to the things already done in the Body, whether good or bad. <hi>After Death comes the Judgment,</hi> even eternal Judgment, an irreſiſtible Doom. After that we ſhall no more have the offers of Salvation made to us; nor any more Enjoy the Hopes &amp; Means of Grace; but ſhall be fixed in an everlaſting State. We have only the preſent ſhort Life to work in and prepare for an eternal World. We had need then be up &amp; doing As our Lord ſaid, Joh 9.4. <hi>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work.</hi> Let us make haſte and not delay. It is high time to awake unto Righteouſneſs. Let us not be ſecure, and trifle away our time in idleneſs, putting far away the evil day: but let us do with Might, with Speed and Vigour, what our hand findeth to do, redeeming the Time. Let us not content ourſelves with empty wiſhes, and unactive Reſolutions; for in the day of Death all our Tho'ts will periſh, and avail us nothing, unleſs now put in Execution.</p>
            <p>AND let us ſee to it that we be <hi>Sincere,</hi> that our Hearts be right with GOD, and ſound in his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes; that we ſo number our days, as indeed to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002743_0019_0FE61FBC7333ECE8"/>
apply our <hi>Hearts</hi> unto Wiſdom. Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Himſelf. Be not deceived: GOD is not mocked. But whatſoever a Man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap. He that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap Life everlaſting. But he that ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption and Death. Let us ſee to it that we be indeed the Children of GOD by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus: and if Children, then ſhall we be <hi>Heirs</hi> of GOD, and joynt Heirs with Jeſus Chriſt; we ſhall receive the End of our Faith, the Salvation of our Souls.</p>
            <p>BUT if we are not the Children of GOD, if we do not truly believe in CHRIST, and live Godly in him, but prove finally the Children of this World, we ſhall certainly periſh, and our Hope ſhall periſh: which brings me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>DEATH deſtroys the Hope of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,</hi> and puts an End to all his Dreams of Heaven and Happineſs. The Righteous hath Hope in his Death, and becomes an Heir according to the hope of eternal Life. But the Way of the wicked ſhall periſh, and the Expectation of the Hypocrite ſhall periſh. If we die in our Sins, verily Hell will be our portion; we ſhall lie down in ſorrow and be doomedd to everlaſting Deſpair: If we die Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, verily all Hope will die with us, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Miſery and Confuſion remain for us.

Even ſo (ſays he) are the paths of all that forget GOD, <hi>and the Hypocrite's Hope ſhall periſh.</hi> His Hope ſhall be cut off, and his Truſt ſhall be a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s <hi>Web</hi> (woven out of his own bowels, light and airy, and eaſily ſwept away by the beſome of Deſtruction:) He may lean upon his houſe, but it ſhall not ſtand; he may hold it faſt, but it ſhall not endure. All the falſe Confidences of Hypocrites will fail them in the day of Wrath; their ſandy Foundations will crumble under them in the Storm that's coming, and they themſelves ſhall periſh in the Ruines. The Refuges of Lies will be ſwept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and all their bright Thoughts of Heaven and Happineſs ſhall end in black Deſpair.</p>
            <p>WHILE here in this World, Sinners in <hi>Zion</hi> are many times carnally confident and at eaſe; They ſpeak Peace &amp; promiſe Safety to their Souls. They value themſelves upon their extraordinary Gifts, on their Goſpel-priviledges, on their Religious Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Performances, and the like: but theſe will all prove vain Pleas, and avail them nothing. Of this we are aſſur'd by the Judge himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21—27. So in the Parable of the Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.1—12. [Which Scriptures for brevity ſake, I muſt only turn you to.]</p>

Deſtruction from GOD be a terror to you, and be perſwaded by the Terrors of the LORD.

O Remember you are ere long to DIE: and Death will ſtorm you out of all your deluſive Confidences, and pull down your towering Imaginations. Then you will ſee the Vanity of your preſent Dreams. That which is now a high Wall in your Conceit; a Munition of Rocks, and a ſubſtantial Security unto you, will then prove but a ſhadow, mere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance &amp; deceit. Then you will ſee and bewail your Folly and Preſumption; will be aſhamed of your treacherous Hope, and abandon your ſelf to everlaſting Deſpondence, Regret &amp; Rage. — At Death there will be a fatal period of all your Joys and Hopes. Your Hope may now bud &amp; flouriſh, and yield unto you peaceable fruits; but verily the <hi>latter Harveſt ſhall be a Heap in the day of Grief and of deſperate ſorrow.</hi>

            <p>O that Sinners who are at eaſe in <hi>Zion,</hi> would hear &amp; fear, &amp; no longer delude themſelves with a groundleſs hope. <hi>Job</hi> 15.31. <hi>Let not him that is deceived, truſt in vanity: for vanity ſhall be his recompence.</hi> Conſider before it be too late, how vain &amp; deſtructive your falſe hope will prove in the end. Conſider how Death is haſtning upon you, which will deſtroy your Hope, &amp; turn it into en leſs Deſperation. O give Credit to the Divine Threatnings, &amp; take ſeaſonable Warning. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>For many walk, of whom I have told you
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002743_0022_0FE61FC4D2002398"/>
often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the croſs of Chriſt: Whoſe end is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, whoſe God is their belly: and whoſe glory is in their ſhame, who mind earthly things.</hi> Iſa. 50.11. <hi>Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compaſs your ſelves about with ſparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the ſparks that ye have kindled. This ſhall ye have of mine hand, ye ſhall lie down in ſorrow.</hi> O Reſt not eaſy in your preſent Condition. Fly for refuge to Jeſus Chriſt &amp; lay hold on the hope ſet before you. Repent &amp; turn to GOD, elſe how ſhall you eſcape the Damnation of Hell? How ſhall you eſcape, if you neglect ſo great Salvation, and die in your ſins? None can fly from GOD, and hide themſelves in ſecret places. None can reſiſt. He will prevail for ever againſt them, &amp; will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the hopes of the Wicked. And how ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated your Miſery, if you periſh from under the Goſpel! Job 36.18. <hi>Becauſe there is wrath, beware leſt be take thee away with his ſtroke: then a great ranſom cannot deliver thee.</hi> To him that is joyned to the Living, there is hope, but Death deſtroys the hope of Sinners, deſtroys it <hi>totally,</hi> deſtroys it <hi>finally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN a Word, Let us all then from what has been ſaid, be put upon <hi>Examining our Hope,</hi> whether it be a Hope that Death cannot deſtroy.</p>
            <p>THIS is an Inquiry of infinite Importance. It relates to our Souls, &amp; to the Eternal World; to our Spiritual &amp; Everlaſting Safety &amp; Welfare: And therefore ſurely muſt deſerve our Conſideration, and calls for a peculiar concern that we be not deceivd about it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:002743_0023_0FE61FC4DABE0608"/>BUT yet Multitudes <hi>do</hi> deceive themſelves in this great Affair, reſting in a falſe Faith and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Hope.</p>
            <p>AN Error here is fatal, and yet (alas) very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>WE had need then apply our ſelves with the greateſt Care and Solicitude to inquire into the Truth &amp; Grounds of our Hope, that we may not by a deceived Heart be turned aſide from the path of Life, and finally periſh with a Lie in our right hand.</p>
            <p>Let it be Inquired then,</p>
            <p>IS your Hope built on the Promiſe of GOD in Jeſus Chriſt, and accompany'd with Qualifications and Deportments agreeable to the Terms of the Promiſe? Are you of the Number of thoſe, Phil. 3.3. <hi>Which worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh</hi>? Can you take up the Language of the Apoſtle, and from the Heart repeat his words in the following <hi>verſes,</hi> 
               <q>I count all things but loſs, for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the knowlege of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord; and do count them but dung, that I may win Chriſt; and be found in him, not having on mine own Righteouſneſs, but that which is of Chriſt by Faith. I count not my ſelf to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, I preſs toward the mark, for the prize of the high Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of GOD in Chriſt Jeſus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>DO'S your Hope in Chriſt in flame your Deſires and invigorate your Endeavors after Communion

with him and Conformity to him? In fine —</p>
            <p>HAS your Hope a purifying Influence upon you? The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> lays down that infallible Character for us to try our ſelves by, — 1 Joh. 3.3. <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, even as God is pure.</hi> — Verily, if theſe be the Properties &amp; Fruits of your Hope, 'tis a <hi>good Hope,</hi> and ſhall ſtand the ſhock of Death, &amp; may well reconcile you to the Tho'ts of the Grave. It is a Hope built on ſure and everlaſting Foundations, ſtrong in the LORD, and guarded with all the Forces of his ſtrength. Wherefore it is ſaid in the Scripture, <hi>He that believeth on Him, ſhall not be confounded.</hi> They ſhall not be aſhamed, that wait for the LORD, and hope in his Mercy. Such may triumph with the Prophet, Iſai. 50.7, 8. — <hi>The Lord God will help me; — I know I ſhall not be aſhamed. He is near that justifyeth me: who will contend with me,</hi> &amp;c. — So you may glory with the Apoſtle, in like words, Rom. 8.33, &amp;c. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that juſtifyeth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died —. Who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt? — Neither Death nor Life, nor Angels — nor any other Creature ſhall be able</hi> —. Verily, if you truly believe in CHRIST, your Hope is ſuch an one as ſhall not be diſappointed; ſhall not make you aſhamed. Even Death ſhall not deſtroy it, but <hi>accompliſh</hi> it. Your Fleſh ſhall reſt in Hope, and your Hope ſhall never periſh; but be <hi>completed</hi> in everlaſting Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition, ſwallow'd up in the Sight and Enjoyment of the Bleſſed GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:002743_0025_0FE61FC72F52D670"/>GOD may ſeem to hide himſelf from you for the preſent, but he will never forſake you utterly. Iſai. 45.15, &amp;c. <hi>Thou art a God that hideſt thy ſelf, O God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>the Saviour. They ſhall be aſhamed, all of them, — that are makers of</hi> Idols. <hi>But</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved in the Lord with an everlaſting ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ye ſhall not be aſhamed, nor confounded world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</hi> You may be apt to condemn your ſelves, but GOD wou'd have you truſt in him. Iſai. 50.10. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkneſs and hath no light? let him truſt in the Name of the LORD, and ſtay upon his GOD.</hi> Finally, Men may vote you Reprobates, and paſs the Doom of Hypocrites upon you: but ſays the ſame Prophet, Chap. 66.5. <hi>Hear the Word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hated you, that caſt you out for my Name's ſake, ſaid Let the LORD be glorified: but he ſhall appear to your joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> AMEN!</p>
