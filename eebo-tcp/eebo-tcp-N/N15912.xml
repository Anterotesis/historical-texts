            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE REMARKABLE HISTORY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THIS very fortunate young Man, when only a few days old, was put faſt aſleep into Mr. All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy's bed, on the ſame night that gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from London, to his Country Houſe, which was about a mile from Bath—
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020356_0004_0FAEFADE9960FA90"/>
Mr. Allworthy came home late in the evening, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort ſupper with his ſiſter, retired, much fatigued to his chamber: Here, after having ſpent ſome Minutes on his knees, a cuſtom which he never broke thro' on any account, he was preparing to ſtep into bed, when, on opening the clothes, to his great ſurpriſe, he beheld the Infant, wrapt up in ſome coarſe linen, in a ſweet and profound ſleep,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020356_0005_0FAEFADF10BC6898"/>
between his ſheets; he ſtood ſome time loſt in aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the ſight, but as good nature had always an aſcendancy in his mind, he was ſoon touched with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of compaſſion for the little wretch before him, and rang the bell, which called up his houſekeeper, Mrs. Deborah Wilkins.—She being a ſtrict obſerver of decency, was exceedingly alarmed, on entering her maſter's room, to find him
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020356_0006_0FAEFAE02E9FCE68"/>
undreſſed, but more ſo on his preſenting her with the child, which he ordered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be taken care of; although ſhe took the liberty to adviſe him to have it placed at the Church-Warden's door; "It is a goodly night, ſays ſhe, only a little rainy and windy, but if it is well wrapt up, and put into a warm baſket, it is two to one but he lives until he is found in the morning."
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020356_0007_0FAEFAE0A7B85D90"/>
This goodly advice of his houſekeeper, it is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Mr Allworthy did not hear, for by this time he had got one of his fingers in the infant's hand, which by its gentle preſſure, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to implore his aſſiſtance. Some months after, his ſiſter, Mrs. Blifill, brought him a nephew, and Mr. Allworthy gave the nurſe ſtrict orders to bring them up together, and not make the leaſt diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020356_0008_0FAEFAE1B1D47070"/>
the two boys; and was often heard to ſay, if Tommy turned out good, he would be as a father to him, and as he was very rich it was greatly in his power to be ſo. But tho' his goodneſs preſerved the poor orphan, he was exceeding angry with the perſon who placed him in his bed, and cauſed the moſt diligent ſearch to be made, in order to find the party; declaring, if he
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020356_0009_0FAEFAE20B11D8D8"/>
found them out he would immediately commit them to priſon, which, as a juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the peace, it was in his power to do; but the ſearch was fruitleſs.</p>
            <p>Nothing material hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened reſpecting Maſter Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill and Maſter Jones, of conſequence ſufficient for a place in this hiſtory, until they were about eight years of age. But before I proceed, it is, I think, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to inform the reader,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020356_0010_0FAEFAE4F777FF38"/>
why he took upon him the name of Jones, it was cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I am told, from a ſtrong ſuſpicion, that one Molly Jones (ſervant to Mr. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, a ſchoolmaſter in the neighbourhood) was the perſon who put him into Mr. Allworthy's bed; ſhe left her place about that time and making nobody acquainted where ſhe was gone to, was in moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's opinion, grounds ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conclude her the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020356_0011_0FAEFAE60732C9E8"/>
perſon; ſo all agreed, that Jones ſhould be the name of the boy. I wiſh it was in my power as <hi>clearly</hi> to account for his chriſtian name, there hiſtory is ſhamefully deficient. But I will detain you no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with digreſſions, for in my opinion it is but of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle moment; tho' ſome very learned men have taken the pains to write folio volumes on ſubjects more trivial than even what cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020356_0012_0FAEFAE6F77E0248"/>
Jones to be named Tom.</p>
            <p>I obſerved, that nothing material happened till they were eight years old, at that time 'Squire Weſtern, a Gentleman who lived about a mile diſtant, invited Mr. Allworthy to take a dinner with him, and bring along his two ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews (for by that name did he ſuffer the poor help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs orphan to be called) they all had made a hearty
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020356_0013_0FAEFAE751AF1598"/>
dinner, and Mr. Weſtern returned thanks to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for the ſame, when he told Maſter Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill and Maſter Jones, they might go and play together, if it was agreeable to Mr. Allworthy; the good man readily conſented. They had been but a very little time at play, when Miſs Sophy, Mr. Weſtern's only child, a girl about their own age, made a third, and ſhe being willing, like
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020356_0014_0FAEFAE80CA45FB8"/>
a good ſoul, to divert them all in her power, ſaid, ſhe had a Goldfinch in the houſe quite tame, which ſhe had brought up her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from a week old, and was very fond of, and if they choſe ſhe would bring it into the garden, to ſhew them. Here ſhe is with a bit of ſtring tied round the bird's leg.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:020356_0015_0FAEFAE8E8888A88"/>
               <figure/>
            </p>
            <p>The two lads were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pleaſed with the bird; and after admiring him ſome time, Maſter Blifil begged Sophy would let him hold the ſtring himſelf;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020356_0016_0FAEFAE9970E9298"/>
ſhe was, however, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to part with it, but as he pledged his word and honour, he would return the bird to her as ſafe as he received it, ſhe could then no longer object; but the inſtant ſhe put the bird in his hands he ſlipt the ſtring from his leg and away he flew. Little Jones was extremely angry with Maſter Blifill for behaving ſo, and ſorry for poor little Sophy, who ſtood crying
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020356_0017_0FAEFAEA4E103840"/>
for the loſs of her favourite bird. Tom obſerved where he flew, off goes his clothes, he climbs the tree, and puts his hand on the poor little trembling tame creature, &amp; preſents it to Miſs Sophy.</p>
            <figure/>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:020356_0018_0FAEFAEB65D7AEE0"/>
You cannot imagine how much little Jones gained Sophy's good will for recovering her bird, and how much Maſter Blifill had diſpleaſed her by his behaviour. The moment Mr. Weſtern was informed how Blifill had ſerved his little darling's bird, he ſaid that if Blifill was not flog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for it on his return home, he would never ſpeak to Mr. Allworthy again; to this Mr. Allworthy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020356_0019_0FAEFAEBCCC3CE98"/>
agreed, for he was as much diſpleaſed with Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Blifill as Mr. Weſtern could be.</p>
            <p>Tom's generous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in recovering the bird, made a deep impreſſion on Sophy, and as they grew up together, and continued neighbours, he had frequent opportunities of exerting himſelf in the aſſiſtance of Miſs Weſtern. One time ſhe had been taking a ride on a young ſpirited horſe,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020356_0020_0FAEFAECC866F488"/>
who threw her off, and, if Jones had not been near and caught her in his arms,
<figure/>
it is moſt likely the fall would have broke her neck; by ſaving her, he broke his
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020356_0021_0FAEFAED4B712360"/>
own arm, "but, ſaid he, if I have preſerved you, Miſs Sophy, I am ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid, for I promiſe you, I would have ſecured you from the leaſt harm at the expence of a much greater misfortune to myſelf than I have ſuffered on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion."</p>
            <p>When Mr. Weſtern was informed that Mr. Jones had ſaved his daughter's life, he was in raptures, and poſitively declared, that if
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020356_0022_0FAEFAF05089E6E8"/>
both the parties were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they ſhould go through the world together, and that he would give Sophy to him in marriage with twenty thouſand pounds. They both cheerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to this offer, and a day was fixed for the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: This was joy indeed to Mr. Allworthy, for you muſt recollect his uſual ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "I will be as a father to him, if he turns out a good boy;" and ſo he was,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020356_0023_0FAEFAF1563D1998"/>
for on the wedding day, he gave Mr. Jones exactly the ſame ſum of money, as Mr. Weſtern gave to Sophy, ſo that their fortunes were equal.
<figure/>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:020356_0024_0FAEFAF2B2D22990"/>
They now ride about the country in their coach and ſix, the happieſt couple I believe, in the world, and often joke with each other about the recovery of the Goldfinch. They take pleaſure in aſſiſting the diſtreſſed, and have the prayers of all the poor folks in the country; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Blifill having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his uncle a great many times, and made every perſon he was
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020356_0025_0FAEFAF353747FD0"/>
acquainted with, diſlike him, was at laſt turned out of Mr. Allworthy's houſe, and on the point of inliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a common ſoldier for Africa.
<figure/>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:020356_0026_0FAEFAF41955B7C0"/>
When Mr. Jones hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his diſtreſs, gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly inſiſted on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Fifty Pounds a year for his Life; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Mr. Jones was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately acquainted with the many falſhoods Blifill had told his uncle, with an intent to injure him in that good man's opinion, yet he was of ſo good and forgiving a diſpoſition, that it was impoſſible for him to ſee a perſon in diſtreſs
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020356_0027_0FAEFAF4CB418BC8"/>
and not afford him ſome aſſiſtance; eſpecially one he had been brought up with from a child, and who would have been heir to Mr. Allworthy's great eſtate, had not his own unhappy vicious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition prevented it.</p>

            <p>If this true Hiſtory, my little friends, makes the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

on your minds which I intend it ſhould, I ſhall then have no reaſon to lament the pains I have taken to collect the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials which form it. I was born and brought up in the ſame pariſh with both the lads, Jones's heart was generous and good, and glad was I to find Mr. All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy had underſtanding enough to diſcover it thro' the clouds of imprudence with which it was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded;
