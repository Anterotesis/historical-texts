            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Glories of God the Creator, are every where ſeen in his Works, and preached in his Word. Look where we will in his World, we ſee them; and attend where we will to his Word, and we hear them. The holy Scriptures begin with the Declaration, That <hi>In the Beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth;</hi> and the Account is carried on, and interſperſed thro' all the ſacred Pages. The Honours of God are here celebrated, in his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005354_0003_10170F68F1ACA4F0"/>Power and Sovereignty, and creating Attributes. Pſal. lxxiv. 16, 17. <hi>The Day is thine, the Night alſo is thine: Thou haſt prepared the Light and the Sun: Thou haſt ſet all the Borders of the Earth: Thou haſt made the Summer and the Winter.</hi> The great Frame of Nature is the Work of God: He orders all the <hi>Motions</hi> of Nature, and is himſelf the firſt Mover. He is the Owner and Proprietor of Nature then; and the Day and Night, the Light and Sun, the Summer and Winter are his.</p>
            <p>But it is the Winter Scene that now opens. And the Skies and the Earth around, and the ſacred Volume before us unite to claim our Honours to the God of Glory, as he appears grand at the Head of this Part of Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, <hi>He ſendeth forth his Commandment upon Earth; his Word runneth very ſwiftly. He giveth Snow like Wool; he ſcattereth the Hoar-froſt like Aſhes. He caſteth forth his Ice like Morſels; who can ſtand before his Cold?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Theme before us is, <hi>GOD is adorable in the Scenes of the Winter.</hi> How does it appear? And what Evidence can we bring for it? It is proved every Way: And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction pours in upon us from all Quarters. He has created it; He has eſtabliſhed it; He ſtill continues to bring it upon the Earth; He gives us the Senſation of it; a Capacity to feel it, in the Diſpoſition of our Bodily Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: And he acts, and operates in all the ſecond Cauſes, that conſpire to form it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He has created it.</hi> The Cold it ſelf is a Creature of God. Some have argued Cold to be only the Privation of Heat, as Darkneſs is only the Privation of Light. But even in this Senſe, God who forms the Heat and the Light, is the Author of the Cold and the Darkneſs. He lays his Claim, in the Letter as well as the Metaphor, <hi>I form the Light: I create Darkneſs.</hi> But there is ſomething further in the Nature and Philoſophy of Cold, than a bare Privati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005354_0004_1017218AEB37DF90"/>A Non-entity and Cold one would think were diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. A <hi>cold Nothing</hi> were an abſurd ſort of Curioſity. Cold has really ſomething material in its Nature; and it is not barely the Privation of Heat. The God of Nature has filled the Air with the Nitre, which ſo penetrates the Pores, and even cuts the Skin, in the bleak Winds of the Winter. By this he ſwells and fixes the frozen Water, and binds the Sea and Rivers in Fetters of Ice, bringing the Globules of the Fluid into that Attraction which we call Coheſion. He created the Cauſes of the Cold.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He has eſtabliſhed the Winter.</hi> He formed all the Cauſes, and contrived all the Laws of it: And he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the Laws, and keeps them in Force and Authority. Gen. viii. 21, 22. <hi>The Lord ſaid, While the Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, Seed time and Harveſt, and Cold and Heat, and Summer and Winter, and Day and Night ſhall not ceaſe.</hi> We know not how far the Flood it ſelf contributed to this Inequality of Seaſons, and brought the Sun and Earth to ſlant to one another, as we find they now do: But this we know, that at the Flood the Law of Summer and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was confirmed and eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis he who <hi>ſtill continues to bring it upon the Earth.</hi> He keeps up the Performance of his own Laws, and leads on the Summer and Winter in their perpetual Circle. The Wheels of Nature would ſtand ſtill, were it not for his powerful and unerring Hand: But having firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Motion to them, he maintains it, and keeps them rolling to this Day. The <hi>ſteady</hi> Return of the annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cold, is a Proof that there is ſome intelligent Agent at work, to bring it ſo orderly and uſefully onward. The whole Voice of modern Philoſophy, is aloud for this, that the Motion of the heavenly Globes is owing to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Energy of God. It is demonſtrable from Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Nature, that ſhould the great God ſpend his
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005354_0005_1017219C9FE1CDE0"/>Power one Moment, all the Planets would leave the Sun, and ſcatter thro' Immenſity. Summer and Winter would ceaſe in a Moment, and the Inhabitants of the Earth would wonder to ſee the Sun leſſen ſo faſt to them, as our Globe, ſhot off in a right Line, into eternal Cold and Darkneſs. What ſhall I ſay! Should the great God withdraw his Operations, we ſhould no more have the Sun go off and return as the Cauſe of Winter and Summer: But on the contrary, the Earth and Sun would ſeparate forever, and retire to further and further Diſtances in the immenſe Space, to all Eternity. God, then, who ſtill keeps the Sun, (to ſpeak in the Language of the Vulgar) in its Circle, and makes it approach and retire; makes it ſhine aſlant, or direct, is the Author of the Summer and the Winter. He made the Winter: For he is ſtill forever at Work to bring it on us. Not only did he create it at firſt; and eſtabliſh it by a ſtated Law; but he ſtills puts this Law in Execution. He <hi>makes</hi> the Winter: He made <hi>This</hi> Winter. He does not leave the Year to run Riot; but ſtill orders and produces and changes all the Seaſons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He has made the Power in us to perceive the Scenes of Winter.</hi> He has given us the Faculties of Senſation, to hear the Tempeſts roar, to ſee the Snows deſcend, and to feel the chill and cutting Blaſts. To what Purpoſe would the material Scenes of the Winter be, if our Organs were not diſpoſed and adapted to perceive them? Nay, if our Souls were not furniſhed with a Power of forming Ideas from them, different from what are in the Objects themſelves? There is, in our Perceptions of Cold and Heat, no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between the material Object, and the conceived Idea, but the unaccountable Will of God. He it is, who has made the Snow, and the Winds, and the Cold; and he it is that gives us the Power to perceive them. <hi>He</hi> has filled the Winter Sky with the pointed Froſt, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005354_0006_1017218C77A6E708"/>impregnated it with the Particles of Nitre: And he has given us the Power to apprehend Cold, from theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Cauſes. We depend upon him to keep theſe Senſes in Exerciſe; for it is the continual Exertion of his Power by which they act. Our Senſes are the Springs of theſe Perceptions; and in this Senſe, <hi>All our Springs are in him.</hi> He keeps them acting, as he at firſt awakened them in us. He ranged and modified our Nerves; he filled them with the animal Spirits; he formed the Imagination &amp; Fancy in us, by a Combination of all which, we feel the Cold, and ſhudder at the keen Winter. He firſt contrived the ſmall pointed Matter, and then he contrived our Pores to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe little Particles; then he formed our animal Spirits to convey the Senſation to our Brain; and after all he lighted up the Imagination, to perceive the Idea, and pronounce upon it, <hi>Cold.</hi> Thus is the great God adorable in the Winter. 'Tis all his ſtrange Work, within us, and without us. 'Tis intricate, and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious! We know but Part of his Ways; nor can we find them out unto Perfection. We amuſe our ſelves, and wonder, and adore. Our Philoſophy reaches a little Way: And where that ceaſes, our Devotion goes on, and our Aſcription to God muſt ſtill be, 'Tis <hi>His</hi> Ice, 'tis <hi>His</hi> Cold.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He has <hi>made all thoſe Things which unite to form the Winter.</hi> The Cold, the Snow, the Winds, the Froſt and Ice, the Nitre in the Air, the Obliquity of the Sun, and all the ſhivering Attendants of the Winter, are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of his Hand. <hi>For he ſaith to the Snow, be thou on the Earth,</hi>—Job xxxvii. 6,—10. 'Tis all aſcrib'd to God, to the Voice of God, to the Breath of God. The Snow falls, and the Ice thickens at his great Command: And by his Cold he ſeals up the Hand of every Man, and puts a Stop to his Work. As ſoon as ever his Word is
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005354_0007_1017219E3573D298"/>given, all the Terrors of the bleak Winter, collect and muſter together. <hi>He ſendeth forth his Commandment upon Earth, his Word runneth very ſwiftly:</hi> Swift as his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, his Creation obeys him, and performs his ſovereign Order. He bids his Wind blow, and the ſtormy Wind fulfills his Word. It ruſhes out, and roars aloud; it bluſters and ſweeps the Earth, and battles in the Air; it raiſes the Ocean, toſſes up the Billows in white Foam, and daſhes Wave upon Wave, and Cloud upon Cloud. If he enlarges his Commiſſion, it roots up Foreſts, and a whole Grove ſhall fly before it's Rage; and Cities ſhall be overturn'd and laid waſte in an Inſtant. In all this, the lawleſs Tumult of the Winds is ſtrictly govern'd by God: They do but blow his Praiſes, as with the Sound of a Trumpet. When he Commands, they retire, and are huſh; a profund Calm enſues; not a Whiſper, not a Breath of Air moves a Sprig of the Trees, or bends the Smoaks of the Chimneys: The Sea ſmooths its ſhining Surface, and the Sky gleams ſerene in Silence. 'Tis this ſame God, who orders his Cold to chill the Air, and ſtrip the Foreſts: To arreſt the Rivers in their rapid Motion, and bind them in Fetters of Ice: To ſeize the living Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, ſlacken the Motion of the Blood, and make the Limbs ſhake, and the Teeth chatter. 'Tis this ſame God, who makes his ſnows gently deſcend, ſport in the light Air, and whiten the ſoft Ground. At his Order, the beautiful Fleeces cover the Fields with a dazling and a warm Robe. He it is, that forms the ſlippery and gliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paths, and finiſhes the Looks and the Form of the rugged Lanſkip. Every little Riſing about us, the Banks of Snow, or the ſhining Ice, are the common Works of him, the God who made the Winter. He has made all the various Parts of it, and furniſhed and compleated the whole Scene.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005354_0008_1017218F9AE7E4C8"/>
Thus I have illuſtrated and confirmed the Doctrine; I come now to apply it to the holy Ends of Plety and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Learn the <hi>adorable Perfections of this GOD.</hi> See his Grandeur and Majeſty, in the terrible Work! How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous is his Challenge to mortal Man, in thoſe Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his Hands? Job xxxviii. 22, 23. <hi>Haſt thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Treaſures of the Snow? Or haſt thou ſeen the Treaſures of the Hail? Which I have reſerved againſt the Time of Trouble, againſt the Day of Battle and War?</hi> How grand and majeſtick is the God who has ſuch Magazines of Artillery; ſuch Armies of various Deſtruction all at his uncontroulable Command. See the Winter, and own the almighty Power and of the God who produced it. What a reſiſtleſs Arm muſt he have, who rolls on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their Order, and forms all the ſtrong Cold, and Wind, and Froſt of the Winter? <hi>Who can ſtand before his Cold?</hi> Who then can ſtand before him when once he is angry? Who knows the Power of his Anger? Even as his Fear, ſo is his Wrath.</p>
            <p>See the Winter, and own the Mercy of God, to bring Good out of Evil, and make it beneficial to the Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Year, and the Health of Mankind. See his Mercy in providing us Shelter from the keen Air, and Cloaths as the Covering from the Cold. He has built our Houſes for us; elſe had the Artificers laboured in vain. He has given us Fire to oppoſe the Cold, and defend us from its unſufferable and mortal Rigour. He gave our firſt Father Coats of Skin, and he gives us all our uſeful and beautiful Raiment, to hide us from the fatal Cold. The Winter all over ſhews the Mercy of the God who made it.</p>
            <p>See the Winter, and behold his Juſtice alſo. 'Twas for Sin that Cold became painful, and executes part of the Curſe upon the barren Earth. 'Tis not improbable, that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005354_0009_1017219FC60C7640"/>the Poſition of the Earth to the Sun, has been altered ſince the Sin of <hi>Adam:</hi> And how far the Flood which came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World of the Ungodly, has contributed to this, is diſputed among the Learned. 'Tis no unfair Conjecture, that the Diſruption of the Abyſs, and the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions of the Globe at that Time, might unhinge the Poles, and alter the Courſe of the Year. Perhaps this is hinted at, when God ſaid to <hi>Noah</hi> immediately after the Flood, that now there ſhould be no Ceſſation of Winter and Summer, and Cold and Heat. However that may be, we know the Curſe on the Earth for Sin, became more compleated by the Flood, which has very much alter'd the Form of the Earth, and the Healthineſs of the Air; and ſhortned the Life of Man. And we know the Painfulneſs and Unfruitfulneſs of the Winter Cold, is Part of that Curſe brought upon us by Sin. But I would not enlarge; let us ſee the Perfections of God in his Work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us <hi>ſerve God in the Winter.</hi> It is his Time: We ought then to render it to him, and fill it up in his Service. 'Twas for his own Glory that he made it: For this is his End in all his Works. <hi>For his Pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> 'Tis juſt then that we ſhould make the Winter conduce to his Glory, and glorify him in it, and for it. We are apt indeed to be rendred ſluggiſh and ſloathful by the Winter-Cold. Prov. xx. 4. <hi>The Sluggard will not Plough by reaſon of the Cold.</hi> But far be this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter from us! Amidſt the Cold let us be diligent: not ſlothful in Buſineſs, but fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord. Let not our Love wax cold with the Seaſon. Away with the invidious Proverb, <hi>Cold as Charity.</hi> Let us now, as far as God gives us Capacity and Opportunity, relieve the Neceſſities of our poor Neighbours. If a Brother of Siſter be naked and deſtitute of daily Food,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005354_0010_1017219131D72F90"/>and one of you ſay, Be ye warmed, be ye cloathed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ye give them not thoſe Things which are neceſſary for the Body, what doth it profit? Your Faith is dead, unleſs it inſpires theſe Works. And the great Demand of Chriſt at laſt will be concerning theſe Works and Labours of Love. And as we, in theſe Inſtances, deal by his Members, he will look upon himſelf honoured or abuſed.—<hi>I was naked, and ye cloathed me not</hi>—Or, <hi>I was naked, and ye cloathed me. Inaſmuch as ye have done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye did it unto me.</hi> Then ſhall not a Cup of cold Water loſe its Reward, much leſs ſhall a warm Garment, or a comfortable Fire, or a refreſhing Meal.—And as there are Duties peculiarly adapted to Winter, I ſhall conclude with a few profitable Meditations pertinent to the Seaſon. We may ſerve God, in his Winter, by making the Winter itſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to our ſacred Contemplations.</p>
            <p>For Inſtance, When we feel the <hi>Cold</hi> of the Winter, let us fear the God who made the Cold. How eaſily can he kill us by this one Creature? There have been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Perſons paſſing over the northern Mountains, ſeized and ſtiffened at once, and left like <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, a Pillar to be wonder'd at in after Years. In a dreadful Senſe, they <hi>ſtand</hi> before his Cold; ſtand <hi>by</hi> it, and are <hi>kept</hi> ſtanding, the Monuments of his awful Power.<note n="*" place="bottom">

Let the ſlippery Paths and the ſhort Days unite to perſwade us, to walk circumſpectly, redeeming the Time. This I ſay, Brethren, the Time is ſhort; Oh! ſhall we not fill up the ſhort Time as full as ever we can.
