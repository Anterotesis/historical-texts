            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE occaſion of our being collected to worſhip GOD is one of the moſt ſolemn that can be conceived. This day is appointed to cloſe the life of an unhappy perſon, who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for conſpiring againſt his country and all its privileges. He hath been judged by men in righteouſneſs, the ſentence of death pronounced, the day of execution come; an event indeed awful, and affecting to every mind of humanity or religion. Though juſtice to our country and reverence for its laws, forbids any thing that would impede a full execution of them; there is room for prayer to ALMIGHTY GOD that this days buſineſs may be bleſſed for our good, and that the unhappy criminal may receive the forgiveneſs of his ſins from GOD, though he cannot have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs from the State, conſiſtent with public ſafety.</p>
            <p>FOR reaſons, we muſt in charity hope, honeſt to himſelf, he refuſes to be preſent at this ſolemnity; my diſcourſe therefore will not be calculated, as hath been uſual on ſuch occaſions, for a dying creature who is to appear immediately before the GREAT
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015607_0004_0F99DBA25F5C2ED8"/>
JUDGE: but to aſſiſt my hearers in making an improvement of the event, for their own benefit.</p>
            <p>THE text from which I diſcourſe, is a direction of the apoſtle Paul to Timothy, for executing his miniſterial power with digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and for conducting the puniſhments that ſhould be inflicted on offenders, in ſuch manner, that all might derive benefit from them. Them, who ſin ſo as to make puniſhment neceſſary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke before all, that others may be deterred when they ſee the danger of tranſgreſſion—the infamy and miſery in which the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient are finally involved.</p>
            <p>THIS ſacred precept, though written originally to direct the church in its proceedings againſt offenders, may be applied with equal propriety to civil government. Several reaſons for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of tranſgreſſion are the ſame, both in the church of CHRIST, and in the civil ſtate; and there are the ſame reaſons that it ſhould be publicly inflicted—that others may fear and be guarded againſt temptation. If all men had faith in the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and government of JEHOVAH, and loved him with chriſtian affection, there would be no diſpoſition to do unreaſonable things; no other principles of obedience, would be neceſſary to maintain good order, holineſs and virtue. That all men have not faith, are not diſpoſed to live peaceably and juſtly, we know from the word of GOD, and from daily experience—Such is the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of human nature, that we need every motive which can be adduced in favor of virtue—every principle and paſſion of the ſoul, muſt be ſkilfully addreſſed to promote an habitual abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theſe things, which the LORD hateth on account of their unreaſonableneſs—of the diſhonor they bring on his laws and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment —and the damage done to mankind.</p>
            <p>THE event which calls us together is an awful and affecting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, of the danger of ſin—a warning to hold our paſſions and appetites in conſtant ſubjection to reaſon—to cultivate fixed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015607_0005_0F99DBA26E38C768"/>
principles of honeſty, juſtice and benevolence—to be conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtrict in obeying the laws of GOD, and our country.</p>
            <p>PERMIT me to conſider the following points.</p>
            <p>THE reaſons why it is neceſſary ſin ſhould be publicly rebuked and puniſhed by civil government.—The infamy and miſery which the wicked bring on themſelves in this world, by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the good laws of GOD and man.—The importance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtantly guarded, leſt inadvertently we plunge into deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction.</p>
            <p>I AM firſt to conſider ſome reaſons, why it is neceſſary that ſin ſhould be publicly puniſhed by civil government The moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant are, the glory of GOD—the ſafety of mankind—and that others may be deterred from wickedneſs by the example.—Each of theſe conſiderations warrant the ſeverity of human laws againſt iniquity.</p>
            <p>NATURAL religion and chriſtianity require us viſibly to exalt and glorify the MOST HIGH by all poſſible means. This duty is equally incumbent on individuals, and on public ſocieties; for both are preſerved by his providence, and under ſolemn ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations in their proper character to dignify his name and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, reverence his laws, and exert their whole influence for the ſupport of virtue. In the holy ſcriptures, GOD often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes civil ſocieties in their national character—reproves their vices—points out their danger—and promiſes public bleſſings as a reward of viſible morality, and of care to celebrate the honor of his name, and obedience to his laws.</p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT is a divine inſtitution, equally deſigned to encourage thoſe virtues GOD commands; as to ſupport the temporal intereſts of mankind. The particular mode is left to be determined by human wiſdom; but the inſtitution is divine.</p>
            <p>RULERS and judges of nations are called the miniſters of GOD,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015607_0006_0F99DBA32DF3C758"/>
for good unto men; and if miniſters of GOD ALMIGHTY, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to conſult his viſible glory. How can nations, their rulers and laws pay any reſpect unto the DEITY, unleſs they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage morality, and publicly puniſh the iniquities he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited? Is it not a part of national holineſs to frown on viſible ſin, and chaſtiſe the tranſactions, which diſhonor him by whom States are preſerved or deſtroyed? Doth not gratitude to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preſerver of empires direct, that the ungodly and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhould be puniſhed, and the friends of religion, good order and their country protected by its power. I have ſometimes heard the idea of national obligations to promote GOD's viſible honor derided; but if it is not thus, can conceive of no reaſons why mankind are addreſſed, warned, threatned and encouraged in that character.</p>
            <p>THE ſafety of mankind, is a ſecond reaſon, why ſin ſhould be puniſhed by the power of the State.</p>
            <p>THE law of ſelf-preſervation implanted in the mind by its cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, many times obliges ſocieties to exerciſe ſeverity for their own defence. All men are ſinful, and ſome ſo horridly wicked —ſo much influenced by covetouſneſs, envy and malice—ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of honeſty and juſtice, humanity and benevolence—ſo cruel to their neighbours and their country, as not to heſitate at any thing which will promote a temporary intereſt of their own, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever miſery may be brought thereby on others. Every wicked perſon is an enemy to GOD and man—inclined to gratify himſelf at the expence of their rights, prerogatives and exiſtence. Every ſinful diſpoſition—all the practices of iniquity, in their nature imply danger to mankind—are pointed againſt the peace, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and deareſt intereſts of the world; ſo that ſelf-preſervation, were there no other reaſons, ſhould induce States to diſcourage ſin by puniſhment.</p>
            <p>WERE there time for a particular enquiry, it might eaſily be
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015607_0007_0F99DBA45BDFAA78"/>
made evident that the diſpoſitions, paſſions and practices, which are denominated ſinful, are in their nature hoſtile to ALMIGHTY GOD, and to exiſtence generally. Hence the ſafety of mankind requires, that puniſhment ſhould be inflicted on thoſe, who will not be reſtrained by mildneſs from injuring their fellow-men. Is it not reaſonable—is it not juſt, that thoſe who have not the fear of GOD, who are not reſtrained by their own conſciences, ſhould be obliged by puniſhment to conſider ſin immediately dangerous to themſelves? Is it not proper that thoſe, who by their actions ſhew a fixed deſign againſt ſociety—a deſire to involve it in the moſt awful calamities, death or what is worſe, the torments of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; ſhould be cut off from the earth, and thereby prevented an opportunity of executing the intended miſchief. The revealed law of GOD warrants this proceeding, and enjoins on civil ſtates the preſervation of their intereſts, liberties and exiſtence, when it cannot be done otherwiſe, by cutting off the offenders from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. If there were need of juſtifying the divine law, it might eaſily be done from the experience of ages and hiſtory of the whole world. Human nature hath always been found ſuch— that where law and government ſo far loſt their energy, as not to be able to puniſh offenders; a numerous ſwarm of unjuſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, murderers, aſſaſſins and tyrants have immediately appeared to indulge their luſt and ſatiate their cruelty in the blood of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. This leads us to</p>
            <p>A THIRD reaſon, why puniſhment ſhould be publicly inflicted on the wicked—that others may ſee and fear. This principle hath mighty influence in preſerving that regularity, good order, honeſty and juſtice which ſubſiſts among mankind. I do not wiſh to calumniate human nature, or repreſent it more wicked, than it really is; but is it not probable—is it not certain, that if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of fear were wholly taken off the world would exhibit a ſcene of confuſion, of cruelty, of helliſh wickedneſs unparellelled by all diſcriptions that have been given. Have we not, my chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015607_0008_0F99DBA4A7F1FB90"/>
hearers, often felt ourſelves reſtrained by this principle? Should we not have done many more evil things, had not fear of men's indignation prevented? Sometimes we have feared the loſs of reputation—ſometimes of intereſt—ſometimes the more awful puniſhments inflicted by public juſtice. Even thoſe who gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally appear to be honeſt, well-meaning perſons, are at certain times ſo much influenced by paſſion and appetite; that they would commit horrid evils, were they not reſtrained by fear of the conſequences. For this reaſon it hath always been eſteemed proper, that puniſhments ſhould be inflicted in the moſt public manner poſſible—they are a warning, a ſolemn lecture to all who ſee and hear them, and ſpeak with the greateſt energy,
<q>watch and pray, leſt you enter into temptation,</q>
and commit thoſe evils which men muſt puniſh in this world for their own ſafety, and GOD ALMIGHTY in the other for the glory of his juſtice.</p>
            <p>WE will proceed to the ſecond branch of diſcourſe. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy and miſery which the wicked bring on themſelves in this world, by tranſgreſſing the good laws of GOD and man.</p>
            <p>EVERY violation of the divine law, and the righteous laws of ſociety is a moral evil—an abuſe of reaſon; and is intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with ſuch natural evils and miſeries, as are dreadful to be endured. Were we to be influenced by no motives but the peace and happineſs of this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ought to be holy and virtuous in all our conduct—temperate in our indulgencies—juſt, honeſt, faithful and benevolent in all connections with individuals and our country. All kinds of tranſgreſſion, which can be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, draw after them a horrid train of miſeries, ſufficient to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify the boldeſt mind, when they are realized and felt. Iniquity hath often a gaudy covering, which glitters at a diſtance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the unwarry into an opinion real happineſs is there —walk with it—embrace it—bring it home to the boſom, and it is death. Sin is only another name for miſery. So GOD's holy word hath warned us, ſo experience hath taught from the beginning of days,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015607_0009_0F99DBA777A68560"/>
yet <hi>fools indeed!</hi> we ſeek its indulgencies, and court its gains, at the expence of life. The apoſtle mentions three principal idols, to which the wicked ſacrifice, <hi>ſenſuality, covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>ambition.</hi> Their votaries, inſtead of finding the expected happineſs, plunge themſelves into <hi>miſery, loſs</hi> and <hi>infamy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT be the natural conſequences of indulging the animal affections and appetites, in wantonneſs and ſenſuality? Do they not produce pain and woe—a crazy body, loaded with ill-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, tormented with anxiety, and thick ſown with the ſeeds of death—a conſtitution bending over the grave at an untimely age by the weight of iniquity. What be the fruits of falſhood, fraud, injuſtice and cruelty? Should they be ſecreted from man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, which is impoſſible to be done any conſiderable time; yet they deprive the mind of that peace and ſerenity, which is better than life—they create a guilty accuſer within, from which it is impoſſible to flee: and when detected by the world, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and the confidence of others is forever loſt.</p>
            <p>WHEREVER the guilty perſon goes, he is eſteemed dangerous —in whatever character he acts, contemptible—in whatever bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs engaged, jealouſy watches him, detects his baſeneſs, and ſhould he chance to do an honeſt action, brands it with a falſe conſtruction. Every one judges him deſigning ſome miſchief, plotting ſome baſe, unrighteous advantage to himſelf, by the ſpoil of his neighbours, and deſtruction of his country. How awful the ſituation! to be eſteemed an enemy to mankind, and treated with that mortifying cautiouſneſs, which is uſed when dealing with one eſteemed to be a diſhoneſt and wicked perſon.</p>
            <p>This infamy, and ill opinion which we are obliged to entertain of the perſon, who deals in fraud, injuſtice and cruelty, is an evil greatly to be dreaded—to be cut off from the confidence of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, excluded the ſocial delights of virtue, and juſtly marked out an enemy to our neighbours and our country is bitter as death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:015607_0010_0F99DBA90B0B4540"/>THE unhappineſs is ſtill more encreaſed by a conſciouſneſs, which every ſuch perſon muſt have unleſs given up by GOD to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular impenitence, that he merits all the odium thrown upon him. <hi>The feelings of guilt are a death to the mind.</hi> Cain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed them truly, "<hi>every one that findeth me, ſhall ſlay me.</hi>" Whatever be the crime, there is ſomething of this nature in all guilty feelings.</p>
            <p>THESE conſequences, loſs of health, of reputation, of the friendſhip of mankind, of ſacred ſocial pleaſures, of public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, of peace in our minds, naturally flow from indulging the appetites, and violating the juſt laws of GOD and our country. Are they not ſufficient to deter every perſon from meddling with the myſteries of iniquity; and <hi>the greater half</hi> of its danger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains yet untold. Frequently it arreſts life cuts ſhort the time of probation and introduces to the juſt condemnation of GOD. <hi>The Almighty ſhall bring the wicked down into the pit of deſtruction: bloody and deceitful men ſhall not live out half their days.</hi> Vengeance cannot ſleep—they are either deſtroyed by the immediate act of GOD, to glorify his name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vindicate his juſtice; or men are reduced to the horrid neceſſity of cutting them off from the earth, for their own preſervation. When thoſe crimes are committed, which ſtrike at public life, the ſacred law of ſelf-preſervation commands the guilty name to be eraſed from among the people.</p>
            <p>THOUGH only a few crimes are made capital by the laws of the land, we ſhould eſteem every ſin tending to the ſame awful fate— vices through all their gradations are intimately connected— Such as knowingly indulge themſelves in ſmaller faults, have reaſon to fear the habit of iniquity will grow irreſiſtible—that GOD will permit them to do ſome great evil, which the juſtice of men muſt puniſh in the laſt and moſt awful manner. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who have come to an untimely end by the hand of public juſtice, in the laſt moments of their ſhame, have lamented the beginnings of vice, and dated their deſtruction from guilty prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015607_0011_0F99DBA92EFEDA70"/>
common among men—they began the fatal race no more wicked than their cotemporaries, but were permitted by GOD to indulge a ſinful heart, and execute purpoſes which end in the moſt public infamy and death. The preſent days buſineſs is a warning to all, to ſuch particularly as indulge themſelves in known ſin, to break off iniquity by repentance; leſt GOD AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY ſhould determine in anger to withdraw his reſtraint, and leave them to commit thoſe atrocious deeds which public juſtice muſt avenge.</p>
            <p>SUFFER me in the <hi>third place,</hi> to ſay a few words on the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of being <hi>conſtantly</hi> guarded againſt ſin.</p>
            <p>WE have briefly viewed the horrid calamities tranſgreſſors bring on themſelves by ſinful indulgence—the loſs of every deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bleſſing, and many times of life itſelf. Will not he who is wiſe be guarded againſt temptation? As we regard ourſelves; as we regard every thing that can be dear to a rational being, we ſhould take every ſtep with caution, and ruſh into no courſe without previous examination whether or not it be forbidden.</p>
            <p>TWO reaſons require us to keep a conſtant guard—there are many tempters ready to throw in the fatal inſinuation, when dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is leaſt ſuſpected—and our own ſinful paſſions are eaſily enkindled.</p>
            <p>FIRST. None are free from the influence of ſeducing ſpirits, who watch with infernal art to catch the unguarded moment— the choſen opportunity of deſtroying. From thoſe who reſiſt ſatan will flee; but the incautious and ſecure he will follow with temptation, until their infamy and deſtruction is ſealed. Added to the influence of evil ſpirits, there is the deſigning policy of wicked men, who take pleaſure in propagating calamity and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the unwarry into the paths of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>UNGODLY men, who mean to deſtroy, frequently make their approaches with an appearance of much friendſhip, and <hi>betray us
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015607_0012_0F99DBA9E9E80700"/>
to death with a kiſs,</hi> as Judas did the SON of GOD. On happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the company of thoſe, who profeſs veneration; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely inſinuate againſt the good laws of GOD or men, we ſhould immediately ſet a double guard—dwell on the danger—and not give up a ſingle moment to careleſneſs, for a moment may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. <hi>Watch and pray leſt ye enter into temptation,</hi> is a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent maxim for preſervation, and ſingularly neceſſary in a day of public calamity, when the State is in ſo critical a ſituation, that the diſhoneſty and bad example of a few perſons may ſhake its foundation.</p>
            <p>THE depraved principles and paſſions of human nature, which are eaſily excited, is a <hi>ſecond reaſon</hi> why we ſhould be conſtantly guarded againſt ſin.</p>
            <p>OUR paſſions, like the moſt combuſtible matter, may inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly kindle at the touch of a ſingle ſpark—our appetites which are huſhed into moderation one hour, may the next be fierce and victorious over reaſon, intereſt, duty, and every ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred obligation. Danger carried in our own breaſts, is doubly great. There is no moment, in which a wiſe perſon who knows himſelf will ſay, I am ſafe from falling by the corruption of my own nature.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Say not,</hi> my brethren, <hi>when ye are tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. For every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed. When luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin: and ſin when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death.</hi>" O how awful the death! both of body and ſpirit language looſes its energy in deſcribing things ſo awful. Glory to GOD! who is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver—Let us pray him to ſave us from the temptation of our own hearts—to give us chriſtian repentance, love and faith in his SON, that our ſins may be forgiven—that by the energy of his good ſpirit he would enable us to purify ourſelves, even as he is pure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:015607_0013_0F99DBAB1F0CD270"/>I WILL conclude with ſome obſervations ſuggeſted by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the day.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. IT learns us to love and revere our country, to obey its laws, to devote ourſelves to its ſervice, and abhor every practice which hath any tendency to increaſe the public calamities. Had the unhappy perſon who is ſoon to be executed done this; he might now have been proſperous, beloved and reſpected—as fair a candidate for long life, as any perſon in this great aſſembly. Now he is covered with infamy, bound in chains, ſurrounded with the inſtruments of horror and <hi>death.</hi> From his fate let us learn the danger of encouraging a traterous diſpoſition, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly attempting practices againſt our country; the mercy of men cannot pardon them, for darkneſs will not cover them, hell will not hide them. Our country, its privileges and laws are ſacred—they guard our peace, our intereſt and lives—being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted in a public manner, with the free conſent of the people, they become <hi>ordinances of God</hi>; and the tranſgreſſor offends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Heaven and earth.</hi> Our liberties and free conſtitution, are the patrimony which GOD ALMIGHTY hath given to every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual in the community; and is not that a cruel ſinner who would defraud his brethren of Heaven's ſacred and invaluable gift? and this may be done many ways—by open force and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate artifice—not only by throwing off the maſk and joining our enemies in the face of day; but by fomenting internal diviſion; by inſinuations againſt thoſe who ſtand foremoſt in the civil and military departments; by deſtroying public credit; by imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good government and the meaſures of defence; by violating our own laws enacted for the moſt ſalutary purpoſes; by every kind of diſhoneſty, fraud and injuſtice, which diſſolves that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which is the beauty and ſtrength of ſociety.</p>
            <p>IT is unhappy that ſo many are inſenſible of the veneration and punctual obedience due to the laws of the land. That people are not far from deſtruction, who diſobey the public acts of their
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015607_0014_0F99DBAB8E827270"/>
own government—who endeavor artfully to elude the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own legiſlature—who think themſelves better judges of ſafety, and the means of preſervation than the collected wiſdom of the whole—who are generally become ſo avaricious as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſmalleſt intereſts of their own, to the moſt capital and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred intereſts of the State. A nation generally of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, are the moſt miſerable on earth, are prepared for deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſerve all its horrors—deſtruction not only by a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign enemy, but by themſelves, by the hands of their brethren. I ardently wiſh there were no appearance of this nature among us. It is known, and cannot be ſecreted; that many prefer a <hi>ſordid gain</hi> to the ſalvation of their <hi>country, and would damn an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to ſhare a penny.</hi> I would not confine the charge of avarice to any particular character or claſs of men; for ſuch as till the field, and thoſe who barter the commodities of nations are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infected. Let ſuch perſons whatever their character may be in life; or however ſacred or ſafe they may eſteem themſelves, be warned by the proceedings of this day and do no more ſo wickedly. Their principles are the ſame, and their practices al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as dangerous, as thoſe which condemned the unhappy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who muſt die this day. The particular way in which a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man betrays his country, is but a circumſtance; the deſign of his heart, and the horrid effects of his practices, furniſh a true rule to determine his guilt. Is there not reaſon to think, that thoſe who knowingly injure the State by fraud, avarice and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, would plunge their ſwords into its bowels, if they had courage to face danger? Thoſe people have reaſon to fear, that a righteous GOD provoked by their diſhoneſty, will leave them to be tempted, and commit thoſe political ſins which muſt be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the halter and the gallows. My brethren, let us learn to love and venerate our country, to obey the laws, honor the conſtitution, and deſpiſe all thoſe who are wickedly undermining the privileges of mankind.</p>
            <p>LET us be prepared to bleed in defence of ourſelves, our friends
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015607_0015_0F99DBAD4FA2DE60"/>
and families, ſhould it be the will of GOD to call us thereto. We profeſs to be chriſtians; Can a chriſtian, can one who imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the temper and manners of the SON of GOD, wiſh ſervitude and the horrors of ſlavery to any creature on earth? Love to mankind, their happineſs and liberties, is eſſential to the religion of JESUS. He died to purchaſe preſent and future liberty for men; and we cannot with any propriety call ourſelves after his name, unleſs we are benevolent, love the peace and happineſs of others, and promote their good by all honeſty and juſtice.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. THE melancholy ſpectacle which is ſoon to be exhibited, hath drawn together a vaſt concourſe of people, who are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs influenced by various motives to be ſpectators of ſo awful a ſcene. Some by true ſeriouſneſs, and many to gratify a vain curioſity. Curioſity is but a poor motive for collecting on ſuch an occaſion—the perſon who can go and look on death, merely to gratify an idle humour, is deſtitute both of humanity and piety.</p>
            <p>SUCH awful exhibitions are deſigned that others may ſee and fear.—Go not to that place of horror with elevated ſpirits, and gay hearts, for death is there! juſtice and judgment are there! the power of government, diſplayed in its moſt awful form, is there.</p>
            <p>ONE reaſon why it is neceſſary the unhappy perſon ſhould thus die, is that others may be fortified againſt temptation by the ſpectacle of horror, and the bitter conſequences of tranſgreſſion. When you look thereon, learn the venerableneſs of the ſtate and of civil government—the ſacred nature of thoſe laws made to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect liberty and property, and our obligations to obedience— learn that ſin is puniſhed by infamy, diſtreſs and death—that the man who injures his country, and will not be reſtrained by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of duty, juſtice and gratitude, muſt be cut off from the earth that others may be ſafe—remember that leſſer ſins, though they are not made capital by the laws of the State, lead directly towards the ſame untimely end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:015607_0016_0F99DBADD59EB6B8"/>ABOVE all things, learn that we muſt all die. Though we may hope to eſcape the ſame circumſtances and manner of death; the change in one form or another is certain. Realize the importance of being prepared to leave the world—how it feels to be within a few minutes of eternity! of the bar of GOD! of the ſolemn ſentence which determines a ſtate of happineſs or miſery forever!</p>
            <p>WITH regard to the dying criminal, while you acquieſce in the neceſſity of his fate, give him your prayers. Though pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſafety forbids him pardon from the State, he may be pardoned by GOD ALMIGHTY. As chriſtians, forgive him—let not an idea that he hath ſinned againſt the country, keep alive the paſſions of hatred and revenge.</p>
            <p>REMEMBER the inſtruction of CHRIST, <hi>forgive our treſpaſſes as we forgive thoſe that treſpaſs againſt us—forgive your enemies, and pray for thoſe who uſe you wickedly</hi>—commend his ſpirit to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of GOD, and the SAVIOUR of men's ſouls.</p>
            <p>GOD grant, that the awful ſcene may do us good—confirm us in holineſs and virtue, in the love of GOD and our country— that it may guard us againſt temptation, and make us careful to live in all good conſcience towards GOD and men—that we may finally lay down theſe tabernacles of fleſh in peace, truſting in the SAVIOUR's merits, and be received to the holy preſence of GOD.</p>
            <p>TO HIM WHO RULES ALL THINGS ACCORDING TO HIS OWN PLEASURE AND WISDOM, WHO SAVES THE WORLD BY HIS BLOOD, AND SANCTIFIES THE UNGODLY, BE PRAISE, GLORY AND DOMINION FOREVER AND EVER, AMEN.</p>
