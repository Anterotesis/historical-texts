            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY conſtant Hurry of Buſineſs, made it doubtful for ſome Time, whether, or not, I ſhould comply with the Importunity of thoſe Friends who requeſted this Publication: Which is the Reaſon why it was delayed.</p>

            <p>FOR tho' this has been, and no doubt will ſtill be done in a better Manner, by thoſe who have more Leiſure, and a further Acquaintance with our political Affairs; yet, as it appear'd of Importance, that theſe Things ſhould be ſet in various Lights, and made as public as poſſible at ſuch a Seaſon, when ſo much depends on our being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly alarm'd, to the Defence of our Lives and Properties; I chearfully offer this Mite, ſuch as it is, to the Abundance others are doing, towards ſaving their Country from impending Ruin.</p>

            <p>I PRESUME, it will not be thought unſuitable to the Occaſion, to give you ſome hiſtorical and political Account, of the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> of our Enemies, and their wicked Deſigns againſt us; that we may have a proper Senſe of our Danger, and be excited to our Duty, in the preſent <hi>critical Juncture.</hi> To this Purpoſe, it will be proper we ſhould look back to the Source and Spring of our preſent Troubles; which are well known to be the <hi>boundleſs Ambition</hi> of the late Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and their inſatiable <hi>Thirſt</hi> after arbitrary Power, and univerſal Monarchy.</p>
            <p>WHOEVER conſiders, that <hi>France,</hi> from a ſmall and inconſiderable Kingdom, in a few Centuries, is become one of the moſt numerous and powerful in Europe, and by what <hi>arbitrary</hi> and <hi>unrighteous</hi> Methods, her Dominions have been extended; will be convinc'd, that all Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007373_0006_102B8B8A6581A388"/>from ſuch a dangerous Enemy, ſhould be guarded againſt, with the utmoſt Precaution.</p>
            <p>IN King HENRY the VIth's Time, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſſeſſed a great Part of their preſent Dominions
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Normandy, Picardy, Champaine,</hi> and the <hi>Iſle of France.</hi>
               </note>, and even <hi>Paris,</hi> the Metropolis, where he was crowned
<note n="§" place="bottom">1431.</note>. Their Territories ſince that Time, have been vaſtly enlarged, and very much at the Expence of the <hi>juſt Rights</hi> of their Neighbours; eſpecially by the preſent <hi>reigning Family,</hi> who are known by the Name of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon.</hi>—The firſt indeed of this Race, <hi>Henry</hi> IVth, who came to the Throne 1589, while a Proteſtant, diſcovered a very different Spirit, from his degenerate Offspring.—Tho', from Reaſons of State, he was induced to declare himſelf a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> yet he had ſo great a Regard to Juſtice and Gratitude, as to eſtabliſh the famous <hi>Edict of</hi> Nantz
<note n="†" place="bottom">So called, becauſe publiſhed in that City, 1598.</note>, in Favour of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who had advanced him to the Throne. This has done more Honour to his Memory, than all the warlike Exploits, whereby he acquir'd the Name of GREAT. But his Succeſſors and Poſterity, the <hi>Lewis</hi>'s, have, for above one Hundred Years paſt, been the <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Scourge</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and rendered their Reigns infamous, by perſecuting the Proteſtants, in Violation of the moſt <hi>ſolemn Engagements;</hi> whom <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIVth, in a Letter to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> acknowledged, were ſome of the beſt and moſt peaceable Subjects he had.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Scheme</hi> for abſolute Power, and univerſal Monarchy, was concerted, in the Minority of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIIIth
<note n="‡" place="bottom">He ſucceeded his Father, 1610, at about 9 Years of Age.</note>, by that haughty and aſpiring Miniſter, Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi> By Bribes and Force, depriving the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> of their Privileges, he endeavoured by every Stratagem, to render the <hi>King</hi> abſolute, and to enſlave the Subject; envying the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the Privileges granted them by <hi>Henry</hi> IVth, he raiſed a ſevere Perſecution againſt them; took away all the Places given as a Security, that the <hi>Edict of</hi> Nantz ſhould be obſerved; the laſt and moſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007373_0007_102B8B8BF2E3F058"/>important of which, <hi>viz. Rochelle,</hi> (being ſhamefully forſaken by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Iſt. notwithſtanding repeated Aſſurances of Aſſiſtance) after a terrible Siege of <hi>two</hi> Years, ſurrendered <hi>October</hi> 8th, 1628. Here we may date the Beginning of <hi>arbitrary Power,</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> In this Reign alſo, her Territories were conſiderably enlarged, and the Foundation of her future <hi>Greatneſs</hi> and <hi>tyrannizing</hi> over her Neighbours, was then laid.</p>
            <p>LEWIS XIVth, being in the 5th Year of his Age, at the Death of his Father, 1643, <hi>Cardinal Mazarine</hi> (equally noted for his Pride and Covetouſneſs) was admitted into the Adminiſtration, who effectually proſecuted the <hi>Plan</hi> laid by his Predeceſſor; rendered the Crown wholly abſolute; bereft the Subjects of the little Remains of Liberty; and upon them, and their Poſterity, rivetted the Chains of an abject <hi>Slavery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Beginning of his Adminiſtration, <hi>France</hi> made herſelf dreaded among her Neighbours, by a Series of Victories obtained in <hi>Flanders,</hi> againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> under the celebrated <hi>Prince of Conde,</hi> at a prodigious Expence of Blood. Tho', in the End, very little Advantage was derived from them, yet they ſerved to ſhow how little Regard was had to the <hi>Lives</hi> of their Fellow-Creatures. Soon after, indeed, his proud Deſigns, of extending the <hi>French</hi> Dominions, were, for a While obſtructed, by the civil Broils and inteſtine Wars, which, at that Time, prevailed in the Nation: They alſo met with an effectual <hi>Check,</hi> for a Seaſon, by the Valour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under <hi>Cromwel,</hi> when Diſputes with <hi>France</hi> were eaſily and ſpeedily ſettled, without any Bloodſhed. Witneſs, that haughty Miniſter's being obliged, by a <hi>ſingle Meſſage,</hi> contrary to his Intentions, to deliver up <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador
<note n="§" place="bottom">Delivered to <hi>Lockhart,</hi> 1659.</note>; and to ſtop the <hi>Duke of Savoy</hi> from perſecuting the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> tho' he pretended it was not within his Juriſdiction. But, notwithſtanding the Confuſion of a Civil War, at the celebrated Treaty of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007373_0008_102B8B8E48615ED8"/>
               <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> he had the Art and Policy to ſecure the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of <hi>Alſace,</hi> and ſome Parts of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſooner had <hi>Lewis</hi> XIVth taken the Reins of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into his own Hands, than he acts the <hi>Tyrant</hi> over his own People, and diſcovers his <hi>ambitious Deſigns</hi> of enſlaving the Reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi> Finding no better Pretence for falling on his Neighbours, he lays claim to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Franché-Comté,</hi> by his Wife <hi>(Maria Thereſia</hi> of <hi>Spain)</hi> tho' ſhe had expreſsly renounced all claim to it, on her Marriage; <hi>which,</hi> by a Series of <hi>bloody Battles</hi> and <hi>Sieges,</hi> at the Expence of Millions of <hi>Lives,</hi> he ſubdued: Tho' he was obliged to reſign the latter; yet, at the Treaty of <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">1668.</note>, he got confirmed to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> almoſt all the Places he had taken in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN 1672, without the leaſt plauſible Pretence for War, he makes the moſt formidable Preparations, to ſubdue the <hi>United Netherlands,</hi> and wholly to extirpate the <hi>Dutch Common-Wealth.</hi> The <hi>States General,</hi> in a very ſubmiſſive Manner, requeſted that his Majeſty would let them know, if thoſe <hi>mighty Preparations</hi> were deſigned againſt them: To whom that <hi>haughty Monarch</hi> made no other Reply, but, <q>That he ſhould employ his Troops in ſuch a Manner, as his Dignity deſerved, which did not require him to give an Account to any one.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ALL the Places that lay in his Way, fell an eaſy Prey to his victorious Arms. The Provinces of <hi>Utrecht, Overiſſel,</hi> and <hi>Guelders,</hi> with all the adjacent Places, being ſubdued, <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis,</hi> was juſt on the Point of being ſurrendered. So near and evident did their Ruin appear, that the moſt noted Families, who were fond of their <hi>Liberties,</hi> had actually prepared for a Remove to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> chuſing rather to live in the <hi>Extremities</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> than become the <hi>Slaves</hi> of a <hi>Tyrant.</hi> But divine Providence prevented their total Overthrow, which ſeemed inevitable, by ſundry favourable Interpoſitions.

            <p>JUST before the breaking out of the laſt War, <hi>the King of France</hi> fitted out a Fleet at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> with 16,000 Troops to invade <hi>England,</hi> in Favour of the <hi>Pretender;</hi> and had not Providence rais'd a Storm, which prevented their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, juſt as they were on our Coaſts, it is not improbable they might have accompliſhed their <hi>wicked Deſign,</hi> as the <hi>Nation</hi> was at that Time, unconcerned about, and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for, ſuch an Event.

The <hi>Line of Forts</hi> they have already between <hi>Canada</hi> and the <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> gives them an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Advantage, to draw off the <hi>Natives</hi> from <hi>our Alliance.</hi> To effect which, no Pains or Coſt, are ſpared, no Stratagem is left untried. We are well aſſured, they keep <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly among them, to inculcate the diſtinguiſhing Principles of their Religion; and what appears ſtill more important in their Eyes, to infuſe into their Minds, Prejudices againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and attach them to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt. They have been unwearied in their Pains, ſince the laſt Peace, in alienating their Affections from us. For this Purpoſe, they have deſired Liberty to ſend <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> among the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and have lately ſent them an <hi>Invitation</hi> to come and ſettle at <hi>Canada.</hi> Should they ſucceed in theſe Attempts, the Conſequence would be very pernicious. Our Frontier Settlements would be broke up, and all Hopes of driving the <hi>French</hi> from their <hi>Encroachments,</hi> be very much at an End.</p>
            <p>THEY are a <hi>warlike People:</hi> Governor SHIRLEY in one of his Speeches, if I don't miſtake, ſuppoſes they have 16,00 or 17,00 fighting Men; and having the moſt of the other <hi>Tribes</hi> under their Influence, are <hi>powerful Friends,</hi> and would be very <hi>dangerous Enemies.</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Twightwees,</hi> a numerous Tribe, in whoſe Country the <hi>French</hi> have lately built <hi>Forts,</hi> ſome Years ago entered into an Alliance with the Governor of <hi>Pennsylvania,</hi> which they have hitherto faithfully preſerved. In 1751, they eſpouſed our Cauſe, and revenged the Affront, which the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007373_0019_102B8BA22F3FDB10"/>
               <hi>French</hi> put upon us, in ſiezing and impriſoning our <hi>Traders,</hi> by bringing two of theirs to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and delivering them up to the <hi>Government.</hi> But unleſs ſome ſpeedy and vigorous Step be taken to ſecure them and ourſelves, their <hi>Friendſhip</hi> will be inevitably loſt, as they will be obliged to join the <hi>French</hi> in their own Defence.—Our weak and ill-concerted Meaſures to diſpoſſeſs the latter, have very much ſunk our Intereſt with the <hi>Indians.</hi> Since <hi>Colonel Waſhington</hi>'s Defeat, they appear wavering and ſhow an unuſual Degree of Coldneſs. Our formal Way of <hi>Treaties,</hi> and giving <hi>Preſents,</hi> ſignifies very little; half the Money well laid out in erecting <hi>Fortreſſes</hi> in their Country, and ſupporting proper <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> to reſide among them, would be much more to the Purpoſe. However, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it is Madneſs for us, by our <hi>dilatory Methods</hi> of proceeding, to increaſe the Advantage the <hi>French</hi> already have in their Hands, for depriving us of thoſe <hi>neceſſary Allies,</hi> who will have it very much in their Power, to turn the <hi>Scale</hi> in the preſent Diſpute. Our Eyes muſt ſurely, by this Time, be open, to ſee that the Schemes they have hitherto, ſo ſecretly laid, and artfully conducted, tend to, and if not ſeaſonably prevented, will iſſue in, the utter Deſtruction of all our <hi>Provinces.</hi> And if we view our Enemies, in a <hi>religious,</hi> as well as <hi>political</hi> Light, we ſhall ſee the Neceſſity of guarding againſt them with all poſſible Care.</p>
            <p>THEIR eſtabliſhed Religion is <hi>Popery;</hi> which, beſide all it's other <hi>Corruptions,</hi> diſpoſes them from Principle, to be cruel to <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> They are early taught as undoubted Truths, <hi>That there is no Salvation out of the Church of Rome;—That all who ſeparate from it are damnable Heretics;— That no Faith is to be kept with them;—That it is highly meritorious to uſe the moſt cruel Methods of reclaiming ſuch, and bringing them back into the Boſom of that</hi> Mother of Harlots;—<hi>and that all ſuch as are obſtinate, ought to be extirpated from the Face of the Earth.</hi> And what we are to expect, if God ſhould deliver us into their Hands, we
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007373_0020_102B8BA4AB7B2638"/>may learn from what <hi>our Brethren</hi> have ſuffered, whoſe Lot has been caſt among them.</p>
            <p>THE beginning of the <hi>Reformation</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was <hi>A. D.</hi> 1124; which ſpread very much, 1160, by Means of one <hi>Peter Waldo,</hi> of <hi>Lyons,</hi> from whom they were called, <hi>Waldenſes.</hi> And tho' there was a Perſecution rais'd againſt it, from its firſt Commencement, it was, by divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, wonderfully preſerved, and carried on. To paſs by numberleſs cruel and inhuman Methods, to deſtroy the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and ſuppreſs the <hi>Reformation,</hi> in the four following Centuries, I have only Time now to remark, That in 1572, there was the moſt <hi>barbarous Maſſacre,</hi> committed on the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſome of their chief Men, being invited, under an Oath of Safety, to ſolemnize the Marriage of the <hi>King of Navarre,</hi> were, at a Signal, by the Toll of the Bell, fallen upon, and <hi>inhumanly butchered</hi> by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> their being at the ſame Time an <hi>Inſurrection</hi> againſt them in the other Parts of the Kingdom. By all Accounts, a great Number, and by ſome, not leſs than 100,000, were ſlain in this <hi>perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Manner.</hi> But deteſtable as their Conduct was, the News of it was receiv'd with Joy, at <hi>Rome.</hi> They found a great Deliverer in <hi>King</hi> HENRY IVth; who, as hath been obſerved, was indebted to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> for his Crown, when the Papiſts, with the <hi>King of Spain,</hi> under the Influence of the <hi>Pope,</hi> were in League againſt him. To reward their Fidelity, or rather, being ſenſible how juſt and equitable it was, he eſtabliſhed the <hi>Edict of Nantz,</hi> by which free Liberty of Conſcience, in religious Matters, and Acceſs to all Places of Honour and Truſt, were ſecured to them; declared it to be <hi>perpetual</hi> and <hi>irrevocable;</hi> put 100 <hi>fortified Places</hi> into their Hands, as a <hi>Security,</hi> that it ſhould ever be obſerved. This was confirmed, by LEWIS XIIIth, tho' it was repeatedly violated in the Courſe of his Reign. The ſame <hi>Edict</hi> was confirmed alſo by LEWIS XIVth, and by him too declared <hi>perpetual</hi> and <hi>irrevocable;</hi> yet by the continual Remonſtrance of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and Inſinuations of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> a cruel Perſecution
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007373_0021_102B8BA6C460E920"/>was carried on againſt them, through a great Part of his Reign, which was very much increaſed, towards the Cloſe of it, when he acted, as if he was determined to extirpate them from his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>IN 1681, he publiſhed a <hi>Declaration,</hi> by which their Children were permitted, at the Age of 7 Years, to renounce their Religion. <q>In Conſequence of this, (<hi>ſays a French Writer</hi>

                     <hi>Voltaire</hi>'s Life of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIVth.</note>) great Numbers of Children were ſeized in the Provinces, with a View to make them abjure, and Troops quartered on their Parents.</q> At the Cloſe of the Year 1684, he ſet on foot the <hi>Helliſh Method</hi> of converting them, by <hi>Dragoons.</hi> The principal Men were aſſembled together, and ordered to <hi>abjure their Religion;</hi> and upon ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, the Soldiers were let looſe to treat them in the moſt inhuman and barbarous Manner. According to ſome Accounts near 500,000 Families were plundered. And to cut them off from that laſt and only Refuge, <hi>flying their Country,</hi> a <hi>Proclamation</hi> was iſſued, <hi>confiſcating</hi> all Eſtates that were ſold, if the Seller departed the Kingdom within a Year after: And as if this was not enough, Soldiers were quartered on the <hi>Frontiers,</hi> to ſeize any that attempted to make their Eſcape; and ſuch as they could apprehend, were confined to the <hi>Gallies.</hi> Multitudes however found Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of eſcaping, and took Refuge in <hi>England, Holland,</hi> and other <hi>Proteſtant Countries,</hi> where they were kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, eſpecially by <hi>King William,</hi> their great <hi>Patron;</hi> 
               <q>50,000 Families <hi>(ſays Voltaire)</hi> in the Space of three Years, left the Kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To convince you that I don't aggravate the Matter, hear the Words of a Letter from his Prime Miniſter
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The Marquis de</hi> Louvois.</note>, dated 1685, <q>It is his Majeſty's Pleaſure, that ſuch as refuſe to conform to his Religion, be proceeded againſt with the utmoſt Rigour, and that not the leaſt Indulgence be ſhewn to thoſe who affect the fooliſh Glory of being the laſt to comply.</q> And to uſe the Words of the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Author, <q>While all the Churches of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007373_0022_102B8BA86C658250"/>were thus every where demoliſhed, and Abjurations demanded in the Provinces, with an armed Force, the <hi>Edict of Nantz</hi> was at laſt revoked, in the Month of <hi>October,</hi> 1685; which compleated the Ruin of the <hi>Proteſtant Cauſe,</hi> already weakened and undermined on all Sides.</q> This may ſatisfy us, that no Security from a <hi>Popiſh Prince,</hi> for our religious Liberties, can ever be obtained. <hi>Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Oaths, even Edicts,</hi> declared <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual,</hi> ſtand for nothing, when made with <hi>Hereticks.</hi> With ſuch <hi>Bigotry</hi> and <hi>blind Zeal,</hi> does their Religion inſpire them, that they will perſecute their Subjects, againſt all the known and conſeſt Rules of good Policy.</p>
            <p>THEY had indeed ſome Reſpite from the <hi>Fury</hi> of their <hi>popiſh Adverſaries,</hi> while the <hi>Duke of Orleans</hi> was Regent of the Kingdom: But it has ſince been renewed again with the ſame Cruelty, under his preſent Majeſty, <hi>Lewis</hi> XVth; who, in the Year 1745, publiſhed an <hi>Edict,</hi> making it <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Death,</hi> for any Miniſters that officiated; <hi>perpetual Impriſonment</hi> for the Women, and <hi>Gallies</hi> for the Men, who attended; and few of the ſucceding Years, to the preſent Time, have been without Inſtances of the <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Treatment</hi> they have met with from <hi>popiſh Bigots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Year 1752, a Gentleman from <hi>Languedoc,</hi> writes thus, <q>The Perſecution is fiercer than ever, the Papiſts demand Abjuration of all that have been married, or had their Children baptized in Proteſtant Aſſemblies, and on the Refuſal, the Mothers are proclaimed <hi>Whores,</hi> and the Children <hi>Baſtards.</hi> They ſeize on Father, Mother, and Children, and force them into <hi>Romiſh Churches, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And by the lateſt Advices, <hi>Perſecutions</hi> ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in <hi>France,</hi> as furious as ever. A Letter from <hi>Paris,</hi> dated <hi>September</hi> 25, 1754, gives the following melancholly Account. <q>The Perſecution of the unhpapy <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> has been long carried on with great Rigour, and no Meaſures are neglected, either to diſturb their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, or ſeize their Miniſters. This appeared very particularly the 19th of <hi>June</hi> laſt, near <hi>St. Foy,</hi> in the <hi>Perigord,</hi> where an Aſſembly of Proteſtants being held
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007373_0023_102B8BAAEA5090B8"/>the Night before, a <hi>Detachment of Troops</hi> lay in <hi>Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade</hi> near the Place, to wait for their breaking up, and then fell upon theſe unhappy People, who could make no Reſiſtance, and dangerouſly wounded a great many of them: But, this is nothing to the Diſtreſs occaſioned in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and the <hi>Cevennes,</hi> by a general Search which was ordered to be made there the 3d of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, for which all the Troops that were in thoſe Provinces, were employed, except thoſe which ſerve to garriſon the <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Citadels:</hi> They were ordered to march in the Dead of the Night, and with all imaginable Silence, to inveſt certain <hi>Towns, Villages,</hi> and <hi>Country Houſes;</hi> a Liſt of which was given to every commanding Officer. At Break of Day, the Search was begun with all Rigour imaginable. The Soldiers burſt the Doors open with their <hi>Muſkets,</hi> and entering with their <hi>Bayonets</hi> at the End of them, ranſack'd every Corner of the Houſes, deſtroying every Thing that came in their Way, and ſparing neither Furniture nor Perſons. In ſhort, the Places they went to, could be compared to nothing but a Town taken by Storm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THUS you ſee, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Policy,</hi> the <hi>Treachery</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> of our <hi>Foes,</hi> have a dark and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Aſpect upon us. But I have a more diſtreſſing and affecting Scene to open to your View: I mean, our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure to the <hi>angry Reſentments of Heaven,</hi> from thoſe crying Abominations, which, at this Time, ſo greatly abound. To declaim againſt the prevailing Iniquities of the Day, is far from being a delightful Theme; but ſhould we, who are ſet as <hi>Watchmen on the Walls</hi> of God's <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> neglect to <hi>declare to his People, their Tranſgreſſions, and their Sins,</hi> we ſhould betray our Truſt, act beneath our <hi>ſacred Character,</hi> and involve our ſelves deeply in the <hi>public Guilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'TIS no leſs lamentable to be thought of, than true in Fact, that our Nation is greatly degenerated, and become extremely corrupt. <hi>We are a ſinful People, laden with Iniquity.</hi> From what kind of Heaven-daring Wickedneſs
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007373_0024_102B8BACC00F9060"/>are we free? If we begin at the Height of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and deſcend to the loweſt Pitch of <hi>Senſuality,</hi> and <hi>beaſtly Uncleaneſs,</hi> what Exception can be made? Are we not in all theſe Reſpects defiled? To ſuch a Degree of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have ſome profane Sinners arrived, as not only, like the <hi>Foot, to ſay in their Heart,</hi> but openly proclaim, <q>That there is no God;</q> and employ the very <hi>intellectual Powers</hi> he has given them, in diſputing againſt the <hi>Author</hi> of their Being. And what Multitudes live and act, as if they believed not his Exiſtence; or, as if they thought <hi>he was altogether ſuch an one as themſelves?</hi> How many make a Scoff and Banter of revealed Religion, pouring Contempt on the Goſpel, and all its Glories; <hi>denying the Lord that bought them, and bringing ſwift Deſtruction on themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>INFIDELITY,</hi> has of late Years, been ſpreading faſt in the Kingdom, and is evidently growing on the preſent Generation. Books, that turn the <hi>divine Oracles</hi> into Ridicule, and tend to unhinge Men's Minds, from all <hi>Principles of Religion,</hi> have been induſtriouſly propagated.</p>
            <p>THE lamentable Increaſe of <hi>Profaneſs,</hi> in our Day, muſt be manifeſt to the moſt careleſs Obſerver. What Numbers of thoughtleſs, ſtupid Sinners, ſhow an utter Diſregard to all that is <hi>ſacred</hi> and <hi>ſolemn;</hi> fill the Ears of all that hear them, with their vain Oaths, and horrid Imprecations; interline their filthy Diſcourſes, with the <hi>venerable Name</hi> of the ever bleſſed Deity; and in meer Sport, or, on every ſlight Provocation, wiſh Damnation to themſelves, and all around them. 'Tis eaſy to ſee, how this infamous Practice deſtroys all <hi>Reverence</hi> for an <hi>Oath;</hi> opens a Door to <hi>Perjury,</hi> and the whole Train of direful Conſequences that flow from it. And what ſhall we ſay, as to the various Kinds of <hi>Luxury, Lewdneſs,</hi> and vile <hi>Debauchery,</hi> which ſo much prevail? It is a Shame to ſpeak of the ſordid Methods invented by corrupt Minds, for the Gratification of their <hi>brutiſh Luſts;</hi> tho' many of theſe <hi>unclean Wretches,</hi> glory in their Shame, <hi>declaring their Sin, like</hi> Sodom, <hi>and hide it not.</hi>—Nay, too often many turn Factors for the Devil, and labour to promote his Kingdom,

               <q>Have not, <hi>ſays he,</hi> all the Abominations of the publick Stews, been opened to View, by lewd Pictures, expoſed to Sale at Noon Day? Have not Hiſtories or Romances of the vileſt Proſtitutes, been publiſhed? intended meerly to diſplay the moſt execrable Scenes of Lewdneſs; Lewdneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented without Diſguiſe, to inflame the corrupt Paſſions of the Youth of the Nation; and the quick Sale thoſe Pictures and Books had, is a deplorable Circumſtance, and ſad Inſtance of the corrupt Diſpoſition of many among us.</q> And that this <hi>excellent and pious Letter,</hi> ſhould be lampooned in the public <hi>News-Papers,</hi> is a flagrant Evidence to what a Height Impiety is arrived. And if the Sinners of our Land have not gone the ſame Length in all thoſe beaſtly Pleaſures, and deteſtable Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, 'tis evident they make ſwift Advances, and great Improvements in <hi>thoſe Myſteries of Iniquity.</hi>

            <p>TIME would fail me, to ſpeak of the open Contempt, every where caſt on God's holy Day; all the Ordinances of his Houſe, and all the Riches of his Grace, offered in the Goſpel; nor can I eaſily deſcribe the Gluttony and Drunkenneſs, Robbery and Deceit, Oppreſſion and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Pride and Covetouſneſs, for which our Land mourns. <hi>We look far Judgment, but behold Oppreſſion;</hi> for <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but behold a Cry.</hi>—Will any enquire, where are thoſe Enormities to be found?

Would to God there was nothing of this found among the Rulers of our Nation and Land;—that they were all <hi>Terrors to evil Doers,</hi> as their Office obliges them to be!</p>
            <p>ARE thoſe of the <hi>ſacred Profeſſion</hi> free from a Share in the <hi>public Guilt;</hi> who ſhould be the <hi>Salt of the Earth,</hi> the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> to keep it from Darkneſs and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

And does not Deſtruction threaten the <hi>Britiſh Nation,</hi> and her <hi>American Colonies,</hi> from
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007373_0028_102B8BB5619B7460"/>the ſame Quarter? Such Vices as now prevail, ſap the very <hi>Foundation</hi> of a Society, exhauſt its <hi>Riches,</hi> weaken its <hi>Power;</hi> deſtroy a Spirit of <hi>Induſtry, Frugality,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Oeconomy; introduce <hi>Idleneſs</hi> and <hi>Effeminacy; Diſcontent with,</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>Authority;</hi> which are the <hi>Bane</hi> of a People, and render them an <hi>eaſy Prey</hi> to their ambitious Neighbours. And do not theſe Things cry to Heaven, for Vengeance, and lay us open to the Diſpleaſure of an angry God? <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe Things, ſaith the Lord? And ſhall not my Soul be avenged on ſuch a Nation as this?</hi> Jer. v. 9. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks of it, as the uſual Method of divine Providence, <hi>to turn a fruitful Land into Barrenneſs. for the Wickedneſs of them that dwell therein,</hi> Pſal. cvii, 34. 'Tis true, public Judgments are executed in a Way of Sovereignty, on ſome Nations <hi>ſooner,</hi> and in a <hi>leſſer Degree,</hi> as a <hi>Warning</hi> to Repentance; on others, who are more ripe for Vengeance, <hi>later,</hi> but in a more <hi>terrible Manner:</hi> However, national Sins perſiſted in, unreformed, and unrepented of, will ſooner or later bring down the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Heaven.—The Reaſon is plain. As to <hi>particular Perſons,</hi> altho' Rewards and Puniſhments ſhould be ever ſo promiſcuous <hi>here,</hi> yet all will be rectified at the <hi>great Day;</hi> but <hi>Societies</hi> will be diſbanded; and if ever they are puniſhed as ſuch, it muſt be in this World. And, indeed, the Experience of all Ages, has verified the Obſervation of the wiſe Man, <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation, but Sin is a Reproach to any People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN this View, our Caſe looks <hi>dark;</hi> but bleſſed be God, not <hi>deſperate. Sentence againſt our evil Deeds is not yet execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Tho' God might in righteous Severity long before this, have caſt us off and left us to all the <hi>Miſery</hi> of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wholly abandoned by him, which we heard deſcribed in the former Part of the Day, yet he affords a Seaſon of Repentance, and waits to be gracious. He ſeems, with an amazing Condeſcention, and Kindneſs, to ſay to us as to <hi>Ephraim</hi> of old, <q>How ſhall I give thee up <hi>Ephraim?</hi> how ſhall I deliver thee <hi>Iſrael?</hi> How ſhall I make thee as <hi>Admah?</hi> How ſhall I ſet thee as <hi>Zeboim?</hi> Mine
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007373_0029_102B8BB6FA401818"/>Heart is turned within me, my Repentings are kindled together.</q> Our Danger from our <hi>Enemies,</hi> and eſpecially from our <hi>Sins,</hi> is great; ſo is our Encouragement from the <hi>ſovereign boundleſs Mercy</hi> of our God, and the many <hi>Tokens</hi> of his favourable Preſence which yet remain with us. We may apply to ourſelves the Words of the Prophet <hi>Jerem.</hi> li. 5. <q>For <hi>Iſrael</hi> has not been forſaken, nor <hi>Judah</hi> of his God, of the Lord of Hoſts, tho' the Land was filled with Sin againſt the holy one of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I TRUST there is yet Mercy in Store for us. God has in his ſovereign Goodneſs, choſen the <hi>Britiſh Nation</hi> to be the <hi>Bulwark</hi> of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> to hold up a Standard againſt thoſe <hi>Deluſions, Superſtitions,</hi> and <hi>Impoſtures,</hi> which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> has been for above a thouſand Years, ſpreading in the Chriſtian Church, and diſtinguiſhed it above all the <hi>Nations</hi> of the Earth, by the peculiar and conſtant Care of his Providence; by numberleſs <hi>ſignal Deliverances,</hi> and <hi>Salvations,</hi> which Time does not allow me to recount</p>
            <p>AND I can't but eſteem it a Token for Good, and Ground of great <hi>Encouragement,</hi> that, notwithſtanding all our <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Declenſions,</hi> there are ſtill among us, a <hi>Generation that fear God, whoſe righteous Souls are vexed from Day to Day, with the filthy Converſation of the Wicked;</hi> who are jealous for the Lord of Hoſts, and plead his Cauſe againſt the Workers of Iniquity, who are labouring by their <hi>Prayers,</hi> by their <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Influence,</hi> to reform a degenerate Age. How melancholly ſoever our Caſe is, it is not ſo bad as theirs, of whom God complains
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ezek. xxii. 30, 31.</note>: <hi>And I ſought for a Man among them, that ſhould make up the Hedge, and ſtand in the Gap before me, for the Land, that I ſhould not deſtroy it; but I found none: Therefore have I poured out my Indignation upon them: I have conſumed them with the Fire of my Wrath; their own Way have I recompenſed upon their Heads, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> We may indeed ſay with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophet
<note n="§" place="bottom">Iſai. i. 9.</note>, <hi>Except the Lord of Hoſts had left unto us a</hi>

But bleſſed be God, ſuch <hi>a Remnant</hi> is left, who have an Intereſt at the Throne of Grace, and improve it in daily Supplications, not only for themſelves, their Families, and the Church of God, but for the <hi>Land</hi> of their Nativity, that God would ſave it from deſerved <hi>Ruin,</hi> and not come out againſt it, and deſtroy it with a <hi>Curſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING thus, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> laid before you ſomething of our Danger, from the <hi>Power,</hi> the <hi>Pride,</hi> and the <hi>Policy</hi> of our Enemies, the Greatneſs of our Sins, and at the ſame Time, what Grounds we have to hope, that we are not forſaken by God; but that there is yet Mercy in Store for us. It only remains, that I briefly point out our Duty in this <hi>important Seaſon,</hi> which it becomes us to hear, with Hearts fully diſpoſed to a ready and unfeigned <hi>Compliance:</hi> And I think it lies plain before us, and may be conciſely ſummed up under the following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. WE ought to humble ourſelves; repent as in <hi>Duſt and Aſhes,</hi> before God, and return to him with all our Hearts, from whom we have ſo grievouſly revolted. The Voice of divine Providence to us, at this Time, may well be expreſſed in the Words of the Prophet
<note n="*" place="bottom">Joel 11.12, 13, 14.</note>, <hi>Therefore alſo now ſaith the Lord, Turn ye even to me, with all your Heart, and with faſting, and with weeping, and with mourning, and rent your Heart, and not your Garments, and turn unto the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful, ſlow to Anger, and of great Kindneſs, and repenteth him of the Evil. Who knoweth, if he will return, and repent, and leave a Bleſſing behind him, even a Meat-Offering, and a Drink-Offering, unto the Lord your God.</hi> 'Tis not enough that we ſpeak of public Sins, as being Matter of Lamentation, and confeſs them in a <hi>formal Way,</hi> in our Prayers, on ſuch an Occaſion as this; but we ſhould in our <hi>private,</hi> as well as <hi>public</hi> Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace, bring our Caſe before God, with <hi>broken Hearts,</hi> and <hi>contrite Spirits,</hi> ſaying with the great Reformer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Ezra IX. 7, 10, and 15.</note>, <hi>O! our God,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:007373_0031_102B8BBB73EE28B0"/>
               <hi>we are aſhamed, and bluſh to lift up our Faces to thee; for our Iniquities are increaſed over our Heads, and our Treſpaſſes are grown up into the Heavens.</hi> The following Words we may adopt, with a little Variation: <hi>Since the Days of our Fathers have we been in a great Treſpaſs, unto this Day, and for our Iniquities, we, our Kings, and our Prieſts,</hi> our Nobles and our Commons, <hi>may</hi> juſtly <hi>be delivered into the Hands of the King,</hi> who ſeeks our Ruin, <hi>to the Sword, to Captivity, to a Spoil, and to Confuſion of Face.—And now, O our God! what ſhall we ſay after this; for we have forſaken thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.—O Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thou art righteous; for we remain yet eſcaped, as it is this Day, behold we are before thee in our Treſpaſſes, and we cannot ſtand before thee, becauſe of this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſuch a Day, <q>Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord, and all his People weep, between the Porch and the Altar; and let them ſay, Spare thy People, O Lord, and give not thy Heritage to Reproach, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſhould rule over them. Wherefore ſhould they ſay among the People, where is their God? Then will the Lord be jealous for this Land, and pity this People.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. We ſhould labour after a thorough <hi>Reformation.</hi> Our Faſtings, Humiliation, and Shews of Repentance, will ſignify Nothing without this. O! how much is a general thorough Reformation, to be deſired! how vigorouſly ſhould it be attempted, by all that have the Honour of God, and Intereſt of their Country at Heart! When our Land is ſinking under the Load of <hi>public Guilt,</hi> and Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is coming in upon us, like a <hi>Flood,</hi> ſhall we not lift up a <hi>Standard</hi> againſt it, and labour to <hi>prevent</hi> the <hi>Ruin</hi> we fear and deſerve, by <hi>removing</hi> the <hi>Cauſe?</hi> Did but an holy Ardor, and Zeal for this <hi>noble Work,</hi> begin to kindle among every Order and Rank of Men, it would be a Token for Good; it would enliven our Hopes, and invigorate all our Attempts for the Protection and Defence of our Country. For how little ſoever we may think of it, our <hi>worſt Enemies</hi> are thoſe of our <hi>own Houſe;</hi> our multiplied Tranſgreſſions, which expoſe us to the Angry Reſentments of Heaven:
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007373_0032_102B8BBD48428C38"/>And were <hi>theſe</hi> ſubdued, <hi>theſe</hi> that now riſe up againſt us, and ſeek our Ruin, I doubt not would ſoon be made to flee before us.</p>
            <p>How <hi>deſirable</hi> a Proſpect would it therefore afford, ſhould all according to their various Stations and Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>cordially unite</hi> in this neceſſary Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> THE <hi>civil Magiſtrates</hi> in the Land, are loudly called upon in ſuch a Day, to exert the <hi>Authority</hi> God has put into their Hands, for the <hi>Suppreſſion</hi> of Vice and Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. They are appointed to execute Wrath on evil Doers
<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xiii. 3.</note>, and did they conſcientiouſly put in <hi>Execution</hi> the many <hi>excellent Laws</hi> we have againſt Vice, and ſtrike a Dread into preſumptuous Sinners, by reſtraining their enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and ſcandalous Crimes, it would be of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Service</hi> to the <hi>public Intereſt;</hi> give Life and Vigour to all Attempts for a Reformation. When Men of <hi>ſuperior Characters</hi> and <hi>Influence,</hi> appear againſt Sin, it puts it <hi>out of Countenance,</hi> and the Vicious are aſhamed to ſhow their Heads. They might do much towards putting a Stop to that Torrent of Iniquity, that threatens the Ruin of our Land. And ſurely they are not only by the <hi>ſacred Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of their <hi>Oath,</hi> but by a Regard to the <hi>dying Cauſe</hi> of their <hi>Country,</hi> and as they would not have the Public Guilt crying againſt them at the laſt Day, bound to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at ſuch a Seaſon, and not bear the <hi>Sword of Juſtice</hi> in vain. And ſhould they add to their Authority, the <hi>engaging Force</hi> of their ſuperior <hi>Example,</hi> for the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Piety towards God; Juſtice and Charity, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men; Sobriety, Frugality and Chaſtity,—who can ſay how far the <hi>kind Influence</hi> might extend?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> AND ſurely it concerns thoſe of the <hi>ſacred Order,</hi> of every Denomination, moſt heartily to engage in ſuch a Deſign. 'Tis juſtly expected, that we ſhould appear on the Lord's Side, againſt the Workers of Iniquity. Our <hi>Profeſſion</hi> obliges us to give the <hi>Alarm</hi> of <hi>impending Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> to ſhew to God's People, their Tranſgreſſion and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007373_0033_102B8BBED4E04CA0"/>Sin, as the procuring Cauſe of all the Calamities we feel, or fear.—Methinks at ſuch a Day, we ſhould lay aſide all Bigotry, and <hi>Party Diſputes,</hi> about leſſer Matters, and <hi>unite</hi> our Endeavours, to reform a degenerate Age. We may ſoon be <hi>Companions</hi> in ſuffering, and ſee all our <hi>Differences</hi> buried in one <hi>common Ruin.</hi> There has perhaps ſcarce ever been a Time, when Miniſters were more loudly called upon, to unite their Activity and Diligence, in awakening a ſecure Generation from the Lethargy into which they are ſunk, and exciting them to a ſpeedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Reformation, as the <hi>neceſſary Means</hi> of ſaving a guilty Land. When we look around, and ſee how Iniquity abounds; how God is diſhonoured; the Cauſe of our glorious Redeemer deſpiſed and ridiculed by ſome; ſlighted and diſregarded by moſt; can we be <hi>unaffected</hi> with the mournful Scene? Shall we ſtand as <hi>unconcerned</hi> Spectators, of all the Profaneneſs and Security which is ſo viſible and lamentable, in thoughtleſs Sinners? Of all the Hypocriſy, Formality and Apoſtacies among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors? Where is our <hi>Zeal</hi> for the LORD OF HOSTS? our Bowels of <hi>Compaſſion</hi> for <hi>periſhing</hi> Sinners? our <hi>Concern</hi> for the <hi>ſinking Intereſt</hi> of the Common-wealth? When the <hi>Ark of God</hi> is juſt ready to <hi>depart</hi> from us, and with it, all our Privileges, to be careleſs and unconcerned about <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving</hi> the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the divine Diſpleaſure, muſt be <hi>unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable</hi> Stupidity. We have every Thing to awaken our Zeal, and animate to Diligence in our great Work. Our Mouths may ſoon be ſtopped, and we called to ſeal our Teſtimony with our own Blood. What therefore we have to do for God, the <hi>Souls</hi> of our Hearers, and for our <hi>Country,</hi> we ſhould do quickly, and <hi>with all our Might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> PARENTS and <hi>Governors</hi> of <hi>Families,</hi> ſhould uſe their Authority and Influence, for the reforming a corrupt and wicked Generation. Upon a careful Enquiry, we ſhall find, that almoſt all the prevailing Corruptions of the Times, ſpring from the Want of proper Government, Diſcipline, and Inſtruction in Families, which are <hi>Nurſeries</hi> where Youth are ſormed for the Public, when they are
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007373_0034_102B8BC1B79B9C68"/>moſt <hi>ſuſceptible</hi> of any Impreſſions, and moſt like to <hi>retain</hi> them. Then the <hi>Foundation</hi> is moſt commonly laid for their being <hi>Bleſſings</hi> or <hi>Plagues,</hi> to the World.—It can't eaſily be expreſſed, how much the Welfare of Church and State depends on the <hi>proper Management</hi> of the riſing Generation. The <hi>firſt</hi> Part of Education enters much <hi>farther</hi> into Life, has a <hi>greater Influence</hi> on the Whole of Perſons <hi>future</hi> Conduct, than moſt imagine; and an <hi>Error here</hi> is often attended with a long Train of <hi>pernicious</hi> Conſequences. <hi>Ungoverned Families,</hi> where Children and Servants are not inſtructed in the great Things of Religion, but trained up in <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and ſuffered to walk in the <hi>Ways of their own Heart,</hi> and in the <hi>Sight of their own Eyes,</hi> are the <hi>Bane</hi> of Societies, and do unknown Miſchief in the World; and ſuch ſhould tremble to think, how much of the <hi>common Guilt</hi> will be found at their Door, and how deep a Share they will have in the <hi>Ruin</hi> of their Country, if, when their Sons and Daughters make themſelvs vile, they don't reſtrain them. Would <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi> conſcientiouſly diſcharge their important Truſt to their Children and Servants, open to them the <hi>great Truths</hi> of Chriſtianity, and ſolemly impreſs them on their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, paint out the <hi>fatal Conſequences</hi> of Sin; the <hi>Beauty</hi> of Holineſs, the <hi>Excellency</hi> of a Life ſpent in ſerving God and their Generation; with affectionate Exhortations, Warnings and Entreaties, and prohibit them from ſuch fooliſh Diverſions, and extravagant Pleaſures, as debauch their Minds, and ſpoil their Morals; innure them to Temperance, Sobriety, Induſtry and Frugality, enforcing all by an Example of Piety and Virtue; what <hi>happy Influence</hi> would it have, to produce the Reformation, that is ſo much wanted! What <hi>delightful</hi> Proſpect would it afford, to behold a Generation riſing up to ſerve God, to ſupport his Cauſe, and hand down Religion to thoſe that are yet unborn! Surely ſuch as have any Regard for the Glory of God, the Welfare of their Poſterity, or the Felicity of their Country, dare not live in the Neglect of ſo reaſonable and neceſſary a Duty. In a Word, Perſons
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007373_0035_102B8BC346873BF0"/>of <hi>every</hi> Station, Character and Relation in Life, ſhould think themſelves concerned, to <hi>contribute</hi> all that lies in their Power, towards <hi>reforming</hi> this corrupt and licentious Age. And ſurely, if we feel <hi>any warm Zeal</hi> for the Honour of <hi>Religion,</hi> any <hi>due Affection</hi> for our dear <hi>Country,</hi> or any <hi>Compaſſion</hi> to thoſe abandon'd Sinners, who are pulling down the Wrath of God on themſelves and us, we ſhall be vigorous and active, in this laudable Deſign. I can't leave this Head, without adding my earneſt Wiſh, that Men of Influence and public Spirit, would, according to the Example ſet them in their Mother Country, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſet up in the ſeveral Parts of the Land, <hi>Societies for Reformation of Manners,</hi> founded on ſuch a <hi>Plan,</hi> as that Perſons of <hi>different</hi> Denominations might unite in them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. WE ought to acknowledge our <hi>Dependance</hi> on God, and look to Heaven for Direction and Aſſiſtance, againſt our Enemies; with a deep Senſe of the <hi>Inſufficiency</hi> of human Wiſdom and Strength, without divine Help. Nothing is more provoking to God, than for a People to caſt off their Dependance upon him; overlook <hi>his Hand</hi> in all the ſignal Diſpenſations of his Providence, and act as tho' the <hi>Source</hi> of their Safety was wholly <hi>in themſelves.</hi> Too much of this <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Infidelity</hi> has evidently appeared in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, which I look upon as one of the darkeſt Symptoms upon us. It was Matter of Grief and Aſtoniſhment, to all that had any Senſe of Religion left, to obſerve how very little Regard we ſhowed to an <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence,</hi> by our public Conduct in the late War
<note n="†" place="bottom">The Conduct of <hi>New-England,</hi> in taking <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> muſt be excepted. See Mr. <hi>Prince</hi>'s excellent Sermon, on the Occaſion.</note>, how we ſeemed to ground all our Expectations on our <hi>own Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and as it were, bid Defiance to God and Man. This mournful Obſervation is abundantly confirmed, by the ingenious and ſerious Author of a Pamphlet, entitled, <hi>Britain's Remembrancer:</hi> Having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſome ſuch Paſſages in the <hi>public Prints,</hi> as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> "Our Fleets are in high Spirits, <hi>&amp;c."</hi>

               <q>Let <hi>England</hi> but take Care of her Fleets, and what has ſhe to fear?</q> In all which, ſays he, there is ſo far from any Appearance of a <hi>Senſe</hi> of <hi>Dependance upon Heaven,</hi> that we ſeem rather deſirous to ſtand by our <hi>own Strength,</hi> than be beholding to the God of Battles. And ſpeaking of declaring War with <hi>Spain,</hi> he adds, <q>I appeal to Thouſands, who ſaw it declared, whether there appeared in the Behaviour and Converſation of the People of <hi>London,</hi> on that Occaſion, the leaſt Senſe of Humanity for their Fellow-Creatures, that were like to periſh in it, or the leaſt Dependance on Heaven, for the Succeſs of it; or whether the Spirit which reigned at that Time in <hi>England,</hi> was not a Spirit of Inſolence, and Defiance both of God and Man.</q> That an Account of one of the moſt <hi>remarkable</hi> Tranſactions in the whole War, in which there was ſuch a Series of <hi>eminent Dangers,</hi> and <hi>ſignal Deliverances,</hi> ſhould be wrote by a <hi>Clergyman</hi>

            <p>WE may boaſt of our <hi>Strength,</hi> by Sea and Land; of our <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> imagine our Schemes are ſo well contrived, that nothing will prevent their Succeſs: Yet if God be not for us, our <hi>Strength</hi> will be but <hi>Weakneſs;</hi> our <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> but <hi>Folly;</hi> and we ſhall fall an eaſy Prey to our ambitious Foes. 'Tis infinitely eaſy with God, to defeat the Devices of the deepeſt Policy. What Madneſs therefore and Folly, as well as great Wickedneſs, is it, to put our Confidence in an <hi>Arm</hi> of <hi>Fleſh?</hi> And we ſhould tremble at the Thoughts of it, when God has ſaid, <hi>Curſed be he that putteth his Truſt in Man, and maketh Fleſh his Arm.</hi> And ſurely we ſhall be more <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> than any Nation under Heaven, if we caſt off our Dependance upon God, when he has repeatedly, in a moſt remarkable Manner, appeared for our Deliverance and Salvation.

WHILE our Eyes are to Heaven, for Direction and Aſſiſtance, we ſhould <hi>vigorouſly exert</hi> ourſelves in our own <hi>Defence,</hi> by all thoſe <hi>Means</hi> that the Providence of God has put into our Power.

            <p>WHEN God has appointed Means for our Safety, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly to neglect them, vainly imagining <hi>Deliverance</hi> will come in ſome <hi>miraculous</hi> Way, is not <hi>Faith,</hi> but <hi>Folly;</hi> not <hi>Confidence,</hi> but <hi>Madneſs.</hi> And who does not ſee, that the preſent <hi>Defenceleſs State</hi> of our Southern Provinces, is not the Effect of <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Dependance</hi> on God, but either of <hi>meer Sloth,</hi> or <hi>ſordid Covetouſneſs.</hi>

            <p>WE ſhall not, I preſume, pretend that our preſent Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ariſes from our having ſo much a <hi>greater</hi> Senſe of Religion; Diſpoſition to acknowledge God, and depend upon him, than <hi>our Neighbours.</hi> Muſt we not rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, it flows from the <hi>Want</hi> of a becoming Senſibility of the invaluable Privileges we enjoy, and of the Greatneſs of our Danger, tho' it be ſo near and apparent.—But I truſt, after all that has been ſaid, to open our Eyes and alarm our Fears, we ſhall not any longer fold our Hands together, and cry, <hi>A little more Sleep, and a little more Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> 'Tis <hi>high Time</hi> to look about us, and vigorouſly fall upon every proper Method of Defence.</p>

WHAT a Pity, that at ſuch a Time, there ſhould be any <hi>Contention</hi> between our <hi>Governors,</hi> and reſpective <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> but who ſhould be <hi>moſt</hi> forward and zealous in the Service of their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi> All private and <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Deſigns; all petty Diſputes and Contentions, ſhould be ſwallowed up in a <hi>diſintereſted</hi> View to, and Concern for, the public Good. Of what Importance is it, that our Repreſentatives ſhould have <hi>enlarged Views,</hi> of the public Intereſt, and a <hi>deep Senſe,</hi> how much the Welfare of their Country, depends upon <hi>their Conduct,</hi> in this difficult Day.—Nothing can be plainer, than that a <hi>parſimonious</hi> Spirit, at ſuch a Time, opens a Door to the moſt <hi>extravagant</hi> Expence. To do Things by <hi>Halves,</hi> is worſe, than doing nothing at all. This we have learnt by fatal Experience. What £. 10,000 would have done, when we <hi>firſt</hi> had the Alarm, £. 100,000, 'tis probable, will not <hi>now</hi> effect; and 'tis conſtantly <hi>increaſing</hi> on our Hands, thro' the Vigilance, Activity, and continual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of our Enemies. And ſhould they by our Delays, and <hi>ſtingy</hi> Proviſions for Defence, thro' Fear of putting the Country to Charges, make it the Seat of a long diſtreſſing War, there is no computing the Expence, and Number of Lives it may coſt. <hi>War</hi> is, indeed, to be deprecated; both Conquerors, and Conquered, are ſure to feel the ſad Effects of it, more or leſs; and <hi>Peace</hi> is ſo great a Bleſſing, that it is to be <hi>purſued</hi> by all juſt and rational Methods. But the Way to have Peace in the preſent Caſe, is to make a ſpeedy and vigorous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for War: Had this been done more ſeaſonably, it might have prevented all we now fear. There ſeems but two poſſible Ways left, to avoid the War we are threatned with from <hi>France.</hi> The one, tamely to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to their unrighteous Encroachments; quietly reſign up our Poſſeſſions, and all our Privileges, into the Hands of a lawleſs Tyrant; and expoſe ourſelves and Poſterity, to the mad Zeal and Fury, of cruel perſecuting Bigots.— The other is, to let them ſpeedily know, that we have it in our Power to <hi>force</hi> them, to reaſonable Terms, and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:007373_0040_102B8BCDC33430C0"/>
               <hi>oblige</hi> them to keep within their own Limits; and I need not ſay which, both Duty and Intereſt, lead us to take.</p>
            <p>WERE the ſeveral Provinces thoroughly engaged, to take ſome ſpeedy, vigorous Steps, for the Protection and Defence of the Land, it might ſtrike ſuch Dread into our Enemies, whoſe Inſolence and Courage, ariſe chiefly from our Sloth and Stupidity, as might divert the Storm that is now gathering faſt upon us. And methinks we have every Thing to awaken our <hi>Fears,</hi> and animate our <hi>Hopes.</hi> On the one Hand, there is Poverty, Slavery, Perſecution and Death; on the other, a fruitful Country, pleaſant Habitations, <hi>Britiſh</hi> Liberty, and what is dearer than all, undefiled Chriſtianity. And do not let us put far away the evil Day. <hi>Delays</hi> may prove of the moſt fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; our Danger may be much <hi>nearer,</hi> and much <hi>greater</hi> than we imagine.</p>
            <p>SHOULD the <hi>French,</hi> agreeable to their known Perfidy, before they declare War, ſend a Fleet, with a large Army of well-diſciplined Troops, to lay waſte, and deſtroy our Coaſts; while the <hi>ſavage Natives,</hi> whoſe tender Mercies, are Cruelty, join them in falling on our <hi>Frontiers,</hi> what a a diſtreſſing Scene opens to our View? Our Sea-port <hi>Towns</hi> ſack'd, and laid in Aſhes!—Our Country ravaged! our <hi>Houſes</hi> plundered!—The Voice of Lamentation and Woe heard in our Streets!—Our <hi>Men</hi> ſlaughtered!—Our <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> delivered to the Luſts and Fury of a lawleſs Soldiery!—Our helpleſs <hi>Babes</hi> daſhed againſt the Stones!—Men looking on the right Hand for Help, and on the Left there is none to deliver! Their Hearts failing them for Fear, while they hear the confuſed Noiſe of War; ſee Garments rolled in Blood, and the inſulting Foe ſpreading Deſolation and Ruin all around!—But I muſt ſtop:—The <hi>tragical</hi> Scene is too diſtreſſing, even in <hi>diſtant</hi> Proſpect! And is there a <hi>emote Probability,</hi> is there <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Danger,</hi> of our being thrown into ſuch univerſal Tumult and Confuſion and ſhall we not <hi>exert</hi> ourſelves, in making the moſt ſpeedy and effectual Preparation againſt it? What Folly, what Madneſs; nay I may
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007373_0041_102B8BCF4EB117D8"/>ſay, what <hi>Cruelty</hi> to ourſelves and Poſterity, is it, to run the Riſk of having Deſolation, Anguiſh and Deſpair, ſpread thro' the Land, by a ſudden Invaſion, while we are ſo ſhamefully unprepared, to make any proper Defence.</p>
            <p>WE have every Thing to alarm, to rouſe and animate us, in ſuch a Day as this, when all that is valuable, all that is dear, lies at Stake. Shall we tamely ſuffer our delightful Poſſeſſions, to be taken from us?—become the Dupes and Slaves of a <hi>French</hi> Tyrant? What!—ſacrifice our precious Liberty, our Property, and what is more, our Religion, to our Sloth? entail Miſery, Slavery, and Ruin, on our Poſterity, by our Indolence and Cowardice! God forbid! 'Tis high Time, to awake, to call up all the <hi>Briton</hi> in us, every Spark of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour; chearfully to offer our Purſes, our Arms, and our Lives, to the Defence of our Country, our holy Religion, our excellent Conſtitution, and invaluable Liberties. For what is Life, without <hi>Liberty?</hi> without the Enjoyment of the glorious <hi>Goſpel</hi> of Chriſt, depending on the <hi>Will</hi> of a <hi>Tyrant</hi> and expoſed to all the <hi>Inſults</hi> of perſecuting <hi>Bigots?</hi> 'Tis not worth hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A <hi>free-born Briton,</hi> ſhould diſdain the Life of a Slave;—better,—far better, bravely to <hi>ſacrifice</hi> it to the Defence of our Religion and Country, than to <hi>ſurvive</hi> the diſmal Day, when theſe Regions of Light and Liberty, ſhall be overſpread with Ignorance, Superſtition, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. And had we but the <hi>Spirit</hi> of our <hi>brave Anceſtors,</hi> who chearfully ventured their Lives, and reſigned all the Comforts thereof, in an howling Wilderneſs, that they might hand down to us the ineſtimable Privileges we now enjoy: Were <hi>we,</hi> I ſay, animated with the ſame <hi>heroic</hi> Spirit, in the Defence of them; with the ſame ardent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of leaving them <hi>inviolate</hi> to our Poſterity;—did but the <hi>noble Ardor</hi> kindle from Breaſt to Breaſt, I doubt not, by the Smiles of Heaven, we ſhould ſoon make our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies flee before us, and again ſit quietly under our Vines and Fig-trees, and eat the Good of the Land. <hi>Which God of his infinite Mercy grant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>AMEN.</hi>
