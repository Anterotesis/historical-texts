            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Doct 8. <hi>The example of Gods judgements upon his own people for their sin and wicked Apostacy,</hi> are very useful and solemn considerations for all professors of Religion: the Lord sends <hi>lerusalem</hi> to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and for what end, only to see, what he did, and for what, to view his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their causes and effects; to see, <hi>i. e.</hi> not only to look on, but to consider them seriously, and to make use of them to themselves; and learn something from it for their own conviction; by comparing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ground of the truth we may understand if we consider a few pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions:</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God hath one rule of dealing with all his externally covenanted

people in the world,</hi> and that because the covenant with them all runs upon the same terms and conditions, for it is a conditional Covenant; in the which there is a promise and a threatning, a promise annexed to obedience, but a threatning denounced against disobedience. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 19, 20. It is true, God reserves a soveraignty to himself as to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of his dealings with his people in one place or in another; without either infringing his Covenant, or rendring to the creature a Reason of that variety; hence, possibly patience and mercy may lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wait upon some then others, some God may come severely out against, for breach of Covenant, and to others he may condescend to allow a greater space to repent in, as he pleaseth, and he does not the least wrong or injury in so doing, because he is both supream, and hath ends in all his judgements, beyond the capacity of the creatures find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out; but, as to the essence of the Covenant, he thus far stands po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively and absolutely engaged to reward obedience, and to punish disobedience; which flows from his everlasting righteousness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Examples of Gods judgements upon his own people for their sins, are evident confirmations and testimonies that he is a God who proceeds impartially according to his own Rule;</hi> as when Laws are executed according to the tenor of them upon malefactors in the Kingdome, we now know that such Laws were not meer scare-crows, made only to fright, but not to hurt, but that there was reality in the Law-makers, and that they were really set against such evils to subvert and root them out, and may teach others to expect what to meet with, in the like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: so, when God punisheth sin in his people according to his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his word, we now see that those threatnings are realities; that his orders and constitutions are not bug-bears, but realities, that sin shall not go unpunished. Hence God declares in his word, that he will be known to be God in his judgements. <hi>Exek.</hi> 28. 22 if men will not believe the word, that God will do as he hath said, but presume upon his mercy and patience; when he takes his rod into his hand, now he is mad, that believs not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence, Examples have matter of precept in them.</hi> Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are documents, there are doctrinal conclusions to be drawn for our instruction out of them, hence, we shall find God in Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon his people to look upon Examples. thus, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 32. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6. &amp;c. If God have thus dealt with such a people, we may thence conclude he will deal so with those that are so qualified, if
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000184_0013_0FA3177E07336DF8"/>
we enjoy the same priviledges that Israel did, and make no better use of them then they made of theirs, we may expect to be visited as well as they were, and not only may we argue <hi>a pari,</hi> but also <hi>ab impari,</hi> from the lesser to the greater; if Israel so priviledged were not spared; how much less shall we be spared, who exceed them in priviledges, if sinners <hi>under the Law</hi> found no favour, <hi>how much sorer punishment</hi> may sinners <hi>under the Gospel</hi> expect: God writes his <hi>severe truths</hi> with the <hi>blood</hi> of his <hi>disobedient Subjects,</hi> and makes their ruinous heaps to proclaim knowledg and counsel to the rest of the world: <hi>Sodom's ashes, Shiloh's fire, Ierusalem's desolation,</hi> are uses of instruction to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Examples are of wondrous benefit to give efficacy to Doctrines,</hi> and move upon the affections, and bring them to consideration, they are useful to perswade; and to move the soul to make out after God: <hi>Psal. </hi> 78.6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Because there is a natural sympathy between the children of men,</hi> there is a kind of a fellow feeling of sufferings; when we read only of Doctrines, these may reach the understanding, but when we read or hear of Examples, humane affection doth as it were represent to us the case as our own; whereupon the judgements of God, do in the very hearing dwell upon the thoughts, and take upon the heart: when I read the story of <hi>Sodom's overthrow,</hi> me thinks I see the Sun rising in glorious brightness, the <hi>Sodomites</hi> sporting and pleasing themselves in their <hi>opulence and security;</hi> when on a sudden, me thinks I see the heavens covered with those sable clouds, and hear the great Cannon of heaven thundring down tempests upon them, and the streams of fire with horror and dread, till I behold a proud City, on a sudden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>desolate heap;</hi> when I read <hi>Ierusalems history,</hi> me thinks I see the battering Engines placed against the walls, the proud enemy climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the battlements, the feeble and saint-hearted Citizens flying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to corners, overtaking by the insulting foe; who without mercy or pity sheaths his sword in their bowels; me-thinks I see the fire-balls flying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Because examples come in by the senses, and these have a great

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Because Examples have an awakening voice in them,</hi> when judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes into the world, it carries awe with it, it sensibly moves the soul to have consideration; such as these are natural influences up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart of such as have any remainder of an acting conscience in them. <abbr>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>It was Gods place:</hi> i. e. <hi>a peculiar place</hi> which he had chosen to himself, <hi>his chief place.</hi>
            </p>

It was the <hi>first Tent,</hi> or <hi>Tabernacle</hi> where God see up his Ordinances, and called his name upon it, after he had given to <hi>his people Israel possession of the land of Canaan:</hi> as we shall find in <hi>Joshua</hi> 18. 1. here it was that after the <hi>Arke</hi> had been unsettled for 40 years and upward in the <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What was the wickedness of</hi> Shiloh; for the Lord shews that it was for that, he did that to it, which he had done; <hi>Text,</hi> now we shall see the sin of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> if we look into 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 12. &amp;c. which was the sin of the Priests in contemning the Ordinances of God, giving an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil example to the people, and enriching themselves in a way of abuse of Gods Institutions, and thereby discouraging the people from serving of God, and of <hi>Eli</hi> in bearing with the wickedness, and not severely punishing the sin of his sons, which God interprets as a preferring them before him. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. &amp;c. and <hi>Psa.</hi> 78. 41. to 60. where their horrible ingratitude in forgetting Gods mercies, and woful Idolatry is declared this was Israels sin, the Priests and people were polluted and defiled, and alienated from God; there was a continuance of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and sacrifice, but both abuse of Ordinances and Idolatry, both in profession and practice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The judgments of God upon his people Israel,</hi> and upon <hi>Shiloh</hi> in particular: we shall find recorded in scripture, what God did to it; for that is the thing which God would have in especial be minded, look into 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 10, 11: where you shall find the judgment denounced, and more amply we shall read of the execution of it in <hi>Psal</hi> 78. 59. to 68. where we have described unto us, the effects of their sins.</p>

Better it is for us to bow our selves before him, left he break us in pieces: and therefore let it be our great endeavour to meet God in the way by Repentance, before he come home to us in wrath, and fall upon us in his fore displeasure; let that be the great practical lesson that we learn at <hi>Shiloh.</hi> For motive:</p>
            <p n="1">1.

               <hi>[When thy Judgments;. &amp;c.]</hi> Judgments are Acts of Divine <hi>Justice, Vindicative,</hi> all Gods dispensations to the creature, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led either acts of <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>justice;</hi> Not as if there were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in these two; God is Just where he is Mercifull, <hi>i.e.</hi> his being mercifull doth not infringe or wrong his justice at all: and where God is Just, he is Mercifull also, in this world; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his justice is here dispensed with moderation; though the time be comeing when he will execute justice without mercy:</p>
            <p>But wherein any act of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> one of these Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes is more visible to the creature then the other, thence it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its Denomination.</p>
            <p>Judgments, <hi>are Judicial acts of Gods Severity in the World, wherein he declares himselfe to be set against sin or sinners;</hi> Some translate it <hi>Chastizements:</hi> Judgment sometimes intend <hi>proper act; of Revenging justice;</hi> when God comes forth to right himselfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his enemies, in their wonderfull destruction: Sometimes <hi>severe afflictions,</hi> though intended for the amendment of those who suffer them: the word signifies properly, <hi>a doing right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>[Righteousness]</hi> The word signifies <hi>Truth and Equity:</hi> it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in Scripture restrained to <hi>second Table dutyes,</hi> and then it is distinguished from <hi>Holyness,</hi> which referrs to <hi>first Table dutyes,</hi> but here, as in many other places, it is used more largely, to signifie a <hi>reformation of Life,</hi> and universal <hi>Anastasy,</hi> or <hi>Reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> from their former sinfull courses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[Will learne]</hi> This is spoken as if such an effect should come to pass in all that should see and hear of Gods judgements; for the Scripture speaks of some, that when Gods hand was upon them, they sinned yet more: thus <hi>Ahaz:</hi> 2 Chron. 28.22. but it is spoken either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By way of Presumption,</hi> as if they should say, <hi>surely they will learn righteousness.</hi> or,</p>

2. <hi>Expressing what ought to be,</hi> as if it would be; such a thing should be, and if men were in a right frame, it would be: the meaning is, that there is matter enough in Gods judgements to awaken the world to righteousness. Hence,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>The Judgements of God in the World carry along with them an universal awakening call to Righteousness.</hi> When God comes forth rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his <hi>fiery Chariot,</hi> and dispenseth terrible things among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, it sends forth a loud cry to the world to reform and amend their ways. By way of Explication, Consider a few things.</p>
            <p>First. <hi>All judgements are of God,</hi> it's said thy judgements, they come from him: here observe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Some judgements are more immediate,</hi> they come by an unseen hand and in an unknown way, we see the effects, but are not able to track them in their causes; of such as these, even an <hi>Egyptian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician</hi> must say, <hi>lo the finger of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Other judgements come mediately by the mediation or efficiency of Instruments,</hi> second causes are the next occasion of them, and these are either.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Devils, who have a great stroake in many effects of providence,</hi> they come by Divine permission, God giving them a license, so far as he sees meet for his own ends; and sometimes they come with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from God on his errands, who shall for us <hi>perswade</hi> Ahab <hi>to go to</hi> Ramoth Gilead <hi>and fall?</hi> I, faith the Devills, <hi>go, saith God, and prosper,</hi> 1 Kings 22. 20. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Men, who are many times the meanes of bringing sore and sad, calamities upon their fellow creatures,</hi> being used and improved by God to that end, by Warrs, and desolations that follow then, upon, thus God used the <hi>Philistins, Syrians, Assyrians</hi> &amp;c. to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict Israel <hi>and</hi> Judah.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Bruit beasts and unreasonable creatures,</hi> who serve their great Lord against man, when he rebells against God, which otherwise should have been subservient to him: thus the <hi>fiery Serpents in the wilderness,</hi> the <hi>two shee Bears,</hi> to tear in peeces the mocking chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, thus <hi>Locusts, Caterpillers, Palmer wormes</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Elements, Starrs, Rivers, Vapours, Rain, Drought</hi> &amp;c the <hi>Starrs fought in their course against Sisera,</hi> the <hi>brook <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

By all these meanes God may bring severe punishments upon the creture for his sin: but all these are from God, they are his Judgments, and come of his errand. This appears;</p>
            <p n="1">1. From <hi>the Supream Efficiency of God;</hi> all creatures move as they are moved by him: in the matter of the action, if he give not his <hi>Efficiency,</hi> they can do nothing at all: <hi>in him we live, move and have our being:</hi> his Efficiency is the first mover, he is as it were the first wheel of the great clock of the world, or the spring of this watch: Second beings have an operation, but it hath an absolute dependence upon his Co-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> only <hi>Divine permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> in it, but <hi>Divin Efficiency</hi> also.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From <hi>his Providential Ordering of all the affaires of the world:</hi> God <hi>sits King upon the flood</hi> Psal. 29. 10. He is Soveraign disposer of all things, and therefore good and evill comes from him, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be that doth it. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 3. Because <hi>Prayer to God hath been the meanes of turning aside judgment, yea even then when Instruments have done their worst,</hi> the people of God in their distress, have but acquainted God with it, end sought him in the case, and the buisiness hath been done: thus <hi>David</hi> prayes to God to <hi>turn the counsell of Achitophel into foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and its done; and he who formerly was looked upon to speak <hi>Oracles,</hi> is now disregarded: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> doth tell, go into the the house of God, and spread <hi>Rabshekah's raling letter</hi> before him and leaves the case with him; and the next newes is, an Angel is sent from heaen, who slayes in one night <hi>an hundred, four score</hi> and <hi>five</hi> thousand of his enemies, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35. Hence we have the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es confidence in Gods protection, enabling them to <hi>sound a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge</hi> to their enemies to do their worst against them. <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 9, 10. there is their boldness, <hi>God is with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. <hi>All those acts of Divine Providence, wherein God dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his severity in any degree against sin,</hi> are properly the Judgments of God: wherever God layes his heavy hand upon a people: <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, they naturally teach these lessons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God is a just God, that he is set against sin, and will not alwayes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with sinners: dayes of patience make sinners forget, yea Atheistically think God is not holy and just; but he is known in his Judgements, these are beginning discoveries before the great and general Assizes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God will sooner or later be revenged upon sinners: every monument of Divine Revenge lectures out what others may look for and expect at the hands of God. Gods Judgements declare that sin shall not alwayes go unpunished, that though there be a day of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, yet there shall also be a day wherein they shall receive their wages.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there shall be a great Day of Judgement: for if some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are here taken, and others in this world forborn, according to the pleasure of Gods Soveraign will, this shews that there must be another day above and besides all these Judgement-dayes, wherein God sits upon some sinners in this world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That there is no security in a state of sin, though we are not such notorious sinners as others, yet are we under sin; we lye open and liable to the Judgements of God, and may as soon as others be made monuments of it. It is no cloak to say, I am not as bad as such and such. Art thou out from the promise of Gods special grace? thou art every day open to Judgement</p>
            <p n="5">5. That there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> our peace with God: if God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And hence the conclusion is to teach men righteousness, to forsake those sins that are provoking to God, and lay hold upon him in a way of true Repentance, in time, for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Seventhly, It is the will and command of God that his Judgements should learn men righteousness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because he singles out some to shew his judgements upon, and takes not all sinners as he might do: this shews that God would have men improve this day of his presence to Repentance. God hath Pleas enough against others, and might have executed his wrath on them, but when he does not, he shews that he would have others to get good by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because God in his Word calls men to consider and observe his Judgements; he declares it to be his will, that when he visits any in severity for their sins. <hi>All Israel should hear, and fear, and do no more so.</hi> When God would reclaim <hi>Judah</hi> from their vain confidence, and awaken them to repentance, he sends them to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> to see what wastes and desolations he had there made, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because none of Gods Providences are in vain, God doth nothing in the world to no purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Because God does by his awakening Judgements teach them he intends good to: <hi>David</hi> professeth, <hi>Thy judgements make me, afraid,</hi> i.e. afraid to sin, afraid to be licentious and remiss in my life and wayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Because God doth charge the neglect of this duty upon <hi>Judah</hi> as a great, grievous, and provoking sin: when he had executed his judgements upon her sister <hi>Aholah (Israel,</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. That Afflictions and Calamities are not by casualty, they are Gods Judgements, ordered and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. That it is our duty to look beyond Instruments in every Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that befalls us. It is true, Instruments are some of them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional some are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

use of by us then it is. Let this consideration have its weight in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling us this day before God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with our own hearts, that we are no more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, that there is so much ice and coldness in us, that our affections are scarce warmed with such a providence; we may lay our hands upon our mouthes, and be angry with our selves, that we finde such a chilness upon our affections. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. Particularly, those deserve a Reproof,</p>
            <p>First, That make all their application of those whom the Judgement is upon: Oh the spirit of censure that is in too many, and there they rest; Surely there is some special reason, some more then ordinary provocation, why else is God come out upon that Family, rather then upon any other Family? I do not here speak to make those whom the Judgement nextly concerns, to be regardless of Gods hand upon them; no, let them know that God calls them into the School of Search, and would have them in particular try what is the meaning of his so severe coming out against them, that they may learn to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in silence, and justifie him: But I speak to others, who are apt to judge of persons by providences, though Scripture teacheth us that <hi>all things fell out alike unto all.</hi> And therefore let such consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This practice is contrary to our Saviours precept, who admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth others by such providences to learn this lesson, that <hi>except they repent, they shall likewise perish,</hi> Luke 13. 2, 3. it seems personal appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation suits better, its the wisest way to bring all things home to our own Souls; that might be profitable to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is to forget our own sinfulness: whiles we judge and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure others, we do tacitly justifie our selves, and think our selves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then others; we interpret our merit rather then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, mercy to be the distinguishing cause: and is not this to lift up our selves too high?</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is to forget divine Soveraignty: God all this while is not adored by us in his Supreme uncontrolable disposal which he hath of all creatures, to lay his hand where he pleaseth, without giving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the creature. Consider well with thy self, and it may be thou hast been ten times a greater sinner, if all the circumstances of aggravation were well pondered and weighed, but God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ends best known to himself hath thus dealt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is the way to rob God of the glory of his goodness to thee
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000184_0031_0FA3178B8560B968"/>
in preserving thee from this sad Calamity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hereas if thou reflect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, thou mightest see so much of provocation in thy own heart, and so many grievous obliquities and wanderings, that it would set thee into a rapture of admiration, at the unspeakable favour which appears in thy preservation, who mightest have been chosen in the room of this person, to have been hung up as a sign, and a wonder, and an astonishment, for others with sad hearts to have looked upon.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This is not to learn Righteousness; for that is onely by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conclusions home to our selves, and making the case our own: yea, this is a way to harden our hearts in wickedness. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learn to make a better use of this tremendous Providence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Those that look not beyond Instruments. There is a great deal of enquiry made about the Devils agency, and raising of Spirits against such as we are ready to think may be his subservient actors in this case, but how many are there that look no further. Consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is to forget the Supremacy of Divine Providence; we do not remember that God sits and rules over Men and Devils, and that in such an uncontrolable manner, that Earth and Hell cannot move to any act upon the creature, unless he permit them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It tends to hinder the right efficacy of this Judgement upon the Soul; for it raiseth, and humbles not the Soul of the creature: it is the way to provocation and exasperation, to bitterness and rage, from the consideration of the virulency of the enemy, and that we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> deserved it at their hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas if we looked beyond these, to God the prime Efficient, it would teach us silence, and holy submission: <hi>I was dumb,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>because thou didst it,</hi> Psal. 39. 9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Those that look upon the Providence with slighty and common affections, whose hearts are not awed by it, but look upon it as matter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or no concernment, are as jocund, as vain, as light, as frothy as ever they were: there are too many of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This argues that God is not feared by such hearts, those that fear not God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his Judgements, especially in such Judgements, may well be thought not to fear him at all. Assure thy self if this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, so solemn, have left no impression upon thee, thou hast a heart as hard as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> should learn Righteousness: the

Affections are the feet of the Soul, if these move not, there is little good to be hoped for in such an one, and therefore never look that such should get any good by it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Those that have lost their Affections: it may be many were at the first, at the newness and strangeness of the sight and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, filled for a season with consternation; but now they are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to their old wont again, and recovered their frights and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, dried up their fears, and wiped their eyes, and they are where they were before: this shews that this Judgement had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> depth of efficacy upon your souls, it was onely something external; it shews what your nature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rtation</hi> and <hi>Direction.</hi> Oh let it be an awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word of Counsel to us all. We are now come together to affect our souls with this stupend Judgement of God which is among us, the Lord in mercy grant that it may teach us Righteousness; the voice of God cries aloud by it to this poor Town in a special manner, the Lord give us an hearing ear: let it be our great request, that he would <hi>bore our ear to instruction,</hi> that it may not pass by without doing us true and saving good. For <hi>Motive:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us consider the awfulness, of the Judgement it self: this is none of those ordinary dispensations of Gods Providence which are frequent and usual in the world, to be sure not among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; it is no common sickness and calamity, and yet if it had been no more it had been our duty to have wisely considered it, and given attention to the voice of it; but it is extraordinary and stupendious: it is not usuall for God to give Satan such liberty and power, so to rock and torture, so to hurry and perplex poor creatures, and therefore something <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> special to be learned by us, when God has leaves the common track, and comes in so unwonted a way of Judgement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider how nearly we are related unto it above other in the Land: there is a voice in it to the whole Land, but in a more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> manner to poor <hi>Groton;</hi> it is not a Judgement afar off, but it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

use of it: Let us look upon our selves to be set up as a <hi>Beacon upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Hill</hi> by this Providence, and let those that hear what hath been done among us, hear also of the good effects, and reformation it hath wrought among us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Consider what advantage we have above others to be affected with it: others indeed may hear of it, relations may be carried from one place to another, and that may affect, yet not so much as when it is seen. Why, we may say as <hi>Job, I have heard of thee with the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye sees thee.</hi> Reports may be carried various, and that may wound a great part of the credit of it abroad in the world, as not knowing how or where to fasten their belief; however, when never so truly reported, it cannot carry the life of the thing with it: but we have seen, yea seen such things as one would think might melt, or break an heart of stone; we may carry about with us every day, the very pourtraicture of those Hellish and Diabolicall Cruelties, those strange Gestures, those dreadful Voices: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we be not awed and affected by it, who should?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consider how sad it will be for us, if we be not awed and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this Judgement, if we learn nothing by it: Oh how much will God have against us, above others! the nearer he hath come to us, and the more we are concerned in it, and the louder the Cry hath been to us, will all have their particular weight to increase our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, God will lay every circumstance to our charge, and as he hath singularly revealed his minde to us in it, so he will have a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar provocation by it. Oh! little do we know how much this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence slighted and misimproved will adde to the weight of our sins, and increase of our woes. Let it then be a solemn lesson to teach us Righteousness. For <hi>Direction:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Let us all in general learn something by it, let it afford us some practical conclusions, which may be for our use and benefit to instruct and teach us in wayes of Righteousness; namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Learn by it that Satan is busie in places of Gospel light, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and draw away Souls from attending the means of grace. The Light of the Gospel doth not clear and free places from Satan or his bold Temptations, these infernal Spirits of darkness will come thither, and there endeavour to raise mists and fogs to seduce souls; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us learn not to live securely under the enjoyment of the Gospel of grace, but to <hi>spend our time of sojourning here in holy fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:000184_0034_0FA3178DDA17BBB8"/>
2. That there is no place free, no not the House of God from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Temptations: when thou art in Gods House, and thy bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to attend the Ordinances, the dispensing of the Gospel, Satan will come thither, as he often did to this poor creature, he will do all he can to steal away thy minde and meditation, he will begin a par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with thee that shall last as long as the Sermon, and thou shalt go away without receiving one word of instruction. Oh how can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e please thy fancy, and delude thy soul! and therefore let it awaken thee to be careful to <hi>keep thy foot when thou comest to the house of God,</hi> if thou <hi>wouldest not offer the sacrifice of fools,</hi> Eccles. 5. 1. The feet of the soul are the Affections, learn to be more watchful over them, to keep them from wandring, lest Satan meet and make a prey of them, and so steal away the feed of the Word from thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That discontent layes us exceeding open to the assaults of Satan, and gives him more then ordinary advantage to make discoveries of himself to us: little do we know how we do as it were invite the Devil by it. In any Government, discontented persons are fittest for Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to work upon: by discontent we discover a weariness of Gods Government, and therefore Satan is emboldened by it to come, yea to make his Apparitions, and strike in to the drawing over of poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to enter a <hi>Covenant of Rebellion</hi> with him, and a wonder it is if any at such a time escape. Learn we therefore to be more watchfull over our own hearts, beware how we give any way to secret up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risings against the Providence of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That this world would be a sad place to live in, if it were not for Gods over-ruling Providence. Oh how busie is the Devil, that great Adversary of Souls! and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow full is he of Cruelty! did not God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain his rage, he would soon make poor Mortals incapable of living here below: By the Claw you may judge of the Lion. We finde in <hi>Jobs</hi> case, he goes to the outside of his Commission: and here you have a lively spectacle of his venome and spight; Oh then let it awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us to see by whom we are every day preserved and protected from the rage of Devils, God onely: Alas! what were we in the hands of these infernal Powers, if Gods Omnipotency did not restrain them. Let this make God more glorious in our eyes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That there is no safety but under the wings of the Lord Jesus Christ: he onely is the <hi>strong man</hi> that can secure us from the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Satan. Satan rules and reigns in this world, and you see how
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000184_0035_0FA3178E87B45DC8"/>
much power he holds over the children of disobedience. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learn hence both to bless God for Christ Jesus, who came into the world to <hi>destroy the works of the Devil;</hi> had he not come to set up, his Kingdome in this world, the Devil would have reigned Lord and King in all Souls, he onely is able to dispossess the strength, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle the Powers of Hell: as also to fly under the wings of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer for safeguard, that we may be freed from these cruel Enemies.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That visible Priviledges are no security from Satan: it's not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be <hi>baptized with water,</hi> unless we be also <hi>baptized with the holy Ghost, and with fire;</hi> it's not enough to be a Member of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, if we be not also of Christs invisible Flock: Satan is not terrified by these outward things, he is not afraid to assault those that are Christs nominally, and to endeavour to make them his own really. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p n="1">1. Let it be a Doctrinal Providence to <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>Old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, To you that are <hi>Elder,</hi> and more grown up in years, let it awaken you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Consider how many more provocations God hath had from you, then he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ath had from this poor creature; how many more Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Providences have attended upon you, then ever did upon her: think how long you have lived in Gods world, and yet have done him little or no service since you came into it: and therefore let this awaken you to see how it stands with you, how the matter goes between God and your Souls, whether you are secure under his wings, and at peace with him. When you see one so much younger then you thus visited, Oh think upon what ground you stand, fear
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000184_0036_0FA3178F4654C210"/>
the like or worse, if you are yet in an uncertain state. Let it in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> manner awaken old ones to <hi>make their calling and election sure,</hi> considering how much danger you are in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let it teach you how much you have had of the patience of God exercised towards you, that God hath born with and for born you so long; you have lived a great while longer in the world, and it may be have been more enormous and flagitious in your lives then ever this poor creature was: possibly you have lived in scandalous sins, and grievous pollutions: if you should consider, and ask a Reason why God hath taken her and not taken you, you may see and say, that if God had gone according to outward appearance, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of rigour, there had been transcendently more ground why he should have come upon you. Oh then, when you see one so young, and one not observed to be guilty of any flagitious crimes taken, while you are by Gods goodness spared, learn to admire at, and worship the patience of God towards you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let it therefore teach you to amend your wayes, and reform your lives, and that speedily: it may be a great argument to quicken you up no longer to use delayes, nor put off God coming to you in his Word, and perswading you by his Spirit to repent and return to him. Oh see in this lecture upon what slippery and dangerous ground you stand, and have stood all this while, and if God had been severe towards you, you had not had this opportunity of being called to Repentance; and then learn to shake off all delayes, to put by all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, and bless God that you yet have an opportunity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You that are <hi>Young ones,</hi> behold here one of your Tribe and Form, as I may say, one of your own years pickt out of you by the wise Providence of God, to be made an object of Gods severity, and mans pity.

Childrens Souls: here you may see how open they are by nature to Satans temptations, how they every day go in danger of those fly and subtile assaults of this politick enemy of their Souls: let this lye near your hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence let this teach you to be careful in Educating them in the <hi>nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> which is the onely way and means to prevent this adversary. If you have hitherto been remiss, learn now to be more careful and vigilant about it, let it be a quickning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to rouse you up from this neglect, by teaching you the great weight of the duty, even of as much moment as the precious lives of their poor souls.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let it teach you to begin with them betimes, do not defer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing of them too long; you see Satan will set upon them early, he will not delay long before he comes and useth his endeavours to draw your Childrens souls away after him: and therefore if you would prevent him, do not you delay, but be dropping in instruction as they are able, and as soon as they are able to understand any thing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whithersoever they go, bear a holy jealousie over them, lest they should offend God, and provoke him to leave them to the Devil: you cannot be alwayes with them, nor constantly have them under your eye, but where-ever they be, be sure let your hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6. See to your own lives, that they be exemplary to your Children, if you teach them never so carefully, yet if you unteach them again by your vain conversation before them, its little the better; think how much advantage you put into Satans hands against your Children, to draw them into sin by your example, he knows well enough what a taking argument this is with Children.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Rest not satisfied, but be constant and earnest with God for your Children till you see <hi>Christ formed in them,</hi> as knowing that till then they are in Satans Kingdome, and under his Jurisdiction. Oh what bowels of affection, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> requests might this providence arm us withall! how strong might it make us with God for our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren! O pity them in a state of unregeneracy: Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>less souls are naked souls, and therefore lye open to the enemy; cease not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night nor day begging for them. See in this providence their danger, and let it quicken you to importunacy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Children</hi> do you learn something hence also.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Learn to hearken to the loving and wholesom Counsels of your Parents, and not to slight or despise their Admonitions and Reproofs. You see here how open you are to Satans assaults, and if you will not hear God speaking to you by your Parents, it is just with God to leave you to the Devil, to hear him: know it, when your Parents speak to you, and advise you for your good, God speaks to you by them, and if <hi>your eye despise them,</hi> God may suffer these infernal <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> and <hi>Eagles to pick it out, and eat it.</hi> One would think this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument might make you fear and tremble.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Learn hence not to trust to your Parents Covenant, or to think that you shall be saved by their Faith, or by it secured from Satan: it is true, you may fare the better by them and for them, but if you rest upon their godliness for your security, you are deceived: you may be the natural Children of godly Parents, and yet the spiritual Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 43, 44. Know it, it is not enough to be the Children of godly Parents, unless you do inherit their graces: seek therefore that, or else Satan hath you at his beck.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Rest not upon your Parents Prayers; think it not enough that your godly Parents pray for you to God, and therefore you are safe: true, Parents Prayers are a great benefit to Children, but if they be trusted to, they will prove a meer delusion. <hi>Abraham</hi> prayes for

               </gap> not for himself: God may answer your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Prayers in another way, they shall not lose them, but yet if you rest there, they may but increase your woes. Let this therefore call upon you to make your own peace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Learn to obey your Parents in all their lawful Commands, and that in obedience unto God: acknowledge their authority and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over you, and though they restrain you from that which you may think to be a lawful liberty, yet be obedient in all things lawful, for though the thing be a matter indifferent, yet if you disobey and displease your Parents in it, be sure you lay your selves open to Satan.</p>
            <p>III. Let it teach both the <hi>Regenerate,</hi> and <hi>Unregenerate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, You that are <hi>Regenerated,</hi> and brought home to God, you may learn something here.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let this providence teach you to magnifie Gods grace, that hath taken you out of Satans Kingdome, and <hi>translated you into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of his own Son.</hi> When-ever we see any left by God, and in any wayes in the hand of Satan, and under his power, how should it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> us with God-glorifying thoughts, at the consideration of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full love to us. Now is a time to consider who made the difference between two pieces of the same clay, to remember how opposite we were to any saving good, what pains God took with us, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions he used, and how contumeliously we often handled his Spirit; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> consider that if his love had not carried him against our hatred, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he pitied us, when we did not, could not pity our selves, we had yet to this day been under the dominion of Hell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let it awaken you to <hi>walk worthy of your vocation; you now see your calling,</hi> you are called out of Satans kingdome, you are delivered from the powers of darkness, labour then to walk no longer <hi>in the vanity of your mindes:</hi> Are you Gods Children? <hi>Live in holiness,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh that this Providence might awaken those that have given up themselves to God and his Service, to consider whether we have not too much gratified Satan, by being too light, too vain, too excessive in taking liberty in worldly mirth and vanity, too little spiritual in our course and conversation among men. Let it then be a word of Warning to us to be more serious and cautious to our selves and wayes for the time to come.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let it move in you earning bowels of compassion towards those
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000184_0041_0FA3179306AE4808"/>
that are yet in Satans Kingdome, and under his spiritual Jurisdiction: you may here see a little, though but a little, yet so much appears here visible and demonstrative, as may give a glimpse of discovery how sad and doleful the condition of poor unregenerate sinners is, who are <hi>spiritually possest by Satan:</hi> Let it then rouse up in you bowels of pity, when you look in the faces of any such, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et it make you to mourn over them, and pray for them, and counsel and advise them as God gives you opportunity, that if it may be, you may be helpful to their escape out of the paws of the devouring Lion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let it awaken you to watch your wayes and actions, to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to your lives and courses, how you carry it before them who are yet in their vanity, lest Satan make you his <hi>Stales</hi> to allure poor souls by. If the Devil can <hi>belye</hi> the people of God to encourage others to hearken to him, be sure he will make his market of <hi>your failings,</hi> negligent walkings, and whatsoever is done amiss by you at one time or other, to draw others more fearlesly after him; and will it not be a sad thing that souls should follow Satan to their eternal ruine and perdition, and you the live-birds that have drawn them into this net? For the Lords sake, for the love you bear to poor souls, if there be any pity, any compassion, any desire to Gods glory, or others Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, look to your wayes, and see they be exemplary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You that are <hi>Unregenerate,</hi> labour to hear the voice of God in this Providence, and learn by it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let this Example teach you how <hi>cruel a Master</hi> you serve: you see here, that Satan (whatever pretences he makes, and fair promises he seeks to delude poor souls withall) is in his heart set against all mankinde, and he seeks only to destroy them; and if once God less him loose, and gives him liberty, he will soon shew his own nature, and give evidence of his Cruelty. This you have seen is but a little of that bitter spight he will exercise upon those who shall be wholly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into his hands. You have little cause to boast of your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, its a cruel bondage, you are in the hands of one whose <hi>tender mercies are cruelty.</hi> Oh that this might make you weary of Satans go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that it might make you begin to discover his policies, and flee from him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let it shew you the great danger you go in every hour of being made a prey to Satan. Consider how ready this Adversary is to fasten his Talons upon poor creatures, if God permit him: and consider
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000184_0042_0FA31793C54912B8"/>
that thou hast no security, no ground to promise thy self that God will defend thee from him, no not for a moment, it is Gods goodness that he hath hither to afforded thee his protection, but thou hast no promise that he will continue it: Yea consider, how many Calls and Counsels, how many Providences and Ordinances thou hast despised, how often God hath come to thee, and wooed earnestly for thy soul, used heart-breaking intreaties with thee, endeavouring to insinuate himself into thy very soul, and yet thou hast hardned thy heart against all, and resolutely refused: think then, what hast thou to say for thy self why thou mayest not speedily hear God say to the Devil, <hi>Take the full and everlasting possession of such a soul?</hi> and what will become of thee then?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence let it be a loud Cry to you to Repentance: You have had many Cries in your ears from the Word, but you have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the report which Gods Messengers have brought. Oh that you would believe when God addes such a Confirmation to the truth of his Word! reade your own state in this poor Monument, and think by what you see in her, what is like to become of you in the state you are in; hearken, and you may hear God crying to you by her, <hi>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, let me return once again to all that are here in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence this day to humble themselves before him: learn we hence, for this day, and hence-forward, these two Lessons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us all examine by this Providence what sins they have been, that have given Satan so much footing in this poor place: sure the voice of God is loud to us, and bids us to bring this matter upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rch; for though God be Soveraign yet it is to us a time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration when Gods hand is out against us, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 7. Let it then bring us upon a serious Triall of our selves and wayes, that we may be able to trace God in his Providence, and acknowledge his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgements; let us ask whether our <hi>Contentions</hi> have not set open this door, and invited Satan in? I am sure these carry a very great resemblance of the Devils <hi>Cloven Foot.</hi> Have not our <hi>Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Divisions</hi> grieved away the Spirit of God, and given Satan this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage? I am sure they leave a people faulty, <hi>Hos.</hi> 10 2. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore say them open to severe punishments: these have been too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sins, and what have been in particular? What a deal of <hi>Wordly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedness</hi> in the elder sort? the <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>looseness</hi> in the younger,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000184_0043_0FA3179486C9C330"/>
increased to such a height of impudency. Let me adde, the general <hi>light esteem</hi> there hath been among us of Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oly and precious <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> of his <hi>Messengers:</hi> these are crying sins, and therefore, may well be answered with loud-speaking Providences.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us all joyn heart and hand to drive this Enemy out again. Let that be our great business this day to implore God, and beg his assistance and direction in so great a Work as this is; and let us forthwith set upon it, and follow it might and main: and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of, and humiliation for what is past, and reformation for the future, <hi>let us search and try our wayes, and turn again to the Lord;</hi> Let us lay aside <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> throw down our <hi>Contention</hi> &amp; <hi>Strife,</hi> and take up <hi>Peace and Love.</hi> Let the Aged reform their <hi>Earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedness,</hi> and the Youth their <hi>Vanity,</hi> their Night-walkings, and merry Drinking-meetings; let the <hi>Judgements of God</hi> awe our hearts, and leave such impressions behinde them, as may powerfully lead us in wayes of Righteousness, that God may delight to dwell among us, and <hi>tread Satan under our feet.</hi>

            <p>Doct. <hi>The denunciations of Gods wrath against a sinning people is  a Burden, a thing heavy and grievous.</hi> In divers considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are <hi>a burden to Gods Messengers:</hi> i. e. grievous and hard to them, their spirits are oppressed, and many times even overwhelmed within them, to fore-think of the message they have to deliver.

            <p n="2">2. They are a <hi>burden to the People</hi> to whom they are sent. This in two respects:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) They are <hi>a burden of grief and sorrow</hi> to the godly, who hear and fear, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Of <hi>indignation</hi> to the wicked, who cannot endure so much as to hear of them, the very Threatning is to them intolerable, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 10. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 26. 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In some sense they are <hi>a burden to God,</hi> who speaking after the manner of men, expresseth a rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Reasons</hi> are:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the first; From the sympathetical compassionateness of Gods Messengers towards their fellow-creatures, there is a <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Of the second; From the sense of the severity of Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure in the godly, and hence it produceth sorrow for their sins.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It brings sin to minde, which is the Cause, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 17, 18.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The people of God know what a sad thing it is to have to do with an angry God <hi>Psal.</hi> 76. 7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of the third; From the pride of heart which is in the wicked, <hi>Jer.</hi> 43. 2. they are too good to be reproved, will not hear by reason of the height of heir spirits, think so well of themselves, that they cannot believe that God is displeased at them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Of the fourth; From the compassions of God towards poor sinners, he herein discovers his merciful Nature, <hi>Hos.</hi> 11. 8</p>
            <p n="5">5. Of the fifth; From the aversness of the nature of man from sorrows and miseries: they are against our nature, and therefore must needs be burdensome; yea they are Punishments, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grievous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 1. See here a Reason why Gods Warnings and Threatnings finde no more welcome, and why plain Preaching Ministers are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> sinning man is gotten above warning, though by our sins we are pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down Gods Judgements upon our heads, all this is nothing, but
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:000184_0046_0FA31796C548E7C0"/>
he that tells us plainly of them, and represents the anger of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us for them, he is <hi>the troubler of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> II. Learn hence to interpret the Threatnings of Judgement denounced by Gods Messengers in the best sense, when they tell you of Gods wrath. Oh do not think th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, tell you as they would have it, or that they take any delight in bringing such heavy tidings, but they must say as God commands them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28. 6. they can be gladly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the threatning may never be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> III. Here is a mark to distinguish the people of God from hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Professors: when God tells us plainly of our sins, and speaks of his wrath, 'tis indeed <hi>a burden</hi> to all; but how? why, the wicked endeavour to throw it off themselves, and cast it upon Gods Ministers, and violently to pull their shoulder from under it; but the people of God sit down under it, and bear it patiently, yea take up a new <hi>burden of sorrow</hi> for the sin which hath procured it, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 27, 28, 39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> IV. Learn hence what use to make of the threatning of Gods Judgements, and Reproofs of your sins, if it be <hi>a burden</hi> to hear of them, what then will it be to bear them? if you cannot endure to sit quietly whiles you are told of them, how will you endure when God shall do according to the word of his Messengers? Let such thoughts as these move you to prepare your selves, this use God would have these burdens attain, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of Dumah] i.e.</hi> Of the Land of <hi>Idumea,</hi> the place of the posterity of <hi>Esau,</hi> called <hi>Edom:</hi> these were, though of the posterity of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> yet a Nation rejected by God, and become an Heathen Nation; and yet God tells them aforehand what he intends against them, and condescends to give them a Warning to Repentance. Hence</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>God, though grievously provoked, yet seldome brings desolating Judgements, before he gives warning. Edom,</hi> though out of Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant shall nevertheless hear from God before they feel his wrath, and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Tyre,</hi> &amp;c. as we finde scattered in the Prophesies, how much more a people in Covenant with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because this is the day of Gods for bearance, and therefore he will exalt it towards sinners, and make them to taste of it. It is the time wherein Justice is moderated by Mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That sinners may have an opportunity to repent: when God speaks to them before he strikes them, he puts <hi>a price into their hands,</hi>

               </gap> on it as such a season, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To take off all excuse in the day of Vengeance, that all mouthes may be stopt, sinners shall have nothing to say for themselves, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been warned; they shall have no plea, shall not be able to say, <hi>We never heard of it:</hi> no cloak shall be left them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> This may be a Rule to teach us what use to make of those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Warnings which God vouchsafes to afford unto us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hearken to his <hi>Warnings,</hi> hear his Threatnings, attend to them, and believe them.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>How doth God warn us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, By his <hi>Messengers,</hi> these are Ambassadors, to declare the minde and counsel of God, and proclaim his Judgments.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But Revelations cease, how then can they give us a true account of the minde of God, and his purposes of bringing Judgments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n its?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> God gives a greater portion of his Spirit to his Ministers, then to others, and by that Spirit he extraordinarily</p>
            <p n="1">1. Stirs them up to a consideration of his minde and counsels: he directs their thoughts that way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Discovers to them the sins of the times and places they live in, makes them to observe the frames and manners of the people he sends them to.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Enables them to compare his ancient dealings with sinners, in the several respects and circumstances, and hence to draw conclusions, and hence verifies that promise, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 7. Now these Conclusions are <hi>a sure word of Prophesie:</hi> for</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Rule is standing, <hi>Crying sins are answered with certain Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> God is the same he was, his Holiness and Justice remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, and unchangeable, and therefore sinners have no hopes to escape, if they remain in their sins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Like sins bring like Judgements; <hi>Sodoms</hi> sins are followed with <hi>Sodoms</hi> plagues; and therefore if our sins answer former times, we may expect our sufferings to be like theirs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Prophesies of the Prophets were cautioned with the condition of Repentance, either explicite, as appears by the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to repent annexed to their Threatnings frequently; or at least implicite, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so are theirs.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Let the <hi>Patience</hi> of God break our hearts, and <hi>lead us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Rom.2. 4. Remember, God might have stricken when he warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; he might have made <hi>our plagues seven times heavier,</hi> when he did lay some gentler stroke upon us; he might have made haste, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and made an end with us in one day, after he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>He calleth,</hi> &amp;c] Here is the <hi>question</hi> or <hi>Introduction</hi> to the Prophesie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He]</hi> i.e. Some Person, or Messenger.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Watchman, what,</hi> &amp;c.] By Watchman is meant the <hi>Prophet,</hi> these are called <hi>Watchmen</hi> by God, because he sets them to discern his wrath, and give warning to the people. The meaning or intent of the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> is diversly understood: I finde a twofold interpretation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some take it to be an expression of the bitterness and anguish of the <hi>Edomites,</hi> concerning the future event of those troubles which were beginning upon them: it seems War was threatned by the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrian;</hi> through which anguish they send to the Prophet, to know what was likely to ensue, what troubles they should meet withall: for <hi>Night</hi> is here a Metaphor of the time of affliction, as it is often in Scripture, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then the ingemination of the Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, implies an earnestness of desire to be informed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others understand it to be spoken in a flouring way, and so they call the Prophet <hi>Watchman</hi> by way of derision; as if they should say, <hi>Isaiah,</hi> you pretend to be a Watchman, and have foretold much of the time of trouble and desolation to come upon us, but we still enjoy the morning of prosperity, we are a free people, and not in subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; come, what do you say to it now? Either interpretation will stand with the Analogie of Faith: though I think the latter to be
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:000184_0049_0FA3179907019C10"/>
more suitable to the <hi>Answer</hi> given in the following verse; in which sense the doubling of the <hi>Question</hi> is an aggravation of the scoff in a sarcasmous speech.</p>
            <p>From these words observe,</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>Times of Calamity are fitly compared to the night season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is much of Analogie in these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>night</hi> nothing can be distinguished from the darkness, all things lye equally mantled under that black <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hence the Grave is called <hi>A land of darkness,</hi> because all meet equally, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> there: in times of Calamity the affliction is universal, good and bad are not to be distinguished by the outward face of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Eccles</hi> 9. 1.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>night</hi> is a <hi>joyless time,</hi> darkness and obscurity hide from us objects of joy and mirth: in times of Calamity objects of joy are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, these outward symptomes and expressions of delights and pleasures are removed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7 34.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>night</hi> is <hi>full of terrour,</hi> the darkness hath a kinde of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon our fantasie, leaving an impression of strange apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and possessing us with fears. Calamitous times are fearful and terrible times, fill us with suspitions, a man knows not whom to trust, lives in a fearful expectation of sudden miseries to seize upon him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>night</hi> is a <hi>solitary time,</hi> breaks up societies, and scattereth them to their severall Chambers, to feed upon their melancholick thoughts and fears. Troublesome times bring places full of inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to fit solitary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> I. See here a Reason why the people of God ought to do their utmost to prevent the day of Calamity: though they shall get good by all Providences, yet <hi>no affliction is</hi> in it self <hi>joyous, but grievous,</hi> and they shall finde a great deal of <hi>night</hi> of trouble at such a time. Hence wonder not to hear them so earnest to depreca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e that day, and labour to with God for a prevention of it. Christ himself, in whom was no sin, begs again and again, <hi>if it be possible that the Cup might pass away</hi> from him; how much more they that have sin as well as sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to grapple withall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> II. See here the Analogie between <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> both are in Scripture called <hi>darkness:</hi> hence the punishment is suitable to the fault, God payes men in their own Coin; if men will hurry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:000184_0050_0FA31799C5A3A638"/>
into the shades of sin, God justly brings them into <hi>a land of darkness, and of the shadow of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> III. This Consideration may warn us to have a care how we provoke Gods Judgements against us, to bring wrath upon us; we may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>old and fearless while the day time lasts, and our Sun of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity shines upon us, but if we pull down Judgements upon our heads, we shall finde the <hi>night</hi> to be</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Joyless,</hi> we shall see the difference between joy and sorrow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally when God shall have removed our comforts away from us, our peace, our outward supplies, all our precious things, we shall then feel what it is to be benighted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Terrible,</hi> full of amazement. Ah! little do we know what the terrour of this <hi>night</hi> mean, to be oppressed with pining hunger, with pinching penury; to hear the cries of Children following us for bread, and none to give them; to hear the found of the Trumpet, and Alarm to War; to hear the cries of the wounded, and see the slain in our gates; to fee the raging of Famine and Pestilence, and natural affection changed into a Tyger-like Cruelty, tender-hearted Mothers shutting up their bowels of pity, and laying violent hands on the Children they have born; to go into Captivity, and serve an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my whose tender mercies are cruelty; to live in fear of every sight, every noise, left it should be some messenger of Death, or that which is worse.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Solitary</hi> and lonesome, when you shall be made desolate, and like <hi>Job.</hi> who was made <hi>a stranger to the wife of his bosom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

You see <hi>Edom</hi> here makes a great do of Enquiry: there is an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and false, and there is a sincere and true Enquiry made about divine Dispensations, and the one apparently, and to the view of the world, may be as earnestly pressed as the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because there are other things which may excite such an Enquiry, besides the fear of God; <abbr>

            <p n="2">2. A naturally busie talkative spirit, that loves to be busie, talking and discoursing, many affect to be in discourse, and hence they enquire that they may have something to spend time in discourse.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A desire to be thought wise, discerning and prudent, hence men will enquire for light: we love to have the esteem for prudence and discretion, to be accounted men of discerning spirits, that observe and know the times, and hence take some pains in searching.</p>
            <p n="4">4. An ironicall and flouring spirit: such this seems to be in the Text, not that we have any true desire to know any thing, but in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain of Gods Ministers: we enquire of them as for knowledge, but in the mean-while look upon them to have no more knowledge of the minde and counsel of God then ourselves: with this spirit those <hi>proud men</hi> seem to have come to enquire of the Prophet. <hi>Jer.</hi> 43.</p>
            <p>

            <p n="2">2. An intent to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to no other end, but that they may pick a quarrel with Divine Providence, and charge the wayes of God with injustice, as if they were wiser then God, as if he did not Rule the World by an equall Law.</p>

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000184_0055_0FA3179D851B05A8"/>
about the Judgements of God, and those awfull Providences that are rolling over our heads: there is a great Enquiry made, but let us not think or conclude our selves ever the better, because we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number of those who are possibly the most forward upon this account, but examine our selves whether we do it in sincerity or in hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>Signs of hypocriticall Enquiry.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When we enquire more after the <hi>Events</hi> of Calamity, then the Causes procuring of it: thus those <hi>Id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tans, What of the night?</hi> i. e. What is like to come upon us? So there is much enquiry, what the issue of these rolling Providences is like to be; what things are like to come to: but there are few say, What have I done? wherein is the Lords anger incensed <hi>amp;c.?</hi> this shews we are more afraid of sorrow then sin, when we look so much at the Rod, and not at the hand which wieldeth it: This argues a spirit of hypocrisie, for we neglect our work; which is to search and try our hearts, and meddle with Gods work, whose Soveraignty it is to rule and order the affairs of the whole World at his own pleasure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we enquire more after <hi>Natural</hi> then Spiritual <hi>Causes:</hi> we are very inquisitive to know what may be the <hi>Natural Cause</hi> of these Blastings which have for many years diminished and corrupted the best of our Grain; and hence, many projective endeavours in vain attempted to prevent it, by a seeking to remove that Cause, which we are to this day baffled in, and as far off to seek as ever: but the Causes Spiritual (which are more manifest, and easie to be discovered) are slightly sought after, and so but little endeavour to remove them, hence no wonder that the Effect remains, we enquire in hypocrisie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When we enquire, but 'tis without any desire or willingness to see the <hi>true Reason</hi> or <hi>Causes,</hi> or be convinced of them, we enquire with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inde of fore-stalled and prejudicate spirit; we have taken up already what our determination is and must be: hence this it is, and no other thing, hence we arm our selves with a resolution to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all Conviction, and so lay a block in the way to prevent any effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious meeting God in such a way as might remove his hand off from us, and prevent the process of more and worse miseries.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When we enquire, but never intend to <hi>reform:</hi> this was the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry of those, <hi>Jer.</hi> 43. their promises were indeed fair, but when the Prophet had gone to God and enquired for them, and brought

            <p n="5">5. When we enquire, but not of <hi>Gods Watchmen:</hi> times have been when they have been esteemed, and looked upon as Watchmen indeed, who were best able to inform us in the Counsels of God; but now who more blinde then they in our practical judgement? a prejudicial eye is cast upon them, and they laid by as useless. Oh how is the cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an Anabaptistical and censorious spirit (who can spit his venom in the face of Magistracy and Ministry, and make these the Causes of all our Trouble) set by among many? whiles the faithful Warnings of Gods Servants are contemned.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When possibly we enquire of them, but with a <hi>slighty</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful <hi>spirit:</hi> Oh how many go with their nice Queries to their Ministers, when they despise them in their hearts? and either lay snares for them, as they dealt by Christ himself, <hi>Is it lawful to pay tribute,</hi> &amp;c? or at least do not go to them as such whom they do indeed look upon and esteem to be sent of God, and therefore may hopefully expect to receive better information from them, then from others, hence they little regard, and less do they practice.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When we enquire, but we are not willing the Cause should be in <hi>our selves,</hi> but in others: and hence though we enquire with some earnestness, yet if the Answer (though true) touch us, and our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, we cannot bear it; this shews that we enquire with a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious (which is an hypocritical) spirit: we regard not how much blame be laid upon others, but are willing to take none of the blame and shame of the sin to our selves; and therefore come not up to this, which is the onely sincere first Enquiry, <hi>What have I done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> II. To humble us for our hypocrisie upon this account: and how much cause the best of us may have to take the shame of this sin upon us before God this day, if we did seriously enquire, we might in some measure discover: let us then bewail it seriously.

            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> I. See here a reason why Gods faithful Ministers use so little humane policy in the execution of their Place and Office: should they connive at our sins, few pillows under our elbows, fawn upon us, or at the least speak in the dark and aloof off, they were most likely, in an eye of humane Reason, to live more quietly, and less hated: he is ready to be accounted our enemy who tells us the truth. How easily might they accommodate themselves to humane affections, but they dare not do it, but speak plain; not because they are ignorant of the probability of what entertainment they are like to meet withall, but because they dare not to be false to the charge and trust which God hath laid upon them. I confess, concerning some things there may be an indiscreet zeal, in these there is a time to hold one's peace; but in the discovery of the Counsels of God, and laying open crying sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it's not the fear or favour of man, but the awful command of God, which must be, and is, the Rule of the serious Minister, who being sent from God, must deliver his Embassie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> II. Learn hence how faithful God is to us, how unfaithful so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we be to him, and to our own souls; might we have our own desires, we would hear nothing else but soothing and pleasant words; he that preacheth sin and wrath, is a Legallist, a <hi>Micaiah,</hi> he <hi>never speaks good to us;</hi> thus would we go sleeping and secure to Hell, run our selves jocundly into all misery, such enemies are we to our own souls: but how faithful is God, who seeing us falling into the seas of wrath, sends to awaken us out of our sleep, to tell us of our evil wayes, and to reclaim, and bring us back. That God hath ordained and set up the Office of the Ministry under that solemn and dreadful charge, As they will answer it in the great day, If they will not bring

Learn hence to account a plain-dealing Ministry to be of God, however they cross our corruptions: if any in the world are indeed sent of God to us, then surely those, who laying aside all self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends and worldly interests, lay themselves open to the hatred and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the world, hazard to lose our love and good will, to be evil spoken of, to suffer want, and hard usage among us, rather then be silent in an evil day; rather then hold their peace, and let us alone in our sins, or palliate and dissemble with us in the Cause of God and our own souls. Pray to God that you may alwayes have and enjoy such Ministers, and that he would put this Spirit into his Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors.</p>

               </gap> of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Consider what Warnings God hath given us:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Ministry:</hi> Hath it not been the voice of God in the mouth of all his Prophets, hath there not been a full and universal consent of all Gods Messengers, that <hi>God hath a Controversie with his people, and cannot be silent?</hi> How long hath this been a Conclusion, and they have been faithful to discharge their duty, and acquit their Consciences on this account by declaring it: this we have heard often proclaimed, and by sound demonstration cleared to us, but we have made too light of that, Ministers must say something to keep up their credit, and keep the people in awe. And therefore</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath warned us in his <hi>Providences,</hi> that so he might make us believe his Word in the mouth of his Messengers: and that not only by many Signs and Prognosticks usual forerunners of calamitous times, but also by the <hi>Vaunt-Courriers</hi> of his Army of Judgements, beginnings of sorrows; many have been the sad and awakening Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of these latter years, he is a stranger in our <hi>Israel</hi> who is unacquainted therewithall. It we will not credit the Word, yet let us believe the Rod; if in the <hi>Morning</hi> we have been easily deluded into false and vain hopes, to think it would never be <hi>Night,</hi> yet one would think, when the Sun seems to be setting in our Horizon, and the dusk of the Evening is coming upon us, we should now be ready to give credit to it, unless we are fallen into a Lethargic, and dead sleep of Security.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now let us bethink our selves how it may be prevented: to what end should we be warned, but that we might endeavou to prevent and escape the drinking the dregs of this Cup, whereof we have been already made to sip?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Believe that God is yet willing to be stopt, he shews how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing he is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and therefore is ready to be stayed. God loves to be hindred in these proceedings he himself looks to set if there be <hi>any to stand in the gap, and make up the breach,</hi> and he <hi>is grieved when

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> encouragement; <hi>The God of Israel is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God,</hi> and will be ready to extend that mercy to us, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any advantage he hath in his hand against us: he therefore (when in the midst of Judgements) swears, that he <hi>delights not in the sinners death,</hi> and calls upon them to return to him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Improve the means of prevention that are appointed by God: as there is a possibility of stopping the process of Gods wrath, so there is but one onely way whereby it can be done, and that is by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning by a thorow Repentance, by a confessing and forsaking those sins that pull down wrath; we must <hi>confess,</hi> that he may be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Just; we must <hi>forsake,</hi> because the Cause must be taken away before the Effect cease.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Prepare that if the <hi>Night</hi> come you may make advantage of it for your good: though the Night hath many sad disadvantages, yet it hath its advantages too; though it pay the sluggard with shame, yet to him that hath done his work, 'tis sweet, and helps his rest: if it finde you <hi>in a way of righteousness,</hi> it can do you no hurt, it shall do you a great deal of good. Oh prepare, get your sins pardoned and done away, if the guilt of these remain, they will interpose as a thick and dismall Cloud, between the light of Gods countenance and your souls, then it will be a black and dark night indeed: get into Christ, make him your shelter and rock, he is a sure refuge, and the tempest cannot break through him to do you any harm, though it should bear down, and wash away the <hi>clay house of your earthly tabernacle,</hi> yet it cannot keep you from, but will hasten you to a more speedy posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of your Eternal Mansion, your house of rest, <hi>whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </abbr> the glory of God: this is the end of all true service, to bring glory to our Maker, and if this be not our aim and end, God is not indeed served in it.

            <p n="1">1. How little fruit of Reformation hath there been on our part: what one thing hath there been amended? what publick sin hath been reclaimed? is there ever the less vanity, pride, profaneness, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, contention? or do not these and the like evils seem rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arease and grow more after all? and is not this a note of hypocrisie, to confess, and seem to bewail, and yet not to amend, but grow worse?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wherein hath there been a removal of the Rod on Gods part: do not our calamities seem to increase, and the stroke to be more and more heavy? we lost many Instruments of the glory of God, and suffered many bodily Calamities, and Blastings of our labours, and we have fasted, but <hi>his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out still;</hi> yea more varieties of sorrows are heaped upon us: we may therefore well examine our own hears, what is the reason of all this, unless we have not yet indeed turned to him who smote us, the Lord our God.</p>

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="6">6.

Why is God displeased?</hi> Why, is all this nothing? yes sure: why, who knows not that these are our distempers?</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But there is some particular thing which must be known, and this is either in Magistrate, or Ministers, or both: when shall you finds in Scripture that God ever brought publick Judgements on his people, but the sins of Princes, Priests and Prophets were the causes of it, and are so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to have been? and therefore we must enquire yet further.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This Objection is strange and impertinent, it is as if a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician should come to a person all over full of mortal wounds, and yet neglects them all, and strangely cries out, There is one singular wound which I must finde out: is not this to suffer the person wilfully to perish, by letting him bleed out his life at the known wounds, while he goes upon the discovery of one unknown? Is not this <hi>New-Englands</hi> case, such as was once <hi>Judahs,</hi> Isa. 1 5. and shall we yet grope as in the dark after some singular thing: I therefore fear that this is but a fond and hypocritical excuse, to put off the edge of the conviction of present sins, and keep up our credit too, as if we would willingly know the minde of God. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppose there be some singular sin: yet</p>
            <p>First, It doth not need presently terminate upon the Magistracy and Ministry, though wherein they may be wanting in their places, the Lord give them to see &amp; reform it, but it is not my work to scandalize those who cannot hear me speak: yet I say the sin is not needfully theirs. But</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may be universal, a spreading and over-running distemper. It is true indeed, God sometimes speaks to these, <hi>For your sakes they shall go into captivity;</hi> but if we be wise and compare Scripture, we shall elswhere hear God saying, <hi>My people would have it so;</hi> there is a concurrence, a delight in it.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Consider (though I speak not to excuse sin in any, where they may be guilty before God) yet consider why hath God lately taken away so many of his precious Servants in the Ministry, it is not to their damage or wrong, they are gone to their rest, have left a sinful and sorrowful world, to be invested with a Crown of Glory, and to be with Christ, which is best: but we are bereaved, the Lights are put out of our Candlesticks; they were despised here, and they are now received to honour and glory: and this may call us to solemn conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

            <p>Secondly, Be it a singular sin, and let it center where it will, it seems we are to seek about it; It tell you, the way to know it, is to reform what we do know. God reveals himself by degrees to a people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their improvement. God hath told us of these and those things; why should he discover any more, since we mend not, but make so ill use of what he hath discovered. Let me tell you, and I can assure you of it to be a truth, prove it, and you shall have experience of it, If we repent from our hearts of our known sins, God will either remove the stroke off from us, or further discover what is provoking to him.</p>

               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Of the the first; From Gods merciful Nature, who had rather sinners should repent and live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 11. he had rather spare then destroy, but it must be so as his Honour may not be wronged, which is near and precious to him, and therefore it must be by giving glory to him in a way of Repentance. Hence God when he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, useth delayes, and moves slowly in bringing his Judgements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Of the second; Because partial Repentance is but a mockery: We owe God all, and therefore in every thing wherein we have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, we ought to repent and return, and seek to make it up. He that doth not repent seriously of every sin, doth not repent truly of any sin; he that doth not return unto God, doth not in truth turn away from his sin: a half repentance therefore is no repentance at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Of the third:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because this is the last means, and therefore if this do it not, what hopes are there remaining of such a peoples Reformation. God takes not the Rod in his hand till he be enforced to it, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 37. he useth all other means first, Convictions, Reproofs, Warnings, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and waits to see if these will not reach his ends, and work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; when all these fail then he begins to afflict a people: now if this will not effect it, nothing will, such a people are beyond hopes obstinate in rebellion, whom Judgements will not awaken to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and therefore, God hath little encouragement to use any long delayes with such a people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because God delayes till he be indeed provoked, and therefore
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:000184_0079_0FA317AE09A4B830"/>
there is need to make haste. God in this exalts his Patience to wait a long time upon a rebellious people, but if Patience be worn out, we had need have a care now to our selves, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> Here we see what is our work to day: God hath begun and made an entrance, and hath been bringing of us on to a stage of Judgements, I need not mention the particulars wherein his hand hath been out against us. Here you see what God expects at our hands.</p>
            <p>First, He must have <hi>Repentance,</hi> if you come not to this you do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; if you only <hi>confess,</hi> it is but half a Fast, you must <hi>forsake</hi> too.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God will be owned to be just, in the most retired thoughts of your hearts, he cannot bear it to be found fault withall, or be thought to do any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, he will have you to acknowledge, that in all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hath done, he is righteous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence you must see your sins, your many provocations, your Covenant-breakings, and your particular enormities, you cannot else justifie God aright, for that is onely done by a sight of sin in its being, its hainousness and guilt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God punishment for sin, hence therefore you must forsake them, you must part with those sins which have parted between God and you: Gods holiness will keep him at a distance from you, so long as you keep your sins, and do not willingly part with them: he cannot love you, till you hate your sins.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He must have a <hi>thorough Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. You must repent of all your sins, that is, all universally, and all particularly, as he comes to discover them to you, you must be sure hide none under your tongue, spare none, but bring them all forth, and confess them before God; the least sin reserved, will keep you at a distance from God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You must amend your wayes, you must live a new life, take cut a new lesson and learn to practise it; you must live no longer after the old <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort, you must not now go out of Gods presence, and do as bad as ever you did, God will not endure such halving with him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You must cleave to God with your whole heart, and not fit loose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
