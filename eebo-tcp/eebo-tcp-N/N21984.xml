            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS <hi>Volume is ſent into the world without apologies, although the Author has many to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: That candour which the ingenuous will always beſtow on the productions of one ſo very young, cannot be increaſed by them; and that diſpoſition to cenſure, which many are fond of cheriſhing, much leſs removed. A few of theſe Miſcellanies have, previous to their publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, appeared in the New-York Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine—The</hi> Young Compoſitor, <hi>which is among this number, was written by the Author at a much earlier period of his life than any other performance inſerted in this Volume—He has left it in its original ſituation, without altering the egotiſms with which it abounds—The piece is deſigned to expoſe the errors of youth.</hi>

                  <p>WHEN the mind has fixed upon a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as a theme for its reflections, one of the moſt difficult ends is then accompliſhed. It is always the caſe with youth, that when they have brought their minds to a mode of thinking, and ſit down to compoſe, their firſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt difficulty is, on what ſubject they ſhall write. A variety of ſubjects are preſented to their imaginations; but the mind ſingles out no one in particular before the others. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028973_0020_0FDDC717CECD42C8"/>
ideas ariſe which might tend to the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration of each of them; and it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that we are longer in chooſing a ſubject, than, when this difficulty being overcome, we are in finiſhing the compoſition. I remember often to have ſet down, yet undetermined on what ſubject to write, while many were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to my view: I have at length ſhewn a little partiality for the pleaſures of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have run on within my mind, with out committing it to paper after this manner: "To the imagination man owes ſome of the moſt pleaſing moments of his life; it wafts him to celeſtial regions, unſeen, untrod, and brings to his contemplative view, thoſe beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and captivating ſcenes which none but ſhe herſelf can paint. It is ſhe that paints the lovely grottos, the verdant vallies and the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawns, the retreats of muſes, and the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtreams which meander through them; ſhe brings to the view of the youthful lover, the charming form of his Amelia, and dwells on the pleaſing proſpect, when ſhe ſhall be his.—She preſents to youth honor, fame, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as—." Thus far having proceeded, I
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028973_0021_0FDDC758646A6B10"/>
make a pauſe; inward diſſatisfaction tells me this is not a good ſubject, and points to ſome other. I then begin on Dancing in the ſame manner:—"Some enthuſiaſts have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhew that dancing is a ſin; others again, not going quite ſo far, have exclaimed againſt it as a waſte of time: Againſt all theſe hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical gentry, I ſhall endeavour to defend this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable accompliſhment." I here alſo pauſe, grow diſſatisfied, and make a third attempt; for the country with all its charms, now attracts me topaint her in lofty ſtrains.—"While ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the tumults of a city; retirement, eaſe and ſolitude point to the rural retreat, where roſy health ſits enthroned, and where peace and content lead on the gentle train." The wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering imagination of youth is not yet content, and I am often forced to riſe without having determined what virtue, or what vice, or what thing ſhall have the honor of claiming my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt ſpeculative attention. But the ſubject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen, another difficulty which ariſes in the mind of youth, is, how they ſhall begin: Shall it be by a round about way, as if ſtealing upon the ſubject, and a long preamble? Or ſhall
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028973_0022_0FDDC71995B2A060"/>
they come out open and bold and directly tell then ſubject. To avoid this laſt, is what ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it more difficult to youth, for they look upon it as ungraceful in writing. It is the manner which naturally occurs to their minds and requires ſome ſtudy to avoid. But I think it is a miſtaken notion in us, for the chief end of writing is to be underſtood, and ſimplicity in ſtile muſt then be the beſt, provided it is not harſh and grating to the ear. The former of theſe introductions, Dr. Johnſon, in his Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler. abounds with: we have with him a page of reflections, and exclamations, before we know what ſubject we are about to meditate upon. It is the manner generally practiſed by flowery writers, and thoſe who delight in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ear more than improving the mind. But Addiſon, who is the ſtandard of beauty in writing, always introduces his ſubject with a reflection, or ſtrikes directly to the point. What a ſimple and beautiful introduction is the following:—"There is nothing in which men deceive themſelves more than in what the world call zeal. There are ſo many paſſions which hide themſelves under it and ſo many
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028973_0023_0FDDC759444CE808"/>
miſchiefs ariſing from it, that ſome have gone ſo far as to ſay, it would have been for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of mankind, if it had never been reckoned in the catalogue of virtues."—When the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is choſen and begun, the young Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor goes on with a tolerable degree of briſkneſs his heart begins now to expand with pleaſure; and I look upon the delight of the youth in the preſent ſituation of the compoſition, to be greater than in any other. The greateſt impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments are now removed, and the ſtream flows in an uninterrupted and peaceful ſucceſſion. The laſt difficulty, and let me add alſo the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, to the young compoſitor, is the concluſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. He is led aſtray by a falſe idea of grandeur, in terminating his reflection, by ſelecting the moſt ſonorous and high ſounding words, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make his piece end well, let it be of whatever merit.</p>
                  <p>This puts me in mind of a man who, having lived in the meaneſt and moſt wicked ſtile was reſolved to die in a moſt magnificent one. I remember at the concluſion of a little compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mine on libels, I was at a ſtand; but ſome inſpiring angel overcame my difficulty,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028973_0024_0FDDC71B3A6CAE28"/>
and whiſpered me the following:—"The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a man is of too ſerious a nature to be thus ſported with: For when robbed of it, a perſon is deſerted by thoſe who formerly were his friends, and univerſally deſpiſed. To a feeling mind, how wretched is ſuch a ſtate. But yet, O envy! ſhort is thy triumph, for innocence will ſtill prevail, and triumph in her turn.—She will unfold grim envy's gloomy haunts, and her black form diſcloſe.—An ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation I beg leave to make on compoſition in general, is, that moſt youth ſtudy to write in a flowery ſtile; this, when it flows naturally, is an evidence of a fertile genius:—But they ought never to mend the language in which the idea preſents itſelf, unleſs it is bad grammar, and expreſſions which are harſh; for then, as an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor expreſſes it, the language is raiſed, but the ſtrength is fallen. The fault of a young poet I conceive to be his great delight to ſend invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the muſes, and to ſpread throughout the poem the name of youth. Of the invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the following is an elegant example:
<q>
                        <l>O come, ye muſes, with a laurel crown,</l>
                        <l>Pour, O Parnaſſus, pour your torrents down!</l>
                        <l>
                           <pb n="19" facs="unknown:028973_0025_0FDDC75DF35CED00"/>
Blow ye poetic zephyrs gently blow,</l>
                        <l>Ye heavenly choirs, O ſtrike in accents ſlow;</l>
                        <l>Ye gods immortal, ſwell the preſent lay,</l>
                        <l>O Homer, Milton, hearken when I pray.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word more employed than any other by a young poet, and which he can hardly write any poetry without frequently uſing, is ſoft. He makes the mind the impreſſion of the face, and almoſt every thing he deſcribes ſoft, as in the following verſes:
<q>
                        <l>Friendſhip the offſpring of a ſoul refined,</l>
                        <l>Where firm ſincerity and truth reſide;</l>
                        <l>And the <hi>ſoft</hi> virtues of a gentle mind,</l>
                        <l>With generous pity for its feeling guide;</l>
                        <l>Connects theſe girls in ſtrongeſt <hi>ſofteſt</hi> ties,</l>
                        <l>Array'd in all their <hi>ſoft</hi> interior grace;</l>
                        <l>Strong as the luſtre of their ſparkling eyes,</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Soft</hi> as expreſſion in their lovely face.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet after all I have ſaid, it is a true and common ſaying, that what is taught by precept, is not ſhewn by example; for where our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation points, we naturally follow, though at the expence of error. And with much propriety
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028973_0026_0FDDC71FCBAC01B0"/>
might I here apply to myſelf theſe words of the poet:—
<q>
                        <l>"I ſee the right and I approve it too,</l>
                        <l>"Condemn the wrong, and yet the wrong purſue."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having gone through theſe remarks, relative to a young compoſitor, let us for a moment draw the curtain, and behold him in his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, with the inſtrument of his profeſſion in his hand, and Sheridan laying by his ſide:—See, how with eyes ſteadily fixed on ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and not even allowed to twinkle, and with his elbow placed upon the table, and his head reclined upon his hand, he explores the qualities and appendages of things. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he caſts his eyes up, and then down, as if in the greateſt devotion. See how he knits his brows, claps his pen in his mouth, and rubs his ſhins with his hands, while the muſe reſuſes her aid, or in other words, while the young gentleman in unable to recal his ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ideas, or while he has none to recal. But look at him again: See now the pleaſant ſmile that plays upon his countenance, and with what
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028973_0027_0FDDC7618463DEF0"/>
rapidity he ſnatches his pen that he was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chewing; for the gods have ſaved it from deſtruction, by inſpiring its maſter with a thought. See how he throws one thigh over the other, and applies his pen to paper, leſt he ſhould loſe what he has this moment found. He now reads over, in rapid accents, his compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from the beginning, to ſee how the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent member will ſuit,—he gives the ſmile of approbation;—and then, as a fowler having killed his bird, beholds it with a ſmile, and as ſoon as he has thrown it into his wallet thinks no more of it, but purſues his game; ſo does this preſent pupil of Clio, after having ſecured his idea, throw down his head in its prior po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and purſue his meditation. See now, how boiſterously poor Sheridan is handled, for the young gentleman has at length arrived at the concluſion. His lips are now never ſtill, but continually repeating parts of ſentences, and muſically chiming ſonorous words. See now, when he has committed his concluſion to paper, ſubſcribed his name, and printed a FINIS, what looks of ſelf-approving merit beam from his eyes! Smile now follows ſmile.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028973_0028_0FDDC721121AC400"/>
—Here then we muſt let the curtain fall, for the young Addiſonian is juſt riſing to give his compoſition a ſecond reading, and to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it with geſtures and emphaſis, and all the graces of delivery. It is better there ſhould be but one mouth; let us therefore, be only ſilent hearers.</p>

                  <head>THE YOUNG COMPOSITOR. CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>IN the firſt chapter, I drew from nature a few obſervations concerning the Compoſitions of youth: I have traced ſome of the chief diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ariſing in their minds throughout the writing of the compoſition, the faults into which they naturally fall, and I have drawn the curtain and ſhewn a young Addiſonian in his meditation.—We left him with Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian eloquence, ſpeaking the effuſions of his brain; he has, no doubt, by this time ſtopped. The former ſpeaker has therefore ventured again to reſume his diſcourſe, and has preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it would not be unentertaining, <hi>ſhould
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028973_0029_0FDDC7629204DE88"/>
he advance farther, to thoſe who have honored his former little production with their read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> I ſhall now ſpeak generally of Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its great importance, and of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial effect of ſocieties, inſtituted for litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry improvement. Young perſons in chooſing a ſubject, ſearch always for that one in which they can moſt indulge a favourite inclination; that on which they can dwell in ſwelling lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage do they fail in argument, and wiſh to extend the compoſition to a greater length; they always have recourſe to example, which every one muſt undoubtedly acknowledge, to be weightier than precept, to effect both theſe. I remember I once ſingled out patriotiſm as my ſubject: after having, with much meditation and labour, produced a few remarks, I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately called to my aid the ſhades of heroes, and in enraptured accents exclaimed:—</p>
                  <p>How amiable muſt Warren appear; and how deteſtable on the other hand, is Arnold; behold, the one nobly dying, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and thus enumerated examples throughout the whole. An obſervation made by many writers is, that if youth wiſh to write a good ſtile, they muſt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028973_0030_0FDDC72594DADE00"/>
continually read ſome of the writings of the principal authors, ſo that they may imbibe their eaſy, and graceful expreſſions, and elegance of diction. Although this is the ſentiment of men remarkable for their learning and wiſdom, I have yet the audacity to poſſeſs thoughts which diſſent from it. That youth ought to read authors, to acquire a ſtock of ideas, I will not preſume to deny; for this and practice are the only means by which they are able to become compoſitors; but it is only to ſtile that I allude. No expreſſions can be ſimple, eaſy and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, without being natural. And can thoſe be ſo which are formed from the writings of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? muſt they not be affected, and the idea through this affectation, ſtripped of its force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Similar to the affectation of manners, which diminiſhes the power of form and of beauty. Is not the end of all writing to be underſtood? If this is the caſe, ſimplicity, is the beſt of ſtiles; and what is ſimplicy but nature. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Addiſon nor any other of the writers, whom we are told to imitate, ever purſued this method. In my opinion, he who wiſhes to write in the moſt ſimple and eaſy ſtile, muſt uſe
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028973_0031_0FDDC766D99B6798"/>
expreſſions which nature dictates, neither ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ornament, nor rejecting it when it volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily offers itſelf. Theſe expreſſions which nature dictates, by often practiſing ourſelves in compoſition, become more refined and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.</p>
                  <p>Did mankind not poſſeſs the power and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of converſation, we could not receive that moſt laſting and rational pleaſure, ariſing from ſocial ſociety. It is by this we receive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and information through communication. Beſides converſation, compoſition is another mean, by which we make known our ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on different and uſeful ſubjects. While converſation confines itſelf merely to thoſe who conſtitute ſociety, compoſition diffuſes its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning rays to thouſands; and while in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation the ſentiments which are advanced, are only the impulſe of the moment, thoſe in compoſition are well digeſted, and accompanied with eaſy and graceful language. Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is juſtly eſteemed the moſt uſeful branch in polite learning, and with it are connected all branches of ſcience; eaſe and grace in writing have therefore been the ſtudy of many ages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="unknown:028973_0032_0FDDC726A7B54880"/>
The advantages of compoſition and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſtiles have been ſhewn by many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent authors, and that upon it youth cannot beſtow too much labour and attention, provided it is not at the expence of other important ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Compoſition is the moſt conſpicuous branch of literature; by it men have riſen to ſame, without poſſeſſing any depth in ſcientific knowledge. It is by this that perſons in the loweſt rank and ſituation of life, have claimed the attention of a world, and acquired eſteem and admiration. How could we without it, advance, with propriety and energy our ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. How could we paint in the deſcriptive ſtile, the beauty or the curioſity of any object which has ſtruck our attention. How could we ſtand the champions of innocence againſt all the ſophiſtry of deceit and treachery. How could we paint in proper terms the deteſtable form of ſlavery, and dwell on the exalted vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of liberty.</p>
                  <p>To youth, upon contemplation, compoſition appears an exceeding difficult taſk, and one which they ſhall never be able to accompliſh; but upon practice, their ideas become more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,

and their underſtandings enlarged: this is one of the principal uſes of ſociety, for as in all other things, nothing can be acquired without practice, ſo it is in a more particular degree with regard to compoſition. Let not youth then be intimidated, for after one or two attempts, the way is rendered more plain and easy. In ſociety a youth has the advantage of of many examples: he can ſuit more to his capacity the writings of his equals, he can improve by the criticiſms made upon the ſame, and he is generally rouſed by the ſpirit of emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Of the importance of oratory, we need but ſlightly hint, for it is daily exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, at the bar, in the pulpit and in the ſenate. It is this which ſo much ſways the paſſions of men, one while making them feel a ſoldier's warmth, and now the ſoft emotion of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Do any of us wiſh to ſerve our country in the cabinet, or even in the field? this then is an eſſential ſtudy. By this we can enforce what propoſition we wiſh to be adopted, and by this we can re-animate the ſoldier's drooping cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. But ſhould any perſon deſpair of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an orator, becauſe nature has denied

               <head>ON HOPE AND REFLECTION.</head>
               <p>THE anticipation of future events, which we conceive will tend to our happineſs, elates the mind with joy and pleaſure. We are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the lively ſallies of imagination, and with anxious ſmiles caſt forward a ſearching eye, the beneficial effects ariſing from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired event, appear dreſſed in the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful colours, and give the mind a captivating glow, which prompts the wiſhed embrace. But ah! how often does the long looked for period at length arrive, but only to diſappoint the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy being, lulled by the giddy flights of a warm imagination, and dreaming of honor, popularity and reward. Led by the fond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver Hope, the author invokes his ſolitary muſe; with gloomy pleaſure he deviſes plans; alone he ſeeks the hoary genius of reflection,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028973_0035_0FDDC76976B40B28"/>
and gives to the world the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The world with frowns receives the gift; no ſmile breaks through the ſullen gloom, and ſoon a ſtartling voice, not that of gentle can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, blaſts the nouriſhed hope of the degraded author. Then from the muſes ſpreading grove he takes his lonely way to where, decaying oaks refuſe a cooling ſhade. No more he ſilent ponders on Parnaſſus' flowery banks, but ſeeks the ſtagnant pool. Hope firſt ſeduced the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Chatterton; on her he placed his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but alas? he placed them upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. At length wearied of her promiſes, he baniſhed her from his melancoly abode, and ſought the arms of death. Hope is one of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing paſſions of the human breaſt; it furniſhes the mind with employment, beyond what the preſent time affords. We receive nearly an equal pleaſure in anticipating ſome future event, as if we realized it. Hope preſents to us, futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, while Imagination decorates it in beautiful robes. Without Hope man would lead a dull and unhappy life. It is her which animates him, and calls forth his faculties to action, ſhe gives him ſerenity and good humour. Hope,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028973_0036_0FDDC72C5412DEC8"/>
ſays Addiſon, is a kind of vital heat in the ſoul, that cheers and gladdens her when ſhe does not attend to it—it makes pain eaſy and labour ſweet.</p>
               <p>How kind and indulgent does Hope lend her ſmiles on the youthful lover; ſhe conveys him to a beautiful bower, where the roſe, the jeſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and the moſt odoriferous flowers lendtheir ſweet perfume; ſhe there preſents to his view the object of his affection, and dwells on the future period, when he ſhall lead her blooming to the altar. When our country calls the ſoldier to arms, when in ſight the hoſtile armies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and martial muſic ſounds the dreadful onſet, what is it that keeps alive the courage of the hero, and bids him undauntedly face the cannon's bellowing mouth. It is the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſoother Hope that glows within his boſom. He hopes he ſhall be one of that happy number which ſhall ſurvive the conflict; that victory will crown his valour, and that his country will receive him with a wreath of laurels. But it was a hope of a different nature, which ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the boſoms of the ſons of Columbia—it was not for glory that they unſheathed the ſhining

ſword. It was for their injured rights, it was for liberty. Rouſed by the groan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of their country, their courage roſe to fury, which breathed vengeance on the foe, ſtained with the blood of their unhappy countrymen.</p>
               <p>There is another power beſtowed upon man, from which he receives a great ſource of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This power, which is reflection, though of a nature widely different, ſeems to be in ſome inſtances, a little ſimilar with Hope. Hope anticipates things which are to come, Reflection calls to mind what is paſt; the one is the offspring of that creative power the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, the other of the memory; the one is elated by the expectation of future happineſs, the other looks back with a ſmile of exquiſite pleaſure, on experienced incidents; the one takes its abode in the chearful breaſt of youth, the other in the experienced boſom of old age. We may be ſaid to poſſeſs double pleaſure from the anticipation of the happineſs which an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching event will confer upon us, and alſo, that we cannot fully enjoy one, without reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it. It is hard to determine from which
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028973_0038_0FDDC73154F520A8"/>
of theſe faculties of the mind it is, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the moſt pleaſure. How highly gratifying to the old man, muſt it be to recollect a well ſpent life; with what delight can he dwell on his puerile tricks, and youthful employments, when the tinge of health glowed upon his cheek, and when ſtrength nerved his limbs; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny happy years he has enjoyed, bleſſed with the ſmiles of a youthful bride. Reflecting upon paſt ſcenes improves our minds, and our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of human nature; we can recollect the many ſchemes and plans which were executed to bring about deſired events, and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others to defraud us. Knox, in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Eſſays, was ſo conscious of the extreme pleaſure, which attends the reflection of the virtuous man, that he has ſaid, To recollect a well ſpent life, is to anticipate a future ſtate of happineſs. Homer, in his Iliad, had ſhewn himſelf to poſſeſs a complete knowledge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, in his character of Neſtor; the old man can ſeldom deliver an oration, in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of princes, without informing them of the many noble actions he has atchieved, how he ſlew giants, tyrants, and baſe men. It was
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028973_0039_0FDDC76FD0975C38"/>
from this ſource the venerable hero drew his greateſt pleaſure, and it was by telling the ſeats of his youth, that he choſe to entertain his friends; who can hear the aged fire thus ſpeak, without feeling for him a veneration and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect—

               <p>I PROPOSE briefly to enquire into the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which youth receive from ſocieties eſtabliſhed for literary purpoſes. There are ſo many inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, formed from this motive, now exiſting, that it is an enquiry of ſome importance; the love of them ſeems to be prevalent in the breaſt of every youth. The rational pleaſure which we there receive, abſtracting every other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, deſerves ſome attention. One of the moſt delightful pleaſures which we can enjoy, ariſes from intercourſe with our fellow man; while in the preſence of lively and agreeable friends, we baniſh all diſagreeable reflections from our minds, which at other times would tend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt our repoſe, and diſcourſe with harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and pleaſure. There are few who can ſay, that they receive no pleaſure from a ſociety of favourite companions, when engaged in ſome literary diſpute; and ſuch who can, are in ſome meaſure bereft of the feeling of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Such who can, have, through diſſipation and vicious purſuit, rubbed off that amiable poliſh which attracts human nature in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028973_0046_0FDDC736F926B108"/>
ties of brotherly love. All will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the pure enjoyments which ariſe from a virtuous friendſhip; many can judge of it from delightful experience. It is in ſuch ſocieties as theſe that they become formed. Young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the ſame age, members of the ſame literary ſociety, and purſuing hand in hand the ſame object, ſympathy will be naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in each boſom, and led to form this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſensation. The particular objects which theſe ſocieties purſue are compoſition; verbal debates and oratory. To explain the uſe, and the great neceſſity of theſe branches, to render us great and diſtinguiſhed characters, is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and is not the ſubject of our inveſtigation.</p>
               <p>In favour of ſocieties one of the firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which ſtrikes us is Emulation, in a large ſociety, where young gentlemen meet for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and have ſuch a laudable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of diſplaying to their comrades their good ſenſe and judgment, it is impoſſible that ſuch a motive ſhould not actuate the breaſt, which is not callous to ſhame and the love of praiſe. The ſituations and rewards which are offered to their view, muſt ſtimulate every ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028973_0047_0FDDC7422150D6D0"/>
to excel. The Spartans, conſcious of the emulation which will always prevail among youth, formed their young warriors into ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, that ſo, ſtriving who ſhould excel in the military arts, they might be trained up to all the fatigues and hardſhips of war. It was this that rendered the Spartan bands invincible and ſpread the terror of their name abroad. But not like them we train ourſelves to ſcenes of human blood; we ſtrive not to gain the laurel from a bruiſed and bleeding adverſary, but we ſtrive to obtain the fragrant myrtle by excelling in literature, and the delight<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> arts of peace. Though youth may be led to practiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in compoſition, without entering ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet I am not acquainted with any other manner in which they are ſo agreeebly incited to it. Friendſhip, the love of praiſe, and deſire of improvement, invite them to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the delightful walks of the muſes, where no thorns obſtruct the verdant path. The modeſt youth there brings forth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, to the benevolent ear of friendſhip, and is not terrified by the expected ſneers of a moroſe critic; but ſtill a fear of diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028973_0048_0FDDC738593A1588"/>
and a deſire of praiſe, baniſh careleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and neglect, from his compoſitions and literary exerciſes. By reading and experience perſons may acquire a ſtock of knowledge; they may retain in their minds, various ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and hiſtorical events, which they have read; but they will never become elegant compoſitors, without much practiſe. By this they acquire a more regular arrangement of their ideas, and a more free and continued flow of thought and argument. A perſon can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver compose an eſſay entirely original, without much practiſe and inveſtigation; the more he practiſes, the more his mental faculties become enlarged and refined.</p>
               <p>Although a young compoſitor ought never to cultivate a ſtile which is laboured and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; he ought not to ſeek high-ſounding words and the many figures of rhetoric to decorate his compoſition; for theſe, inſtead of beauty, introduce obſcurity in his meaning, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play a conſiderable ſhare of pedantry unamia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in youth. Many perſons, led by a false taſte, conſider theſe as elegance; and inſtead of following the eaſy and natural path of ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028973_0049_0FDDC77B03E5F490"/>
copy the florid and bombaſtic ſtile of Hervey, which is grating to the ear of the true critic. But yet the harſh language of nature ought to be refined. The language in which an idea firſt preſents itſelf to our minds, the manner in which we clothe our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in converſation, which ariſe from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of the moment, requires conſiderable poliſh; more accuracy, a more ſmooth flow of our words, and a more particular arrangement of our periods ought to be obſerved; we ought to adorn our ſtile with the garb of neatneſs, but ought not to deck it with too many flowers, which diminiſh its force, and obſcure the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its texture. By practice and criticiſm we are led to ſeek this beauty of ſtile, and to ſhun this gaudy and bombaſtic diſplay of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. When young perſons firſt ſet out in their purſuit of the Belle Lettres, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always led aſtray by this falſe idea of grandeur, but after ſome practiſe, they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe a ſtile ſo effeminate, and endeavour to cultivate a ſtile, which then, to their more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined taſte, appears more perfect. Many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028973_0050_0FDDC7C3CF0B9FA0"/>
might be produced in favour of Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nile inſtitutions, which ariſe from the pleaſing exerciſe of extemporary diſputation; the truly rational and mental pleaſure which youth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from this improving enjoyment, has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been experienced by many to whom I now addreſs myſelf. From this ſource we might trace ſome of the moſt weighty arguments in ſupport of our cauſe. But we ſhall only ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally obſerve, that the fluency of ſpeech which is by this means acquired, the readineſs and quick ſucceſſion of ideas, the gracefulneſs and ease of extemporary delivery, operate great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the advantage of ſocieties: perſons, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though poſſeſſed of cultivated underſtandings, acquainted with the works of the hiſtorical and ſentimental writers, and although favorite ſons of the muſes, if they are not accuſtomed to extemporary diſputes, they will appear in certain ſituations to much diſadvantage. What is related concerning Addiſon, every perſon is acquainted with, it is a weighty example of what I aſſert; that profound claſſic knowledge which he had acquired, that elegance of diction, and that delicacy of wit, which ſhine ſo
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028973_0051_0FDDC77EC40649E8"/>
conſpicuous in his writings, could not in this inſtance ſupport him: "He conceived thrice, and brought forth nothing." Thus, this great man, the ornament of Britiſh Literature, by not being ſufficiently exerciſed in extemporary diſputation, gave occaſion to a ſtroke of wit, which muſt have hurt the tender feelings of this modeſt and amiable author; for want of this, men, infinitely his inferiors, appeared with more diſtinguiſhed luſtre. In ſociety, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often the advocates of a cauſe, we baniſh that timidity and baſhfulneſs, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attendant on our firſt attempts at diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which occaſion a perturbation of mind, which greatly confuſes the ſpeaker.</p>
               <p>I need not mention how exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite fluency of ſpeech, and promptneſs of thought are to the divine, the lawyer, and the perſon who is called upon by his countrymen, to repreſent them in legiſlature; they at once appear evident, and need no illuſtration. Some perſons have aſſerted, that youthful inſtitutions, inſtead of being beneficial, are diſadvantageous to youth. Their principal argument, and the one upon which they build their oppoſition, is,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028973_0052_0FDDC7C554112560"/>
that by extemporary diſputations, youth are led into a ſophiſtical manner of reaſoning. This I will acknowledge to be an objection of conſiderable import. Formidable, however, as it may appear, it is feeble, compared with the many benefits ariſing from ſociety. To invalidate this evil, I would obſerve, that it depends moſtly upon the diſpoſitions of perſons, that debates are productive of this harm; and that if youth would only allow the ſubject ſome inveſtigation, upon which they are to diſpute; if they are not fond of ſpeaking very often, to diſplay their talents, although devoid of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſubſtance, and if they will follow the advice of doctor Blair, by always chuſing that ſide of the queſtion, which to them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears right, and the moſt advantageous—Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile Inſtitutions would not be productive of this only evil, which can be maintained againſt them.</p>

               <p>IT is pleaſing to retrace paſt ſcenes, to bid fond thought ponder on events which were beneficial to us alone as individuals. If this to the rational mind affords a ſource of joy, what muſt be the heart-exulting glow of every ſon of Columbia? What pure delight muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection kindle in their patriotic boſoms? What muſt be their tender ſenſations of gratitude and love to an overruling power? When, on this auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious day, they behold their country bidding defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the threats of a despot, and daring to be
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028973_0056_0FDDC7CA29A1D258"/>
free; when they ſee her draw the glittering ſword and cut the chain of tyranny which would bind her, and proclaiming independence through all her fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile plains—when they find, that the liberty and independence for which <hi>they</hi> ſo arduouſly fought ſtill remain.—The hero, now, thinks upon his victorious ſtruggles, when freedom nerved his warlike arm, and enthuſiaſm in his country's cauſe rendered him dreadful to her foes—his former glorious wounds, new to his memory, bleed afreſh.—We, my young friends, as a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſociety, have convened to celebrate this ever memorable day; a day which our youthful minds behold with tranſport.—We poſſeſs not the ſenſations of the venerable actors on the bloody plain—but we feel equal pleaſure for the liberty which our country enjoys—we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the delightful emotions of exultation and emulation—we look upon the glorious work which our fathers have performed, and pant to unſheathe the ſword in our country's defence. As yet we are wholly unacquainted with war—Our country has not called us into the field—Under the ſhadow of celeſtial peace, we court

the gentle muſe—we follow, uninterrupted, our ſtudies in purſuit of knowledge—But ah! who knows how long this bleſſing will be preſerved! The bloody clouds of war begin to ſpread over the world: That liberty for which Columbia's ſons fought, has captivated the ſons of France with her charms—She has awakened in their boſoms an enthuſiaſm which braves the pointed ſteel, and bids them proclaim, "We will periſh or be free."—The European deſpots oppoſe their glorious cauſe; for they behold with fear, ſentiments ſo derogatory to their intereſt. They have led their numerous armies on the hoſtile plains, to ſtop the progreſs of Freedom; and the rich blood of thouſands has fertilized the fields; but the firm Tree of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſtands unrooted. Britain, that haughty, imperious, and infatuated nation, ſeems not yet to have been corrected ſufficiently for her inſolent and deteſtable deſigns on France, but turns once more her hoſtile eye on Columbia's cultivated ſhores.—She has acted towards her with much indignity.—But, beware Britain; once you have felt what Americans, what free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can do. America, unlike you, delights not in the effuſion of human blood, but wiſhes

Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice will ariſe to demand ſatisfaction from the offender. Many more are the numbers of her warlike heroes, than when you formerly felt the chaſtiſement of her infant arm—Many are her gallant youths, who, when their country calls, dauntleſs will oppoſe their patriotic breaſts—Many the ſons of thoſe brave heroes who fell for their country by your bloody hand.</p>
               <p>Come with me all ye emulative youth, and drop the tender tear of remembrance over War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren's tomb—That Warren whoſe blood firſt ſtreamed in Freedom's ſacred cauſe—That Warren, adorned by all the tender virtues, who, when his country called, flew from the ſmiles of his infant children, when deprived of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to nouriſh and ſoothe them, and ſought the dreadful ſcenes of war—Long has his aſhes mouldered in the grave, but his great and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like name ſhall ever live; "the prattling boy ſhall liſp it, and become a ſoldier."

America once had a venerable ſon, the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic FRANKLIN—who ſhone not as the warrior and general, but as the great and wiſe ſtatesman—who has vindicated the cauſe of Freedom with his pen, and whom we ought on this day to remember with the moſt lively gratitude, as one of the moſt active inſtruments in effecting our Liberty and Independence. In the ſublime walks of philoſophy, the name of Franklin will be always held in veneration. It was him who drew the lightning from the awful clouds, and who has improved the world in the knowledge of electric fluids.

When the firſt colonies of America were formed, ſhe ſpread wide her arms, and welcomed every perſon flying from the tyranny of deſpots to her friendly clime.—Thouſands flocked to her extenſive ſhores, and hailed her happy plains. Soon the cultured fields waved in ſmiling bloom; the towns and villages reared their heads, and the ſound of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry was heard through the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

over America, the dream vaniſhed; that former unmoleſted reign of tranquility was interrupted, but ſtill Liberty remained, until Britain's baſe deſigns, to ſubject us wholly under her power, were attempted to be put in execution. It was this that rouſed the indignation of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. It was in ſupport of their injured rights, that the firſt rich blood of freemen was ſhed at Lexington.</p>
               <p>But let us turn our attention to the event which we particularly celebrate this day: It opens a ſcene, ſolemn to the tender boſom—While Britain's unrelentleſs ſoldiery were ſpill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blood of Americans—while the ſpirits of all were damped by unſucceſs, and ſorrow ſat drooping on each patriot cheek, America calls together her little ſenate: In ſlow and penſive ſteps they move in proceſſion to their place of meeting—they bring the momentous buſineſs of Independence under their ſerious conſideration—they reflect on the cruelty which is exerciſed towards America, and, feeling ſpirit and ſublimity, greater than ever entered into a Roman ſenate, declare the United States Free and Independent.

               <p>May that Independence and Freedom, which were, in awful ſolemnity, declared on this day, be handed down to the lateſt poſterity—May poſterity feel the true bleſſing and ſpirit of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty equally with their fore-fathers, and may Heaven ſtill waft the clear and beautiful clouds of peace over theſe delightful regions.</p>

               <p>IT is very common with ſome perſons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their enmity to the rights of man by magnifying and decrying the extravagancies of thoſe who are engaged in contending for them—they are ſo diſingenuous as not to diſtinguiſh between a good cauſe, and the evils which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably attend the accompliſhment of it—Thus we frequently hear of the licentiouſneſs, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision

Not to call in queſtion, at preſent, the truth of many facts which are publiſhed, or to inſiſt on our inability at this diſtance, or the information we have, to judge of them—let me only aſk, Ought France to have patiently ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to her former government? If not, in what way ſhould ſhe have effected a Revolution? Was ever ſuch a thing accompliſhed without diviſion and bloodſhed? Who ſhall ſet bounds to a people riſing from under oppreſſion, and feeling their own liberty and ſtrength? Either ſhe muſt have continued under the old tyranny, or, in becoming free, ſhe muſt experience the diſtreſſes of the preſent day—which of theſe in the end will contribute moſt to the happineſs of poſterity, and to the happineſs of mankind? Would we rather that Caeſar were living, and be all bondmen, or that Caeſar were dead, and live all freemen?</p>
               <p>It is a pity that thoſe who ſo much lament the loſs of a few heads in France, do not conſider the monſtrous cruelties of which kings have been guilty—is not the Baſtile a more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſtrument than the Guillotine? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

All the blood already ſpilled, and which may be ſpilled in France, is only a drop to that which kings have ſhed—the earth has been ſtained with the gore, and fattened with the bodies of millions ſlain, through their injuſtice and rapine.</p>

In ſhort, the eſtabliſhment of a Republican form of government in France is ardently to be wiſhed, is intimately connected with the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of America, and with the happineſs of mankind.

               <p>Let us for a moment here enquire, what that deſperate thing, Equality, is, which ſo much alarms the minds of many <hi>amiable</hi> men.</p>
               <p>Equality ſays, all men are equal—that they were born free and independent—that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be repreſentative—that there ſhall be no king—but rulers, ſuch as meet the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the people—theſe are <hi>certainly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> circumſtances!—ſtartle ariſtocrat! The words, that all men are equal, very much hurt these gentlemen's finer feelings, and upon them they caſt many <hi>exceedingly ſatirical</hi> obſervations.

<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028973_0071_0FDDC79B1725C030"/>
is by theſe alone that we are to be led in the choice of our rulers. It does not demand what I have heard a wiſe gentleman wittily ſay, "that if we meet our brother in the ſtreet, without breeches, we ſhould give him half our own," but that the poor ſhall not be ſubſervient to the rich, that the induſtrious clown ſhall not be obliged to tremble, and how ſubmiſſive to a haughty and tyrannical lord when he approaches him, but that he ſhall be equal with all.</p>

               <head>THE EFFECTS OF MODERATION, CONSIDERED IN THE LOVE OF PRAISE &amp; POLITICS.</head>
               <p>THERE are many uſeful and pleaſing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions implanted in the breaſt, which, when much indulged, become great blemiſhes in the character; the animating glow which prompted the mind to great and glorious actions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes demeaned, when it ſtoops to things diſhonourable and degrading. From the want
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028973_0072_0FDDC7E586D563C0"/>
of paying proper attention to the warning voice of moderation, we often render ourſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtful to our fellow creatures, and involve ourſelves in many troubles. The paſſionate man is violent in all his proceedings; he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, blindfolded, the deluſive phantom in favor of which he is prejudiced, and ſpurns from him the paternal voice of reaſon—but the moderate man is poſſeſſed of the more tender and ſofter feelings: with his moderation he connects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and walks ſteady and ſure in all his ways—All men, in ſome meaſure, are actuated by prejudice, but the moderate man is not guided by the impulſe of the moment, but by mature deliberation. Zeal, in a good cauſe, when not carried beyond the limits of reaſon, is very much to be admired; but the paſſionate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> purſues with equal ardour the good and bad. The love of praiſe is a neceſſary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful paſſion. It is inherent in human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Mankind depend upon each other for all their wants, and even for their exiſtence; from ſocial intercourſe they receive their moſt laſting and rational pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:028973_0073_0FDDC79C0CA5BF48"/>
Persons unaſſiſted by their fellow-creatures, would make no progreſs in any uſeful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. It is ſociety that calls forth their faculties to action. We ſee then, that for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful ends the love of praiſe is a paſſion of the breaſt, for it is her attractive power which binds men in the ties of humanity and of friendſhip; no other principle of the ſoul would be capable of effecting this, if we did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the good opinion and eſteem of each other. Without this, the friendly intercourſe between the human race, the tender endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of brotherly love, would ſhun this miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able habitation of human nature. No more the ſympathetic boſom would glow with affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and relate its ſorrows and joys to the anxious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of a friend. No more would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the plaintive voice of love, and the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the conjugal ſtate. Shame, which often deters from the commiſſion of diſgraceful and wicked actions, would then have no influence over the conduct and inclination. Emulation would ceaſe to exiſt within the youthful breaſt. Literature and the cultivation of the arts and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028973_0074_0FDDC7DE0745ADD8"/>
and ſciences, would vaniſh from ſo diſcordant an habitation, and ignorance wrap the world in gloom and darkneſs.</p>
               <p>If ſuch an awful picture would preſent itſelf to us, were not the love of praiſe a principle of the human breaſt, to what a variety of good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes muſt it actuate us, and in how many caſes muſt it appear to be the offspring of virtue—the actions to which it incites are thoſe which all mankind admire.</p>
               <p>The diſpoſitions of men are generally inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſloth and indulgence—the faculties of the ſoul would be inactive and dormant, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful love of praiſe did not baniſh their ſlumbers, and point to an object which entices them in the purſuit of literature and uſeful knowledge.—The love of praiſe reforms our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and makes us ſtudious to pleaſe our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures. It has been the cauſe of many glorious actions, and has given a ſpring to many which bear the appearance of eminent virtue.</p>
               <p>The warrior, although he feels the animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glow of patriotiſm, yet there needs ſome other power to aſſiſt and ſupport his drooping

courage when under diſtreſſed circumſtances. The love of praiſe performs this uſeful part, ſhe takes the deſpairing hero by the hand, ſhe ſoothes his boſom by her melodious voice, ſhe whiſpers in his ear, the thankfulneſs, the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the exclamations of joy and the ſalutation of thoſe perſons whoſe lives and property he has defended and protected: all which await him at his return victorious from the bloody plain. She holds out to his view the wreaths of laurels which his country will entwine around his brows. Theſe reflections kindle in his boſom a new ardour. He is now not only animated by the inſtigations of duty, and the glow of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm, but alſo by the juſt wiſh to acquire the eſteem of his country, and win her praiſes and her gratitude. He again reſumes his waving helmet, and bids defiance to his foes.</p>
               <p>The great Germanicus, on the eve before a bloody battle, in ſilent reflection, wandered over the plain, where, freed from the fatigues of the day, his veteran army repoſed in their tents: the noiſe of the ſoldiery, the reſounding of arms, and the loud blaſts of martial muſic, were huſhed in ſilence. With a penſive melancholy,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028973_0076_0FDDC7E1C624B930"/>
he reflected on the great and dreadful ſcene which was ſhortly to enſue on the ſucceeding day, the fate of his country, and the many brave men who would ſhed their precious blood in their country's cauſe. His great ſoul was filled with certain ſenſations, characteriſtic of the great warrior, and of the feeling heart—while thus in ſolitude he indulged the feelings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, he thought he heard ſome voices diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing in one of the tents; he approached towards it ſlowly, and without noiſe, until he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> clearly diſtinguiſh the ſubject of their diſcourſe. But! who can deſcribe his ſensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the exquiſite glow of his heroic boſom, when he diſcovered it was himſelf—that it was the praiſes of Germanicus which employed the attention of his officers; inſtead of courting that reſt which the fatigues of the day required, they took more delight in ſpeaking the dictates of their admiring boſoms, and celebrating the glory of their beloved commander. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man chief pauſed, to indulge his feelings, which expanded with conſcious virtue: he heard not the fawning accents of flattery, but the voice of truth, of ſincerity, and of juſtly acquired
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028973_0077_0FDDC7A203AF5C00"/>
praiſe. He returned to his tent, filled with the moſt delightful ſenſations. The next day, the voice of praiſe ſtill vibrating in his ear, and inſpiring him with an elevation of ſoul above mortality, he led on his ſoldiers, eager for bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and fearful of no danger, when Germanicus was their chief—The warlike Armenius formed his German bands, and bid defiance to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power. The armies engaged; ſevere was the conflict; but victory at length crowned the Roman with a wreath of laurels. His former praiſes increaſed to adoration—his valiant army offered him the empire, but moderation bade him refuſe it.</p>
               <p>Thus far we have conſidered the Love of Praiſe as an incitement only to great and noble deeds. It is equally uſeful when we deſcend from its active influence on the mind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in a character who has already acquired it, and who is poſſeſſed of the good opinion and eſteem of his fellow creatures: In him mankind place their confidence; his influence is extenſive, and his fellow men will always exert themſelves to ſerve and oblige the man

whom they admire—and when old age creeps upon him, the regard which is manifeſted for him, the conſcious rectitude of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, illumine the ſmile of ſatisfaction on his once animated but now wrinkled countenance. Reflection caſts a ſoothing view on the time when his laudable exertions extorted from his countrymen the burſts of applauſe, and ſilent admiration. Devoid of this principle, as it has now been conſidered, man wants one of the paſſions which moſt diſtinguiſhes him from the brutes; without it, he would ſhun the face of his fellow man, and become a ſolitary wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the deſart. We have now, in its proper light, conſidered the Love of Praiſe; the happy effects which Moderation has upon the conduct, when man liſtens to her inſtructive voice, nor treſſpaſſes beyond her rules. Amiable as the Love of Praiſe appears, it may be carried to exceſs, whence injury will reſult. We ſhall now conſider, though but very briefly, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Love of Praiſe, when purſued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its proper limits. When a man devotes himſelf wholly to the acquirement of praiſe, he muſt bid adieu to all uſeful ſtudies, except ſuch
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028973_0079_0FDDC7A649566950"/>
as particularly anſwer his purpoſes—he muſt bid adieu to that liberty and independence of ſpirit, without which we can never be great. All virtuous men agree in admiring indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſpirit, which will follow the dictates of duty, againſt popular clamour. But he who will purſue the whims and courſes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic opinion to gain praiſe, will be deſpiſed—to throw aſide all ſenſe of right, and to act in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the wiſhes of party, betrays an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble ſoul, which is highly degrading. The Love of Praiſe, in this ſense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> overcomes all the tender and amiable feelings of the ſoul: the voice of conſcience is not heard in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of actions, which are conceived to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the purſuit of its favorite object:—Virtue, the true ſource of eſteem and reſpect, is baniſhed from its preſence, and vice and meanneſs are its boſom friends. The perſon actuated by this extravagant thirſt, will ſacrifice the ties of humanity, and all the tender feelings of the breaſt. The unruly Love of Praiſe defeats itſelf in its own deſigns; it is unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the motive which gives riſe to its many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, and when the world perceives a perſon
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028973_0080_0FDDC7E8409A4430"/>
anxious to acquire its praiſes, inſtead of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, it beſtows upon him contempt and reproaches: His great labours, his violent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to pleaſe, only afford mirth and amuſement.</p>
               <p>Izrael Smyly is extremely deſirous of acquiring praiſe; he is a man endowed with a moderate ſhare of underſtanding, and is <hi>diminitive</hi> in his looks and manners; but, poſſeſſed of human nature, he caſts a ſmiling eye of approbation upon himſelf, and thinks that he is important and conſequential to his fellow creatures. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of performing any great actions, and not poſſeſſed of discernment enough to know what a great action is, he has fallen upon a very accommodating plan, in his purſuit; it is compoſed of good nature, acquieſſence, and meanneſs. In converſation, he never ſuffers himſelf to contradict a perſon, but approves, and ſmilingly bows aſſent to all he ſays: if he was to aſſert that blue is yellow, his refinement of manners would not allow him to ſay, "that he preſumed he was miſtaken;" but he inclines his head, <hi>gliſtening with greaſe,</hi> and draws his ſmooth face into a ſmile, in token of his conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niality of ſentiment—He will bear inſult with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028973_0081_0FDDC7A74D380C68"/>
reſentment—nay! I believe a perſon of that race of men denominated the great, might ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo far as to pull the gentleman's noſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meeting with the leaſt retaliation. He ſeeks out and follows every method, in which he can oblige particular perſons, and will run to the other end of the town with the greateſt ſwiftneſs and ſatisfaction, to confer the leaſt benefit and favour.</p>
               <p>Thus does this poor animal pay all his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and worry himſelf almoſt to death, in the purſuit of an object which ſneers at him, and flies him with uncommon averſion. He gains, it muſt be granted, the thanks of perſons for carrying their <hi>portmanteaus,</hi> and particularly for becoming a ſervant without wages. The name of Mr. Smyly is ſpread abroad, but it is never pronounced unleſs it be to excite diverſion and laughter.</p>
               <p>At firſt view, mankind are led to admire actions which participate of bravery; but when reflection and reaſon are allowed their proper exerciſe, they will appear to be crimes which have diſgraced human nature, and ought never to be held up for admiration, but for deteſtation.</p>

Such, if we examine, and are not dazzled by glitter and ſhow, will appear to be the actions of an Alexander and others. Led on by a thirſt of fame, which nothing could quench, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued his hands in the blood of thouſands of his fellow men! their ſtreaming bodies covered over the plain! their piercing cries, the ruins of cities which he deſolated, could not touch his cruel ſoul!

               <p>This butcherer of mankind, after he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered moſt of the nations then in the known world, who had never in the leaſt inſtance of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him, ſat down and wept, that he had no more worlds to conquer.</p>

               <head>A true Account of the LIFE and WRITINGS of PEGASUS HELICON, THE POET OF THE GARRET, AS RELATED BY JULIUS TELLWELL.</head>
               <p>I WRITE to bring forward to public view a truly great man, one who has not met with that encouragement, and been treated with that reſpect which his dignity and eminent abilities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. But ah! he is not the only author who has met with miſfortunes. The mighty Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Otway, and Butler, were the children of poverty. If in tracing the life and writings of this ſon of the Muſe, though I write not with the pen of Pathos and elegance, but with the pen of commiſeration and truth, I ſhall excite in the breaſt of the public, the emotions of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028973_0086_0FDDC7AF142EE690"/>
and a conſciouſneſs of their former neglect, that by theſe they may become the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and encouragers of Pegaſus Helicon, my whole deſign will be anſwered. If my feeble pen is able to accompliſh this, my ſatisfaction and pleaſure will be greater than that which attended Virgil and Milton, after they had ſeen their poems crowned with wreaths of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels. They wrote one may ſay, to acquire lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary fame, I write to excite in the breaſt the moſt amiable ſenſations, and to be of aſſiſtance to the diſtreſſed. The ſubjects of their writings were moſtly fictitious. Pegaſus Helicon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands my pen, not as an imaginary but real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Shakeſpeare, who has been pronounced immortal, obtained his name by being an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal writer. Pegaſus Helicon is entirely an original writer, and what is more extraordinary, in a period of 178 years after Shakeſpeare, when many more diſcoveries had been made. The manner in which I came to be firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Mr. Helicon is this: As I was reading one day a ſmall production, on what ſubject I do not rightly remember, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome lines of poetry, which were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028973_0087_0FDDC7B28C5CBFC8"/>
to the Muſe, written in ſuch a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime manner, that they wonderfully excited my admiration—the two firſt lines I can only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect.—
<q>
                     <l>O come ye Muſes with a laurel crown,</l>
                     <l>Pour O Parnaſſus, pour your torrents down.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As I was extremely pleaſed, I was naturally led to enquire who the author of them was. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much trouble I found that his name was Pegaſus Helicon; that the author of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction in which they were printed, was ſo captivated by their charms, that he exhibited them to the public with high encomiums. I now knew the name of the man, but I had not yet ſeen him, my curioſity was now rather more excited than appeaſed. I long made a fruitleſs ſearch to diſcover a perſon to introduce me to him; at length, lucky chance threw in my way, that friend of his, who quoted his verſes; he very politely offered to introduce me to Mr. Helicon—On our way towards the Poet's lodging, my friend informed me of many of his peculiarities; one of which was, that he never ſhaved, but ſuffered his beard to take its natural growth.—We had now walked a conſiderable way, when
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028973_0088_0FDDC7EDDCAC39A8"/>
my friend at laſt ſtopped at a tall board houſe; he pointed to the top of the houſe, and deſired me to follow him. He led me through a winding ſtairs which brought us to the garret of the houſe, where I diſcovered a little room pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned off in the weſt corner, which he inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me was Mr. Helicon's ſtudy. He told me to approach without noiſe for fear we might diſturb his meditation; we advanced on tiptoe to the door, and was juſt lifting up the latch to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when we heard a voice within repeat aloud,
<q>
                     <l>Aſſiſt thy Helicon to ſing the times.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>My friend now opened the door, and addreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Helicon, introduced me to him: He beſtowed upon me a gracious ſmile, and friendly nod, with which I thought myſelf highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored. His beard was brown and thin; he had a long gown rapped round him, and the ſprig of ſome tree twined round his head: He was ſitting on a three legged ſtool, with a long pen in his hand, and ſome looſe papers lying before him; there were no chairs in the room, but a long bench, upon which he invited us to ſit down: He then threw aſide his pen, carefully put up
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028973_0089_0FDDC7B459A30CA0"/>
his papers, and, taking the wreath of leaves from his head, addreſſed it in theſe extemporary couplets,
<q>
                     <l>Lie there my wreath, I never thee will uſe,</l>

               </p>
               <p>We now converſed about the news of the day, in the courſe of which, I diſcovered that Mr. Helicon was a good Republican; but he ſaid he did not trouble himſelf much about things done abroad, being occupied by more important buſineſs in his room. I then took the liberty of aſking him, if his country called upon her ſons to fight her battles, if he would not then ſeize his muſquet, and ſeek the hoſtile plain? He ſmiled, took up his pen, which lay upon the table, and ſaid, Demoſthenes and Cicero, with their tongues, were ſaid to have done more good for their country, than ten thouſand men could have effected. They fought not themſelves, but inſpired the heroes with ſtrength, courage, and with enthuſiasm, in defence of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries—ſo will I with my pen.</p>
               <p>I now, having thrown off that embarraſſment commonly attendant on perſons when firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028973_0090_0FDDC7F1A24F8DD8"/>
to the company of great men, ventured to compliment him concerning his excellent poetry, ſome of which I mentioned I had ſeen, and to humbly beg the favor, that he would gratify me with the peruſal of one of his lateſt poems. With pleaſing ſmiles he returned my compliments, and with extreme politeneſs told me, that it was his wiſh to gratify all who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored him with their friendſhip. He then took up one of his papers which lay upon the table, and told me, that the laſt piece he had finiſhed was blotted and written very badly; he, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would even read it himſelf for us. We returned him our thanks in the warmeſt manner for his great condescension; he then placed his wreath upon his head, and read in plaintive voice as follows:</p>

dead, even cities contend for the honor of his birth: thus it was with the divine Homer; thus it will be with Pegaſus Helicon. In a few years hence, when I have ſought the ſilent tomb, and the melancholy yew tree hovers over my head, the name of Helicon will be reſounded throughout the world's wide theatre—But Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con will not return their juſt applauſe; unſtrung will be his muſe, unſtrung his gentle lyre. We lamented with him this ſtrange diſpoſition in the world, and enquired if he had no more pieces lately finiſhed. He ſaid he had long been thinking of writing a poem on the Times, and had begun it a little before we came in, but had not yet advanced farther than the ſecond line; the two lines were as follow:
<q>
                     <l>Ariſe, O Muſe, and in melodious rhimes,</l>
                     <l>Aſſiſt thy Helicon to ſing the Times.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We now changed the converſation, by aſking him why he ſuffered his beard to grow to ſuch a length? Why, gentlemen (ſays he) my reaſons are forcible, and founded on the firm baſis of propriety. A beard you will all allow to be a ſign of wiſdom; a poet then, the greateſt of
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028973_0093_0FDDC7B94DC3A6B0"/>
terreſtrial beings, ought to poſſeſs that which gives an idea of wiſdom. A beard adds a grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the face, ſtrikes an awe into the illiterate crowd, and commands from all veneration and reſpect. Secondly—A beard was beſtowed upon man by nature—ought man, therefore, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare war againſt nature, by clipping off his beard? Certainly not; it is a crime nearly allied to ſuicide. Providence ſays, that we have no right to diſpoſe of that life which he has beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us—Certainly then we have no right to diſpoſe of that beard which he has beſtowed upon us, and which is one of the greateſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of human nature, but ought to allow na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to take its courſe. Nothing is really beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, but what is natural, and as Providence has formed man with nothing but what is either uſeful or ornamental. The beard muſt belong to one of theſe claſſes. Therefore, to cut off the beard takes away part of the auguſt form of man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and depreciates his beauty. But the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant faſhion ſays the beard ſhall be cut, <hi>O tempora! O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Thirdly and laſtly, Horace ſays every poet ought to encourage a philosophic beard. Besides, all the great men of antiquity poſſeſſed
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028973_0094_0FDDC7F730FF26E0"/>
long beards, ſuch as Homer the prince of poets, and Socrates who was pronounced the wiſeſt of women. Women have got no beards, why do not women poſſeſs beards as well as men? Becauſe nature has implanted the greater wiſdom in man, and has placed the beard as a ſign of it. It is from theſe weighty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſiderations, gentlemen, that I ſuffer my beard to grow. Swayed by the poet's reaſoning, we now perfectly coincided with him in ſentiment, and lamented the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing cuſtom which obliged us to cut our beards. Animated by our applauſes, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded farther in his defence of beards, and told us he had written a poem on beards which he would do himſelf the pleaſure of reading to us. He then, from out of a little box which ſtood by him, took a paper and read as follows:
<q>
                     <l>I ſoftly ask of thee Erato to be heard,</l>

               <p>He thus proceeded to enumerate the many happy effects the poſſeſſor of a beard received, and concluded the whole with theſe two elegant lines,

               <p>We paid the tribute of applauſe to this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant poem, and proceeded to other converſation; we now took the liberty to aſk Mr. Helicon why he did not get married—he ſurveyed us with a ſmile, and exclaimed with great ſurpriſe, Married? Why, gentlemen, am not I a poet, to whom matrimony ought to be an entire ſtranger? a poet ought to have no wife but the Muſe; as well might you aſk a man why he does not kiſs the mouth of a ſerpent, as me.—Why don't you get married! Why, gentlemen, a woman in a little while would talk me into a conſumption, and a ſqualling brat would ſcare the Muſe away from my dwelling, ſo that ſhe never dare again enter it.—And laying aſide all this, the fatigues of the connubial ſtate would render me an unfit

                  </gap> to depart. I was ſo fortunate as to gain the good opinion of Mr. Helicon; he invited me to viſit him often, and to become the friend of a neglected poet. Honored by the friendſhip of ſo great a man, I ſought every opportunity in my power to enjoy his agreeable and improving converſation. One day when I was in his room long ſubſequent to this, and we were talking about poetry, which was always Mr. Helicon's favourite topic, I asked him what he thought of the poets of America—why (returned he) America has produced many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſons of the Muſes, of myſelf I ſhall decline ſpeaking. The four firſt poets, in my opinion, are Barlow, Trumbull, Freneau, and Dwight. I ſhall not, Sir, point out to you their beauties and defections, I only Sir, give you my opinion of them. Barlow's viſion of Columbus I eſteem one of the firſt productions of the age. Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull's M'Fingal is a ſpecies of poetry ſo wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from the viſion of Columbus, that they cannot be compared together. I think that he far ſurpaſſes Peter Pindar the great wit of Britannia. Freneau's productions are miſcellaneous, and diſcover a poet who
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028973_0097_0FDDC7BE92ACB748"/>
writes with the greateſt eaſe, his lines ſeem to flow without any labour. He ſeeks not for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors, nor to give a kind of obſcurity to his meaning, but he courts ſimplicity. Among his many pretty performances, I think his Britiſh Priſon Ship is one of the moſt happy. The lines with which he concludes it are theſe:
<q>
                     <l>The years approach which ſhall to ruin bring</l>
                     <l>Your lords, your chiefs, your miſcreant of a king,</l>
                     <l>Whoſe murd'rous acts ſhall ſtamp his name accurs'd,</l>
                     <l>And his laſt triumphs more than damn the firſt.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Dwight's Conqueſt of Canaan diſcovers a genius for poetry; in it are many beautiful, and ſome that I may call ſublime lines; but I think there are ſome lines which the poet did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand himſelf; at leaſt, I could not. He is very fond of making every thing that ſhines with luſtre to ape and mimic day, ſuch as ſwords, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and veſtments. But his Conqueſt of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, although a production of much merit, is not his moſt happy performance.</p>
               <p>He then proceeded to ſpeak of ſome other American poets, and I thought his obſervations on all were very juſt and pertinent. In the courſe of our converſation, at this time. I aſked
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028973_0098_0FDDC7F994F2DAA0"/>
Mr. Helicon how old he was? I am (answered he) about 45 years old, I was born in the year 1749, on the 14th day of May. You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by this, that nature never produces any thing remarkable without ſufficient ſigns and cauſes. The awful thunder does not ſend its threatening roar, the rains do not deſcend in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid floods, when the ſky is beautiful and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, but they are foretold by dark and gloom clouds, which obſcure the face of the heavens. Thus, you ſee that I was not a poet without ſufficient cauſes—Nature, to be ſure, formed me for a poet, but ſhe ſent alſo ſigns proclaiming me at my birth. I was born, you perceive, in the lovely ſmiling month of May when the waving lawns, the verdant vallies and the fragrant gardens, are clothed in their moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful dreſſes, and ſend forth their moſt exquiſite fragrance. It is in this month, when the poets are ſo much delighted and captivated by the charms of rural and retired life; it is now they ſeek the murmuring ſtreams and cooling ſhades, it is now that the ſofter paſſions pervade the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms of the ſhy and lovely maidens.—In this month, moſt favourable to poets, I was born.
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028973_0099_0FDDC7C05CD414C8"/>
One of the other ſigns which diſcovered in me the great poet, was the attachment and the great turn I had for poetry in my young and tender years. During the late war between Britain and America, as I was formed not for war like Virgil and Horace, I remained undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, cultivating the Muſe in a little village far from the din of arms, and the ſound of the martial trumpet. After the peace, I returned to New York, where I have ever ſince devoted myſelf to poeſy, that celeſtial, <hi>heavenly</hi> maid, and ever will, until I ſink within the arms of death. I now took my leave of the poet for this time—I had not returned, and remained but a few hours at home, before a boy came to my houſe, and delivered a note directed to me; I opened it and read as follows:
<q>
                     <l>Surrounded by the iron fang of woe,</l>
                     <l>On thee my friend my anguiſh'd feelings flow.</l>
                     <l>Pegasus' bosom heaves the rattling ſigh,</l>
                     <l>And ſoftly wiſhes that my friend was by,</l>
                     <l>That he could liſten to my ſtreaming grief,</l>
                     <l>And ſquirt within my ſoul ſome kind relief.</l>

               <p>By this note I concluded that ſomething had happened to my friend Helicon; I therefore directed my ſteps towards his dwelling as faſt as my limbs could carry me. When I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there, the firſt objects that ſtruck my eyes, were the poet with his wreath of leaves on his head, ſtanding between two conſtables who <hi>had him</hi> ſeized by the collar. As ſoon as Mr. Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con ſaw me, he began to apologize for his note, and begged that I would make allowances for it, as he was obliged to write and ſend it by the boy in the ſpace of two or three minutes, as theſe barbarians would not allow him more time: that he diſcovered an error in it, and a very material one; it was, that he had put <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng</hi> inſtead of <hi>fangs.</hi>—The conſtables then interrupted him, by telling me, that they had orders to come and take the gentleman and conduct him to goal for debt; that he long owed the landlord of the houſe for boarding and lodging, which
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028973_0101_0FDDC832D675B9B0"/>
he would not pay. I then informed them that I would ſtand his bail and become anſwerable for all the debts he had incurred. The conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles then, with apologies, took their departure. Mr. Helicon, with boſom overflowing with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, poured forth his thanks for my kindneſs in animated and elegant language.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the only ſketches of the life and manners of Pegaſus Helicon I have been able to draw together, that I might place before the public the great and aſtoniſhing man they have long neglected. I have declined bringing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward many of his works, as he ſoon intends to publiſh them, but the few which are here exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited bear wonderful marks of genius. I have now finiſhed my melancholy tale.—Do, O thou propitious genius which hovers over the heads of the virtuous, ſmile upon my feeble efforts, and bleſs the poet, whoſe noble principles and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the ſubjects of my pen.</p>

               <head>ON POETRY.</head>
               <p>FROM the plain language of inſtruction, the imagination of man has riſen to the lively and flowing muſic of poetry.</p>
               <p>Poetry, among the polite arts, holds a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed rank; it is the language of paſſion and fancy: At what time it was invented we know not, the Greeks beſtowed the honour of it upon Orpheus an ancient bard of theirs. Almoſt every man of genius, if he was to turn his attention towards poetry might become a poet, but yet as in oratory many of the principal ingredients which conſtitute a poet, ought to be inherent: It is ſaid concerning Cowley and ſome others of the principal poets, that they were born in rhimes, which evínces, that a natural genius towards this particular art was inherent in them. When we ſeek only ſolid inſtruction, we refer to the philoſophical writer, whoſe ſentiments are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in the moſt plain and ſimple manner of proſe, where there is no flowers and delightful ſcenes, but the worn and rugged paths of ſcience. But when we ſeek principally amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028973_0107_0FDDC838C2A2B690"/>
blended with inſtruction, we explore the beautiful walks of the muſes, where the ſenſes are more captivating, and where nature promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly riſes to our view. Beſides amuſement, improvement is a principal deſign of poetry, and indeed when properly conveyed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is more attractive to the memory of man, as it more fixes his attention, and captivates his imagination. It harmonizes the ſoul, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates it more than ſentiments produced in any other manner. The breaſt of ſenſibility is touched by its penſive ſtrain, and drops the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tear of compaſſion, for virtue in diſtreſs; the pathetic, therefore, when executed in this manner is generally ſucceſsful. Its muſical and winning accents ſteal upon the heart, and lull it into meditation. Poetry has an effect in heightening the ſenſibility.—To the poet the garden of nature appears with double charms; none reliſh like him beautiful and grand proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and receive them with an equal impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: from them none are equally ſoothed with him by the ſoft and trembling ſtrains of poetry. While ſome flee from the unſocial aſpect of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the poet delights in her lonely and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028973_0108_0FDDC7FE4F9B8B60"/>
ſeats; he courts her as the parent of reflection, and aſſiſtant to his ſtrains, reclined beneath her cooling ſhade, where nought can diſturb his meditation: he liſtens to the muſic of the grove, and the diſtant fall of ſome running ſtream.—It is there he receives the inſpiration of the Muſe; in ſuch retired places, ſhe chuſes her abode.</p>
               <p>More agreeable to the view of the poet is the tall tree, and the rugged mountain top, than the populous cities, lofty ſpires, and the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved architecture:—more pleaſing the rude hand of Nature, than the poliſhed hand of art:—ſweeter to him is the wild note of the tuneful bird, than the organs artificial ſound. That the love of rural retreats has poſſeſſed the breaſt of almoſt every poet, is a truth no one will doubt. It was this that made Pope delight in his ſeat at Twickenham, whence flowed a ſtream as ſmooth and majeſtic as his ſong. It was this that led Shenſtone to form the Leaſowes, where he might call the moſt beautiful flowers to deck his penſive Paſtorals.</p>
               <p>But, beſides theſe, which are happy effects of poetry upon the mind, it is charged with often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028973_0109_0FDDC83A4B425300"/>
raiſing our natural ſenſibility to ſuch a pitch as to make life almoſt a burden to us: the mind ruffled and uneaſy by the buſtle and tumult of the world, and creative of imaginary trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. This, no doubt, may be ſometimes the caſe; we may find ſome unhappy examples of it, but we ſhall alſo diſcover that theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were entire votaries of the Muſe, and confined themſelves almoſt wholly to the elegiac ſtile, the effect of which on the mind, in this reſpect, is greater than that of any other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of poetry.—We muſt obſerve a very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difference between the writer and the reader, for it is impoſſible that an author can tranſmit to the reader, the emotion which he himſelf realized, in writing ſome melancholy ſtrain. Poetry, as an accompliſhment, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful in the female ſex: it diſcovers their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of mind, their delicacy of thought, and livelineſs of expreſſion. It would occupy ſome of their moſt agreeable hours, and afford amuſement for their friends. It muſt alſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them more admired by the other ſex, as it adds another charm to the number they poſſeſs, their muſical notes as coming from one of their
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028973_0110_0FDDC803656EBF98"/>
ſex, would captivate their attention and find the way to the heart.</p>
               <p>The female ſenſibility being naturally more defined than the male, they ought for the reaſon juſt mentioned, to ſhun the gloomy Melpomene and ſeek the gay, the lively, and deſcriptive muſe; they ought to make their ſtrains correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with themſelves, in diffuſing joy and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs around them.</p>

               <head>ON DESCRIPTIVE POETRY.</head>
               <p>AMONG the diviſions under which poetry is arranged, there is none which appears to me more amuſing and inſtructive than the deſcriptive.—It draws all its ſcenes and reflections from nature; writings of all kinds which deſcribe Nature, work more than others upon the imagination, and fix the attention; and indeed, there is no kind of poetry more worthy the attention of the poet, than the deſcriptive.—He here has a wide field for the full exerciſe of his muſe, the country with all her charms is open to his view. The painter with his pencil preſents us with ſome beautiful

proſpect, but the poet ſpeaks to us in a ſtill more moving and more pleaſing, by deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He points to us the variegated landſcape and all the beauties of nature, he carries us over the verdant vallies, to the refreſhing coolneſs of a ſpreading grove, and leads us by the ſide of murmuring ſtreams; like a friend and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he converſes with us, and from the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, draws pleaſing and improving reflections. The reader almoſt fancies himſelf in the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which the poet repreſents, and his breaſt is lulled into the penſive meditation, which the ſurvey of a beautiful landſcape really beſtows. Thompſon among the deſcriptive poets holds a diſtinguiſhed rank; no author could ever have choſen a more beautiful and pleaſing ſubject than the Seaſons, and no author, I make bold to ſay, within the ſame compaſs, could have done the ſubject more juſtice; he abounds with the beautiful and pathetic, and carries us through all the delightful ſcenes in nature; that perſon who can read this author without being greatly entertained, I ſhould doubt his taſte and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. Who is not touched with his elegance of expreſſion and delicacy of ſentiment, when he preſents his Muſidora to our view, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

               <p>If we attend to ſome of the principal poets, we will diſcover that it is from productions of the deſcriptive kind, that they have derived the moſt fame. Some of Milton's moſt admired ſentences are deſcriptive of nature, his L'Allegro and Il Penſeroſo are both of the deſcriptive claſs. Thompſon, although he has written many other excellent poems, and one of the beſt tragedies in the Engliſh language, obtains almoſt all his fame from his Seaſons.

I might ſtill more enforce my aſſertion by the names of many other diſtinguiſhed poets, and might particularly bring forward the elegant author of the Deſerted Village. But I truſt I have produced ſufficient examples. Enraptured by the ſtrains of nature, the youthful poet gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally firſt exerciſes his wild and incorrect muſe in the field of deſcription. The delightful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the country, the ſimplicity of a ſhepherd's life, allure his wandering imagination. He is fond of deſcribing morning and evening walks, the appearance of the fields at the ſetting of the ſun; the murmuring and wandering ſtreams; the muſic of the feathered throng, and the ſoft whiſpering of the ſpreading grove. In a juvenile poem we can always diſcover what the accurate Pope aſſerts—
<q>

               <head>ON ELEGIAC POETRY.</head>
               <p>ALL perſons poſſeſſed of refined taſtes are ſuſceptible of the charms of poetry. Some men have indeed affected to deſpiſe it; but perhaps the fable of the fox and the grapes may be in ſome meaſure applicable to them. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are numerous, that men who have ſhone as ſtateſmen and eminent literary characters, have not had certain qualifications inherent in them, neceſſary to the attainment of this ſublime art. Perhaps there is no ſpecies of poetry of which the mind is more ſuſceptible than elegy. There is none perhaps which meets with more agreeable reception from all claſſes of men. Its objects are to excite the ſofter paſſions, to repreſent to us the diſtreſs of virtue, and the many misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to which human nature is liable. Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with its principle deſign to infuſe into us pity and ſorrow, it conveys ſentiments which experience partly dictates, and which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and ſtriking. In many inſtances, elegy is calculated to excite a rougher feeling than ſympathy, and to kindle in the mind indignation againſt ſome unfeeling wretch, who is introduced
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028973_0118_0FDDC80B12637948"/>
in the poem as a perpetrator of the moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cruelties. When elegy cauſes theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, it muſt operate in forming the mind to virtue, and in cultivating the amiable and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feelings.</p>
               <p>To anſwer theſe purpoſes elegy has choſen a ſtrain remarkably ſweet, ſmooth, and penſive to the ear, the very ſound is the plaintive voice of ſorrow—
<q>
                     <l>The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,</l>
                     <l>The lowing herd winds ſlowly o'er the lea;</l>
                     <l>The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,</l>
                     <l>And leaves the world to darkneſs and to me.</l>
                  </q>

               <p>Shenſtone's genius led him to delight in Elegy; in this ſpecies of poetry he particularly excels; poſſeſſed of ſenſibility diſagreeably refined, he exquiſitely felt what he wrote, and he tranſmits to the reader, in ſome degree, the ſame impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He is remarkable, in many verſes, for his beautiful ſimplicity. In his Elegy, on the

               <p>The celebrated Gray has obtained more fame in the literary world, by the production of one Elegy, than by all his other works, although a celebrated critic has pronounced his Odes to be the moſt elegant poetry of that particular ſpecies in the Engliſh language—A ſtriking proof of the agreeable impreſſion which Elegy makes upon the mind of the generality of men. The name of Gray will never be forgotten, as the author of the Elegy in a Country Church Yard—It was the death of an old and intimate friend which impreſſed upon the mind of Gray a gloom and melancholy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Theſe four whom I have mentioned are eminent examples of it.

In no place do I as much feel the pathos of his pen, as where he breaks out into the ſorrowful muſic of elegy. The following three verſes, deſcribing the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſoldier, I ſhall only extract from him—

               <p>LEANDER is an old gentleman poſſeſſed of a large eſtate; Mira is his only child of whom he is paſſionately fond; Henry a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great beauty and amiable diſpoſition, falls in love with Mira; ſhe returns his paſſion with equal ardour; her father Leander diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers their fondneſs for each other, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of it; he forbids Henry the houſe, and to

think more of his daughter. The old father, when he ſees the effect which Henry's abſence has upon his daughter, repents of his conduct but too late. Mira dies; Leander is ſeized with the greateſt affliction; his memory recalls to his view his former cruelty. He is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented reclining beneath an aged oak, which grew upon the bank of the Hudſon, and retrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſorrows.</p>

               <head>ON HISTORY. THE PROPER STUDY OF MANKIND IS MAN—Pope.</head>
               <p>THERE is no ſubject more intereſting to mankind, and from which they receive greater improvement and pleaſure, than from a ſurvey of the tranſactions which have happened in the world—Inquiries after the events which have taken place among our predeceſſors and fore-fathers, are natural to the human mind. They ſeem to be connected with us and relative to our own ſtate. The miſeries which have befell great and good men, although upwards of one thouſand years ago, excite in our breaſts the tender emotion of diſtreſs, and we rejoice when Fortune ſmiles propitious on their laudable exertions. Our boſoms glow with hatred and diſguſt towards thoſe tyrants, who have inflicted the moſt ſhocking cruelties on their unhappy ſubjects. We feel our indignation rouſed for the ingratitude which cities have ſhewn towards their Generals, who have led their armies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and victory; and we ſhed the tears of ſorrow over the ruins of a once populous city,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:028973_0155_0FDDC875DA4B9528"/>
which war has levelled to the ground. It is a cauſe of joy that the moſt uſeful ſtudy is at the ſame time the moſt entertaining; that hiſtory, when it delights us greatly increaſes our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. When we are peruſing a book of the dryeſt and moſt abſtruſe kind, if the thought oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs that we are enlarging our mental faculties, we receive pleaſure; but it is an enjoyment of a much higher kind than this, which is derived from hiſtory. When viewing its engaging pages, we want not the reflection of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to keep awake our attention; for keep this away entirely, the animating language of hiſtory, the curious events and the delightful ſcenes with which it abounds, will ſtill capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the mind. Human nature is preſented to our view. Every perſon is concerned in the events which happen to each other. If a friend relate to us ſome remarkable occurrences which have happened in the world, or the manners of a diſtant country; pleaſure glows upon our countenances, we feel intereſted and lend the attentive ear. Of a nature ſimilar to this is the pleaſure which we receive from hiſtory. The tranſactions, the manners, and the lives of
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028973_0156_0FDDC8B860AA78F8"/>
a people, and of individuals, are there related in the elegant language of the hiſtorian. The impreſſions which hiſtory makes upon the minds of thoſe perſons, ſuſceptible to the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and finer feelings, tend to refine the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to promote the cauſe of virtue. When we admire exalted and noble ſentiments in perſons, and ſee their excellence, we feel a deſire to poſſeſs them, and our boſoms expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the ſenſations of emulation and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
               <p>The many objects which hiſtory holds up for our imitation, is one of its principal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. When the life of an amiable man is preſented to us, we feel deeply intereſted in his welfare, our feelings flow congenial, and receive impreſſions correſponding to the various circumſtances and afflictions through which he paſſes.

virtuous Scipio placed Cyrus as a model; as a warrior, as a ſtateſman, and as a man, and in all theſe he equalled, if not excelled him. It was by holding to his view that Prince's virtue, that he in the bloom of youth performed that act of continence for which he has been greatly celebrated. Does the boſom of the ſoldier pant to emulate heroic virtue? Does he wiſh to perform valorous actions in his country's cauſe? Let him turn over the pages of the Grecian and Roman hiſtory—There the deeds of warriors will ſwell his military breaſt, and command wonder and admiration—the deeds of patriots, whoſe thundering arms enthuſiaſm nerved in their country's defence. In ſilent aſtoniſhment, he will pauſe at the names of a Themiſtocles, Leonidas, and Epaminondas; a Camillus, Cincinnatus, Regulus, and Brutus. Does the more peaceful patriot delight to ſerve his country in the Cabinet? Let him view the Grecian and Roman ſtateſman when the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments were in their primitive ſituations.</p>
               <p>Does the youthful breaſt glow with a deſire to poſſeſs the ſwaying powers of oratory; to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as an eloquent champion in his country's

intereſts? As an incitement let him behold the orator of Greece, whoſe voice like lightning fired the boſoms of the Athenians with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible ardour in their country's cauſe; and the Roman orator, whoſe more ſoft and melodious accents, almoſt imperceptible ſtole upon the mind, and ſwayed the gentle and milder paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Let him imitate theſe, if a Philip leads on his troops to deſtroy the freedom of his country; and if a Cataline lifts his traiterous head.</p>
               <p>As the mind is naturally led to imitate an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which it admires, conſequently it will be naturally led to avoid one which it deteſts.

knowledge is increaſed, when we trace the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent forms of government, their peculiar maxims and laws, the duties of the various exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive powers; the privileges and manners of the people; the manner in which governments took their riſe, and the degeneracy and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular evils which occaſioned their downfal. By ſeeing theſe, we can reap inſtruction, and guard againſt the evils which ariſe in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. From the hiſtories of all nations we obtain this precept, that governments eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, though on the moſt wiſe and Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can principles, generally degenerate into ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. The art to render ourſelves agreeable to our fellow-creatures in ſocial intercourſe, to beſtow upon them ſatisfaction and pleaſure, and to excite in their minds an eſteem and regard for us, which is neceſſary in ſociety, is one of the moſt pleaſing and deſirable qualifications we
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:028973_0160_0FDDC8BE5B5B72D0"/>
can obtain. The variety of events and of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in hiſtory, will always furniſh us with ſome examples illuſtrative of the ſentiment we have advanced; which will not only pleaſe our company, but enforce the aſſertion. The cauſe that renders a traveller pleaſing and eſteemed in converſation, ariſes not from his ſuperior un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but from the great number of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and entertaining incidents, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in his memory and introduces in ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and applicable opportunities. The reader of hiſtory obtains his knowledge at a much easier and cheaper rate than the traveller; he experiences not the many inconveniencies to which the other is liable; the veſſel bears him not, on the ruffled boſom of the ocean to ſome diſtant country, far from his relations and friends. The many evils to which men are ſubjected to in this world for want of foreſight; the guile and deceit of mankind render the knowledge of human nature of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; without it the ſmiles of the deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing villain would be named ſincerity, and the maſk of hypocriſy, friendſhip and love. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the evils ariſing from a want of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

of human nature, being a great incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our exertions in the purſuit of it: it is a ſtudy exceedingly curious and pleaſing—It makes us acquainted with ourſelves from which alone we can form an idea conſiderably accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of the human mind at large. What is more delightful to the intelligent and enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind, than to contemplate on the various paſſions which have actuated the ſoul; the great lengths which certain impulſes have hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried human beings beyond the limits of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and reaſon.</p>
               <p>What more aſtoniſhing? than the ſublime works of the Deity, who made and created all things, and by whoſe power they ſtill retain their various movements and exiſtence. The means to obtain an object of ſo much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as the knowledge of human nature, muſt be held by every perſon in the greateſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation. There are only two ways, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and hiſtory. The one of which is cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with thorns and briers and painful to the lacerated traveller; but the other a delightful path ornamented with verdure and flowers, where the cooling ſhadow of the ſurrounding

trees protect us from the parching heat of the ſun.</p>
               <p>In hiſtory the many ſchemes which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to decoy perſons, the characteriſtics of a deſigning villain, the fawning and friendly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor of the flatterer, teach us to be aware, and to keep an eye of ſuſpicion upon many perſons. Without the aſſiſtance of hiſtory, the young ſtudent, juſt proceeding from his ſtudy into the deceitful world, would fall into many ſnares and evils: for the diſpoſition and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of human nature are not ſo widely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that the deſigns and arts which were prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the Greek and Roman nations are no ſimilar with thoſe in the preſent age. I ſhall not now proceed farther to relate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> many and great advantages derived from hiſtory. I have endeavoured to give a brief ſketch of ſome of the principal ones. Conſidering the pleaſure and great importance of this branch of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is ſurpriſing that there are in many youth entirely unacquainted with it.</p>
               <p>When the names of ancient heroes and ſtateſmen are mentioned in their hearing, they are at a loſs and make an aukward appearance.
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:028973_0163_0FDDC88011278A60"/>
The ignorance of hiſtory in ſome youth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from their want of reading, but from the manner in which they read. When they take up a hiſtory, they attend wholly to the amuſement which it affords them, and not to the improvement. Hence they ſkim it over ſo quick and ſuperficially, that in a ſhort time it becomes entirely eraſed from their minds. The advice which authors have recommended to us when reading hiſtory, is, to pay a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular attention, to reflect for a conſiderable time on ſome ſcene which has raiſed our feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for without this, when we proceed to other events we cannot receive a deep and laſting impreſſion from it.</p>
               <p>The author which I much admire for his ſimplicity of ſtile, and all the other qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a hiſtorian, is Rollin. By reading his volumes alone we can acquire a comprehenſive knowledge of ancient hiſtory. In no part of his volumes have I ever ſound him languid and unentertaining; after having deſcribed ſome things that are ſtriking, he often draws from them pleaſing and improving reflections. Plutarch's Lives, although they come under
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028973_0164_0FDDC8C3544C4A00"/>
the title of biography, I may here very proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommend as part of the hiſtory of the country in which they lived, are involved in the lives of his auguſt characters. Gillies and Goldſmith's hiſtories of Greece are both very improving, but Gillies gives a more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive view of manners, cuſtoms and liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature. Gibbon is a ſplendid hiſtorian, and often decoys the mind more to the ſtile than the ſubſtance. Hume excells in the hiſtory of England—Robertſon, who has lately paid the debt of Nature, in my opinion, is one of the moſt elegant hiſtorians in the Engliſh language; his Charles the fifth and hiſtory of America are the beſt arguments I can offer.</p>
               <p>The introduction to Univerſal Hiſtory writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the learned and celebrated orator Boſſuet, ought to be the favorite companion of every youth. In a very ſmall compaſs he gives a general idea of all the principal events which have paſſed in the world. He accurately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes the periods and ſituation of occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, which preſents his readers when peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing extenſive hiſtories, from falling into certain errors, from confuſion, and from placing events
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:028973_0165_0FDDC8841BF40568"/>
in their improper places. Voltaire has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed much praiſe upon this performance, than which none has ever obtained greater; he ſays—"The Univerſal Hiſtory of Mr. Boſſuet is a work that will tranſmit the author to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality."</p>
               <p>A late author has written the hiſtory of Rome, France, and Spain. The hiſtory of France, of theſe, I have only read, it appears to me to bear the marks of a maſterly hand; I would recommend it with his other two performances to the attention of my fellow youth.</p>
               <p>I have not recommended all theſe authors from my own weak judgment only, but from the approbation of many diſtinguiſhed characters in literature.</p>

of the war, he returned home with his hoary head encircled with the wreaths of laurel which his valor had won, to enjoy domeſtic happineſs in the boſom of his family; he brought with him a gentleman of the name of Mr. Tollard, who had long with him ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the dangers of war, and whoſe breaſts were united together by the indiſſoluble ties of friendſhip. When Mr. Armenius arrived at home, how great was his ſurpriſe and emotion to find that a beloved wife was ſnatched from him by the arms of death—the ſtroke he deeply felt; he now, in the contemplation of Elvira, an only daughter, derived his greateſt happineſs.</p>
               <p>Sarina, the beautiful ſeat of Colonel Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, was ſituated on a riſing eminence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath which flowed a ſpacious water: nature and art both combined to render it truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. Here the romantic mind could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge its imaginary pleaſures; it might retire with its roving fancy to ſome ſequeſtered ſpot, where nought is found to diſturb its medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Here the ſpreading tree afforded a cool retreat, covered with thick and verdant foliage; the murmur of the running ſtream excited to

He was ſenſible, mild, open and generous; his perſon much reſembled Armenius's, but his face did not ſo much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize the ſoldier, being more mild and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid: he was of a noble and reſpectable family, the poſſeſſor of a large fortune, and had no near relation living except a ſiſter, who ſoon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpend ſome time at Sarina, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the companion of Elvira. The gay Adeline (which was her name) had hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided at London, with an old aunt: ſhe had often viſited Elvira at Sarina, and was a lively, handſome girl, nearly of the ſame age with El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira.
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:028973_0180_0FDDC8D29A7FB4E8"/>
The return of Mr. Armenius had now ſpread abroad, and many came to pay their congratulations: among the number was a Mr. Harmer, a diſtant relation of the Colonel's, who introduced to him an only ſon whom he had brought with him. This young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who claims a ſhare in our tale, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for external beauty: he was about nineteen years of age, tall, and beautifully ſhaped: his face correſponded with his perſon; his fine blue eye ſparkled vivacity and enticed the beholder; but alas! why have we to ſay, that his beauty, like that of a Paris, covered a deceitful, cruel, and treacherous heart? he was diſſipated and debauched. This adds ſtrength to an obſervation made by experience, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable beauty is ſeldom accompanied with virtue. The top is lifted from the poliſhed and plated coffin, and lo! a loathſome corpſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. He concealed the blackneſs of his heart from his friends by diſſimulation; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had been detected in many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and villainous acts, yet his beauty, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an engaging addreſs, made him the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of admiration. Let the obſervation
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028973_0181_0FDDC899950A5A40"/>
made concerning beauty, not tend to injure, in any degree, the character of our heroine, who, I have before ſaid, was remarkable for beauty, for there are exceptions from every general rule; and not only this, but I make diſtinctions between beauties; and that which Elvira poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed experience could draw no ſuch remark from. Elvira's did not ſo much conſiſt in the beauty and ſymmetry of the features, as in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain divine expreſſion which animated her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene countenance. A Cleopatra's beauty is the rich and beautiful tulip, which erects its orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented head, and excites the admiration of every beholder, far and near. Elvira's, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt bluſhing roſe, whoſe beauties the near ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, and one acquainted with its excellence only perceives. Such was young Charles Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, a dangerous viſitor at Sarina, eſpecially when an enchanting creature like Elvira dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there, who knew no guile and no deceit. When this young gentleman was introduced by the Colonel to his daughter, no wonder that the ſalutation of ſuch a perſon ſhould tinge her face with a bluſh, and that ſuch a perſon ſhould prepoſſeſs her in his favour. This prepoſſeſſion
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:028973_0182_0FDD5F9ADC6C2750"/>
was augmented when ſhe liſtened to his lively converſation, and when ſhe obſerved that he now paid to her the moſt of his attention. He addreſſed her with mild and gentle accents; congratulated her on the arrival of her father, and mourned with her the loſs of a mother. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira returned ſuitable and modeſt anſwers, and ſurprized him with an underſtanding equal to her beauty. The hours had paſſed unperceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Sarina's inhabitants, engaged in ſweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe; and evening was drawing a veil over the face of the ſun, when young Charles propoſed a walk, which was accepted by Elvira. When they were retiring the Colonel caſt a pleaſing ſmile on his lovely daughter, which Elvira returned while the roſe ſuffuſed itſelf over her face.</p>
               <p>They now directed their ſteps towards the water's ſide; and while they enjoyed each others converſation, the calmneſs and beauty of the ſcene contributed to augment their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Young Harmer, in the language of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration expreſſed the beauty of the evening, and of the place. Says he, the evening is the emblem of calmneſs and ſerenity; all that in the
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028973_0183_0FDDC89D6F5B8130"/>
day contributed to diſturb meditation, is huſhed in quietneſs and repoſe. It is now that gloomy ſorrow leaves her diſcontented manſion, and walks abroad to ſurvey the beauties of Nature, the temporary ſoother of her woes. He then, in expreſſing the beauty of the place, obſerved, that it was only ſuitable for ſuch inhabitants, and ſufficient to ſooth the Colonel's former ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. The city was the ſeat of Elvira's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, and ſhe was informed in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. When ſhe enquired concerning the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, O! ſays he, they are indeed truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful; there is no ſuch ſociability and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in any place: and what a delightful and uſeful accompliſhment dancing is! it baniſhes all gloomy ideas from the mind, and gives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and ſprightlineſs to the body. Elvira on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replied, that ſhe was glad to ſee ſo powerful an advocate eſpouſe the cauſe of an amuſement ſhe was very fond of. He then told her that the laſt aſſembly he viſited, he was very much ſtruck with the beauty of a young lady, whoſe hand he had the favour of to walk a minuet; and that when on the floor her beauty attracted the attention of the whole company, and much,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:028973_0184_0FDDC8D9D7C5C8F0"/>
that of his own: that when he had handed her to a ſeat he was greatly entertained with her agreeable and lively converſation. She aſked him if he had any acquaintance with Miſs El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira Armenius; and when he anſwered in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, ſhe related a great many pretty things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her. Upon enquiry, he found her to be a Miſs Adeline Tollard, the expected heireſs of a great fortune. Elvira, pleaſed with this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, returned, that Miſs Adeline was her inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friend, and that ſhe could not ſufficiently thank her for propagating reports concerning her ſuppoſed excellence; but that ſhe would not attempt her excellencies, as they were too well eſtabliſhed, and needed no eulogium. The inſinuating Harmer, ſmiling, ſaid, that Miſs Adeline, among her many virtues, muſt have mingled confidence and ſelf-conceit to attempt Miſs Elvira's; but that friendſhip had engaged her in the cauſe, although unequal to the arduous taſk. Elvira, bluſhing, told him to remember that friendſhip never puts vice in the ſcales to preponderate with virtue, and is therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to draw any true or juſt character.</p>
               <p>They now approached a little hill which gradually aroſe from the water, whoſe verdant
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028973_0185_0FDDC89ED8688900"/>
top ſeemed to invite an agreeable ſeat. When they had aſcended it, what was Harmer's ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, when he obſerved the beauty and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the graſs, the ſpreading foilage of the trees which ſurrounded it, and the different flowers exhaling the moſt agreeable odour.—The common hill was ſuddenly and unexpectedly changed into an Helicon or Parnaſſus. Surely (cries he) nature never, entirely of herſelf, formed this delightful ſpot, but art muſt alſo have lent her aſſiſtance.—Elvira, ſmiling, told him, that it was a ſelected place of her's, ſacred to reflection and contemplation; that ſhe often in the evening reſorted hither, to pay her vow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to thoſe venerable gods. Here (ſays ſhe) I have often paſſed many an agreeable hour with my dear Adeline, whoſe company made every thing aſſume a new charm. Then friendſhip directed our diſcourſes, and we never thought or dreamt of ſorrow. Sometimes Adeline would here tune her lute, and the echo would reſound to the charming melody. O then the evening ſeemed too much in haſte to interrupt our joys—
<q>
                     <l>"Friendſhip! myſterious cement of the ſoul!</l>
                     <l>Sweetner of life! and ſolder of ſociety!</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="180" facs="unknown:028973_0186_0FDDC8DD1CBB7418"/>
I owe thee much. Thou haſt deſerved from me</l>
                     <l>Far, far beyond what I can ever pray,</l>
                     <l>Oft have I prov'd the labours of thy love,</l>
                     <l>And the warm efforts of the gentle heart</l>
                     <l>Anxious to pleaſe.—</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here alſo, I have often ſent invocations to the muſes, but alas! without effect. O! cries Harmer, could the muſe ever reject ſuch a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or refuſe a viſit to ſuch a place? No, ſays Elvira; ſhe diſdains not the place; but it is the humble and obſcure mind; for ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the enlightened and intelligent even in a wretched garret. Let it then be my duty, when females, like Caliſta, ſing in gentle lays, to liſten and improve, until I catch the note. Harmer replied; this, Miſs Elvira, is only the report of an individual, whom modeſty hinders from ſpeaking the contrary; but where is a ſecond to confirm it? I am certain none can be found, and therefore you muſt pardon me if I ſtand unconvinced.</p>
               <p>They deſcended the hill and approached the houſe, as the ſhades of evening were quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining.—When Elvira retired to her chamber, and was left alone to her meditation, the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:028973_0187_0FDDC8A2DAB324E0"/>
Harmer employed the moſt of her thoughts: they repreſented him as beautiful and agreeable, and a youth of almoſt every perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as polite, but eſpecially ſo to herſelf. In ſhort, ſhe felt ſomething which ſhe could not expreſs, and which her youthful mind had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt before: what this was, experience beſt can tell, and inexperience ſhuns the dangerous taſk.—Elvira no leſs commanded the attention of young Harmer: ſhe inſpired him with more reverence and honourable intentions than any female he had ſeen: ſhe impreſſed on his mind a great idea of her underſtanding and beauty, and made him conſider her as a prize well worth obtaining, and that too much pains could not be taken in anſwering this end. As he was to return home with his father next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was already planning the time of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Theſe were their pleaſing meditations, until ſleep diſperſed conſcious ideas, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented illuſive ones; until the anticipating and reflecting mind ſunk in repoſe: for pleaſure cannot, like ſorrow, entirely baniſh her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="unknown:028973_0188_0FDDC8DE9E7028F8"/>
The next morning after breakfaſt the horſes were prepared for their departure. At ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king leave, the Colonel preſſed them often to viſit their friends at Sarina. Young Harmer, following the example of his father, approached Elvira, and imprinted a kiſs on her cherry lips; ſhe bluſhing wiſhed them a pleaſant journey: they then mounted their horſes and rode off. Elvira purſued them with her eyes until out of ſight, and then retired into the houſe, ſecretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretting the departure of young Harmer: but ſhort was her regret, for Harmer ſoon return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and continued frequently his viſits at Sari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na: he became the open ſuitor of Elvira, and affection imperceptibly ſtole on her heart, while ignorant of the real character of her treacherous lover.</p>
               <p>When guarded by the moſt accurate hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, how could an unſuſpicious female penetrate into the real character of a lover, eſpecially when that hypocriſy is connected with beauty, and manners the moſt refined and engaging? But yet often truth prevails and ſhews the dangerous haunts of vice, and gives the virtuous mind a chance to flee from this dangerous companion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="unknown:028973_0189_0FDD5F9C47091620"/>
But to return—the months had now flown away in ſpeedy ſucceſſion on the wings of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and Adeline Tollard had not arrived ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to expectation; the warm breaſt of friendſhip muſt therefore feel anxious, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily enquire the cauſe—Elvira therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a letter enquiring this, and informing her, that ſhe now mourned for her long abſent friend, and that, expecting her, ſhe had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their little ſeat, which would ſend forth its bloſſoms in vain: that ſhe had a great many things to tell and aſk her. Soon after ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the following anſwer:—</p>

"Being one afternoon, in a large company where the converſation happened to turn upon your father's arrival, as ſoon as the name of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Armenius was mentioned, a young officer who ſat attentive to the diſcourſe in one corner of the room, ſtarted up and repeated aloud the name with all the geſtures of aſtoniſhment and ſurpriſe: but ſoon after recollecting his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, he gracefully begged the company's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. He then drew his chair by my ſide, who held a principal ſhare in the diſcourſe, and with all the eagerneſs of an intereſted friend, aſked me, in a rapid but polite manner, many queſtions concerning the Colonel. I ſatisfied him in the beſt manner I was able. After which he exclaimed, "I thought that this gallant officer fell gloriouſly fighting for his country; but thanks to Providence he is yet ſpared to be a ſtill greater bleſſing. Ah! few are the men his country can boaſt of his equal in military know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or in goodneſs of heart!" He then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired if he had any children. I told him he had none but a daughter, the bloſſom of Sarina, and a young lady excelling in every point of view. He then returned to his old corner, and
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:028973_0191_0FDDC8A416253468"/>
occupied in pleaſing thought, was moſt of the time ſilent. I enquired concerning him, but was informed no farther than that his name was Dormer, that he had been an officer in the army, and had lately arrived from a diſtant jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Before my letter arrives I think he will be at Sarina; my imagination already paints him, caught in my friend's enticing ſnares; methinks I ſee you and him, occupied with each other's engaging chat, aſcend our little hill, which, contrary to what you ſay, ſhall not ſend forth its bloſſoms in vain.—Ah my friend, in ſuch a perſon I could almoſt be your rival; but certainly I cannot revoke what deſtiny ordains. Yes, my Elvira, your friend prophecies that this is the prize which your happy lot turns out—Dormer has not the accurate beauty of Harmer—it is not in him that we admire regularity of features or fair complexion: but there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain expreſſion which calls him handſome; his face and perſon have both the appearance of a ſprightly and active ſoldier—it is the face of courage, generoſity, and love—a perſon of ſtrength and activity.</p>

               <p>Elvira ſhowed this letter to her father, and obſerved, while he was reading it, various emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions preſent themſelves in his face. After he had done ſhe ventured to enquire the cauſe of them—'O my Elvira! (ſays he) it is joy on account of the preſervation of this amiable youth; young Dormer next to my daughter, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Tollard, ſhares my affections—from him is baniſhed all looſeneſs of morals, and in him center very many amiable qualities: but perhaps your father's friendſhip and gratitude towards him, may paſs over his foibles.' El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira interrupted him, exclaiming, 'What gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is it my father mentions?' 'Gratitude for the preſervation of my life—He bore a captain's commiſſion in the ſame regiment which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and had next to myſelf the love and eſteem of the ſoldiers. There was in the ſame regiment an officer, whoſe name was Freeman,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:028973_0193_0FDDC8A8464DA9A8"/>
who was ſecond in command, and whoſe breaſt was the receptacle of the greateſt treachery and diſhonour; This officer, ever ſince I had been promoted before him, harboured in his breaſt the greateſt jealouſy againſt me, and thought if he could poſſibly get rid of me, he would ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed me in command. After having planned all the means malevolence could invent all to no purpoſe, his horrid ſoul did not ſtop at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable crime of attempting my life: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſingled out three ſoldiers, and promiſed them great rewards if they would perpetrate this ſhocking act; but they, too fond of their commander, ſpurned at the thought, and threatened to inform me of the whole affair; he, however, by large bribes, obtained their ſilence.</p>
               <p>Being alſo ſtopped here in his deſign, and his anger heightened by continual diſappointments, he behaved to me in the moſt inſolent manner, and ſpread reports abroad, injurious to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Unable to bear ſuch behaviour, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſatisfaction, and deſired him to meet me in a plain ſome diſtance from the encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without ſeconds, and that he might choſe his own weapons—He ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Although he ſent me this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, his coward ſoul was ſtruck with fear, to meet the man whom he had baſely injured, and thought now or never he muſt free himſelf of ſuch an enemy, to eſtabliſh his ambitious views, and to keep himſelf from diſhonour: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by much coſt and pains, obtained at length three men of a different troop to way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay me in the evening. Accordingly, in the evening when I was returning from a walk, I was ſurpriſed to ſee theſe men riſe from an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh with drawn ſwords—I defended myſelf to the utmoſt of my abilities, but would have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len a victim, had not the amiable Dormer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally directed there his ſteps, to reſcue his wounded commander. As ſoon as he perceived me ſtruggling with theſe aſſaſſins, he darted like lightning upon them, and one inſtantly fell a ſacrifice to his unbounded fury; the remaining two fled, and the dying aſſaſſin confeſſed that he was hired by Freeman, and begged forgiveneſs.</p>

When I returned to the camp, I ſaw aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, guilt, and cowardice pictured on the wretched Freeman's viſage. Dormer wiſhed to publiſh the action to the camp, but I prevented him, and told him the point of honour between Freeman and me; and that he need not fear on my account, as I was pretty expert at the ſword. Freeman being now unable to extricate himſelf, muſt either loſe altogether the character of a ſoldier, or meet me: ſuffice it to ſay that he did, and that treachery received its diſmal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the arm of injured innocence. As ſoon as Freeman fell, Dormer came from a place in which he was concealed, for the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate youth feared that the perfidious wretch might plan ſome other plot, and wiſhed to be near to lend the aſſiſtance of his valorous arm—and we heard the dying Freeman confeſs all his treachery. Not only in this, but in many other inſtances, has Dormer been the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate of friends. Happy is the time now approaching, when I ſhall preſs to my boſom this my young and amiable friend: but O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier ſtill if the charming Adeline prophecies right.</p>

Every day the inhabitants of Sarina looked for the arrival of Dormer, but he diſappointed all their expectations. The colonel feared he had forgotten his old commander, or that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary had happened. Elvira, in the company of Harmer, felt no way anxious for his arrival, and was blind to the deſcription of her friend and father: but Harmer dreaded his coming, not only on Elvira's account, but for reaſons yet unknown. One evening when they were all ſitting before the door, a young man on horſeback appeared: when he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nearer, they diſcerned by his dreſs that he was an officer; as ſoon as he had come up he threw himſelf from his horſe and enquired for Mr. Armenius; the colonel immediately aroſe, and they were inſtantly in each other's arms. After this warm embrace was over, Dormer was introduced to the other two; they all then retired into the houſe: the colonel fixed his eyes on his young friend, and addreſſed him in the warm language which friendſhip dictates; he obſerved a gloomy melancholy cloud his manly features, and that his former vivacity and ſprightlineſs were flown; and by Miſs Adeline's
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028973_0197_0FDDC8ACD6B1B910"/>
letter this change muſt have commenced ſince ſhe wrote it—'Ah! (ſays the colonel) have I no more an intereſt in your heart, that the preſence of an old friend who has ſo long been abſent from you, cannot command dejection from your features?—O! (replied Harmer) never ſhall my love and affection for my Armenius ceaſe; equally with a father he ſhares my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but pardon the ſorrow of an aching heart—Long ago, as ſoon as I heard of your exiſtence, I ſhould have flew into your arms; but that an only and amiable ſiſter has fled from home, and gone we know not where; I have been detained in making ſearch for her, but all to no purpoſe; and I muſt ſoon return to renew them, for never ſhall I ceaſe until I have found her.'—The face of young Harmer during this relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent ſeveral changes unperceived by the company, and he next day planned ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for his return home. Dormer ſoon after returned home, having promiſed to write to the colonel, and left behind two ſympathiſing breaſts.</p>
               <p>Adeline Tollard ſoon after arrived at Sarina, where Friendſhip ſtood with open arms to receive her: ſhe informed her brother of the

recovery of her aunt; and ſhe and Elvira unbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened to each other the ſecrets of their boſoms. Elvira acknowledged that Harmer ſtood firſt in her affections, but that ſhe could not deny Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer had many engaging and inſinuating charms, and that ſhe felt for him the endearing tie of gratitude, for preſerving the life of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>They now found the name of Dormer's ſiſter to be the ſame with this unknown maid; "per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps," ſaid they, "ſhe may be the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage."—They were now already impatient
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028973_0202_0FDDC97AC36E2C80"/>
for the return of the evening; and as ſoon as it appeared, they directed their ſteps towards the little hill. When they had come to the foot of it, they walked ſoftly up it, for fear of alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtranger, if ſhe was already there. When they had reached the top, the firſt object that ſtruck their eyes was the beautiful Iſabella, ſitting with her back reclined againſt a tree, with hands claſped and eyes directed towards Heaven; her beautiful hair hung looſe about her neck; her pale and ſnowy viſage, and tears which ſlowly flowed, beſpoke the fair daughter of affliction: The name of Harmer had just died on her lips, when ſhe caſt down her lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing eyes and beheld her two fair viſitants: ſhe ſtarted and uttered a cry; but soon after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering herſelf, ſhe ſaid in wild accents, "What chance has directed here two beautiful young ladies? flee from the ſeat of miſery and ignominy." "Pardon," ſays Elvira interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, "this intruſion; we laſt evening found out that here an unknown maid mourned her miſery, "without an ear to hear, or eye to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty." We have come to endeavour to ſoothe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction's aching breaſt, and to open two boſoms,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028973_0203_0FDDC8FA6A6950A8"/>
where Iſabella may pour her grief; but yet, if our preſence is painful—ſenſibility ſhuns giving pain." Elvira then ſhowed her the verſes they had found. Iſabella replied, "That unhappy paper too well informs you of my ſituation; I am unable to refuſe ſuch amiable offers of friendſhip: I have fled from the houſe of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, deceived by a treacherous, but alas! too captivating villain. Pardon me for not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning names; notwithſtanding I know well your ſecrecy." Elvira heard the name which died on Iſabella's lips when ſhe firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them: her untried fortitude was unable to bear the ſevere trial; thus to ſee the unhappy ſituation of an amiable female, and to find that Harmer, the man whom ſhe adored, had been the cauſe of it; ſhe would have fallen had not her friend ſupported her. Iſabella ſaw her agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and knew that ſomething elſe beſide diſtreſs on her account muſt be the cauſe. When Elvira recovered ſufficiently, ſhe confeſſed to Iſabella the whole affair concerning herſelf and Harmer, and that ſhe would now endeavour to baniſh him from her affections, and to receive (more agreeably to her father's inclinations) the
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:028973_0204_0FDDC96FB6C2AD40"/>
amiable Dormer. The name, inadvertently expreſſed, had ſuch an effect upon Iſabella, that it immediately diſcovered her to be the loſt ſiſter. The letter which her brother had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten was then related to her, and ſhe was made acquainted with all that Elvira knew concerning the family. When they parted they agreed often to meet on the little hill.</p>
               <p>When Elvira and Adeline returned home, the firſt perſon they ſaw was Harmer, who had juſt come: he aroſe with his uſual engaging air to ſalute them, but was coldly received. Before he could have an opportunity to enquire the cauſe, the young ladies retired to their chamber, where Elvira paſſed a reſtleſs night. The next morning Harmer endeavoured to find Elvira alone: he at laſt obtained his wiſh, and addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her in his uſual mild and enticing accent, ſaid, "My amiable Elvira, I hope I have not in any manner injured you; if I have, do not ſo ſeverely puniſh a ſlight fault." Elvira re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "Perhaps, Sir, you have not injured me, but I wiſh to have no connection with perfidy; I have once, I own, had a partiality for you, but this I now baniſh from my breaſt: as my ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I beg no longer to have the favour of your vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits.

Harmer having found all fruitless, immediately mounted his horſe and rode off.—When Elvira and Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line returned again to the hill, they found Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella more compoſed than uſual. Elvira related to her what had lately happened. "Ah!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Iſabella, "you told Harmer too much; he will eaſily ſuſpect you have ſeen me; I muſt ſtay here no longer." Juſt as ſhe ſpoke theſe words, Harmer ſprung from a buſh where he had been concealed, and proſtrated himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the terrified Iſabella, and in accents o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

with yea; I came to enquire of Elvira where you were concealed, as I ſuſpected ſhe had ſome knowledge of you, when ſhe upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with perfidy." Iſabella, almoſt drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in tears, ſobbing, ſaid, "riſe, Harmer, I ſee you are ſincere; I forgive you, but I ſhall never be your wife, unleſs you fall before my father and brother, acknowledge your crimes, and implore their forgiveneſs." "Ah!" my Iſabella, "is that all? that I ſhould volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily have done: I now go to fulfil it." He then tore himſelf away, telling them he ſhould return to inform them of his ſucceſs the fifth evening from this. The evening at length ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; the three young ladies had long been on the hill expecting Harmer's coming. He at length arrived, as the ſhades of evening were quickly declining; his hair all diſhevelled, and his face expreſſive of fatigue; and approaching Iſabella haſtily ſaid, "You are mine; it is granted; come, haſte home this very evening to dry your weeping father's tears." He then led her down, the hill, at the foot of which was a chaise, and after having bid Elvira and Adeline <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Upon hearing of it, his eyes ſparkled with pleaſure, and he at laſt exclaimed, "Now, my Elvira, this is one of the happieſt minutes of my life; no young man is before Dormer in your eſteem." She, bluſhing anſwered, "She could not deny it, and that if he conducted himſelf in a proper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhe could have no objection againſt him." Need we add, that he did conduct himſelf in ſuch a manner, as to win the affections of Elvira, and to beſtow upon her the name of Dormer, as well as that of a mother.</p>

               <p>AUGUSTUS had juſt entered his 19th year, when, by the death of a father he came to the poſſeſſion of a large and independent fortune; he had one year before completed his education. He was not remarkable for regularity of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fairness of complexion, but for a manly appearance and winning demeanor. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he poſſeſſed ſome foibles which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:028973_0208_0FDDC97C147E1800"/>
attendant on mortality, yet his many ſhining qualities far preponderated. His was not like to the authority of a Britiſh noble whom his tenants almoſt worſhipped. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the plain and induſtrious farmer his equal, and to them his houſe and heart were open; for he dwelled in the beautiful and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile regions of America, where liberty and equality ſpread their extenſive domain; where the language of the inhabitants is, "We will be free." A refined ſenſibility which he poſſeſſed made him ſeek for the diſtreſſed, and to delight to ſoothe the breaſt of affliction by his affability and charity. He now reſided at his country ſeat with an only ſiſter and his family domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, beloved by all who knew him. His ſeat was large and beautifully ſituated; his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind was not yet inclined to domeſtic af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he therefore intruſted them to an old and faithful ſteward who had long been attached to the houſe. His time he commonly employed in the improvement of his mind, and in the company of ſome ſelect friends. He delighted often to wander from home, to behold the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſcenes with which the country abounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="unknown:028973_0209_0FDDC8F0849A3900"/>
As Auguſtus and his ſiſter Louiſa were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from a rural excurſion, they were much delighted with the beauty and ſituation of a little cot which ſtood on their property; they would have advanced unto it, but the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being far ſpent prevented them.</p>
               <p>Some time after as Auguſtus was walking out unaccompanied in the evening, he directed his ſteps towards this cot which he formerly ſo much admired, and when he had come up to it he leaned on the fence with which it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed; he caſt his eyes around, and beheld with admiration and pleaſure the neatneſs of the houſe, as well as the improvements which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded it; but a ſtill more beautiful object attracted his attention, he beheld a beautiful young female gracefully reclined beneath a tree; her ſide face was turned towards him, and he indulged himself with the pleaſing feeling that he feaſted not at the expence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy. He obſerved by her pale countenance, on which he could perceive that the rose for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly bloomed, that ſome ſecret uneaſiness ſat heavy on her heart; ſhe was ſtroaking the neck
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:028973_0210_0FDDC98049997178"/>
of a little dog which fawned at her feet: ſhe was cloathed in the ſimple weeds of ruſticity, but even at her firſt appearance the idea aroſe in Auguſtus's mind, that ſo much beauty could not be born in ſo low a ſphere. Auguſtus ſilently retired behind ſome trees for fear that this beautiful ſtranger ſhould perceive him. He had not been long there before ſhe arose, caſt her expreſſive black eyes around, and walked towards the door of the cot, calling her little dog, in a voice which equalled the ſweeteſt muſic. Her graceful movement and elegantly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned perſon did not then eſcape the tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attention of Auguſtus. From her appearance he judged her to be about ſixteen years of age. After ſhe had diſappeared, Auguſtus roſe from his place of concealment, and directed his ſteps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards home reflecting on the beauty of this fair cottager, and planning ſome ſcheme to become acquainted with her. His imagination from ſuch an outſide appearance, already painted the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and cultivated mind, while his ſuſpicion that ſhe was not the daughter of the poſſeſſor of the cot, was greatly increaſed. When he returned home, his firſt enquiry was for his old ſteward; he enquired of him who it was that lived in the
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028973_0211_0FDDC9010F5D9FD0"/>
cot; but all that the ſteward could inform him, was, that a Mr. Ambern, a clever honeſt man had been there for the ſpace of a year. To his queſtion whether he had any daughters, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, he had never perceived any children there but a little ſon. Theſe anſwers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did not ſatisfy Auguſtus, confirmed him that the young female was not the farmer's daughter. While his curioſity was greatly excited to diſcover who ſhe was, his feelings were now much more intereſted; his heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready beat with ſympathy for the diſtreſs which he thought he diſcovered, in this beautiful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. When he had related theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and ſuſpicions to his ſiſter Louiſa, her curioſity was immediately excited, and ſhe was already planning ſome ſcheme to become acquainted with her ſituation, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ender his viſiting at the cot proper. He therefore diſpatched a ſervant next morning with a letter, inviting him to his houſe in the evening, the ſervant returned with an anſwer, that Mr. Ambern would do himſelf the honour of waiting on him, and when aſked by Auguſtus who he had ſeen, O, cries he, beſides the man and his wife, I ſaw a most beautiful young lady, who appeared about the age of Miſs Louiſa, sitting in the corner with her eyes ſwimming in tears, and a beautiful picture tied by a ribbon hung from her neck, I think it muſt ſurely be that of ſome lover. This ſimple ſpeech of the ſervant made ſuch an impreſſion on the mind of Auguſtus, as convinced him that his breaſt was in this inſtance ſuſceptible to the charms of beauty, as well as to the feelings of ſympathy and ſorrow. In ſhort, let it be ſufficient to ſay, that the charms of this lovely maid had ſmitten the ſuſceptible breaſt of Auguſtus. When the evening arrived, and Auguſtus was alone in his chamber, a rap was heard at the door, and a ſervant directly led in Mr. Ambern. Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus aroſe to receive him, and after he had wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed him to his houſe, they ſat down ſociably
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:028973_0213_0FDDC904F04E60F8"/>
together. Although his manners were not what is commonly termed graceful, they were ſimple and eaſy, free from all affectation. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus was informed by him, that he had been an officer in the American army; that he had been in ſeveral engagements, in one of which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wound. Auguſtus's young mind, which glowed with patriotiſm, now burned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled friendſhip towards him. He enquired how many children he had, to which, after a little heſitation, he replied only one. He was about to queſtion him concerning the young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which he meant to ſay his ſervant had ſeen there; when Mr. Ambern looking at him with a ſmile, cried, I know it is in vain, my young friend, to hide from you what you allude to, and although requeſted to ſecrecy, I will inform you of what little I know, not only from a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ſatisfy you, but that you being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the circumſtances, may be in ſome degree uſeful. Auguſtus replied, that there needed not any other plea but diſtreſs to engage his protection; but eſpecially, in favour of one arrayed in ſuch charms, his intereſtedneſs muſt be greatly increaſed, for he now informed

Mr. Ambern he had been an eye witneſs of them. Mr. Ambern replied, you are yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with but half her charms, for equal to her beauty is the cultivation of her mind; her ſweet enticing manners, her engaging conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, have ſo won upon the affections of my wife and myſelf, that we love her almoſt equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with our ſon. We feel almoſt equally with her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the diſtreſs under which ſhe appears to labour. She has a little inſtrument through which ſhe breathes the ſorrows of her ſoul in ſuch melancholy ſtrains as to often draw tears from our eyes. But, my friend, I will paſs from this, to tell you what little I know concerning this amiable young lady. About a week paſt, late in the evening as we ſat at tea, we heard a carriage ſtop, and ſoon after a knocking at the door, when opening it, a young gentleman of genteel appearance, and noble countenance, led in this young female; they both appeared to be in diſtreſs; I invited them to ſit down, which they immediately did; we all ſat for ſome time in profound ſilence, at laſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

accents, deſired me to walk a little way in the field with him. I immediately complied, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the young lady with my wife; we had not proceeded far when he thus addreſſed me—you will, no doubt, wonder to ſee two perſons thus enter your houſe with whom you have not the leaſt acquaintance; but it will be ſufficient to inform you that it is diſtreſs which has thus obliged us abruptly to claim an entrance; and at the door of the induſtrious and honeſt huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, miſery is ſeldom refuſed admittance. I interrupted him with aſſurances of the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of his apology, and expreſſed, in ſincere terms, my intereſt in his ſorrows; that if I could in any way ſerve him, it would give me the greateſt pleaſure. With tears of joy and gratitude he acknowledged my kindneſs and hoſpitality: He told me, I need not harbour the leaſt ſuſpicion of their diſhoneſty, for it was virtue that bade them fly hither. But (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he) you muſt pardon me for not relating the cauſe of our appearance here, you ſhall hear it at ſome future time; the few minutes which circumſtances allow me to ſtay here will not permit me: But let me now call your attention
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:028973_0216_0FDDC98690BBC0A0"/>
to the trouble which I ſolicit from you—This lovely female which I have brought under your roof, I beſeech you to protect; let her remain with you as one of your family; be a kind and indulgent parent to her; let it remain a ſecret that ſhe is here; endeavor to ſoothe her in her affliction, but do not endeavor to draw the cauſe of it from her, as it will heighten it—excuſe, my protector, the ſhortneſs and abruptneſs of my expreſſions, as haſte will allow me no others. We then turned towards the houſe; when the young gentleman entered it, and, while the tears trickled down his cheeks, he exclaimed, now, my Aurelia, having found a faithful guardian for you, ſuffer me to bid you farewell: It ſhall not be long before I ſhall return to reſtore you to joy and to your home. The lovely Aurelia ſprang from her chair, and encircled his neck with her ſnowy arms, exclaiming, in accents almoſt inarticulate, return ſoon my Ferdinand, my deareſt —. The laſt word here I was unable to diſtinguiſh. Ferdinand, after having eembraced her, and, with all the politeneſs of afflicted gratitude, bid us farewell, walked haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily from the door. He immediately ſprang
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:028973_0217_0FDDC8EF6CDD6D88"/>
in his carriage, dropping his purſe, which I had formerly refuſed. I returned to the houſe, much touched by the generoſity and diſtreſſ of the youth. Aurelia the next morning ſeemed to have much recovered her ſpirits—to prevent diſcovery, ſhe dreſſed herſelf in thoſe garments in which you have ſeen her. This is all, my dear young gentleman, that I know about the beautiful Aurelia. After much other conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, chiefly concerning the ſame ſubject, Mr. Ambern returned home. When Auguſtus was left alone, his thoughts naturally remained with the object of his late converſation: his curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, inſtead of being diminiſhed, was rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. The behavior of Ferdinand, the young gentleman who accompanied her, and the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which the ſervant had ſeen about Aurelia's neck, convinced him that he was her lover. The pain which theſe reflections gave, told him the ſtate of his heart—He was reſolved to guard himſelf againſt her charms—<hi>Sed omnia vincit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One evening, which was very calm and beautiful, when ſilence waved her gentle hand, and huſhed the world in quiet and repoſe, when
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:028973_0218_0FDDC988078EB528"/>
the mind is filled with thoughts congenial to the ſcene, Auguſtus took up his flute, upon which he was a great proficient, and directed his ſteps towards a little grove, which grew a ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance behind the houſe of Mr. Ambern. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia was the ſubject of his meditation. When he came to the grove, he reclined himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a tree, and, after having remained for ſome time in ſilence, he applied his mouth to hiſ flute, and through it breathed forth ſuch harmonious ſtrains as correſponded with his feelings: The melody, in ſweeteſt vibrations, floated on the air, and the hills were reſponſive to the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling notes—The feathered ſongſters forgot their ſong, and liſtened in attentive ſilence—Nor were theſe the only liſteners—This grove was often the reſort of Aurelia—The beauty of the preſent evening had invited her thither, and ſhe was now liſtening in a little place ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by buſhes, a ſilent hearer and ſpectator of Auguſtus—She, unſeen, now perceived him, as he formerly did her—She was charmed with the beauty of the muſic, which was alſo conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial to her feelings—but the manly appearance of Auguſtus claimed her attention more than
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:028973_0219_0FDDC90A761D8400"/>
his ſtrains—While thus Auguſtus indulged his feelings, his ſiſter Louiſa, who had obſerved him walk towards the grove, and who deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to follow him, now came up, and, laughing, caught hold of his flute, and ſaid, Why, Auguſtus, what is the matter with you—what makes you ſo grave and ſerious of late, that you muſt run into the woods to play ſuch doleſome ditties?—Auguſtus, ſmiling, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any reply, took his ſiſter by the hand, and they directed their ſteps home.—Aurelia, when ſhe returned to the cot, did not relate what ſhe had ſeen—From the appearance of Auguſtus, ſhe ſuppoſed he was a young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of fortune, and that ſome ſecret uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwelled within his breaſt—Her heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the charms of his muſic, and of himſelf. The next morning Auguſtus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to pay a viſit at the cot—He, therefore, after breakfaſt, went unaccompanied, and was received with great joy by its induſtrious inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants—In caſting his eyes around the room, he miſled the object for whom the preſent viſit was deſigned—Delicacy prevented him from expreſſing his diſappointment, but Mr. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bern
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:028973_0220_0FDDC98CE34E6420"/>
perceived it by his countenance—It was, however, of ſhort duration, for he had ſet but a few minutes, when Aurelia entered, with her hat on, juſt returned from a walk—She did not perceive Auguſtus, who had ariſen at her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, until ſhe had advanced a few ſteps in the room; but directly after, her eyes meeting his, a crimſon bluſh diffuſed itſelf over both their countenances—Aurelia immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected the young gentleman ſhe had ſeen in the grove, whoſe muſic had ſo greatly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her. Mr. Ambern then introduced them to each other—a certain embarraſſment was viſible in Aurelia—After they had ſet down, Auguſtus, with his uſual engaging demeanor, endeavored to enter into converſation, nor were his attempts unſucceſsful, and the common em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment which ſubſiſts between ſtrangers was ſoon removed—He could not behold, but with admiration and emotion, her beauty, which was heightened by the exerciſe ſhe had been taking—Without the aid of ornament, and richneſs of dreſs, ſhe now appeared in her own charms—her beautiful eyes beamed ſweetneſs and love—her flowing locks hung graceful on
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:028973_0221_0FDDC90B882E19D8"/>
her back, unadorned by the hand of art—She had not the fragrance of coſmetic perfume, but the flowers of the garden bloomed on her boſom. Auguſtus was equally pleaſed with her conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and he found, that his imagination had not painted her in too high colours.</p>
               <p>He paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed the evening in her company, and was ſorry to ſee it ſo rapidly glide away. At his departure, he informed Aurelia, that he had a ſiſter nearly of the ſame age with herſelf, who would be happy to poſſeſs ſuch an invaluable acquaintance. Aurelia thanked him for his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, and expreſſed the happineſs ſhe ſhould experience from a friend. When Auguſtus returned home, his mind was almoſt wholly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied with Aurelia—His ſiſter Louiſa jocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly queſtioned him concerning where he had been—He, without diſguiſe, informed her of the converſation at the cot, and of the liberty he had taken in offering her friendſhip to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia. Louiſa rejoiced in this opportunity of getting acquainted with her—Her curioſity had become so greatly excited, that ſhe reſolved the very next day to viſit her—She did ſo, and ſhe
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:028973_0222_0FDDC98E09641D20"/>
and Aurelia became intimates at the very firſt meeting—This intimacy gradually increaſed; Aurelia often viſited Auguſtus's feat, himſelf and his ſiſter often at the cot. Auguſtus now informed Aurelia, where he had firſt ſeen her, but never ventured to utter a ſyllable reſpecting her ſituation. She, in return, informed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus where ſhe had firſt ſeen him, and how much ſhe had been entertained with his flute.</p>
               <p>While thus the intimacy and paſſion of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus were daily increaſing, an event happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which draws my tale to a ſpeedy conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:—</p>
               <p>One evening Auguſtus was on a viſit to the cot; when he had approached within view of it, he perceived a carriage ſtanding before the door; his curioſity was greatly excited, to know to whom it belonged. He ſoftly entered the houſe, but what was his ſurprize, when the firſt object that ſtruck his eyes, was a young gentleman with Aurelia claſped in his arms—His heart throbbed, his pulſe beat quick, the thought immediately occurred, that he was to have his beloved Aurelia ſnatched from him forever, by a ſucceſsful lover. The young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:028973_0223_0FDDC90F73E62200"/>
who held Aurelia, did not perceive Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus at his firſt entrance, but upon her whiſpering to him, he turned round. They inſtantly caught each other's eye, ſtood for a moment gazing on each other, then flow into each other's arms, while Auguſtus exclaimed, O my Ferdinand, is it you, my former deareſt friend and claſsmate? After this warm em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, Auguſtus's firſt inquiry to Ferdinand was, why he had come hither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Ah! my dear Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus (he cried) I have come on a very pleaſing embaſſy; to recall home an only and beloved ſiſter, who has fled here for protection from a father who was going to force her into marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with one whom ſhe deteſted. As ſoon as Ferdinand pronounced the name of ſiſter, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus was unable to contain himself—he ſprang forward towards Aurelia, and preſſed her roſy cheek to his—ſhe did not receive him with a frown, but a bluſh and a ſmile. Here the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor breaks off his narrative, aſſuring thoſe who have honored his little tale with their peruſal, that the concluſion which they will be naturally led to draw, will be the true and right one; ſuch an one as the author, if he had felt himſelf diſpoſed, would have drawn himſelf.</p>

                  <p>GAUL, the ſon of Morni, attended Lath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon into his own country, where he was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained by Nuath, the father of Lath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and fell in love with his daughter Oithona. The lady was no leſs enamoured of Gaul, and a day was fixed for their marriage. In the mean time, Fingal, preparing for an expedition, ſent for Gaul. He obeyed and went; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Oithona to return if he ſurvived the war, by a certain day. Lathmon too was obliged to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his father Nuath in his wars; and Oitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na was left alone at Dunlathmon, the ſeat of the family. Dunromath, Lord of Cuthal, taking advantage of the abſence of her friends, came, and carried off by force, Oithona, who had formerly rejected his love, into Tromathon, where he concealed her in a cave.—Gaul returned on the day appointed; heard of the rape, and ſailed to Tromathon, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf on Dunromath. When he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he found Oithona diſconſolate, and reſolved not to ſurvive the loſs of her honour. She told him the ſtory of her miſfortunes, and ſhe had ſcarce ended, when Dunromath with his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers

She ſeemingly obeyed; but ſecretly armed herſelf, ruſhed in the thickeſt of the battle, and was mortally wounded. Gaul having put to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>CUTHULLIN, after the arms of Fingal had expelled Swaran from Ireland, continued to manage the affairs of that kingdom, as the guardian of Cormac the young King. In the third year of Cuthullin's adminiſtration, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lath, the ſon of Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Torlath fell in the battle by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thullin's hand; but as he too eagerly preſſed on the enemy, he was mortally wounded. The affairs of Cormac, though for ſome time ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Nathos as mentioned in another poem, fell in confuſion at the death of Cuthul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. Cormac himſelf was ſlain by the rebel Cairbar.</p>

Bragela the daughter of Sorglan, and paſſing over into Ireland, lived for ſome time with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, grandſon to the king of Ulſter. His wiſdom and valour in a ſhort time gained him ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that in the minority of Cormac, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme king of Ireland, he was choſen guardian to the young king, and ſole manager of the war againſt Swaran, king of Lochlin. After a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of great actions, he was killed in the twenty-ſeventh year of his age. He was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for his ſtrength, that to deſcribe a ſtrong man, it has paſſed into a proverb, "he has the ſtrength of Cuthullin." They ſhow the remains of his palace at Dunſcaith in the Iſle of Sky; and a ſtone to which he bound his dog goes ſtill by his name.</p>

Nor was he more careleſs of money, than avaricious of time, which he continually dedicated to the ſtudy of learning and philoſophy, or employed in the exerciſe of public and private virtue: Yet, to become uſeful, he was not deſirous to be great: He not only turned his attention to the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his mind, but to the acquirement of vigour and ſtrength of body: He had a martial and manly appearance, and ſhone at once the hero and philoſopher. Pelopidas, the ſon of Hippoclus, was equal with Epaminondas in his deſcent: From his infancy he was brought up in opulence and plenty, and obtained, when he arrived at the age of manhood, an immenſe eſtate: He poſſeſſed, in a high degree, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, generoſity and benevolence, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to relieve the diſtreſſes of the indigent: All his friends he made partake of his wealth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Epaminondas, who could never be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to relinquiſh that virtuous poverty which was ſo very much adapted to his philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical diſpoſition. Pelopidas married early a noble Theban lady, and had by her many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch's Lives;</note>;
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:028973_0280_0FDDC95B0D191E70"/>
yet, notwithſtanding the increaſe of his expences, he ſtill continued to beſtow large donations upon his friends; and when ſome perſon, in conſequence of this, told him, "That money, which he neglected, was a very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary thing"—"It is very neceſſary, replied he, for Nicodemus there"—pointing to a man of that name, who was both blind and lame.</p>
               <p>Theſe two illuſtrious Thebans poſſeſſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for all kinds of virtues: But no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular virtue has rendered them more glorious and celebrated, than the friendſhip which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between them, which was never broken but by the hand of death. Pelopidas preferred the ſociety and improving converſation of his amiable friend, before all the amuſements and honor which riches afford. When he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Epaminondas would receive no ſhare of that wealth which was bountifully beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he learned equally to deſpiſe it, and changed his rich apparel for the decent cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the philoſopher.</p>

They both equally poſſeſſed beauty and ſtrength of body; they both equally excelled in athlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick exerciſes, and in ſwiftneſs; but Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, owing to his greater inclination for litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and philoſophical purſuits, ſurpaſſed his friend in knowledge and prudence; indeed not only Pelopidas, but every Grecian who was his cotemporary, and perhaps he was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled by any who preceded or ſucceeded him.</p>
               <p>There is no where exhibited more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly the great importance and utility of wiſe and eminent leaders, than in the hiſtory of Thebes—Before theſe two heroes aroſe, we find Thebes poſſeſſing a very little ſhare in the government of Greece; but, when headed by theſe two men, ſhe became Empreſs of Greece; and after their deaths, ſhe ſunk again into her former degree of inſignificancy, and yielded again the ſceptre to Sparta. In her affliction, ſhe called for Epaminondas and Pelopidas, but, never did they again appear. The first place where we behold them acting a conſpicuous part, is in the battle of Mantinea, which was fought againſt the Arcadians, in the third year of the ninety-eighth Olympiad.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin.</note> The reader muſt make a diſtinction between this and the

battle of Mantinea in which Epaminondas was ſlain, which did not happen until after the death of Pelopidas, and which was fought againſt the Lacedemonians. The Thebans, in this war which I have reference to, were friends and allies to the Lacedemonians. Epaminondas and Pelopidas were ſent with ſome troops to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them againſt the Arcadians. They both fought in the infantry near one another with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted bravery; but, notwithſtanding their great exertions and atchievements, the wing in which they were, gradually gave way, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated before the enemy; when they perceived this, ſcorning to ſly, and ſupported by intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and courage in a miraculous degree, they ſtood firm as two rocks amidſt the angry ſea, and alone defied the enemy, elevated to enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm by ſuch great ſucceſs—They joined their ſhields together, and undauntedly repulſed all who attacked them; but at length Pelopidas, overcome by ſeven large wounds he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fainting with the loſs of blood which theſe occaſioned, fell upon the bodies of the enemies which his warlike arm had extended dead at his feet. Epaminondas ſaw his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion fall by his ſide. He was reſolved to
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:028973_0283_0FDDC9D5C2ACCC98"/>
die, rather than forſake his friend, and leave him in the power of the enemy: He advanced before his bleeding body, and took his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined ſtand to defend him and his arms, with his own life. Bereft of that warrior, whoſe arm (now lanquid and feeble) terrified and put to flight hundreds, he entirely alone maintained the combat for a long time with great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but being pierced in his breaſt by a ſpear, and wounded in his arm by a ſword, he became diſabled, and would have been the next minute laid lifeleſs by the ſide of Pelopidas, had not Ageſipolis, king of Sparta, came from the other wing to his aſſiſtance, and unexpectedly ſaved both their valuable lives—They were intimate friends before this deſperate action, but it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and augmented the virtuous flame—Friendſhip ariſes from virtue and congeniality of soul, but it is greatly increaſed by actions which excite gratitude and admiration.</p>
               <p>In the lives of theſe perſons, we do not intend to enter into a minute detail of the affairs of Greece at this period—we ſhall only take notice of events which are dependent on their actions.</p>
               <p>The characters of Epaminondas and Pelopidas added ſo much proſperity to Thebes, that the
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:028973_0284_0FDDC960BB644110"/>
Lacedemonians became jealous of their riſing fame, and wiſhed to extinguiſh it—But they concealed their rancour by the maſk of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and alliance. About this time Sparta had reſolved upon an expedition againſt Olynthus. She had already diſpatched Eudamidas at the head of a number of troops, and it was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Phoebidas, his brother, ſhould follow him at the head of eight thouſand more. This powerful reinforcement ſet out from Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus, and in their march northward encamped in the neighbourhood of Thebes. Thebes at this time exhibited a ſcene of confuſion and faction—Occupied entirely by internal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, ſhe was totally defenceleſs; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſhe was lulled into ſecurity by alliances which ſhe then held with all the powerful ſtates of Greece. The commotion of Thebes aroſe from a warm diſpute reſpecting the form of government. Iſmenias, Androclides, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopidas headed a party zealous for Liberty, and a popular adminiſtration—Archias, Leontides, and Philip, who were all very rich, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately ambitious, ſupported with the greateſt enthuſiaſm and violence, and oligarchical form of government. This being the ſtate of affairs
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:028973_0285_0FDDC9D8516AF048"/>
at Thebes, and the ariſtocratic party unable to accompliſh their favorite deſigns, ſent ſecretly to Phoebidas, to ſeize the citadel called Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea, and to expell the adherents of Iſmenias, and give the poſſeſſion of it to the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. They diſplayed, in the moſt eloquent terms, the glory which would attend ſuch an immortal action, as to make himſelf maſter of a defenceleſs city, and one which was in alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his ſtate; that ſuch an act would greatly aſſiſt in the reduction of Olynthus; that the Thebans, who had publiſhed, by decree, that no perſon ſhould act offenſively againſt Olynthus, but ſhould remain entirely neutral, would not fail, after ſuch an exploit, to furniſh him with as great a number of troops, both horſe and foot, as he ſhould think neceſſary for the reinforcement of his brother Eudamidas.</p>
               <p>Some eminent hiſtorians have ſuppoſed this to have been a concerted plan with Sparta it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—This, I think, is extremely probable, for Sparta, in a very few inſtances, was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for her political juſtice. Ageſilaus, one of the greateſt kings they ever poſſeſſed, and who was much celebrated for this particular virtue, committed actions highly unjuſt and
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:028973_0286_0FDDC961CDB90FC0"/>
unpardonable. Sparta, we have alſo ſeen, was at this time jealous of the increaſing glory of Thebes, and elevated by the pitch of grandeur to which ſhe had arrived, as ſhe now held much the ſuperiority over Athens: But the greateſt proof of this aſſertion is the manner in which they behaved—After Phoebidas had taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the citadel, they deprived him of his command, fined him one hundred thouſand drachmas, but ſtill kept poſſeſſion of the Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea, and continued in it a ſtrong and well ſupplied garriſon: An action inconſiſtent, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely baſe, and one among the numerous others which blaſt the Spartan name. But, however this is, Phoebidas liſtened to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of this perfidious party; he was a general of much ambition, and who wiſhed very much to ſignalize himſelf in ſome extraordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This one, which now opened before him, perfectly correſponded with his ideas of magnificence and greatneſs. Whilſt the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans, ſecured by their alliances, and little knowing the ingratitude of Sparta, whom they had lately ſerved in the Arcadian war, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the feaſts of Ceres, and indulged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:028973_0287_0FDD5FA4E04B2E70"/>
in the pleaſures ariſing from their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ceremonies, Phoebidas ſuddenly led on his troops, and took poſſeſſion of the citadel. The Theban Senate were then ſitting—Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides, one of the leaders of the ariſtocratic fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, entered the Senate chamber, and, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the Senators, informed them, that they need not be the leaſt apprehenſive of danger from the Lacedemonians who had entered the citadel; that they had only come to regulate ſome affairs highly neceſſary in the city, and that they would only inflict chaſtiſement on thoſe violent diſturbers of the public tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that as for himſelf, being always deſirous of the happineſs of his country, and willing to lend his aid to reſtore that tranquillity which had for ſome time paſt fled his beloved coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he would now take the liberty of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing that power which his office of polemarch gave him, of confining all perſons who caballed and bred diſturbances in the ſtate.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin,</note>

               <p>He here concluded his ſpeech, and inſtantly ordered Iſmenias to be ſeized, and carried to the citadel, where he might remain ſecure. The party of Iſmenias, when they ſaw their leader conducted to priſon, and fearful of the violence

which the oppoſite faction would exerciſe upon them, ſince they had now the government en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in their own hands, ſled from the city with great precipitation, and, mourning the fate of their diſtreſſed country, retired, to the amount of four hundred or upwards, to Athens. They ſoon after received ſentence of perpetual baniſhment, by a public decree. Among the number of the baniſhed was Pelopidas—But Epaminondas remained unmoleſted, proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his philoſophical ſtudies at Thebes; for the party thought there was nothing to fear from a man who devoted the whole of his attention to literature, and who was ſurrounded with poverty.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </note> After the capture of Thebes, the fortune of the Lacedemonians never appeared more ſtrongly eſtabliſhed, or ſhone with more ſplendour. They now ruled all Greece with abſolute ſway—All Boetia was entirely under their controul—Corinth obeyed their orders in every reſpect—Argos they humbled, and held in dependence—The Athenians, abandoned by their allies, and in other reſpects in a declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſituation, were by no means able to oppoſe the victorious Lacedemonians.</p>

They chaſtiſed and reduced to ſtill ſtricter obedience, thoſe people who attempted to throw off their oppreſſion, and to become free. The puniſhments inflicted upon ſome for exertions of this nature, terrified all others from attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like. Now the ſole Empreſs of the land and ſea, all trembled at the terror of their arms, and bowed in humble ſubmiſſion to their victorious warriors, before they would dare at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to fight thoſe whom they now ſuppoſed invincible. The great king of Perſia courted their friendſhip, and the tyrant of Sicily deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended almoſt to meanneſs to obtain their alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance—But, ſays Rollin, "A proſperity found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in injuſtice, can be of no long duration.—The greateſt blows that were given the Spartan power, came from the quarter where they had acted the higheſt injuries, and from whence they did not ſeem to have any thing to fear, that is, from Thebes." Pelopidas and his party now found an aſylum in Athens; their virtues and engaging behavior rendered them beloved by the nobles and worthy men of Athens. The infamous Leontides, when he was informed of theſe circumſtances, ſent ſecretly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

virtue, and of gratitude. But, to return to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopidas, whom we ſhall ſoon behold ſhine with glorious luſtre! whom we ſhall ſee the hero of an action, a greater than which hiſtory cannot boaſt.</p>
               <p>Sparta had now for four years exerciſed an abſolute power over Thebes—She had ſet over it three tyrants, Leontides, Archias, and Philip, who performed every ſpecies of tyranny with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul, which their cruel and ignoble ſouls dictated. Pelopidas, who was then very young, was unable any longer to contain his indignation and patriotiſm, when informed of the cruelties of the tyrants—He reſolved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into ſome plan to reſtore his country her former freedom, or to ſell a life, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, was unhappy and diſagreeable—He, therefore, requeſted a meeting of all the exiles then at Athens; which being effected, he aroſe from his ſeat, with a countenance on which glowed undaunted courage, and, in an oration ſplendid for its patriotic and truly heroic ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, repreſented to them, with all the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and ardor of enthuſiaſm, that it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy for honorable men, and for Thebans, to remain inactive, after having ſaved their
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:028973_0292_0FDDC96C82232E20"/>
own lives; to behold, with calmneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, the beloved country in which they were born and educated, enſlaved and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that to rely upon the protection and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which Athens afforded them, was a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mean, dependent, and, beſides, very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious; for that Sparta, having much the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over Athens, might oblige them to acquieſce to any propoſals they ſhould make; that the orators of Athens, who were then the rulers, needed even now to be fawned and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered—which occupations were unworthy, and degrading to the Theban character; that no ſcheme could be too hazardous to accompliſh the liberty of their country, and that none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him more promiſing than that which Thraſybulus purſued; that he was a model of intrepid valour and generous fortitude; that as he ſet out from Thebes to deſtroy the tyrants of Athens, ſo they might march from Athens to reſtore to Thebes its primitive freedom.</p>
               <p>When the youthful hero had finiſhed, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly reſounded with univerſal applauſes; every individual admired the zeal and ſcheme of Pelopidas: They then conſidered and digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affairs, neceſſary for the execution of their

purpose. Information was ſecretly diſpatched to ſome of their friends at Thebes, of all their deſigns, which met with a joyful reception. Among their friends which ſtill remained at Thebes, were Charon and Phyllidas: Charon was one of the nobleſt and wealthieſt perſons of the city, and a determined advocate for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical form of government. Phyllidas was of an enterpriſing activity, and poſſeſſed a very inſinuating addreſs; He had ſo engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the favour of Archias and Philip, the two moſt licentious of the tyrants, by his craftineſs and cunning, that they procured him the important office of ſecretary of council, and ſeldom executed any plan without firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting him. By frequent ſecret intelligence between theſe two Thebans and Pelopidas, their deſigns became properly arranged, and ripe for execution. Charon was to receive them in his houſe, and have every thing neceſſary for the project: Phyllidas was to give an entertainment to Archias and Philip, to endeavor to heat them with wine, and introduce in their company ſome lewd and licentious women. Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das was at this time endeavoring to inſpire the young Thebans, by his diſcourſes, with a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate

deſire to throw off the Lacedemonian tyranny. He was made acquainted with every circumſtance relative to Pelopidas's intentions, but took no active part in the deſtruction of the tyrants. The time for action at length arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the little band of conſpirators marched, and made a ſtop at Thraſium, a ſmall town not far diſtant from Thebes: There they reſolved, that a ſmall number of the youngeſt of them ſhould enter the city, and try the firſt dangers, and if they were ſurprized by the enemy, the others ſhould provide for their families. Twelve young heroes, of the beſt families of Thebes, united together by a faithful and virtuous friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, rivals of honor and glory, offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for this bold and dangerous exploit—Pelopidas was their daring leader, and after him were Melon, Democlides, and Theopom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.<note n="*" place="bottom">Goldſmith.</note> The diſtance between Athens and Thebes was about thirty-five miles: The conſpirators had thirteen miles to march, through a dreary and hoſtile country. After having taken an affectionate farewell of their companions, and diſpatched a meſſenger to Charon to give him notice of their coming, they ſet out, diſguiſed in the dreſſes of ſportſmen, carrying nets and

wrung their hands, believing that all was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and that they ſhould die without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting any thing to their own glory, or to the advantage of their country—After a moment of dreadful reflection, they unanimouſly adviſed Charon to obey the mandate without delay.—Charon was a man of intrepid courage; he ſtood unmoved at the danger which threatened himſelf, but was full of concern for the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his friends: fearful leſt he might be ſuſpected of treachery, if ſo many brave citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſhould fall victims to the tyrants rage, he went to the apartment of his wife, and brought out his only ſon, a youth of about fifteen years of age, who, in ſtrength and beauty, was ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to all the youth of Thebes; he gave him into the hands of Pelopidas, pronouncing theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable words—"If you diſcover that I have betrayed you, and have been guilty of treachery on this occaſion, revenge yourſelves on me, in this my only ſon, whom, as dear as he is to me, I abandon to you, and let him fall a victim, without mercy, to his father's perfidy."<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin.</note>—Theſe expreſſions drew tears from the

eyes of many: It much hurt the feelings of theſe heroic Thebans, to think that Charon ſhould ſuſpect that they indulged any idea of his diſhoneſty. They affectionately conjured him not to leave his ſon with them, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to a place of ſafety, that in ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture time he might riſe the champion of his friends and his country's wrongs—<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin,</note> "No," replied the noble father, "He ſhall ſtay with you, and ſhare your fate. If he muſt periſh, what nobler end can he make than with his father and his beſt friends? For you, my ſon, exert yourſelf beyond your years, and ſhew a courage worthy of you and me—You ſee here the moſt excellent of the Thebans—Make, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch maſters, a noble eſſay of glory, and learn to fight, or, if it muſt be, to die, like them, for Liberty—For the reſt, I am not without hopes, for I believe, that the juſtice of our cauſe will draw down the favour and protection of the Gods upon us." He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a prayer for them, and, after em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the conſpirators, went out. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored, on the way, to compoſe his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in ſuch a manner, that he might anſwer,

without ſuſpicion, the queſtions of Archias—When he arrived at the door of the houſe where the feaſt was held, Archias, Philip, and the other magiſtrates who, through apprehenſion, had ariſen from the table, met him there, and immediately aſked him if he knew any thing concerning a report which was ſpread, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the arrival of ſome diſaffected people in the city? He affected geſtures of aſtoniſhment, and perceiving, by the anſwers which they made to ſome queſtions he put to them, that they had no accurate information of the affair, he ventured to ſpeak in a more bold and commanding man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſaid—"It is very probable the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour you ſpeak of, is only ſome falſe alarm, intended or interrupt your mirth and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But, as the ſlighteſt hints of ſuch things ought not to be neglected, I will go and make the ſtricteſt ſearch which poſſibly lies in my power." Phyllidas, who then appeared, praiſed very much his prudence and zeal—He then led them back to the entertainment, and placed before them ſome of the moſt captivating li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors.</p>
               <p>Charon, when he returned home, found his friends, not prepared to ſly, but to die glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,

and to ſell their lives at a dear price—The joy which glowed upon his face, explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at once their good fortune—He made them acquainted with all that paſſed, which raiſed them from dejection and deſpair, to the higheſt degree of hope. This circumſtance, which threatened to prove fatal to the deſign, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly after ſucceeded by another much more alarming—Archias, Philip, and the other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates had not long returned to the table, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the interview with Charon, when a courier arrived from Athens, bearing every mark of haſte and trepidation, deſiring to ſee Archias, to whom he delivered a letter from an Athenian magiſtrate, of the ſame name, his ancient friend and gueſt—This letter revealed the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, and every circumſtance relative to it, as afterwards diſcovered—The meſſenger told Archias, that his maſter deſired him to read it inſtantly, as it contained buſineſs of the greateſt importance, and which required immediate conſideration. Archias took the letter, ſaying, ſmiling, "buſineſs to-morrow,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch.</note> and put the letter under the bolſter of his couch, without reading it. Fortune proving thus kind to our

bold adventures, they now were equipped, and every way prepared for the attack: They now ſet out, divided into two parties—Thoſe which were to attack Leontides, were headed by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopidas, and thoſe which marched againſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias and Philip, the tyrants who were at the feaſt, were led by Charon and Melon. Theſe arrayed themſelves in the flowing veſtments of a woman, and overſhadowed their countenances by a load of wreaths and garlands<note n="*" place="bottom">Gillies.</note>—In this diſguiſe they approached to the door where the feaſt was kept—upon their entrance, the gueſts raiſed loud ſhouts of joy, expecting that theſe were the women which Phyllidas had promiſed them an interview with; they immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed all the ſervants who attended at the feaſt.—At a ſignal given by the commander, the conſpirators, like lightening, unſheathed their ſwords, and ruſhed upon the tyrants, and ſome of their partizans, pointed out to them by Phyllidas: They, being in a ſituation incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of defence, ſoon fell victims to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded ſury.</p>
               <p>But Pelopidas had a more difficult taſk to accompliſh; he had not to encounter with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

debauched and debilitated with wine, but with a ſober, wiſe, and brave man. When he and his party came to the door of this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving tyrant, they found it locked and bolted, for he was already in bed and aſleep; they knocked ſeveral times before any perſon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered or came to open it—at laſt a ſervant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and demanded their wiſhes; one of the band anſwered him in a ſatisfactory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; he then opened the door, which he had no ſooner done, than the conſpirators ruſhed in, laid him lifeleſs on the floor, and bent their way towards the chamber where they knew Leontides ſlept. He, hearing the noiſe and the ſhriek of the ſervant, immediately ſuſpected the true cauſe: He inſtantly leaped from his bed, ſeized his ſword, and prepared to make as vigorous a defence as poſſible; but, unhappily for him, he forgot to extinguiſh the candle, which he always kept burning in the room, which, had he done, it would have thrown the conſpirators into confuſion, and made them miſtake each other for a foe. Leontides, however, received them boldly at his chamber, and laid Cephiſodorus dead at his feet, who was the firſt man that attempted to enter—
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:028973_0304_0FDDCA34417C5730"/>
Their leader, Pelopidas, ſeeing one of his brave men ſlain in the conteſt, became exceedingly enraged, and ruſhed furiouſly forward to the paſſage; but it being very narrow, and the dead body of Cephiſodorus lying in the way, the diſpute was long and difficult, owing to the many diſadvantages under which Pelopidas laboured, and as no perſon but one could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly engage at once; however, the youthful and vigorous arm of Pelopidas at length prevailed, and laid the impious wretch at his feet.</p>
               <p>They went from thence in purſuit of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates, his friend and neighbour, and diſpatched him likewiſe.</p>
               <p>This immortal exploit being performed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, with unexpected ſucceſs, meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers were immediately diſpatched to Thria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fium, where their companions ſtill remained. The doors of all the priſons in Thebes flew open to the victorious republicans; the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, wretched victims of tyranny, once more breathed the freſh air, and enjoyed the uſe of their limbs; the porticos were deprived of their ſpoils; the cutlers ſhops were broken open, and arms were given to every perſon they met.</p>

               <p>The Lacedemonian garriſon moſt authors have thought guilty of ill conduct, in not fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them when the diſorder prevailed during the night; for the garriſon conſiſted of fifteen hundred Spartans, beſides three thouſand ariſtocrats who had taken refuge in the citadel. They, alarmed by the cries they heard, by the illuminations of the houſes, and the multitudes of people which flocked the ſtreets, remained ſtill, and only diſpatched a courier to Sparta, deſiring a reinforcement.</p>

                  <pb n="303" facs="unknown:028973_0306_0FDDCA354A91EAD8"/>
At ſun-riſe the next morning, the exiles ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Thraiſium, completely armed.—Epaminondas led Pelopidas and his party in a large aſſembly of the people, who received them with repeated ſhouts of applauſe, and poured forth their thanks and gratitude in the moſt animated language.</p>
               <p>Pelopidas addreſſed them in an oration, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to aſſiſt their country, and join with their gods in demoliſhing the tyranny of Sparta. The ſame day Pelopidas, with Meion and Charon, were choſen Boetarchs.</p>
               <p>Soon after the early arrival of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors from Thraiſium, a body of men arrived from Athens, to the aſſiſtance of Pelopidas, conſiſting of five thouſand foot and five hundred horſe. Theſe troops, with others which came from ſeveral places of Boetia, compoſed an army of twelve thouſand foot, and the ſame number of horſe. Pelopidas, conſidering that a reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might probably very ſoon arrive from Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, led on theſe troops with as much expedition as poſſible to attack the citadel. The events of the ſiege are variouſly related; ſome ſay the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon made a very vigorous defence, and were at laſt forced to ſurrender on account of the
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:028973_0307_0FDDC9F3403ADE50"/>
failure of proviſion: But the moſt probable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is, that they made a very feeble reſiſtance, being intimidated by the alacrity and enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm, as well as the increaſing number, of the aſſailants. The garriſon had their lives granted them, and the liberty to go to whatever place they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>The Cadmea ſurrendered only a few days before the arrival of a freſh force from Sparta. Cleombrotus led on a powerful Lacedemonian army as far as Megara, which, with a little more expedition, would have ſaved the citadel. Two of the generals who capitulated were puniſhed by death, and the other was ſo heavily fined, that he had to go into voluntary baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at Peloponneſus.</p>
               <p>Thus we have followed an action of which Pelopidas, our hero, was both the propoſer and conductor. "It is," ſays Rollin, "the greateſt exploit that ever was executed by ſurprize and ſtratagem, and may very properly be compared with that of Thraſybulus, who delivered Athens from the ſame ſubjection. Both Pelopidas and Thraſybulus, deſtitute in themſelves of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, and induced to implore a foreign ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, from the bold deſign of attacking a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable

               <p>We ſhall ſee in like manner, that the war which reduced the pride of Sparta, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived it of the empire, both by ſea and land, was the work of this ſingle night, in which Pelopidas, without taking either citadel or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and entering only one of twelve into a private houſe, unlooſened and broke the chains impoſed by the Lacedemonians on all the other ſtates of Greece, though it appeared impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable even to produce ſuch an effect."</p>
               <p>The freedom of Thebes, reſtored in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which has been related, lowered the pride

and dignity of imperial Sparta. She breathed nothing but revenge, and prepared, with every exertion poſſible, all affairs requiſite to beſtow a chaſtiſement adequate to the crime of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious Theban rebels, who dare aſſert the rights of man, and the greateſt priviledge of human nature. The Thebans, who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taſted of liberty, and knew the charms of that celeſtial Goddes, reſolved to maintain their recovered rights, and to die rather than yield in ſo ſacred a cauſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe diſpoſitions on both ſides occaſioned an, inveterate war, which laſted nearly ſeven years, and ended with the battle of Leuctra, which produced a revolution throughout the whole of Greece.</p>

Cleombrotus entered Boetia with a very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful army, ſpreading diſmay and terror before him. The declining Athenians, when they ſaw the great exertions of Sparta, became ſo terrified, that they renounced the Theban alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, fined, baniſhed, and put to death all their firm adherents.</p>

                  <pb n="307" facs="unknown:028973_0310_0FDDCA3B501825D0"/>
The affairs of Thebes now appeared truly deſperate, having no friend or ally on whom they could depend—It was only the ſingular qualifications and heroic virtues of their leaders, that ſupported it.</p>
               <p>Pelopidas and Gorgidas, who were then at the head of the government, conſulted ſome ſcheme by which they might create a quarrel between Athens and Sparta.</p>
               <p>Cleombrotus, after a campaign of 2 months, returned home, leaving one Sphodrias to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a numerous force at Theſpioe. This general poſſeſſed courage and enterpriſe, but very little prudence. His character and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition were well known by Pelopidas—Pelopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das thought that he would be a good inſtrument in effecting a rupture between Athens and Sparta; to accompliſh which, was then his principal deſign—He, therefore, diſpatched a particular friend of his to him with money, which he was to offer him, while he beſtowed upon him inſinuations and flattery, yet more agreeable to him than money. This friend, after having repreſented to Sphodrias, that a man ſo great and glorious as himſelf, ought to perform
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:028973_0311_0FDDC9F8890ABA50"/>
ſome wonderful action, to render his name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, propoſed to him the taking of Piraeus by ſtratagem, when the Athenians had no ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of ſuch an event: Such an action, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, will be extremely grateful to your countrymen: The Thebans, enraged againſt the Athenians for their baſe conduct and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, will ſwell with praiſes the name of Sphodrias, and lend you all the aſſiſtance in their power.</p>
               <p>The ambitious Sphodrias liſtened with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this ſpeech of the friend of Pelopidas: He envied the glory of Phoebidas, who, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ideas of greatneſs, performed a very renowned exploit: But he ſtill conſidered it as more glorious to ſeize Piraeeus, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Athenians of their power, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected attack. Tranſported with joy, he immediately made preparations for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>illuſtrious</hi> action, which was even more horrid than the ſeizure of the Cadmea.</p>
               <p>The diſtance between Thebes and Theſpioe was not more than twenty miles, which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed an eaſy opportunity for the proſecution of theſe ſecret practices—But the great diſtance between Thebes and Athens, which exceeded

forty miles, rendered the intentions of Spho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drias extremely unſucceſsful. He marched from Theſpioe with the flower of the garriſon, with a view of ſurprizing Piraeus before the dawn of the ſucceeding day; but day-light over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took him in Thriaſium, near Eleuſis: The news of his approach was ſoon ſpread in Athens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The Athenians diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched an embaſſy, complaining bitterly of the inſult which had been offered them. In conſequence of which, the Lacedemonians, under the ſhadow of virtue, deprived Sphodrias of his command; cited him to appear before the civil magiſtrates; but finally acquitted him.</p>
               <p>This injuſtice of Sparta exceedingly exaſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the Athenians, and involved them in a long and dangerous war.</p>
               <p>The Athenians immediately made a new al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with Thebes; fitted out a large fleet, commanded by the illuſtrious Timotheus, ſon of Conon. Ageſilaus, at the head of eighteen thouſand foot, and fifteen hundred horſe, made frequent incurſions in Boetia, committing great
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:028973_0313_0FDDC9FC9E5CFEB8"/>
damage, but not without conſiderable loſs on his ſide. There were ſkirmiſhes every day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the armies. It was altogether owing to the abilities of her generals, that Thebes was able to carry on a war againſt a ſuperior force, commanded by one of the greateſt captains of antiquity. The whole glory and great ſucceſs, at this period of the war, is juſtly due to Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas, for Epaminondas had not yet taken the lead of public affairs.</p>
               <p>The arms of Thebes were crowned with victory at Platea and Theſpioe, where Phoebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das (the ſame perſon who had ſurprized the Cadmea) was ſlain. At the battle of Tanagara, Theban valour ſhone very conſpicuous—Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas there ſlew with his own hand <hi>Panthoides,</hi> the chief commander. The engagement at Tegyra rendered particularly glorious this youthful hero—It was a prelude to the battle of Leuctra, which was one of the moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous engagements that has ever happened.</p>
               <p>Pelopidas, with his ſoldiers, having failed in a deſign he formed againſt Orchomenos, which declared on the ſide of the Lacedemonians, were returning by Tegyra, which is remarkable for its narrow paſſes. The Lacedemonians, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:028973_0314_0FDDCA4088803948"/>
from Locris, met them on the road—As ſoon as the enemy was perceived approaching, a ſoldier ran in great haſte to Pelopidas, and, exceedingly terrified, exclaimed, "We are fallen into the enemy's hands." Ah! replied he, why ſhould we not rather ſay, that they are fallen into ours?<note n="*" place="bottom">Plutarch.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He inſtantly ordered his horſe, which were his rear-guard, to begin the attack—He drew out his foot into a cloſe body, which were only 300 in number, called the ſacred battalion—He hoped, wherever theſe charged, being ſo cloſely united, they would break through the enemy. Gorgolicon and Theopompus, the Lacedemonian generals, formed their infantry into two battalions; each of theſe diviſions conſiſted of 900 men. The engagements of thoſe parts where the generals on each ſide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in perſon, were very fierce and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The Spartan generals, who charged Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopidas with great fury, were ſlain firſt; all the troops that were around them were either killed or diſperſed: The remainder of the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians were ſo terrified, that they opened a paſſage for Pelopidas to march through; but

he, diſdaining to retreat, advanced furiouſly againſt thoſe who were ſtill drawn out for battle: He made a terrible ſlaughter among them, ſpreading terror and diſmay wherever he went—He did not purſue far the routed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, fearing he might be ſurprized.—But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his march, crowned with the wreaths of victory.</p>
               <p>This encounter depreſſed the ſpirits of the Lacedemonians; for it had never before hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened until this time, that the Lacedemonians had been defeated by an inferior, or even an equal number; but in this inſtance they were more than three times the number of the Thebans.</p>
               <p>They now became deprived of that glory; the Thebans, in their turn, became the terror and dread, even of thoſe who had rendered themſelves ſo univerſally formidable.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The war had now laſted ſeveral campaigns: All Greece began to grow weary of a war, which, although victory was more frequently on the ſide of the Thebans and Athenians, redounded to the enrichment and aggrandize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sparta. They began to turn their
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:028973_0316_0FDDC9FE94BDA588"/>
thoughts once more on the bleſſings and ſmiles of peace, and to concert meaſures neceſſary to obtain an object ſo delightful.</p>
               <p>Deputies were ſent from the different ſtates to Sparta, who ſtill held the power and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of Greece; Epaminondas, whom we left purſuing with ardor the paths of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, was at the head of this deputation.—He now became very much celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his profound knowledge and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he had not yet ſhone conſpicuous as a ſtateſman and military hero: His friend Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipodas was at this time the moſt illuſtrious hero of Greece, without Timotheus, the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian general, is conſidered as his equal.</p>
               <p>In the counſel of the deputies, where Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus, as king of Lacedemonia preſided, Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas liſtened in thoughtful ſilence to the tyranny of the king, and the mean and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſpirit of the deputies, who coincided in every thing he ſaid: But he preſerved his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity and independence of ſoul; he feared not the frowns of Ageſilaus, or his ſycophants; he was a philoſopher! he was a patriot—He aroſe from his ſeat in deliberate warmth; by the thunder of his eloquence, he made the

haughty Spartan tremble on his throne: He ſpoke not for the advantage of Thebes alone, but of Greece in general; in which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſpare the effuſion of human blood; vigorouſly inſiſted on the neceſſity of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a peace on equality and juſtice, for that no peace could be firm and durable, which was not equal and conſiſtent in all its parts.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe, founded on reaſon and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, made great impreſſion on the minds of the hearers. Ageſilaus obſerved the effect it had upon the deputies, by their thoughtfulneſs and ſilence. To prevent this effect, which it might have to his diſadvantage, he demanded, in a haughty manner, of Epaminondas, "Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thought it juſt and reaſonable, that Boetia ſhould be free and independent! That is, Whether he agreed that the cities of Boetia ſhould depend no longer upon Thebes?"</p>
               <p>Epaminondas anſwered it with equal warmth, by a ſimilar inquiry, <hi>"Whether he thought it juſt and reaſonable, that Laconia ſhould enjoy the ſame independence and liberty?"</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Ageſilaus heard this, he roſe from his ſeat in great rage, ordering Epaminondas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to declare, <hi>"Whether Boetia ſhould be free?"</hi>

Epaminondas, firm and reſolved, replied again, aſking, "Whether, on his ſide, he would conſent that Laconia ſhould be free?"<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin.</note>

               <p>The tyrant, unaccuſtomed to the language of an independent hero, and of one who feared neither him nor his abſolute power, upon the repetition of this queſtion, became ſo inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, that he baniſhed the Thebans out of the treaty of alliance which he was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with the other ſtates of Greece. The reſt of the allies ſigned it, imperfect as it was, dreading the power of the Lacedemonians, if they refuſed.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of this treaty, the armies of Athens were to be diſbanded and recalled.</p>
               <p>Thebes was now left alone to brave the fury of the moſt powerful ſtate of Greece. Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, and his ſon Archidamus, collected a very powerful Lacedemonian army, and ſummoned the aid of their confederates: Sickneſs prevented Ageſilaus from taking the field in perſon; but he commanded his colleague, Cleombrotus, to march without delay into the territories of the enemy, promiſing him, that he ſhould be ſoon joined by a powerful reinforcement. Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus halted in the plains of Leuctra; it was
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:028973_0319_0FDDCA048ADBB578"/>
ſurrounded on all ſides by ridges of mountains, which reared their lofty heads to the ſkies; the moſt conſpicuous of theſe were called Helicon, Citheron, and Cynocephaloe. In this place, as was reported, were buried two Theban dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, whoſe virginity had fell a ſacrifice to the brutality of three Spartan youths. Not able to ſupport life under the load of diſhonor, theſe beautiful and unhappy females flew, before the poiſonous breath of diſgrace, into the arms of a voluntary death: Their old and afflicted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Scedaſus, followed their example, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring vengeance from gods and men.<note n="*" place="bottom">Goldſmith.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Thebans were extremely terrified; they ſaw themſelves without a friend and ſupporter, braving the waves of adverſity, while the ſtates of Greece looked on, and gave them up for loſt. They little then knew that the abilities of one man were to ſecure them from impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruin, and make them triumphant over their foes. This was Epaminondas—We have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto beheld him as an amiable man, a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, and an orator; but now we will ſee him in the field of battle, ſurrounded with vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and glory. He was appointed by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen ſupreme general of the war, and had

               <p>Pelopidas then commanded the celebrated <hi>ſacred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>When Pelopidas left his houſe to join the army, his young and beautiful wife, in taking her laſt farewell, with a ſhower of tears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeched him to avoid as much danger as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to think of her while in the tumult and clangour of battle. He made this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reply to her, "Private men are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to take care of themſelves, but generals to take care of others."</p>
               <p>It was a diſpute among the Theban generals, whether they ſhould offer the enemy battle or not: Pelopidas was a warm advocate for battle; but three of the generals were againſt it; the voice of Epaminondas was only wanting to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:028973_0321_0FDDCA067B291888"/>
it which way he pleaſed; he firmly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for the engagement.</p>
               <p>While the two armies lay at Leuctra, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on battle at the ſucceeding day, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, that at the dead of night, when a ſolemn ſtillneſs reigned throughout the camps, Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas dreamt that he ſaw the two Theban maids, whoſe deaths we have related, weeping at their tombs, calling curſes and evils upon the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans; that their father, Scedaſus, also appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, commanding him, "to ſacrifice a young red haired virgin, in honor of his daughters, if he deſired to be victorious in the enſuing bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle."</p>
               <p>The next morning when Pelopidas aroſe, and reflected on the dream, his humanity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted at the dreadful command; he reſolved in his mind not to obey it, notwithſtanding it was contrary to the opinion of the ſoothſayers. While Pelopidas was in this frame of mind, a wild ſhe-colt, which had broken looſe, ran neighing through the camp, but when ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached near the place where he was, ſhe ſtood ſtill and ſilent: The whole army admired the ſparkling redneſs of her mane; the ſtatelineſs of her form and actions. The thought inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:028973_0322_0FDDCA4865B409E0"/>
occurred to Pelopidas, that this was the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin which was repreſented to him in his dream: He ordered her to bé ſeized and ſacrificed, in honor of the violated Theban maids.</p>
               <p>This circumſtance was ſpread through the army, and tended to animate their ſpirits. The time of battle arrived—The two armies were very unequal in number; the Lacedemonians conſiſted of twenty-four thouſand foot, and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred horſe; the Thebans had only ſix thouſand foot, and four hundred horſe, but all of them valiant men, determined to conquer or die.</p>
               <p>The commanders of each army were very celebrated generals: Cleombrotus may be juſtly ranked among the greateſt heroes that ever Sparta produced; and Epaminondas among the greateſt that ever the world produced. The two armies drew out upon a plain<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin.</note>—Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus commanded on the right wing, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Spartans, on whom he moſt confided. To receive the great advantage which his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of horſe gave him, he placed them in front of the right wing, where he commanded.
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:028973_0323_0FDDCA0A5450CE40"/>
The allies who formed the left wing, were commanded by Archidamus, the ſon of king Ageſilaus.</p>
               <p>The Theban general viewed with attention this arrangement of the enemy; he was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the iſſue of the battle would depend upon the domeſtic troops of Sparta, who were incomparably braver than their allies: He, therefore, reſolved to command in perſon the left wing, to ſtrengthen it with the beſt of his heavy armed troops, and to make a very vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attack on the right of the enemy, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſeize or deſtroy the perſon of Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus. The ſacred battalion, headed by his friend Pelopidas, he placed near his perſon; theſe cloſed the left wing: The remainder of his infantry he drew up on his right in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique line, which the farther it extended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more diſtant from the enemy: This cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſpoſition on the right was made, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his little army from being ſurrounded by the numbers of the enemy, who reſembled the form of a creſcent: His horſe he poſted in the front of his left, after the manner of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="unknown:028973_0324_0FDDCA4B7A8B4A18"/>
The action began with the cavalry: This ſkirmiſh continued but a ſhort time, when the ſixteen hundred horſemen of the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans gave way, before the impetuoſity and bravery of the four hundred Thebans: Being driven back upon the infantry, they put them into conſiderable confuſion: This diſorder was ſtill more increaſed, by an impetuous ſally made upon the flank of Cleombrotus, by Pelopidas, at the head of his ſacred band. Epaminondas followed cloſe his horſe, and fell ſuddenly on the phalanx with all the weight of his heavy battalion: He bore down all before him. The danger of their king recalled to their ancient principles the degenerate diſciples of Lycurgus.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gillies.</note> The moſt valiant warriors <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:028973_0325_0FDDCA0CC83C2780"/>
fall of their chief added new fury to the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans—They held the death of their king as a much leſs diſgrace than to leave his mangled body to the view and inſults of the enemy—To recover his body, they made every exertion; their amazing efforts were ſucceſsful; but they were unable to obtain any other advantage—Epaminondas was careful to fortify his ranks, and to maintain his order of battle; the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and celerity of his aſſault gained him a complete and glorious victory over an army more than four times his number—He routed them in every quarter, and, following them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vigorouſly in their flight, killed a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Epaminondas erected a trophy in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of this memorable engagement.</p>
               <p>Never before had the Lacedemonian arms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſo much diſgrace; in their former moſt bloody engagements, they had never more than five or ſix hundred of their citizens ſlain; in this battle they loſt four thouſand men; the Thebans only three hundred.</p>
               <p>When we conſider the battle of Leuctra in every circumſtance, the great numbers of the Lacedemonian army, their bravery, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their generals, we will be led to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:028973_0326_0FDDCA4C8FC01EA8"/>
that this victory of Epaminondas is one of the moſt glorious and aſtoniſhing that has ever happened in the world: In no inſtance has the qualities of a general been ſo eminently diſplayed.</p>
               <p>Before the time of Pelopidas and Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, the Thebans could not ſtand before the victorious Spartans, and after their deaths, they fell again into the ſame degeneracy.</p>
               <p>When the intelligence was ſpread over Greece; that the Thebans, with the loſs of only three hundred men, had gained an immortal victory over Sparta, it occaſioned revolutions in every quarter.</p>
               <p>The Thebans ſent an account of this victory to Athens, demanding at the ſame time aid againſt a common enemy; but the Senate of the Athenians, which was then ſitting, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced greatly by Timotheus and Iphicrates, treated the embaſſy rather coldly, and refuſed the deſired aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Epaminondas and Pelopidas were, after this battle, appointed joint governors of Boetia: They aſſembled all the troops of Boetia, and all the aſſiſtance of their allies, whoſe number daily
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:028973_0327_0FDDCA11462647A0"/>
increaſed, and entered Peloponneſus, driving all before them. Many places revolted from the ſubjection of the Spartans: among theſe were Elis, Argos, Arcadia, and the greateſt part of Laconia.</p>
               <p>It was then about the winter ſolſtice, towards the end of the laſt month of the year—The firſt day of the next month was the time appointed for the reſignation of their offices; it was enacted by law, that death ſhould be inflicted upon all thoſe who held them beyond that time: The reſt of the colleagues, fearful of bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and of the dreadful conſequences of the infringement of the law, wiſhed that the army ſhould march immediately back to Thebes—Epaminondas and Pelopidas, on the contrary, animated the citizens, and exhorted them to take advantage of the fear and alarm of the enemy, and to follow an enterpriſe, which would be of much benefit to the ſtate, and which would more than compenſate for the neglect of this formality. The army approved this ſalutary advice. Epaminondas, therefore, entered La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia at the head of ſeventy thouſand ſoldiers, a ſmall part of which were Thebans.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="unknown:028973_0328_0FDDCA4E17B9D270"/>
The great reputation of the two generals had ſpread ſo extenſively abroad, that allies flocked in numbers to their ſtandard, obeyed with great reſpect their orders, and marched confident of ſucceſs, when they were their leaders.</p>
               <p>In this expedition they united all Arcadia into one body; they captured Meſſenia, driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them the Spartans, who had been in poſſeſſion of it near two hundred and eighty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeven years. It was a country extremely fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and in extent nearly equal to Laconia.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin.</note> Epaminondas called to their paternal country its ancient inhabitants, who were diſperſed in the different ſtates of Greece, Italy, and Sicily: They heard the friendly invitation, and, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the love of their country, inherent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity, they flocked in joyful crouds to their once happy land.</p>
               <p>This wiſe and benevolent action-of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban gave immoderate grief to the Spartans: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inveterate animoſity had always prevailed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Meſſenians, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being extinguiſhed until the ruin of one party.</p>
               <p>It is related, that Epaminondas, after having ravaged the country in ſight of Sparta, croſſed
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:028973_0329_0FDDCA1504EE7380"/>
the river Eurotas, which was at that time very much ſwelled by the melting of the ſnows: as he paſſed at the head of his infantry, ſome of the Spartans pointed him out to Ageſilaus, who, after having for a conſiderable time ſurveyed him in a very thoughtful manner, raiſed up his hands, and ſaid, <hi>"wonderful man."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After theſe ſucceſſes, the rapidity of which we can ſcarcely imagine, Epaminondas led his army through Cenchea, on his return home.—During his march he defeated the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>The two Thebans, when they returned home, after having performed ſuch memorable actions, inſtead of receiving honor and applauſe from a grateful country, were ſummoned to appear as criminals againſt the ſtate, for having diſobeyed one of its ſtricteſt laws, in retaining their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands four months after the term appointed for their reſignation; during which time they performed thoſe exploits which we have briefly related.</p>
               <p>Such a behaviour, at firſt view, excites in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation in every generous breaſt—But when
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:028973_0330_0FDDCA4FA23F26A0"/>
we conſider, that it is upon the obedience of the laws that the exiſtence of government de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, and particularly the ſituation of Thebes at that time, who had lately recovered her free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, our indignation ought to be changed into admiration. Thebes rejoiced at their victories, but ſtill they arraigned their laurelled heroes to the court of juſtice.</p>
               <p>When theſe two generals appeared before the magiſtrates, Epaminondas, inſtead of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his cauſe, delivered an eulogy on the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories he had gained, together with his friend—He ſtood undaunted, although ſurrounded by perſons envious of his glory—He ſpurned from him ſupplication, or language unworthy of a philoſopher. Both he and Pelopidas were unanimouſly acquitted, and he returned from his trial, as he did from battle, ſurrounded with glory and univerſal applauſe.</p>
               <p>When the Lacedemonians beheld the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans ſucceſsful in every undertaking, and daily increaſing in ſtrength and grandeur, they began to tremble ſo, the fate of Sparta—They knew the enterpriſing ſpirits of Epaminondas and Pelopidas, and they had dreadfully experienced the terrors, of their arms. That imperial ſtate,
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:028973_0331_0FDDCA1695182968"/>
which lately gave law to Athens, diſpatched an orator, who ſorrowfully implored their kind protection and aſſiſtance. The orator deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the moſt pathetic terms, the miſeries, the eminent danger in which Sparta remained; the haughtineſs of Thebes, and her ambition, which extended its views to the empire of all Greece: He repreſented the danger which Athens herſelf had to fear, if, without oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Thebes was allowed to drive all before her, and daily acquire new allies: He dwelt upon the time when a ſtrict union prevailed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Athens and Sparta, and when, by their united efforts, they preſerved all Greece from deſtruction.<note n="*" place="bottom">Goldſmith.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Athenians acknowledged the juſtneſs of moſt parts of this diſcourſe: They felt ſorrow for the diſtreſs of Sparta, and were jealous of the increaſing power of Thebes. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion entirely forgave the injuries they had formerly received from their armies, and they finally determined to aſſiſt the Lacedemonians with the whole of their forces. A league and conſederacy was concluded againſt the Thebans.</p>
               <p>The king of Perſia, deſirous to reconcile the Grecian ſtates, ſent one Philiſcus for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:028973_0332_0FDDCA52AEC35FE0"/>
but his embaſſy proved unſucceſsful.—He then returned home, after having beſtowed large ſums to the Spartans for carrying on the war.</p>
               <p>The Spartans, not yet content with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Athenians, and wiſhing ſtill to enlarge the confederacy, diſpatched deputies to the great king.</p>
               <p>When the Thebans heard this, they thought it was neceſſary to deputize ſome perſon on their ſide—Pelopidas was choſen for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>The fame of his great exploits had ſpread ſo extenſively abroad, and had raiſed him ſo great in the eyes of the world, that when he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at court among the princes and nobility, they received him with joy and acclamations; they related his exploits, and crowned him with praiſe and applauſe. Artaxerxes paid him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary honours; he publicly extolled him before his lords. After having heard him ſpeak, more nervous than the Athenian ambaſſador, and more ſimple than the Lacedemonian, he eſteemed him more than ever—He gave him far the preference to all the reſt of the Grecian deputies. The king granted to Pelopidas all
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:028973_0333_0FDDCA1ADBDC2420"/>
his requeſts, ſo that he entirely baffled the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the confederates.</p>
               <p>He returned home, cloathed with honor, and without accepting any of the riches of Perſia; a behavior widely different from Timagoras, the Athenian ambaſſador.</p>
               <p>The eſteem of Thebes for him was augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the good ſucceſs of his embaſſy, which had procured the freedom of Greece, and the re-eſtabliſhment of Meſſene.</p>
               <p>Shortly after the return of Pelopidas from this embaſſy, new troubles aroſe in Greece, which called him once more into the field of battle.</p>
               <p>Alexander, the tyrant of Pheroe, entertained ſecret deſigns of ſubduing all Theſſaly under his ſubjection. He declared open war againſt ſeveral parts of it.</p>
               <p>The terrified Theſſalonians immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched ambaſſadors to Thebes, begging the aſſiſtance of ſome troops and a general. Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas was at that time engaged in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſian war. The command of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition was unanimouſly given to Pelopidas: He marched with an army to Theſſaly in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time—reduced Sariſſa to a capitulation, and
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:028973_0334_0FDDCA5660E56EB8"/>
obliged Alexander to come, in a ſuppliant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and make ſubmiſſion to him. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored, by mild and lenient behavior, to ſoften his hardened diſpoſition, and to change the cruel tyrant into the humane prince; but, finding theſe endeavors ineffectual, and hearing every day of his cruelties and vicious purſuits, he exerciſed more ſeverity towards him. The tyrant, upon this uſage, ſecretly fled with his guards.</p>
               <p>Pelopidas, having ſettled the affairs of Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaly, and defeated the ſchemes of Alexander, led his army to Macedonia, where Ptolemy was carrying on war againſt his brother Alexander, the king of Macedon, reſpecting ſome politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs. The two brothers had invited him to be the judge and arbitrator of their quarrel, and to eſpouſe that ſide which ſhould appear to him to be the moſt juſt.</p>
               <p>When he arrived, he quieted all diſturbances and diſputes; he recalled all thoſe perſons who had been baniſhed by either party, and returned to Thebes, taking with him Philip, the brother of Alexander, and thirty youths of the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious families of Macedonia, to ſhew the

               <p>Pelopidas was extremely enraged againſt the mercenaries, for their treachery. Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that they had depoſited the whole of their effects at Pharſalus, a city in Theſſaly—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e thought this a fair opportunity to be reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, by depriving them of that, for which they proved perfidious traitors—He, therefore, collected a few Theſſalian troops, and marched to capture Pharſalus. He had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived but a few minutes, and was preparing to
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:028973_0337_0FDDCA1D42879540"/>
attack the place, when Alexander the tyrant, his former enemy, came againſt him at the head of a powerful army.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin.</note> Pelopidas, who had been ſent as ambaſſador to him, believing that he came to juſtify himſelf, and to anſwer to the complaints of the Thebans, for his cruel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, went to meet him, taking no perſon along with him but Iſmenias—He well knew that Alexander was an impious wretch, void of faith and honor, but he ſuppoſed that the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Thebes, and his own dignity and fame, would prevent him from executing any violence on his perſon—He was, however deceived, for the tyrant, ſeeing him and Iſmenias alone and unarmed, ſeized them both as priſoners, and made himſelf maſter of Pharſalus.</p>
               <p>This perfidious action filled the minds of the ſubjects of Alexander with terror and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may—They feared greatly for themſelves, on account of the violent proceedings of the tyrant, who imbrued his hands daily in the blood of the innocent; and for the fate of their country, from the revenge of the juſtly enraged The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans.</p>

When the news of the capture of their leader was conveyed to Thebes, extremely incenſed againſt ſuch a deteſtable proceeding, ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſpatched an army into Theſſaly. Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas happening at that time to lie under the diſpleaſure of his countrymen, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of this expedition was given to ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of very little fame, and incapable of ſo great a truſt. Epaminondas, actuated friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and patriotiſm, entered the army as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſoldier.</p>
               <p>Alexander conveyed Polopidas to Pheroe—he exhibited him as a ſhew to all perſons who, led by curioſity, came to gaze upon the man whoſe exploits had rendered him ſo famous, and who deprived Sparta of the command of Greece.</p>
               <p>The tyrant hoped, by this degrading cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, his pride would be humbled, and his courage abated. But the heroic ſoul of the Theban remained firm—His humanity revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the cruel ties which he beheld exerciſed upon the unhappy Phereans—He conſoled them by affectionate language, and by informing them, that it would not be long before the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant would meet with a puniſhment adequate
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:028973_0339_0FDDCA2141613DB0"/>

He informed Alexander him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in threatening language, of his dreadful cruelties on his innocent ſubjects, and that, as ſoon as he was releaſed by his countrymen from conſinement, he would puniſh him ſeverely, not only for his perfidy to him, but for his other vices; and that it would be more wiſe in him to put to death a perſon who, when freed, he dreaded the power of his vengeance, than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who never did him any harm, and who, in every inſtance, were obedient to his will.</p>
               <p>The tyrant, amazed at his magnanimity and greatneſs of ſoul, aſked him why he was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to die?—<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin.</note> The illuſtrious priſoner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "It is that thou mayeſt periſh the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by being ſtill more deteſtable to the gods and men."</p>
               <p>Alexander, after this, awed by the heroiſm of Pelopidas, committed him to cloſe confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and gave orders, that no perſon, under penalty of death, ſhould approach near his dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, or attempt to ſpeak with him.</p>
               <p>Thebe, the wife of Alexander, and daughter of Jaſon, the predeceſſor of the preſent tyrant, deſirous to ſee the warrior, whoſe name had reſounded throughout the world, and who had

               <p>She found Pelopidas ſitting in a melancholy poſture, in a retired part of his priſon; he was dreſſed in the habit of ſorrow and diſtreſs; his beard was neglected, his hair uncombed and diſhevelled; but ſtill the hero ſhone through this mean diſguiſe; diſtreſs had not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the aſpect of dignity.

               <p>This he ſoon accompliſhed—Alexander diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to him perſons to apologize for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, and to offer his alliance to the Thebans.

               <p>Theſſaly had enjoyed but a ſhort repoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tyrant of Pheroe, unable to change his natural diſpoſition, again invaded their terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,

               <p>On the day of the departure of Pelopidas, the ſun, which had ſhone with uncommon luſtre and magnificence on the morning of the ſame day, became at noon totally eclipſed, and wrapt Thebes in its gloom and awful darkneſs!</p>
               <p>Dread and conſternation damped the boſoms of almoſt every Theban.

Alexander, conſcious of the ſmallneſs of his force, approached againſt him with an army conſiſting of more than twenty thouſand men, challenging him to battle; nor did the valiant Theban refuſe! but drew out his little band to meet him.

The Thebans and Theſſalians, rouſed by the example of their beloved general, made every exertion poſſible for ſo ſmall a force; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry of the enemy gradually gave way. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopidas darted his eye, beaming terror through their retiring bands, in ſearch of the tyrant, who had formerly treated him with ſo much indignity. When he perceived him on the right wing, endeavoring to rally his ſoldiers, the prudence of the general forſook him; he neglected the care of his life, the orders neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

for the battle, and gave his whole ſoul up to revenge: He ruſhed impetuouſly forward, raiſing aloud his voice, and daring his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſingle combat—The coward tyrant feared his dreadful preſence, and ſhrunk behind his troops—Theſe received the enraged warrior with a ſhower of javelins and ſpears—The battalion ſtood firm for a conſiderable time; but Pelopidas drove before him the firſt ranks, ſtrewing the ground with many bleeding vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims of his rage: none daring to approach him, he ſtood alone the victor of the field.</p>
               <p>The daſtardly Phareans, at a diſtance, ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered on him their javelins and ſpears, until at length, pierced in the breaſt and on the arms, the imprudent hero fell.</p>
               <p>His troops, when they perceived his alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſituation, poured furiouſly on to his aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but they arrived too late, they found their general dead.</p>
               <p>They did not now give way to grief, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted themſelves entirely to reſentment; they deſperately charged the retreating enemy, routed them, and covered the plain with the numbers of the ſlain; more than three thouſand of the tyrant's troops fell in this engagement.</p>

This action of Pelopidas has been much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by ſome eminent hiſtorians very juſtly, and we would in vain plead his youth, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and natural averſion to tyranny, as excuſes ſufficient for his raſhneſs.

               <p>The Theſſalians, in whoſe ſervice he had been ſlain, deeply ſenſible of their obligations to him, and ſhedding tears of genuine regret over his fate, requeſted from the Thebans the honor of his burial—This mark of affection they could not deny—The funeral of Pelopidas was celebrated with magnificence and woe—

The tears of two countries were ſhed in fond remembrance over his tomb—the one of which he raiſed from ſlavery to the empire of Greece, and the other he protected from the ravages and cruelties of the tyrant of Pheroe.</p>
               <p>Thebes was not content with only lamenting the death of Pelopidas, for the immediately ſent an army againſt Alexander, which ſtripped him of his conqueſts in Theſſaly, and ſubjected him to the Theban power.

               <p>The Thebans, deprived of one of their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, ſtill retained their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence, and flouriſhed under the conduct of Epaminondas. At that time almoſt all Greece was involved in war and confuſion.</p>
               <p>The people of Tegea ſent a meſſenger to Thebes, imploring their aſſiſtance againſt the Mantineans; the Mantineans, on their ſide, called for the aid of the Athenians and Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin.</note>

               <p>The former gave the ſole command of the war to Epaminondas. He marched with his troops into Arcadia, and encamped at Tegea.
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:028973_0348_0FDDCA66C411E690"/>
While he remained there, he was informed, that Ageſilaus, at the head of his army, had ſet out from Sparta with a deſign of meeting him. Upon this he formed a plan of taking Sparta herſelf by ſurprize—In the night, unknown to the Mantineans, he marched for Sparta, by a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent road from that which Ageſilaus had taken. His enterpriſing ſpirit would have met with ſucceſs, and the city would have fallen into his hands, had not a Cretan, by ſome ſecret means, become acquainted with the intention, and, with amazing celerity, arrived time ſufficient at Ageſilaus's head-quarters to acquaint him with the danger of Sparta.</p>
               <p>The king inſtantly diſpatched a courier to Sparta, and, by a haſty march, arrived there in a ſhort time himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Thebans, ſoon after his arrival, were perceived croſſing the Eurotas. Epaminondas, when he had drawn his men up on the other ſhore, ſaw that his deſign had been diſcovered; but, having proceeded thus far, he thought it a diſgrace to retire without making any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or performing ſome action after his tireſome march.

Agefilaus, and his ſon Archidamus, fought with aſtoniſhing talour—They fought with the fury of deſpair—They ſaw that the fate of Sparta, once the glory of Greece, depended upon theſe exertions—Archidamus, outſtripping the old age of his father, ſhone in this battle with extraordinary glory! It was to him that Sparta was indebted for her preſervation—With a band of Spartan youths, he ruſhed forward againſt the enemy, and drove before him all whom he attacked.</p>
               <p>The Theban chief, having failed of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſuſpecting that the aſſiſtance of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians would every minute arrive at Sparta, and knowing that he had not a ſufficient force to ſtand againſt ſuch numbers, returned to Tegea, having performed what never general did before.</p>
               <p>The troops of the enemy, conſiſting of Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, Lacedemonians, Athenians, and allies, ſoon after marched in purſuit of him.</p>
               <p>Epaminondas regretted that his troops were to be brought ſo ſoon to action, after having
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:028973_0350_0FDDCA672B7430F8"/>
undergone ſo much fatigue—But, conſidering the diſgrace and inconvenience of a retreat, he ordered his army to prepare for battle.</p>
               <p>In all the civil wars of Greece, the Greeks had never before fought with ſuch numerous armies.

               <p>Epaminondas ranged the Thebans and the Arcadians of Tegea on the left—upon the right the Argives, and his other allies in the centre: The cavalry of each were poſted before the wings—He marched in the ſame order in which he intended to fight, that he might not looſe time in the diſpoſition of his army, when he came up with the enemy—He marched ſlowly along upon the hills, with his circuit extended, as if he did, not intend to fight that day—When he arrived to a certain part of the mountain, he commanded his men to halt, and lay down their arms, pretending that he intended to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp there—The enemy, who wondered at
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:028973_0351_0FDDCA798BD80B20"/>
his curious movements, now thought it evident that he had laid aſide all intentions of coming to an engagement that day—they abandoned their ranks and arms, diſperſed themſelves about the field, and baniſhed all thoughts of battle for that time..</p>
               <p>Epaminondas ſeized this opportunity, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable to his deſign—he ſuddenly, by wheeling to the right, changed his column into a line of battle—his troops became immediately formed in the order which he meant to fight—His left wing conſiſted of the flower of his army, which he formed as at Leuctra, in the ſhape of a wedge—The centre and right wing were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of troops in whom he placed but little confidence—He ordered theſe to move very ſlow, and to make a halt before they came up with the enemy, ſo that he might firſt attack the enemy before theſe engaged.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Lacedemonians were amazed when they ſaw the Thebans thus advancing terrible againſt them—they inſtantly ſnatched their arms, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled their horſes, and flew to their ranks.</p>
               <p>The Theban horſe, ordered by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, attacked thoſe of the Lacedemonian,
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:028973_0352_0FDDCA6A396C5528"/>
and obliged them, after a fierce engagement, to ſeek ſhelter behind the infantry.</p>
               <p>Epaminondas, purſuing cloſe this advantage, attacked with vigour the Spartan phalanx—No troops ever fought on each ſide with more deſperate bravery—they ſoon broke the ſpears with which they firſt contended, and graſped with fury the more durable ſword—A dreadful ſlaughter continued on both ſides for a long ſpace of time.</p>
               <p>Epaminondas thought it his duty to obtain the victory by making an extraordinary effort in perſon—He put himſelf at the head of a ſmall band of dauntleſs Thebans, and made a bold charge upon the enemy, in that part where they were moſt ſucceſsful—He cut to pieces the firſt ranks, and dangerouſly wounded their general: His band,. animated by his example, drove all before them, and penetrated the dreadful pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx—Diſmayed by the appearance of Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas in ſo furious a manner, the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians gave ground—The whole Theban army ſaw the exploits of their general, and grew more deſperate in their exertions—The enemy retreated before them with great ſlaughter:—The god-like Theban did not live to enjoy his

victory ſo gloriouſly obtained—Some of the moſt reſolute Spartans, feeing, as they fled, his great ardour in the purſuit, ſuddenly rallied, and made a ſtand—they let fly a ſhower of ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velins, aimed with great ſkill at Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das—whilſt he endeavored to avoid thoſe, and ſtill, with undaunted heroiſm, ſpurſued his victory, Callicrates, a young Spartan, with a javelin pierced him mortally in the breaſt; the wood of the weapon ſnapped, and the iron con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued buried in the wound—he fell upon the ground in excrutiating tortures. The enemy, informed of this circumſtance, returned again to the engagement, and fought with great cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to obtain the body of Epaminondas—The Thebans, like tygers, defended their beloved hero, routed their foes, and bore him from the bloody field—With him retired the ſoldiers' vigor and courage; they felt no deſire to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue their glorious victory, ſince bereft of their leader, whom they ſuppoſed no more. The cavalry, who had defeated the enemy's horſe with much ſlaughter, returned ſorrowful and dejected from the purſuit, as if they had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a defeat. In the right wing the Athenian cavalry, finding themſelves not purſued, after

               <p>The Lacedemonians and Athenians pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the victory was theirs, becauſe they had cut in pieces a detachment—But the Thebans, with much more juſtice, claimed it, ſince they had defeated the enemy's right wing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained maſters of the field—Both ſides erected trophies, and refuſed to aſk permiſſion of the other to inter the dead; for this, with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, was the acknowledgement of a defeat—The Lacedemonians, however, finding their claims feeble and fruitleſs, ſent firſt to demand this degrading occupation.</p>
