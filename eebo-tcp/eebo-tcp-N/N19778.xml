            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
               <p>THE general deſign of theſe pages is to offer ſome curſory remarks on the preſent ſtate of religion among a great part of the polite and the faſhionable; not only among that deſcription of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who, whether from diſbelief, or whatever other cauſe, avowedly neglect the duties of Chriſtianity; but among
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:025845_0008_0FCF414657ED1770"/>
that more decent claſs alſo, who, while they acknowledge their belief of its truth by a public profeſſion, and are not inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to any of its forms, yet exhibit little of its ſpirit in their general temper and conduct: to ſhew that Chriſtianity, like its divine Author, is not only <hi>denied</hi> by thoſe who in words diſown their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to its authority; but <hi>betrayed</hi> by ſtill more treacherous diſciples, even while they ſay, <hi>Hail, Maſter!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this viſible declenſion of piety va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reaſons have been aſſigned, ſome of which however do not ſeem fully adequate to the effects aſcribed to them. The author of a late popular pamphlet<note n="*" place="bottom">Hints to an Aſſociation, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note> has accounted for the increaſed profliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>common people,</hi> by aſcribing it, very juſtly, to the increaſed diſſoluteneſs of their ſuperiors: and who will deny that the general conduct of high and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:025845_0009_0FCF414E2D86A1F0"/>
low, receives a deep tincture of depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity from the growing neglect of public worſhip? I muſt however take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to diſſent from his opinion as to the cauſe of that neglect; and to ſuſpect that the too common deſertion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of rank from the ſervice of the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment is not occaſioned, in general by their diſapprobation of the Liturgy; but that the far greater part of them are deterred from going to church, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives far removed from ſpeculative ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and conſcientious ſcruples.</p>
               <p>Far be it from me to enter the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant and boundleſs fields of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy; an enterpriſe for which it would be hard to ſay whether I have leſs ability or inclination. Far be it from me to ſtand forth the fierce champion of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, or the prejudiced advocate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025845_0010_0FCF414FAA693D20"/>
its inſtitutions without idolatry, and acknowledge its imperfections without palliation.</p>
               <p>But the difference of opinion here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated is not ſo much about the Liturgy itſelf, as its imagined effects in thinning the pews of our people of faſhion. The ſlighteſt degree of obſervation ſeems to contradict this aſſertion: thoſe however who maintain the other opinion may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy their doubts, by enquiring whether the regular and ſyſtematic abſenters from the church are chiefly to be found among the thinking, the reading, the ſpeculative, and the ſcrupulous part of mankind.</p>
               <p>Even the moſt negligent attendant on public worſhip muſt know, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious creed, to whoſe malignant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency this general deſertion is aſcribed, is never read above three or four Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days in the year; and that does not ſeem
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025845_0011_0FCF4151E1F2A4B0"/>
a very adequate reaſon for baniſhing the moſt ſcrupulous and tender conſciences from church on the other eight-and-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Sundays.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there is one teſt which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely unequivocal—it is never read at all in the <hi>afternoon,</hi> any more than the Litany (another great ſource of offence); and yet, with all theſe multiplied reaſons for their attendance, that is a ſeaſon when the pews of the faſhionable world are not <hi>remarkable</hi> for being crowded.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, is it not pretty evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the general quarrel (with ſome few exceptions) of thoſe who habitually abſent themſelves from public worſhip, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

With ſuch, to reform the Prayer Book would go but a little way, unleſs the New Teſtament could be alſo abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025845_0012_0FCF4153272B6B88"/>
Chriſtianity itſelf will be found full of formidable objections. With ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors, it would avail but little that the Church ſhould give up her abſtruſe creeds, unleſs the Bible would expunge thoſe rigorous laws, which not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit ſinful actions, but corrupt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And, to ſpeak honeſtly, I do not ſee how ſuch perſons as habitually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the laws of virtue and ſobriety, and who yet are men of acute ſagacity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffect this author's very benevolent and chriſtian wiſh.</p>
               <p>For religious duties are often neglected, upon more conſiſtent grounds than the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025845_0013_0FCF41549BA750B0"/>
friends of religion are willing to allow. They are often diſcontinued, not as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the underſtanding, not as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive to the judgment, but as hoſtile to a licentious life. And when a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man, after entering into a ſolemn convention, finds that he is living in a conſtant breach of every article of the treaty he has engaged to obſerve; one cannot much wonder at his getting out of the hearing of the heavy artillery which he knows is planted againſt him, and againſt every one who lives in an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed infraction of the covenant.</p>
               <p>A man of ſenſe, who ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the truth of the doctrine, would find himſelf obliged to ſubmit to the force of the precept. It is not eaſy to be a comfortable ſinner; without trying, at leaſt, to be a confirmed unbeliever. The ſmalleſt remains of faith would embitter a life of libertiniſm; and to him who
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025845_0014_0FCF41561697B8D0"/>
retains any impreſſion of Chriſtianity, the wildeſt feſtivals of intemperance will be converted into the terrifying feaſt of Damocles: the ſuſpended ſword may every moment fall.</p>
               <p>That many a worthy nonconformiſt is kept out of the pale of the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by ſome of the cauſes noticed in the pamphlet in queſtion, cannot be doubted; and that many candid mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Eſtabliſhment regret the cauſes which exclude the others, cannot be denied. But theſe are often ſober thinkers, ſerious enquirers, conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reaſoners; whoſe object is truth, and who ſpare no pains in ſearch of what they take to <hi>be</hi> truth. But that the ſame objections baniſh the great and the gay, is not equally evident. Thanks to the indolence and diſſipation of the times, it is not dogmas or doctrines, it is not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract reaſoning or puzzling propoſitions,

it is not perplexed argument or intricate metaphyſics, which can now diſincline from Chriſtianity; ſo far from it, they cannot even allure to unbelief. Infidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity itſelf, with all that ſtrong and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bias which paſſion and appetite have in its favour, if it appear in the grave and ſcholaſtic form of ſpeculation, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, or philoſophical deduction, may lie almoſt as quietly on the ſhelf as its moſt able antagoniſt; and the cobwebs are almoſt as ſeldom bruſhed from Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes as from Hooker. No: prudent ſcepticiſm has wiſely ſtudied the temper of the times, and ſkilfully felt the pulſe of this relaxed and indolent age. It pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently accommodated itſelf to the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing character, when it adopted ſarcaſm inſtead of reaſoning, and preferred a ſneer to an argument. It diſcreetly judged, that, if it would now gain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, it muſt ſhew itſelf under the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching

               <p>Philoſophy therefore (as Unbelief, by a patent of its own creation, has lately been pleaſed to call itſelf) will not do nearly ſo much miſchief to the preſent age, as its great apoſtles intended: ſince it requires time, application, and patience

to peruſe the reaſoning veterans of the ſceptic ſchool; and theſe are talents not now very ſeverely devoted to ſtudy of any ſort, by thoſe who give the law to faſhion; eſpecially ſince, as it was hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, the ſame principles may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on cheaper terms, and the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of being philoſophers obtained without the ſacrifices of pleaſure for the ſeverities of ſtudy; ſince the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of our literary chemiſts has extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſpirit from the groſs ſubſtance of the old unvendible poiſon, and exhibited it in the volatile eſſence of a few ſprightly ſayings.</p>
               <p>If therefore, in this voluptuous age, when a frivolous and relaxing diſſipation has infected our very ſtudies, infidelity will not be at the pains of deep reſearch and elaborate inveſtigation, even on ſuch ſubjects as are congenial to its affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is vain to expect that chriſtianity

               <p>Will it then be uncharitable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that the leading evil, not which thins our churches (for that is not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On this practical irreligion it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to offer a few hints. After at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ſhew, by a compariſon with the religion of the great in preceding ages, that there is a viſible decline of piety
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025845_0019_0FCF416477E60B18"/>
among the higher ranks—that even thoſe more liberal ſpirits who neglect not many of the great duties of benevolence, yet hold the ſeveral obligations of piety in no eſteem—I ſhall proceed, to remark on the notorious <hi>effects</hi> of the decay of this religious principle, as it corrupts our mode of education, infects our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic conduct, ſpreads the contagion downwards among ſervants and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and influences our manners, habits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and converſation.</p>
               <p>But what it is here propoſed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to inſiſt on is, that this defect of religious principles is almoſt equally fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, whether it appear in the open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all ſacred inſtitutions, or under the more decent veil of external obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, unſupported by ſuch a conduct as is analogous to the chriſtian profeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:025845_0020_0FCF4165DAE9B5A0"/>
I ſhall proceed with a few remarks on a third claſs of faſhionable characters, who profeſs to acknowledge chriſtianity as a perfect ſyſtem of morals, while they deny its divine authority: and conclude with ſome ſlight animadverſions on the opinion which theſe maintain, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is the whole of religion.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, however, that manners and principles act reciprocally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

For inſtance—the increaſed relaxation of morals, produces the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed neglect of infuſing religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the education of youth: which effect becomes, in its turn, a cauſe; and in due time, when that cauſe comes to operate, helps on the decline of manners.</p>

               <p>IF the general poſition of this little tract be allowed, namely, that religion is at preſent in no very flouriſhing ſtate among thoſe, whoſe example, from the high ground on which they ſtand, guides and governs the reſt of mankind: it will not be denied by thoſe, who are ever ſo ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially acquainted with the hiſtory of our country, that this has not always been the caſe.

—that there has been a <hi>moral revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> in the national manners and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, very little analogous to that great <hi>political</hi> one of which we hear ſo much; that our public virtue bears little propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our public bleſſings, and that our religion had decreaſed in a pretty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act proportion to our having ſecured the means of enjoying it.</p>
               <p>That the antipodes to wrong are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever right, was very ſtrikingly illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated about the middle of the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, when the fiery and indiſcreet, zeal of one party was made a pretext for the profligate impiety of the other; who, to the bad principle which dictated a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved conduct, added the bad taſte of being proud of it:—when even the leaſt abandoned were abſurdly apprehenſive that an appearance of decency might ſubject them to the charge of fanaticiſm, a charge in which they took care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve

               <p>It was not till piety was thus unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately brought into diſrepute, that perſons of condition thought it made their ſincer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, their abilities, or their good breeding queſtionable, to appear openly on the ſide of religion.

Even the prevalence of a liberal and warm philanthropy, is ſecretly ſapping the foundation of chriſtian morals, becauſe

               <p>The ſtrong and generous bias in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of univerſal toleration, noble as the principle itſelf is, has engendered a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous notion that all error is innocent.

Having wiſely and happily freed our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the trammels of human au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, are we not turning our liberty into licentiouſneſs, and wantonly ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling to throw off the <hi>divine</hi> authority too? Freedom of thought is the glory of the human mind, while it is confined within its juſt and ſober limits; but though we are accountable for <hi>opinions</hi> at no earthly tribunal, yet it ſhould be remembered, that thoughts as well as actions are amenable to the bar of God: and though we may rejoice that the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the ſpiritual Procruſtes is ſo far annihilated, that it is no longer thought a proof of the orthodoxy of one man's opinions, that he lop or lengthen thoſe of another till they fit his own meaſure; yet there is ſtill a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard by which not only actions are weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025845_0029_0FCF417E981BDC18"/>
but opinions are judged, and every ſentiment which is clearly inconſiſtent with the revealed will of God, is as much throwing off <hi>his</hi> dominion, as the breach of any of his moral precepts.</p>
               <p>There is then ſurely one teſt by which it is no mark of intolerance to try the principles of men, namely, the <hi>Law and the Teſtimony:</hi> and it is impoſſible not to lament, that while a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit governs our judgment, a purer principle does not ſeem to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our lives. May it not be ſaid, that while we are juſtly commended for thinking charitably of the opinions of others, we ſeem, in return, as if we were deſirous of furniſhing them with an opportunity of exerciſing their can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, by the laxity of principle in which we indulge ourſelves? If the hearts of men are as firmly united to each other by the bond of charity, as

ſome pretend, they could not fail of being united to God alſo, by one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principle of piety, the only certain ſource of all charitable judgment, as well as of all virtuous conduct.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of abiding by the ſalutary precept of <hi>judging no man,</hi> it is the faſhion to exceed our commiſſion, and to fancy every body to be in a ſafe ſtate. But, in forming our notions, we have to chooſe between the Bible and the world, between the rule and the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Where theſe do not agree, it is left to the judgment, of believers at leaſt, by which we are to decide. But we never act, in religious concerns, by the ſame rule of common ſenſe and equitable judgment which governs us on other occaſions. In weighing any commodity, its weight is determined by ſome generally-allowed ſtandard; and if the commodity be heavier or lighter
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025845_0031_0FCF4181B1623640"/>
than the ſtandard weight, we add to or take from it: but we never break, or clip, or reduce the weight to ſuit the thing we are weighing; becauſe the common conſent of mankind has agreed that the one ſhall be conſidered as the ſtandard to aſcertain the value of the other. But, in weighing our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by the ſtandard of the Goſpel, we do juſt the reverſe. Inſtead of bringing our opinions and actions to the <hi>balance of the ſanctuary,</hi> to determine and rectify their comparative deficiencies, we lower and reduce the ſtandard of the ſcripture doctrines till we have accommodated them to our own purpoſes; ſo that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of trying others and ourſelves by God's unerring rule, we try the truth of God's rule by its conformity or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity to our own depraved notions and corrupt practices.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <head>Benevolence allowed to be the reigning virtue, but not excluſively the virtue of the preſent age. Benevolence not the whole of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though one of its moſt characteriſtic features. Whether benevolence proceed from a religious principle, will be more infallibly known by the general diſpoſition of time, fortune, and the common habits of life, than from a few occaſional acts of bounty.</head>
               <p>TO all the remonſtrances and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives of the preceding chapter, there will not fail to be oppoſed that which we hear every day ſo loudly inſiſted on—the decided ſuperiority of the preſent age, in other and better reſpects. It will be ſaid, that even thoſe who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the outward forms of religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit however the beſt proofs of the beſt
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025845_0033_0FCF41849D0DAAF8"/>
principles; that the unparalleled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of charity, of which we are continual witneſſes; that the many ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acts of public bounty, and the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous new and noble improvements in this ſhining virtue, juſtly entitle the preſent age to be called, by way of eminence, <hi>the age of benevolence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is with the livelieſt joy I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the delightful truth. Liberality flows with a full tide through a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand channels. There is ſcarcely a newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper but records ſome meeting of men of fortune for the moſt ſalutary purpoſes. The noble and numberleſs ſtructures for the relief of diſtreſs, which are the ornament and the glory of our metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, proclaim a ſpecies of munificence unknown to former ages. Subſcriptions, not only to hoſpitals, but to various other valuable inſtitutions, are obtained almoſt as ſoon as ſolicited. And who
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025845_0034_0FCF418785B84B60"/>
but muſt wiſh that theſe beautiful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of benevolence may become every day more numerous, and more extended.</p>
               <p>Yet with all theſe allowed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious excellencies, it is not quite clear whether ſomething too much has not been ſaid of the liberality of the preſent age, in a comparative view with that of thoſe ages which preceded it. A gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral alteration of habits and manners has at the ſame time multiplied public boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and private diſtreſs; and it is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a paradox to ſay, that there was probably leſs miſery when there was leſs munificence.</p>
               <p>If an increaſed benevolence now ranges through, and relieves a wider compaſs of diſtreſs; yet ſtill, if thoſe examples of luxury and diſſipation which promote that diſtreſs, are ſtill <hi>more</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025845_0035_0FCF4189160056E8"/>
this makes the good done bear little proportion to the evil promoted. If the miſeries removed by the growth of charity fall, both in number and weight, far below thoſe which are cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the growth of vice and diſorder; if we find, that though bounty is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet, that thoſe corruptions which make bounty ſo neceſſary, are extended alſo, almoſt beyond calculation; if it appear that, though more objects are relieved by our money, yet incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more are debauched by our licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs—the balance perhaps will not turn out ſo decidedly in favour of the times as we are willing to imagine.</p>
               <p>If then the moſt valuable ſpecies of charity is that which prevents diſtreſs by preventing or leſſening vice, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt inevitable cauſe of want; we ought not ſo highly to exalt the bounty of the great in the preſent day,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025845_0036_0FCF418AC7C63FE8"/>
in preference to that broad ſhade of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, patronage, and maintenance, which the wide-ſpread bounty of their forefathers ſtretched out over whole villages, I had almoſt ſaid whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. When a few noblemen in a country, like a few of their own ſtately oaks (paternal oaks! which are not oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſet upon a card), extended their ſheltering branches to ſhield all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood of the foreſt—when there exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a kind of paſſive charity, a negative ſort of benevolence, which did good of itſelf; and without effort, exertion, or expence, performed the beſt functions of bounty, though it did not aſpire to the dignity of its name—it was ſimply this:—great people ſtaid at home; and the ſober pomp, and orderly magnificence of a noble family, reſiding at their own caſtle great part of the year, contributed in the moſt natural way to the mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the poor; and in a good degree
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025845_0037_0FCF418D9661A8F8"/>
prevented that diſtreſs, which it muſt however be thankfully confeſſed it is the laudable object of modern bounty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. A man of fortune might not then, it is true, ſo often dine in public, for the benefit of the poor; but the poor were more regularly and comfortably fed with the abundant crumbs which then fell from the rich man's table. Whereas it cannot be denied that the prevailing mode of living has pared real hoſpitality to the very quick: and, though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark may be thought ridiculous, it is a material diſadvantage to the poor, that the introduction of the modern ſtyle of luxury has rendered the remains of the moſt coſtly table but of ſmall value.</p>
               <p>But even allowing the boaſted ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of modern benevolence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

though the moſt lovely offspring of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, be yet any poſitive proof of the prevalence of religious principles: and whether it is not the faſhion rather to conſider benevolence as a ſubſtitute for chriſtianity, than as an evidence of it.</p>
               <p>For it ſeems to be one of the reigning errors among the better ſort, to reduce all religion into benevolence, and all benevolence into alms-giving. The wide and comprehenſive idea of chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is compreſſed into the ſlender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a little pecuniary relief. This ſpecies of benevolence is indeed a bright gem among the ornaments of a chriſtian; but by no means furniſhes all the jewels of his crown, which derives its luſtre from the aſſociated radiance of every chriſtian grace. Beſides, the genuine virtues are all of the ſame family; and it is only by being ſeen in company with each other, and with Piety their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025845_0039_0FCF419235E001E8"/>
parent, that they are certainly known to be legitimate, for there are ſuch things as even ſpurious virtues.</p>
               <p>But is this the property of the <hi>chriſtian</hi> virtues, that, like all other amiable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame family, while each is doing its own particular duty, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to the proſperity of the reſt; and the larger the family the better they live together, as no one can advance it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without labouring for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole: thus, no man can be benevolent on chriſtian principles, without ſelf-denial; and ſo of the other virtues: each is connected with ſome other, and all with religion.</p>
               <p>I already anticipate the obvious and hackneyed reply, that "whoever be the inſtrument, and whatever be the motive of bounty, ſtill the poor are equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and therefore the end is the ſame." And it muſt be confeſſed, that thoſe
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025845_0040_0FCF419641DBA1B8"/>
compaſſionate hearts, who cannot but be earneſtly anxious that the diſtreſſed ſhould be relieved at any rate, ſhould not too ſcrupulouſly enquire into any cauſe of which the effect is ſo benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Nor indeed will candour ſcrutinize too curiouſly into the errors of any life, of which benevolence will always be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be a ſhining ornament, while it does not pretend to be an atoning vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>Let me not be miſrepreſented, as if I were ſeeking to detract from the value of this amiable feeling; one does not ſurely lower the practice by ſeeking to ennoble the principle; the action will not be impaired by mending the motive: and no one will be likely to give the poor leſs, becauſe he ſeeks to pleaſe God more.</p>
               <p>One cannot then help wiſhing that pecuniary bounty were not only practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025845_0041_0FCF419938F09960"/>
but ſometimes enjoined too, as a redeeming virtue. In many converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I had almoſt ſaid in many chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſermons, it is inſinuated as if a little alms-giving could pay off old ſcores con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by favourite indulgences. This, though often done by well-meaning men to advance the intereſts of ſome preſent pious purpoſe, yet has the miſchievous effect of thoſe medicines which, while they may relieve a local complaint, are yet undermining the general habit.</p>
               <p>That great numbers who are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by ſo high a principle as chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity holds out, are yet truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, without hypocriſy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oſtentation, who can doubt? ſince there are by nature many tender hearts; for did not God make them? and is he not the Author of all that is good in nature, as well as in grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:025845_0042_0FCF419C81830620"/>
But who that feels the beauty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, can avoid being ſolicitous, not only that its offerings ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the receiver, but return in bleſſings to the boſom of the giver, by ſpringing from ſuch motives, and being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by ſuch a temper as ſhall redound to his eternal good? For that the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is the ſame to the object, whatever be the character of the benefactor, is but an uncomfortable view of things to a real chriſtian, whoſe compaſſion reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the ſouls of men. Such an one longs to ſee the charitable giver as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as he is endeavouring to make the object of his bounty; but ſuch an one knows that no happineſs can be fully and finally enjoyed but on the ſolid ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of chriſtian piety.</p>
               <p>For as religion is not, on the one hand, merely an opinion or a ſentiment; ſo neither is it, on the other, merely an
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:025845_0043_0FCF419D6157B888"/>
act or a performance, but it is a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, a habit, a temper: it is not a name, but a nature: it is a turning the whole mind to God; a concentration of all the powers and affections of the ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one ſteady point, an uniform deſire to pleaſe <hi>Him.</hi> This deſire will naturally and neceſſarily manifeſt itſelf, in our doing all the good we can to our fellow-creatures in every poſſible way; for it will be found that neither of the two parts into which practical religion is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, can be performed with any degree of perfection but by thoſe who unite both: as it may be queſtioned if any man really <hi>does</hi> 
                  <q>love his neighbour as himſelf,</q> who does not firſt endeavour to "love God with all his heart." As genius has been defined to be ſtrong general powers of mind accidentally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſome particular purſuit; ſo piety may be denominated a ſtrong ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diſpoſition of the heart to every
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:025845_0044_0FCF41A27B6AB180"/>
thing that is right, breaking forth into every excellent action, as the occaſion preſents itſelf. The temper muſt be ready in the mind, and the whole heart muſt be prepared and trained to every act of virtue to which it may be called out. For religious principles are like the military exerciſe; they keep up an habitual ſtate of preparation for actual ſervice; and by never relaxing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, the real chriſtian is ready for every duty to which he may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Right actions beſt prove the exiſtence of religion in the heart; but they are evidences, not cauſes.</p>
               <p>Whether therefore a man's charitable actions proceed from religious principle, he will be beſt able to aſcertain by ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinizing into what is the general diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his time and fortune; and by attending to ſuch an habitual regulation of his pleaſures and expences as will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:025845_0045_0FCF41A36DC03FF0"/>
him to be more or leſs uſeful to others.</p>
               <p>For it is in vain that he may poſſeſs, what is called by the courteſy of faſhion <hi>the beſt heart in the world</hi> (a character we every day here applied to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and the prodigal), if he ſquander his time and eſtate in ſuch a round of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant indulgencies, and thoughtleſs diſſipation, as leaves him little money and leſs leiſure for nobler purpoſes. It makes but little difference whether a man is prevented from doing good by hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted parſimony, or an unprincipled extravagance; the ſtream is equally cut off.</p>
               <p>The mere <hi>caſual</hi> benevolence of any man can have little claim to ſolid eſteem; nor does any charity deſerve the name which does not grow out of a ſteady conviction that it is his bounden duty, which does not ſpring from a ſettled pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:025845_0046_0FCF41A4E37531B8"/>
to obey the whole will of God; which is not therefore made a part of the general plan of his conduct; and which does not lead him to order the whole ſcheme of his affairs with an eye to it.</p>
               <p>He therefore who does not habituate himſelf to certain interior reſtraints, who does not live in a regular courſe of ſelf-renunciation, will not be likely often to perform acts of beneficence, when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes neceſſary to convert to ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes any of that time or money which appetite, temptation or vanity ſolicit him to divert to other purpoſes.</p>
               <p>And ſurely he who ſeldom ſacrifices one darling indulgence, who does not ſubtract one gratification from the inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant round of his enjoyments, when the indulgence would obſtruct his capacity of doing good, or when the ſacrifice would enlarge his power, does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:025845_0047_0FCF41A683A3BF58"/>
the name of benevolent. And for ſuch an unequivocal criterion of charity to whom are we to look, but to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious chriſtian? No other ſpirit but that by which he is governed, can ſubdue ſelf-love: and where ſelf-love is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant paſſion, benevolence can have but a feeble, or an accidental dominion.</p>
               <p>Now if we look around and remark the exceſſes of luxury, the coſtly diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the intemperate diſſipation in which numbers of profeſſing chriſtians indulge themſelves, can any ſtretch of candour, can even that tender ſentiment by which we are enjoined "to hope" and to "believe all things," enable us to hope and believe that ſuch are actuated by a ſpirit of chriſtian benevolence, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe we ſee them perform ſome caſual acts of charity, which the ſpirit of the world can contrive to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely compatible with a voluptuous
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:025845_0048_0FCF41A7DF7FE378"/>
life, and the coſt of which, after all, bears but little proportion to that of any one vice, or even vanity?</p>
               <p>Men will not believe that there is hardly any one human good quality which will know and keep its proper bounds, without the reſtraining influence of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principle. There is, for inſtance, great danger leſt a conſtant attention to ſo right a practice as an invariable oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould incline the heart to the love of money. Nothing can effectually counteract this natural propenſity, but the chriſtian habit of devoting thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched expences to ſome good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and then oeconomy, inſtead of narrowing the heart, will enlarge it, by inducing a conſtant aſſociation of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with frugality. An habitual atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the wants of others, is the only wholeſome regulator of our own expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and carries with it a whole train of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:025845_0049_0FCF41A95A7306D0"/>
virtues, diſintereſtedneſs, ſobriety, and temperance. And thoſe who live in the cuſtom of levying conſtant taxes on their vanities for ſuch purpoſes, ſerve the poor ſtill leſs than they ſerve themſelves, by cultivating ſuch habits as make the beſt qualification for their final happineſs.</p>
               <p>Thus when a vein of chriſtianity runs through the whole maſs of a man's life, it gives a new value to all his actions, and a new character to all his views. It tranſmutes prudence and oeconomy into chriſtian virtues; and every offering that is preſented on the altar of charity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes truly conſecrated, when it is the gift of obedience, and the price of ſelf-denial. Piety is the fire from heaven, which can alone kindle the ſacrifice, and make it acceptable.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, when any act of bounty is performed by way of compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with one's Maker, either as a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025845_0050_0FCF41ABEF40E4B0"/>
or an expiation of unallowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies; though even in this caſe, God (who makes all the paſſions of men ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his good purpoſes) can make the gift equally beneficial to the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: yet it is ſurely not too ſevere to ſay, that to the giver ſuch acts are an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded dependance, a deceitful refuge, a broken ſtaff.</p>

To imply this, would be indeed to betray a lamentable ignorance of human nature, of the diſorder ſin has introduced, of the inefficacy of human means, and entirely to miſtake the genius of our religion.

owned, that early ſobriety, early know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of religion, and early habits of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are the moſt probable means of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the favour of God. To acquire theſe, is putting ourſelves in the way in which he himſelf has told us his bleſſing is to be found.</p>
               <p>But religion is the only thing in which we ſeem to look for the end, without making uſe of the means: and yet, it would not be more ſupriſing if we were to expect that our children ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come artiſts and ſcholars, without being bred to arts and languages, than it is to look for a chriſtian world, without a chriſtian education.</p>
               <p>The nobleſt objects can yield no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, if there be not in the mind a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to enjoy them, ariſing from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of their nature, and a rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for their value, which can only
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:025845_0053_0FCF41B671645D08"/>
ſpring from long habit and early acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. For to produce any capacity of enjoyment, there muſt be a congruity between the mind and the object. To the mathematician demonſtration is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; to the philoſopher the ſtudy of nature; to the voluptuous the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his appetite; to the poet the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his imagination. Theſe objects they all reſpectively purſue as their prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er buſineſs, as pleaſures adapted to that part of their nature which they have been accuſtomed to indulge and cultivate.</p>
               <p>Now, as men will be apt to act conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with their general views and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual tendencies, would it not be abſurd to expect that the philoſopher ſhould look for his ſovereign good at a ball, or the ſenſualiſt in the pleaſures of intellect or piety? None of theſe ends are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the general views of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective purſuer; they are not correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:025845_0054_0FCF41B795593D90"/>
to his ideas; they are not commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to his aims. The ſublimeſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures can afford little gratification where a previous taſte has not been cultivated. A clown, who ſhould hear a ſcholar or an artiſt talk of the delights of a library, a picture gallery, or a concert, could not gueſs at the nature of the pleaſures they afford; nor would his being introduced to them give him much clearer ideas, becauſe he would bring to them an eye blind to proportion, an underſtanding new to ſcience, and an ear deaf to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>Shall we expect then, ſince men can only be ſcholars by ſedulous labour, that they ſhall be chriſtians by mere chance? Shall we be ſurpriſed if thoſe do not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the offices of religion, who are not trained to an acquaintance with them? And will it not be obvious, that it muſt be ſome other thing beſides the abſtruſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               <p>Since amuſements of ſome kind are neceſſary to all ages (I ſpeak now with an eye to mere human enjoyment,) why ſhould it not be as proper to tether man as other animals? Why ſhould not he too be confined, in different ſtages of life, to certain reſtricted limitations? ſince nothing but experience ſeems to teach him, that if he be allowed to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate his future poſeſſions, and trample all the flowery fields of real, as well as imaginary and artificial enjoyment, he not only induces preſent diſguſt, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces and deſtroys all the rich materials of his future happineſs; and leaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for the reſt of his life, nothing but ravaged fields and barren ſtubble.</p>

But the great and radical defect, and that which comes more immediately within the preſent deſign, ſeems to be, that in general the characteriſtical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of chriſtianity are not early and ſtrongly infuſed into the mind: that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is rather taught incidentally, as a thing of ſubordinate value, than as the leading principle of human actions, and the great animating ſpring of human con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Were the high influential princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the chriſtian religion anxiouſly and early inculcated, we ſhould find that thoſe lapſes from virtue, to which paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and temptation afterwards too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſolicit, would be more eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable.</p>
               <p>For though the evil propenſities of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len nature, and the bewitching allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of pleaſure, will too often ſeduce even thoſe of the beſt education into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious paths, yet we ſhall find that men

               <p>The errors occaſioned by the violence of paſſion may be reformed, but ſyſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic wickedneſs will be only fortified by time; and no decreaſe of ſtrength, no decay of appetite, can weaken the power of a pernicious principle. He who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a wrong action indeed, puts himſelf out of the path of ſafety; but he who adopts a falſe principle, not only throws himſelf into the enemy's country, but burns the ſhips, breaks the bridge, cuts off every retreat by which he might hope one day to return into his own.</p>
               <p>Surely it will ſubject no one to the imputation of bigotry or enthuſiaſm, if he venture to enquire whether the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:025845_0060_0FCF41CA2738C580"/>
doctrines of chriſtianity are made the ſtandard by which our young men of faſhion are commonly taught to try their principles, or to weigh their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or whether ſome more popular ſtandard, of cuſtom, or faſhion, or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opinion, be not too frequently allowed to ſuperſede them? Whether ſome idol of falſe honour be not conſecrated for them to worſhip? Whether, even among the better ſort, reputation be not held out as a motive of ſufficient energy to produce virtue, in a world where yet the greateſt vices are every day practiſed openly, which do not at all obſtruct the reception of thoſe who practiſe them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beſt company? Whether reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be not ennobled, and pride, and many other paſſions, erected into hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable virtues—virtues not leſs repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the genius and ſpirit of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than obvious groſs vices? Will it be
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:025845_0061_0FCF41CD63C2C130"/>
thought impertinent to enquire if the awful doctrines of a perpetually preſent Deity, and a future righteous judgment, are early impreſſed, and laſtingly engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, on the hearts and conſciences of our high-born youth?</p>
               <p>Perhaps, if there be any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in which we fall remarkably below the politer nations of antiquity, it is in that part of education which has a refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to purity of mind, and the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the heart.</p>
               <p>For the great ſecret of religious edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and which ſeems baniſhed from the preſent practice, conſiſts in training young men to an habitual interior re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, an early government of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and a courſe of ſelf-controul over thoſe tyrannizing inclinations, which have ſo natural a tendency to enſlave the human heart. Without this habit of moral reſtraint, which is one of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:025845_0062_0FCF41D029B32FA8"/>
laws of chriſtian virtue, though men may, from natural temper, often <hi>do</hi> good, yet it is perhaps impoſſible that they ſhould ever <hi>be</hi> good. Without the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous exerciſe of this controuling prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the beſt diſpoſitions, and the moſt amiable qualities, will go but a little way towards eſtabliſhing a virtuous charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For the beſt diſpoſitions will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily overcome by the concurrence of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and temptation, in a heart where the paſſions have not been accuſtomed to this wholeſome diſcipline: and the moſt amiable qualities will but more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily betray their poſſeſſor, unleſs the yielding heart be fortified by repeated acts, and long habits, of reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>In this, as in various other inſtances, we may bluſh at the ſuperiority of Pagan inſtitution. Were the Roman youth taught to imagine themſelves always in the awful preſence of Cato, in order to
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:025845_0063_0FCF41D12380D248"/>
habituate them betimes to ſupreſs baſe ſentiments, and to excite ſuch as were generous and noble? And ſhould not the chriſtian youth be continually reminded, that a greater than Cato is here? Should they not be trained to the habit of acting under the conſtant impreſſion, that <hi>He</hi> to whom they muſt one day be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for intentions, as well as words and actions, is witneſs to the one as well as the other; that he not only is "about their paths," but "underſtands their very thoughts?"</p>
               <p>Were the diſciples of a Pagan<note n="*" place="bottom">Pythagoras.</note> lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er taught that it was a motive ſufficient to compel their obedience to any rule, whether they liked it or not, that it had the authority of their teacher's name? were the bare words, <hi>the maſter hath ſaid it,</hi> ſufficient to ſettle all diſputes, and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:025845_0064_0FCF41D29FCF14E8"/>
to ſubdue all reluctance? And ſhall the ſchollars of a more divine teacher, who have a code of laws written by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, be contented with a lower rule, or abide by a meaner authority? And is any argument drawn from human conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations likely to operate more forcibly on a dependant being, than that ſimple but grand aſſertion, with which ſo many of the precepts of our religion are introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—Becauſe, THUS SAITH THE LORD?</p>
               <p>For it is doing but little, in the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of firſt principles, to obtain the bare aſſent of the underſtanding to the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one Supreme Power, unleſs the heart and affections go along with the conviction, by our conceiving of that power as intimately connected with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. A feeling temper will be but little affected with the cold idea of a <hi>geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical</hi> God, as the excellent Paſcal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, who merely adjuſts all the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025845_0065_0FCF41DA5C2CEFB8"/>
parts of the matter, and keeps the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in order. Such a mind will be but little moved, unleſs he be taught to conſider his Maker under the intereſting and endearing repreſentation which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed religion gives of him. That "God is," will be to him rather an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming than a conſolatory idea; till he be perſuaded of the ſubſequent propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that "he is the rewarder of all ſuch as diligently ſeek him." Nay, if natural religion does even acknowledge one awful attribute, that "God is juſt;" it will only increaſe the terror of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſcience, till he learn, from the fountain of truth, that he is, "the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of all who believe on him."</p>
               <p>But if the great ſanctions of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are not deeply engraven on the heart, where ſhall we look for a more adequate curb to the fiery ſpirit of youth? For, let the elements be ever ſo kindly
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:025845_0066_0FCF41DBB5C7BB10"/>
mixed in a human compoſition, let the natural temper be ever ſo amiable, ſtill whenever a man ceaſes to think himſelf an accountable, being what motive can he have for reſiſting a ſtrong temptation to a preſent good, when he has no dread that he ſhall thereby forfeit a greater future good?</p>
               <p>But it will be objected, that this deep ſenſe of religion would interfere with the general purpoſes of education, which is deſigned to qualify men for the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of human life, and not to train up a race of monks and aſcetics.</p>
               <p>There is however ſo little real ſolidity in this ſpecious objection, that I am firmly perſuaded, that if religious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were more deeply impreſſed on the heart, even the things of this world would be much better carried on. For where are we to look for ſo much punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality, diligence, application, doing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:025845_0067_0FCF41DE9E6B1C00"/>
thing in its proper day (the great hinge on which buſineſs turns), as among men of principle? Oeconomy of time, truth in obſerving his word, never daring to deceive or to diſappoint—theſe are the very eſſence of a man of buſineſs; and for theſe to whom ſhall we moſt natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look? Who is ſo little likely to be "ſlothful in buſineſs," as he who is "fervent in ſpirit?" Will not he be moſt regular in dealing with men, who is moſt diligent in "ſerving the Lord?"</p>
               <p>But, it may be ſaid, allowing that religion does not neceſſarily ſpoil a man of <hi>buſineſs,</hi> yet it would effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat thoſe accompliſhments, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract that fine breeding, which eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſtitute the <hi>gentleman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This again is ſo far from being a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequence, that, ſuppoſing all the other real advantages, of parts and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:025845_0068_0FCF41E0266AF218"/>
education, to be equally taken into the account, there is no doubt but that, in point of true politeneſs, a real chriſtian would beat the world at its own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, the world itſelf being judge.</p>
               <p>For though it muſt be confeſſed, that, in the preſent ſtate of things, other wickedneſs has made diſſimulation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and that being the caſe, there is ſcarcely any one invention for which we are more obliged to mankind than for that of politeneſs, as there is perhaps no ſcreen in the world which hides ſo many ugly ſights: yet while we allow that there never was ſo admirable a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to real goodneſs, as good breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is however certain that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of chriſtianity put into action, would neceſſarily produce more genuine politeneſs than any maxims drawn from motives of human vanity or convenience. If <hi>love, peace, joy, long-ſuffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:025845_0069_0FCF41E1F1275020"/>
patience, goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>meekneſs</hi> may be thought inſtruments to produce ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of manners, theſe we are expreſsly told are "the fruits of the Spirit." If mourning with the afflicted, rejoicing with the happy, if "to eſteem others better than ourſelves;" if "to take the loweſt room;" if "not to ſeek our own;" if "not to behave ourſelves unſeemly;" if "not to ſpeak great ſwelling words of vanity"—if theſe are amiable, engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and polite parts of behaviour; then would the documents of Saint Paul make as true a fine gentleman as the <hi>Courtier of Caſtiglione,</hi> or even the <hi>Letters of Lord Cheſterfield</hi> himſelf. Then would ſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and diſſimulation, and all the nice ſhades and delicate gradations of paſſive and active deceit, be rendered ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and the affections of every heart be won by a ſhorter and a ſurer way, than by the elegant obliquities of this
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:025845_0070_0FCF41E5B2369D40"/>
late popular preceptor; whoſe miſchiefs have out lived his reputation; and who, notwithſtanding the preſent juſt declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his fame, has helped to relax the general nerve of virtue, and has left a taint upon the public morals, of which we are ſtill ſenſible.</p>
               <p>That ſelf-abaſement then, which is inſeparable from chriſtianity, and the external ſigns of which good breeding knows ſo well how to aſſume; and thoſe charities which ſuggeſt invariable kindneſs to others, even in the ſmalleſt things, would, if left to their natural workings, produce that gentleneſs which it is one great object of a polite educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to imitate. They would produce it too without effort and without exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for being inherent in the ſubſtance, it would naturally produce itſelf on the ſurface.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:025845_0071_0FCF41EA3292EA28"/>
For however uſeful the inſtitution of poliſhed ſociety may be found, yet they can never alter the eternal difference between right and wrong; or convert appearances into realities; they cannot transform decency into virtue, nor make politeneſs paſs for principle. And the advocates for faſhioable breeding, ſhould be humbled to reflect, that every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of artificial manners was invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to <hi>cure,</hi> but to <hi>conceal,</hi> deformity: that though the ſuperficial civilities of elegant life, tend to make this cortupt world a more tolerable place than it would be without them; yet they never will be conſidered as a ſubſtitute for truth and virtue by HIM who is to paſs the definitive ſentence on the characters of men.</p>
               <p>Among the many prejudices which the young and the gay entertain againſt religion, one is, that it is the declared
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:025845_0072_0FCF41EC3B12C5B0"/>
enemy to wit and genius. But, ſays one of its wittieſt champions<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. South<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>, "Piety en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins no man to be dull:" and it will be found, on a fair enquiry, that though it cannot be denied that irreligion has had able men for its advocates, yet they have never been the moſt able. Nor can any learned profeſſion, any depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in letters or in ſcience, produce a champion on the ſide of unbelief, but chriſtianity has ſtill a greater name to oppoſe it; philoſophers themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judges.</p>
               <p>But while the young adopt an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, from one claſs of writers, that religious men are weak; they acquire, from another, a notion that they are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous: and this opinion, by mixing itſelf with their common notions, and deriving itſelf from their very amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025845_0073_0FCF41EE5CA947C0"/>
is the more miſchievous as it is received without reſiſtance or ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>One common medium through which they take this falſe view is, thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite works of wit and humour, ſo captivating to youthful imaginations, where no ſmall part of the author's ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs perhaps has been owing to his dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly introducing a pious character, with ſo many virtues, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible not to love him, yet tinctured with ſo many abſurdities, that it is impoſſible not to laugh at him. The reader's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory will furniſh him with too many inſtances of what is here meant. The ſlighteſt touches of a witty malice can make the beſt character ridiculous. It is effected by any little aukwardneſs, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind, an obſolete phraſe, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal pronunciation, a peculiarity of geſture. Or if ſuch a character be brought, by unſuſpecting goodneſs, and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025845_0074_0FCF41F123926E18"/>
truſting honeſty, into ſome fooliſh ſcrape, it will ſtamp an impreſſion of ridicule ſo indelible, that all his worth ſhall not be able to efface it: and the young who do not always ſeparate their ideas very carefully, ſhall ever after, by this early and falſe aſſociation, conceive of piety as having ſomething eſſentially ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in itſelf.</p>
               <p>But one of the moſt infallible arts, by which the inexperienced are engaged on the ſide of irreligion, is, that popular air of candour, good nature, and tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which it ſo invariably puts on. While, on the one hand, ſincere piety is often accuſed of moroſeneſs and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, becauſe it cannot hear the doctrines on which it founds its eternal hopes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided without emotion; indifference or unbelief, on the other hand, purchaſe the praiſe of candour at an eaſy price, becauſe they neither ſuffer grief, nor
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:025845_0075_0FCF41F2DA24C790"/>
expreſs indignation, at hearing the moſt awful truths ridiculed, or the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn obligations ſet at nought.</p>
               <p>The ſcoffers whom young people hear talk, and the books they hear quoted, falſely charge their own injurious opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on chriſtianity, and then unjuſtly accuſe her of being the monſter they have made. They dreſs her up, with the ſword of perſecution in one hand, and the flames of intolerance in the other; and then ridicule the ſober-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for worſhipping an idol which their miſrepreſentation has rendered as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant as Moloch. In the mean time, they affect to ſeize on benevolence with excluſive appropriation as their own cardinal virtue, and to accuſe of a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otted cruelty, that narrow ſpirit which points out the perils of licentiouſneſs, and the terrors of a future account. And yet this benevolence, with all its
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:025845_0076_0FCF41F49A6C4C28"/>
tender mercies, is not afraid nor aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to endeavour at ſnatching away from humble piety, the comfort of a preſent hope, and the bright proſpect of a felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that ſhall have no end. It does not however ſeem a very probable means of adding to the ſtock of human happineſs, by plundering mankind of that principle, by the deſtruction of which friendſhip is robbed of its bond, ſociety of its ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, patience of its motive, morality of its foundation, integrity of its reward, ſorrow of its conſolation, life of its balm, and death of its ſupport.</p>
               <p>It will not perhaps be one of the meaneſt advantages of a better ſtate, that as the will ſhall be reformed, ſo the judgment ſhall be rectified; that "evil ſhall no more be called good," nor the "churl liberal;" nor the plunderer of our beſt poſſeſſion, or principles, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent. Then it will be evident that
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:025845_0077_0FCF41FB2EB18D60"/>
greater violence could not be done to truth and language, than to wreſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence from chriſtianity, her moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate and peculiar attribute. If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence be "good-will to men," it was that which angelic meſſengers were not thought too high to announce, nor a much higher being than angels too great to teach by his precepts, and to illuſtrate by his death: it was the crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, the very watch-word as it were, by which he intended his religion and his followers ſhould be diſtinguiſhed "By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if ye love one another." Beſides, it is the very genius of chriſtianity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate all ſelfiſhneſs, on whoſe vacated ground, benevolence naturally and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily plants itſelf.</p>
               <p>But not to run through all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which obſtruct the growth of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in young perſons, I ſhall only name
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:025845_0078_0FCF41FE7A8BBB60"/>
one more. They hear much declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the faſhionable reaſoners, againſt the contracted and ſelfiſh ſpirit of chriſtianity—that it is of a ſordid tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, works for pay, and looks for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>But this jargon of French philoſophy, which prates of pure diſintereſted good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, acting for its own ſake, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpiſing puniſhment and diſdaining recompence, indicates as little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of human nature, as of chriſtian revelation, when it addreſſes man as a being made up of pure intellect, without any mixture of paſſions, and who can be made happy without hope, and virtuous without fear.</p>
               <p>A creature hurried away by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of ſome impetuous inclination, is not likely to be reſtrained (if he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained at all) by a cold reflection on the
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:025845_0079_0FCF42011FEF2008"/>
beauty of virtue. If the dread of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and the incurring his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpleaſure, cannot ſtop him, how ſhall a weaker motive do it? When we ſee that the powerful ſanctions which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion holds out, are too often an ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual curb: to think of attaining the ſame end by feebler means, is as if one ſhould expect to make a watch go the better by breaking the main ſpring; nay, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as if the philoſopher who inculcates the doctrine, ſhould undertake with one of his fingers to lift an immenſe weight, which had reſiſted the powers of the crane and the lever.</p>
               <p>On calm and temperate ſpirits indeed, in the hour of retirement, in the repoſe of the paſſions, in the abſence of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, virtue does ſeem to be her own ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate reward; and very lovely are the fruits ſhe bears, in preſerving health, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and fortune. But on how few will
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025845_0080_0FCF42029807BFA8"/>
this principle act! and even on them, how often will its operation be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! And though virtue for her own ſake, might have captivated ſofter hearts, which almoſt ſeem caſt in a natural mould of goodneſs; yet no motive could, at all times, be ſo likely to reſtrain even theſe, under the preſſure of temptation, as this ſimple aſſertion—<hi>For all this, God will bring me into judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is the beauty of our religion, that it is not held out excluſively to a few ſelect ſpirits; that it is not an object of ſpeculation, or an exerciſe of ingenuity, but a <hi>rule of life,</hi> ſuited to every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, capacity, and temper. It is the glory of the chriſtian religion to <hi>be,</hi> what it was, the glory of every pagan inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>not</hi> to be, the <hi>religion of the people;</hi> and that which conſtitutes its characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtic value, is its ſuitableneſs to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, condition, and neceſſities of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>

For with whatever obſcurities it has pleaſed God to ſhadow ſome parts of his written word, yet he has graciouſly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that whatever is neceſſary ſhould be perſpicuous alſo: and though "clouds and darkneſs are the habitation of his throne," yet they are not the medium through which he has left us to diſcover our duty. In this, as in all other points it has a decided ſuperiority over all the ancient ſyſtems of philoſophy, which were always in many reſpects impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable and extravagent, becauſe not fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from obſervations drawn from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge "of what was in men." Whereas the whole ſcheme of the Goſpel is accommodated to real human nature; laying open its mortal diſeaſe, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its only remedy; exhibiting rules of conduct, often difficult indeed, but but never impoſſible; and where the rule was ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

to elucidate the doctrine, and to illuſtrate the precept: offering every where the cleareſt notions of what we have to hope, and what we have to fear; the ſtrongeſt injunctions of what we are to believe; and the moſt explicit directions of what we are to do.</p>

               <head>Other ſymptoms of the decline of chriſtianity—No family religion—Corrupt or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent examples of ſuperiors—The ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying and evangelic virtues held in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt—Neglect of encouraging and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting religion among ſervants.</head>
               <p>IT was by no means the deſign of the preſent undertaking to make a general invective on the corrupt ſtate of manners, or even to animadvert on the conduct of the higher ranks, but inaſmuch as the corruption of that conduct, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of thoſe manners, appear to be a natural conſequence of the viſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of religion.</p>
               <p>Of the other obvious cauſes which contribute to this decline of morals little will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="78" facs="unknown:025845_0084_0FCF420A2049F5F0"/>
of primitive manners. This is too lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally an age of gold, to expect that it ſhould be ſo in the poetical and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe. It would be unjuſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd not to form our opinions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from the preſent general ſtate of ſociety. And it would argue great ignorance of the corruption which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and conqueſt, and riches, and arts neceſſarily introduce into a ſtate, to look for the ſame ſober-mindedneſs, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and purity among the <hi>dregs of Romulus,</hi> as the ſevere and ſimple man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere of elder Rome preſented.</p>
               <p>But though it would be an attempt of deſperate hardihood, to controvert that maxim of the witty bard, that
<q>To mend the world's a vaſt deſign;</q>
yet to make the beſt of the times in which we live; to fill up the meaſure of our own particular, and individual duties; and to take care that the age ſhall

not be the worſe for our having been caſt into it, ſeems to be the bare dictate of common probity, and not a romantic flight of impracticable perfection.</p>
               <p>But is it then ſo very chimerical to imagine that the benevolent can be ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-minded? Is it romantic to deſire that the good ſhould be conſiſtent? Is it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to fancy that what has once been practiſed, ſhould not now be impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible then not to help re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretting that it ſhould be the general temper of many of the leading perſons of that age which arrogates to itſelf the glorious character of the <hi>age of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> to be kind, and conſiderate, and compaſſionate, every where rather than at home: that the rich and the faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhould be zealous in promoting reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, as well as charitable inſtitutions
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025845_0086_0FCF4213AD711E20"/>
abroad, and yet diſcourage every thing which looks like religion in their own families: that they ſhould be at a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable expence in inſtructing the poor at a diſtance, and yet diſcredit piety a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their own ſervants—thoſe more immediate objects of every man's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whom Providence has enabled to keep any; and for whoſe conduct he will be finally accountable, inaſmuch as he has helped to corrupt it.</p>
               <p>Is there any degree of pecuniary boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without doors which can counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract the miſchief of a wrong exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at home; or atone for that infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious laxity of principle, which ſpreads corruption wherever its influence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends? Is not he the beſt benefactor to ſociety who ſets the beſt example, and who does, not only the moſt good, but the leaſt evil? Will not that man, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever liberal, very imperfectly promote
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:025845_0087_0FCF2CBC0EA21030"/>
virtue in the world at large, who neglects to diſſeminate the principles of it within the immediate ſphere of his own perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al influence, by a ſober conduct and a blameleſs behaviour? Can a generous but profligate perſon atone by his purſe for the diſorders of his life, or expect a bleſſing on his bounties, while he defeats their effect by a profane converſation?</p>
               <p>In moral as well as political treatiſes, it is often aſſerted, that it is a great evil to do no good: but it has not been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps enough inſiſted on, that it is a great good to do no evil. This ſpecies of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not oſtentatious enough for popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar declamation; and the value of this abſtinence from vice is perhaps not well underſtood by chriſtians, becauſe it wants the oſtenſible brilliancy of actual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
               <p>But as the <hi>principles</hi> of chriſtianity are in no great repute, ſo their concomitant
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:025845_0088_0FCF42190562BD08"/>
                  <hi>qualities,</hi> the evangelical virtues, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably diſeſteemed. But thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret habits of ſelf-controul, thoſe interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and unobtruſive virtues, which excite no aſtoniſhment, kindle no emulation, and extort no praiſe, are yet the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and the moſt ſublime, and, if chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity be true, will be the moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly accepted by <hi>him</hi> who witneſſes the ſecret ſtruggle and the ſilent victory: while the ſplendid deeds, which have the world for their witneſs, and immortal ſame for their reward, ſhall perhaps coſt him who atchieved them, leſs than it coſts a conſcientious chriſtian to ſubdue one irregular inclination; a conqueſt which the world will never know; and if it did, would probably deſpiſe.</p>
               <p>For though great actions performed on human motives are permitted, by the great Diſpoſer, to be equally benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to ſociety with ſuch as are performed
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025845_0089_0FCF4219DC6107A8"/>
on purer principles; yet it is an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſideration, that, at the final adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of accounts, the politician that <hi>raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> a ſtate, or the hero who <hi>preſerved</hi> it, may miſs of that favour of God, which, if it was not his motive, will probably not be his reward. And it is awful to reflect, as we viſit the monuments juſtly raiſed by public gratitude, or the ſtatues properly erected by well-earned admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on what may be now the unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition of the illuſtrious object of theſe deſerved honours; and that he who has ſaved a ſtate, may have loſt his own ſoul.</p>
               <p>A chriſtian life ſeems to conſiſt of two things, almoſt equally difficult; the adoption of good habits, and the exciſion of ſuch as are evil. No one ſets out on a religious courſe with a ſtock of native innocence, or actual freedom from ſin; for there is no ſuch ſtate in human life.
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:025845_0090_0FCF421B750C6DD8"/>
The natural heart is not a blank paper, whereon the divine ſpirit has nothing to do but to ſtamp characters of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but many blots and defilements are to be eraſed, as well as freſh impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be made.</p>
               <p>The vigilant chriſtian therefore, who acts with an eye to the approbation of his Maker, rather than to that of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; to a future account, rather than to preſent glory; will find, that, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to cultivate the "unweeded gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den" of his own heart; to mend the ſoil; to clear the ground of its indigenous vices, by practiſing the painful buſineſs of extirpation; will be that part of his duty which will coſt him moſt labour, and bring him leaſt credit: while the fair flower of one ſhewy action, produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with little trouble, and of which the pleaſure is reward enough, ſhall gain him more praiſe than the eradication of the
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:025845_0091_0FCF421E9A0F5B30"/>
rankeſt weeds which over-run the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heart.</p>
               <p>But the Goſpel judges not after the manner of men; for it never fails to make the abſtinent virtues a previous ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>p to the right performance of the operative ones; and the relinquiſhing what is wrong to be a neceſſary prelude to the performance of what is right. It makes "ceaſing to do evil" the indiſpenſable preliminary to "learning to do well." It continually ſuggeſts that ſomething is to be laid aſide as well as to be practiſed. We muſt "hate vain thoughts" before we can "love God's law." We muſt lay aſide "malice and hyprocriſy," to <hi>enable</hi> us "to receive the ingrafted word."—Having "a conſcience void of offence;" abſtaining from fleſhly luſts," "bringing every thought into obedience"—theſe are actions, or rather negations, which, though they never will obtain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025845_0092_0FCF42203583F768"/>
from the chiſel of the ſtatuary, the declamation of the hiſtorian, or the panegyric of the poet, ſerve however to conſtitute the true chriſtian temper, to promote heavenly mindedneſs, and to procure the divine favour.</p>
               <p>And for our encouragment, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable that a more difficult chriſtian virtue generally involves an eaſier one. An habit of ſelf-denial in permitted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures eaſily induces a victory over ſuch as are unlawful. And to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>it looſe to our own poſſeſſions, neceſſarily includes an exemption from coveting thoſe of others; and ſo on of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Will it be difficult then to trace back to that want of early reſtraint noticed in the preceding chapter, that licence of behaviour which, having been indulged in youth, afterwards reigns uncontrouled in families; and having infected educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:025845_0093_0FCF4225E3135308"/>
in its firſt ſprings, taints all the ſtreams of domeſtic virtue? Nor is it ſtrange that that ſame want of religious principle which corrupted our children, ſhould corrupt our ſervants.</p>
               <p>We ſcarcely go into any company with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing ſome invective againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed profligacy of this order of men; and the remark is made with as great an air of aſtoniſhment, as if the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the complaint were not as viſible as the <hi>truth</hi> of it. It would be endleſs to point out inſtances in which the increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſſipation of their betters (as they are oddly called) has contributed to the growth of this evil. But it comes only within the immediate deſign of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent undertaking, to inſiſt on the ſingle circumſtance of the almoſt total exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of religion in faſhionable fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as a cauſe, adequate of itſelf, to

any conſequences which depraved mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als can produce.</p>
               <p>Is there not a degree of injuſtice in perſons who diſcover ſtrong indignation at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe crimes which crowd our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and furniſh our inceſſant executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and yet diſcourage not an internal principle of vice; ſince thoſe crimes are nothing more than that principle put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to action? And it is no leſs abſurd than cruel in ſuch of the great as lead diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly lives, to expect to prevent vice by the laws they make to reſtrain or puniſh it, while their own example is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſource of temptation to commit it. If by their own practice they demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that they think a vicious life is the only happy one, with what colour of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice can they inflict penalties on others, who, by acting on the ſame principle, expect the ſame indulgence?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:025845_0095_0FCF4228D7A58B08"/>
And indeed it is ſomewhat unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to expect very high degrees of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and probity from a claſs of people whoſe whole life, after they are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into diſſipated families, is one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued counteraction of the principles in which they have probably been bred.</p>
               <p>When a poor youth is tranſplanted from one of thoſe excellent inſtitutions<note n="*" place="bottom">Charity Schools.</note> which do honour to the preſent age, and give ſome hope of reforming the next, into the family, perhaps, of his noble benefactor, who has provided liberally for his inſtruction; what muſt be his aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at finding the manner of life to which he is introduced diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that life, to which he has been taught that ſalvation is alone annexed! He has been trained in a wholeſome ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of gaming; but now his intereſts and paſſions are forcibly engaged on the ſide
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:025845_0096_0FCF422A90975468"/>
of play, ſince the very profits of his place are made <hi>ſyſtematically</hi> to depend on the card-table. He has been taught that it was his bounden duty to be devoutly thankful for his own ſcanty meal, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of barley bread; yet he ſees his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lord ſit down every day,
<q>Not to a dinner, but a hecatomb;</q>
               </p>
               <p>To a repaſt for which every element is plundered, and every climate impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; for which nature is ranſacked, and art is exhauſted; without even the formal ceremony of a ſlight acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It will be lucky for the maſter, if his ſervant does not happen to know that even the pagans never ſat down to a repaſt without making a libation to their deities; and that the Jews did not eat a little fruit, or drink a cup of water, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an expreſſion of devout thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Next to the law of God, he has been taught to reverence the law of the land;
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:025845_0097_0FCF422D454FA268"/>
and to reſpect an act of parliament next to a text of Scripture: yet he ſees his honourable protector, publicly in his own houſe, engaged in the evening in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a game expreſly prohibited by the laws, and againſt which perhaps he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had aſſiſted in the day to paſs an act.</p>
               <p>While the contempt of religion was confined to wits and philoſophers, the effect was not ſo ſenſibly felt. But we cannot congratulate the ordinary race of mortals on their emancipation from old prejudices, or their indifference to ſacred uſages; as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is not at all viſible that the world is become happier in proportion as it is become more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened. We might rejoice more in the boaſted diffuſion of light and freedom, were it not apparent that bankruptcies are grown more frequent, robberies more common, divorces more numerous, and forgeries more extenſive—that more
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:025845_0098_0FCF6400B663D018"/>
rich men die by their own hand, and more poor men by the hand of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner—than when chriſtianity was practiſed by the vulgar, and countenanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at leaſt, by the great.</p>
               <p>Is it not to be regretted therefore, while the affluent are encouraging ſo many admirable ſchemes for promoting religion among the children of the poor, that they do not like to <hi>perpetuate</hi> the principle, by encouraging it in their ſervants alſo? Is it not pity, ſince theſe are ſo moderately furniſhed with the good things of this life, to rob them of that bright reverſion, the bare hope of which is a counterpoiſe to all the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips they undergo here—eſpecially ſince by diminiſhing this future hope, we ſhall not be likely to add to their preſent uſefulneſs?</p>
               <p>Still allowing, what has been already granted, that abſolute infidelity is not
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:025845_0099_0FCF2D010D20E6A0"/>
the reigning evil, and that ſervants will perhaps be more likely to ſee religion neglected than to hear it ridiculed; would it not be a meritorious kindneſs, in families of a better ſtamp, to furniſh them with more opportunities of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and practiſing their duty? Is it not impolitic indeed, as well as unkind, to refuſe them any means of having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on their conſciences the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive principles of chriſtianity? It is but little, barely not to <hi>oppoſe</hi> their going to church, or doing their duty at home, unleſs their opportunities of doing both are facilitated, by giving them, at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeaſons, as few employments as poſſible that may interfere with both. Even when religion is by pretty general conſent baniſhed from our families, that only furniſhes a ſtronger reaſon why our families ſhould not be baniſhed from religion in the churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="unknown:025845_0100_0FCF2D0286EE71D0"/>
But if theſe opportunities are not made eaſy and convenient to them, their ſuperiors have no right to expect from them a zeal ſo far tranſcending their own as to induce them to ſurmount difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the ſake of their duty. Religion is never once repreſented in ſcripture as a light attainment; it is never once il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by an eaſy, a quiet, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent allegory. On the contrary, it is exhibited under the active figure of a combat, a race; ſomething expreſſive of exertion, activity, progreſs. And yet many are unjuſt enough to think that this warfare can be fought, though they are perpetually weakening the vigour of the combatant; this race be run, though they are inceſſantly obſtructing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of him who runs by ſome hard and interfering command. That that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate judge who cannot but be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly touched with the feeling of
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:025845_0101_0FCF2D0B82300F00"/>
                  <hi>their</hi> infirmities, will tenderly allow for their trials, and be merciful to their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, can never be doubted, but what portion of that forgiveneſs he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to thoſe who lay on their virtue hard burdens "too heavy for them to bear," who ſhall ſay?</p>
               <p>To keep any immortal being in a ſtate of ſpiritual darkneſs, is a poſitive diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>His</hi> law, who when he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Bible, no leſs than when he created the material world, ſaid, <hi>Let there be light.</hi> It were well for both the advantage of maſter and ſervant, that the latter ſhould have the doctrines of the Goſpel frequently impreſſed on his heart, that his conſcience ſhould be made familiar with a ſyſtem which offers ſuch clear and intelligible propoſitions of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duty. The ſtriking interrogation, "how ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?" will perhaps ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:025845_0102_0FCF2D0F39D494A8"/>
as forcibly on an uncultivated mind, as the moſt eloquent eſſay, to prove that man is not an accountable being. That once credited promiſe, that "they who have done well ſhall go into everlaſting life," will be more grateful to the ſpirit of a plain man, than that more elegant and diſintereſted aphoriſm, that <hi>virtue is its own reward.</hi> That "he that walketh uprightly walketh ſurely," is not on the whole dangerous or a miſleading maxim. And "well done, good and faithful ſervant! I will make thee ruler over many things," though offenſive to the liberal ſpirit of philoſophic dignity, is a comfortable ſupport to humble and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering piety. That "we ſhould do to others as we would they ſhould do to us," is a portable and compendious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſocial duty, always at hand, as always referring to ſomething within himſelf, not amiſs for a poor man to carry conſtantly about with him, who
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:025845_0103_0FCF2D1004960AB0"/>
has neither time nor learning to ſearch for a better. All Seneca's arguments againſt the fear of death, never yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled one reader to its approach, half ſo effectually as the humble believer is reconciled to it by that ſimple perſuaſion, "I know that my Redeemer liveth."</p>
               <p>While the modern philoſopher is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the boundaries of human know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by undertaking to prove that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is eternal; or enlarging the ſtock of human happineſs, by demonſtrating the extinction of ſpirit: it can do no harm to an unlettered man to believe, that "heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but God's word ſhall not paſs away." While the former is indulging the profitable enquiry why the Deity made the world ſo late, or why he made it at all, it will not hurt the latter to believe that "in the beginning God made the world," and that in the end "he ſhall judge it
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:025845_0104_0FCF2D568C3AD430"/>
in righteouſneſs." While the one is cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſing the creed, he will be no loſer by encourageing the other to keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
               <p>For it is a very valuable part of chriſtianity, that though it is an entire and perfect ſyſtem in its deſign; though it exhibits one great plan, from which complete trains of argument, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected ſchemes of reaſoning, may be deduced; yet, in compaſſion to the multitude, for whom this benevolent inſtitution was in a good meaſure deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and who could not have compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended a long chain of propoſitions, or have embraced remote deductions; the moſt important truths of doctrine, and the moſt eſſential documents of virtue, are detailed in ſingle maxims, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in ſhort ſentences; independent of themſelves, yet making a neceſſary part of a conſummate whole, from a few
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:025845_0105_0FCF2D5916331EE8"/>
of which elementary principles, the whole train of human virtues has been deduced, and many a perfect body of ethics has been framed.</p>

               <head>The negligent conduct of chriſtians, no real objection againſt chriſtianity.—The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why its effects are not more manifeſt to worldly men, is, becauſe believers do not lead chriſtian lives.—Profeſſors dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer but little in their practice from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers.—Even real chriſtians are too diffident and timid, and afraid of acting up to their principles.—The abſurdity of the charge commonly brought againſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people, that they are too ſtrict.</head>
               <p>IT is an objection frequently brought againſt chriſtianity, that if it exhibited ſo perfect a ſcheme, if its influences

               <p>That vice and immorality prevail in no ſmall degree, in countries profeſſing chriſtianity, we need not go out of our own to be convinced. But that this is the caſe only becauſe this benign prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is not ſuffered to operate in its full power, will be no leſs obvious to all who are ſincere in their enquiries. For, if we allow (and who that examines impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="unknown:025845_0107_0FCF2D7848CF3FC0"/>
principle, which prevents them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſo.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are acquainted with the effects it actually produced in the firſt ages of the church, when it <hi>was</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its genuine purity, and when it <hi>did</hi> operate without obſtruction, from its <hi>followers</hi> at leaſt, will want no other proof of its inherent power and efficacy. At that period, its moſt decided and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious enemy, the emperor Julian, could recommend the <hi>manners</hi> of the Galileans to the imitation of his pagan high prieſt; though he himſelf, at the ſame time, was doing every thing which the moſt inveterate malice, ſharpened by the acuteſt wit, and backed by the moſt abſolute power, could deviſe, to diſcredit their doctrines.</p>
               <p>Nor would the efficacy of chriſtianity be leſs viſible now, in influencing the conduct of its profeſſors, if its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:025845_0108_0FCF2D7A809EC488"/>
were heartily and ſincerely received They would operate on the conduct ſo effectually, that we ſhould ſee morals and manners growing out of principles, as ſpontaneouſly and neceſſarily as we ſee other conſequences grow out of their proper and natural cauſes. Let but this great ſpring have its unobſtructed play, and there would be little occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt this exceſs, or that enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. If the ſame ſkill and care which are employed in curing ſymptoms, were vigorouſly levelled at the internal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the diſeaſe, the moral health would feel the benefit. If that attention which is beſtowed in lopping the redundant and unſightly branches were devoted to the cultivation of a found and uncorrupt root, the effect of this labour would ſoon be diſcovered by the excellence of the fruits.</p>

For though even in the higheſt poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exertion of religious principle, and the moſt diligent practice of all its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential train of virtues, man would ſtill find evil propenſities enough, in his fallen nature, to make it neceſſary that he ſhould counteract them, by keeping alive his diligence after higher attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to quicken his aſpirations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a better ſtate; yet the prevailing temper would be in general right, the will would be in a great meaſure rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the heart, feeling and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the diſeaſe, would apply itſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to the only remedy. For though even the beſt men have infirmities enough to deplore, and feel more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly than others, the imperfection of that veſſel in which their heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is hid: theſe however have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conſolation of knowing that they

ſhall have to reckon with one who "knoweth whereof they are made;" who will accept of faith and repentance inſtead of ſinleſs perfection, and of humble ſincerity in lieu of entire holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>All the heavy charges which have been brought againſt religion, have been taken from the abuſes of it. In every other inſtance the injuſtice of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding would be notorious: but there is a general want of candour in the judgment of men on this ſubject, which we do not find them exerciſe on other occaſions; that of throwing the fault of the erring or ignorant profeſſor on the profeſſion itſelf.</p>
               <p>It does not derogate from the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able profeſſion of arms, that there are cowards and braggarts. If any man loſe his eſtate by the chicanery of an attorney,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:025845_0111_0FCF2D7FC4A53968"/>
or his health by the blunder of a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, it is commonly ſaid, that the one was a diſgrace to his buſineſs, and the other was ignorant of it; but no one therefore concludes that law and phyſic are contemptible profeſſions.</p>
               <p>Chriſtianity alone is obliged to bear all the obloquy incurred by the miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of its followers; to ſuſtain all the reproach excited by ignorant, by fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, by ſuperſtitious, or hypocritical profeſſors. But whoever accuſes it of a tendency to produce the errors of theſe profeſſors, muſt have picked up his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion any where rather than in the New Teſtament, which being the only au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic hiſtory of chriſtianity, is that which candour would naturally conſult for information.</p>
               <p>But as worldly and irreligious men do not draw their notions from that pure fountain, but from the polluted ſtream
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:025845_0112_0FCF2D846DA0F050"/>
of human practice; as they form their judgment of divine truth from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe who pretend to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by it; ſome charitable allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <hi>muſt</hi> be made for the contempt which they entertain for chriſtianity, when they ſee what poor effects it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in the lives of the generality of profeſſing chriſtians. What do they obſerve there which can lead them to entertain very high ideas of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which give birth to ſuch practices?</p>
               <p>Do men of the world diſcover any marked, any decided difference between the conduct of nominal chriſtians, and that of the reſt of their neighbours who pretend to no religion at all? Do they ſee, in the daily lives of ſuch, any great abundance of thoſe fruits by which they have heard believers are to be known? On the contrary, do they not diſcern in them the ſame anxious and unwearied
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:025845_0113_0FCF2D86AD61EB80"/>
purſuit after the things of the earth, as in thoſe who do not profeſs to have any thought of heaven? Do not they ſeem then to labour as ſedulouſly in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of a debaſing and frivolous diſſipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as thoſe who do not pretend to have any nobler object in view? Is there not the ſame eagerneſs to plunge into all ſorts of follies themſelves, and the ſame unrighteous ſpeed in introducing their children to them, as if they had never entered into a ſolemn engagement to renounce them? Is there not the ſame ſelf-indulgence, the ſame luxury, and the ſame paſſionate attachment to the things of this world in them, as is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in thoſe who do not look for another.</p>
               <p>Do not thoughtleſs neglect, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual diſſipation, anſwer, as to ſociety, all the ends of the moſt decided infidelity? Between the barely decent, and the openly profane, there is indeed this
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:025845_0114_0FCF2D883A9880E8"/>
difference; that the one, by making no profeſſion, deceives neither the world, nor his own heart; while the other, by intrenching himſelf in forms, fancies that he does ſomething, and thanks God that "he is not like the publican." The one only ſhuts his eyes upon the danger which the other deſpiſes.</p>
               <p>But theſe unfruitful profeſſors would do well to recollect, that, by a conduct ſo little worthy of their high calling, they not only violate the law to which they have vowed obedience, but occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many to diſbelieve or to deſpiſe it; that they are thus in a great meaſure accountable for the infidelity of others, and of courſe will have to anſwer for more than their own perſonal offences. For did they in any reſpect live up to the principles they profeſs; did they adorn the doctrines of chriſtianity by a life in any degree conſonant to their faith; did
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:025845_0115_0FCF2D8989B4A650"/>
they exhibit any thing of the <q>beauty of holineſs</q> in their daily converſation; they would then give ſuch a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proof, not only of the ſincerity of their own obedience, but of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that divine light by which they profeſs to walk, that the moſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined unbeliever would at laſt begin to think there muſt be <hi>ſomething</hi> in a religion of which the effects were ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and the fruits ſo amiable; and might in time be led to "glorify," not <hi>them,</hi> not the imperfect doers of theſe works, but "their Father which is in heaven." Whereas, as things are at preſent carried on, the obvious conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt be, either that chriſtians do not believe in the religion they profeſs, or that there is not truth in the religion itſelf.</p>
               <p>For will he not naturally ſay, that, if its influences were ſo predominant,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:025845_0116_0FCF2D8C6810C660"/>
its conſequences muſt be more evident? that, if the prize held out were really ſo bright, thoſe who truly believed ſo would ſurely <hi>do</hi> ſomething, and <hi>ſacrifice</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to obtain it?</p>
               <p>This ſwells the amount of the actual miſchief beyond calculation. And there is ſomething terrible in the idea of this ſort of indefinite evil, that the careleſs chriſtian can never know the extent of the contagion he ſpreads, nor the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied infection which <hi>they</hi> may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in <hi>their</hi> turn, whom <hi>his</hi> diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders firſt corrupted.</p>
               <p>And there is this farther aggravation of his offence, that he will not only be anſwerable for the poſitive evil of which his example is the cauſe; but for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all the probable good which might have been called forth in others, had <hi>his</hi> actions been conſiſtent with his
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:025845_0117_0FCF2D8D6942AEE0"/>
profeſſion. What a ſtrong, what an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt irreſiſtible conviction would it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the hearts of unbelievers, if they beheld that characteriſtic difference in the manners of chriſtians, which their profeſſion gives one a right to expect! if they ſaw that diſintereſtedneſs, that humility, ſober-mindedneſs, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſimplicity, and ſincerity, which are the unavoidable fruits of a genuine faith.</p>
               <p>But, while a man talks like a ſaint, and yet lives like a ſinner; while he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to believe like an apoſtle, and yet leads the life of a ſenſualiſt; talks of an ardent faith, and yet exhibits a cold and low practice: boaſts himſelf the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a meek maſter, and yet is as much a ſlave to his paſſions as they who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no ſuch authority; while he appears the proud profeſſor of an humble religion, or the intemperate champion of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:025845_0118_0FCF2D8ECC01BEE8"/>
a ſelf-denying one: ſuch a man brings chriſtianity into diſrepute; confirms thoſe in error who might have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened to conviction; ſtrengthens doubt into diſbelief; and hardens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference into contempt.</p>
               <p>Even among thoſe of a better caſt, and a purer principle, the exceſſive reſtraints of timidity, caution, and that "fear of man, which bringeth a ſnare" confine, and almoſt ſtifle the generous ſpirit of an ardent exertion in the cauſe of religion. Chriſtanity may pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically expoſtulate, that it is not always "an open enemy which diſhonours her," but her "familiar friend." And "what doſt thou more than others?" is a queſtion which even the good and worthy ſhould often aſk themſelves, in order to quicken their Zeal? to prevent the total ſtagnation of unexerted principles, on the one hand; or the danger, on the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:025845_0119_0FCF2D90CFAA8368"/>
other, of their being driven down the gulf of ruin, by the unreſiſted and confluent tides of temptation, faſhion, and example.</p>
               <p>In a very ſtrict and mortified age, of which a ſcrupulous ſeverity was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant character, precautions againſt an exceſſive zeal might and doubtleſs would, be a wholeſome and prudent meaſure. But in theſe times of relaxed principle and frigid indifference, to ſee people ſo vigilantly on their guard againſt the imaginary miſchiefs of enthuſiaſm, while they run headlong into the real perils of a deſtructive licentiouſneſs, puts one in mind of the one-eyed animal in the fable; who, living on the banks of the ocean, never fancied he could be deſtroyed any way but by drowning: but while he kept that one eye conſtantly fixed on the ſea, on which ſide he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all the peril lay, he was devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:025845_0120_0FCF2D94020691E8"/>
by an enemy on the dry land, from which quarter he never ſuſpected any danger.</p>
               <p>Are not the miſchiefs of an enthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic piety inſiſted on, with as much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as if an extravagant devotion were the prevailing propenſity? Is not the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of moderation as vehemently urged, as if an intemperate zeal were the epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic diſtemper of the great world? as if all our apparent danger and natural bias lay on the ſide of a too rigid auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which required the diſcreet and conſtant counteraction of an oppoſite principle? Would not a ſtranger be almoſt tempted to imagine, from the frequent invectives againſt extreme ſtrictneſs, that abſtraction from the world, and a monaſtic rage for retreat, were the ruling temper; that we were in ſome danger in ſeeing our places of diverſion abandoned; and the enthuſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025845_0121_0FCF2D9584B54AB0"/>
ſcenes of the <hi>Holy Fathers of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert</hi> acted over again by the frantic and uncontroulable devotion of our young perſons of faſhion?</p>
               <p>It is ſeriouſly to be regretted, in an age like the preſent, remarkable for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference in religion and levity in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and which ſtands ſo much in need of lively patterns of firm and reſolute piety, that many who really are chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans on the ſobereſt conviction, ſhould not appear more openly and decidedly on the ſide they have eſpouſed; that they aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate ſo very much with the manners of thoſe about them (which manners they yet ſcruple not to diſapprove); and, inſtead of an avowed but prudent ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs, which might draw over the others, appear evidently fearful of being thought preciſe and over-ſcrupulous; and actually ſeem to diſavow their right principles, by conceſſions and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:025845_0122_0FCF2D9768C5A710"/>
not ſtrictly conſiſtent with them. They often ſeem cautiouſly afraid of <hi>doing too much,</hi> and <hi>going too far:</hi> and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous plea, the neceſſity of <hi>living like other people,</hi> of <hi>being like the reſt of the world,</hi> and the propriety of <hi>not being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi> is brought as a reaſonable apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for a too yielding and indiſcriminate conformity.</p>
               <p>But, at a time when almoſt all are ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the prevailing corruption, how beautiful a rare, a ſingle integrity is, let the inſtances of Lot and Noah declare. And to thoſe with whom a poem is an higher authority than the Bible, let me recommend the moſt animated picture of a righteous ſingularity that ever was delineated, in

               <p>Few indeed of the more orderly and decent have any objection to that degree of religion which is compatible with their general acceptance with others, or the full enjoyment of their own pleaſures. For a formal and ceremonious exerciſe of the outward duties of chriſtianity may not only be kept up without exciting cenſure, but will even procure a certain reſpect and confidence; and is not quite irreconcileable with a voluptuous and diſſipated life. So far many go; and ſo far "as godlineſs is profitable to the life that <hi>is,"</hi> it paſſes without reproach.</p>
               <p>But as ſoon as men begin to conſider religious exerciſes not as a decency, but a duty; not as a commutation for a ſelf-denying life, but as a means to promote a holy temper, and a virtuous conduct:
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:025845_0124_0FCF2D9A463E7320"/>
as ſoon as they feel diſpoſed to carry the effect of their devotion into their daily life: as ſoon as their principles diſcover themſelves, by leading them to withdraw from thoſe ſcenes, and abſtain from thoſe actions, in which the gay place their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme happineſs: as ſoon as ſomething is to be <hi>done,</hi> and ſomething is to be <hi>part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with;</hi> then the world begins to take offence, and to ſtigmatize the <hi>activity</hi> of that piety, which had been commended as long as it remained <hi>inoperative,</hi> and had only evaporated in <hi>words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when religion, like the vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, takes its ſeat in the heart, and ſends out ſupplies of life and heat to every part; diffuſes motion, ſoul, and vigour, through the whole circulation; and informs and animates the whole man: when it operates on the practice, influences the converſation, breaks out into a lively zeal for the honour of God,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:025845_0125_0FCF2D9CB544F298"/>
and the beſt intereſts of mankind; then the ſincerity, or the underſtanding, of that perſon will become queſtionable: and it muſt be owing to a very fortunate combination of circumſtances indeed, if he can at once preſerve the character of parts and piety.</p>
               <p>But it is a folly to talk of being too holy, too ſtrict, or too good. Where there happens to appear ſome foundation for the charge of enthuſiaſm (as there are indeed too often in good people ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricities which juſtify the cenſure), we may depend upon it, that it proceeds from ſome defect in the judgment, and not from any exceſs in the piety; for in goodneſs there is no exceſs: and it is as prepoſterous to ſay that any one is too good, or too pious, as that he is too wiſe, too ſtrong, or too healthy; ſince the higheſt point in all theſe is only the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that quality which we admired
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:025845_0126_0FCF2D9DC55D5250"/>
in a lower degree. There may be an <hi>imprudent,</hi> but there cannot be a <hi>ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant</hi> goodneſs. An ardent imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may miſlead a rightly turned heart; and a weak intellect may incline the beſt intentioned to aſcribe too much value to things of comparatively ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Such an one not having diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough to perceive where the force and ſtreſs of duty lie, may innocently diſcredit religion by a too ſcrupulous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs in points of ſmall intrinſic value.</p>
               <p>And even well-meaning men, as well as hypocrites, may think too much is done when their "mint" and "aniſe" are rigorouſly tithed.</p>
               <p>But in obſerving the "weightier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the law," in the practice of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal holineſs, in the love of God, there can be no poſſibility of exceeding, while there is no limitation in the command.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:025845_0127_0FCF2DA2332E1CA0"/>
We are in no danger of loving our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <hi>better</hi> than ourſelves; and let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that we do not go beyond, but fall ſhort of our duty, while we love him <hi>leſs.</hi> If we were commanded to love God with <hi>ſome</hi> of our heart, with <hi>part</hi> of our ſoul, and a <hi>portion</hi> of our ſtrength, there would then be ſome colour for thoſe perpetual cavils about the <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of love, and the <hi>degree</hi> of obedience, which are due to him. But as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is ſo definite, ſo abſolute, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, ſo entire; nothing can be more abſurd than that unmeaning, but not unfrequent charge brought againſt ſerious perſons, that <hi>they are too ſtrict.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The foundation of this ſilly cenſure is commonly laid in the firſt principles of education, where an early ſeparation is ſyſtematically made between duty and pleaſure. One of the firſt baits held out for the encouragement of children, is,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:025845_0128_0FCF2DA3E80623B8"/>
that when they have done their <hi>duty,</hi> they will be entitled to ſome <hi>pleaſure;</hi> thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly disjoining what ſhould be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as inſeparable. And there is not a more common juſtification of that idle and diſſipated manner in which the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond half of the Sunday is commonly ſpent, even by thoſe who make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, of ſpending the former part prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly, than that, "now they have done their duty, they may take their pleaſure."</p>
               <p>But while chriſtian obſervances are conſidered as taſks, which are to be got over to entitle us to ſomething more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; as a burthen which we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in order to propitiate an inexorable Judge, who makes a hard bargain with his creatures, and allows them juſt ſo much amuſement in pay for ſo much drudgery; we muſt not wonder that ſuch low views are entertained of chriſtianity, and that a religious life is reprobated as ſtrict and rigid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="unknown:025845_0129_0FCF2DA589A55C40"/>
But to him who acts from the nobler motive of love, and the animating power of the chriſtian hope, the exerciſe is the reward, the permiſſion is the privilege, the work is the wages. <hi>He</hi> does not carve out ſome miſerable pleaſure, and ſtipulate for ſome meagre diverſion, to pay himſelf for the hard performance of his duty, who in that very performance, experiences the higheſt pleaſure, and feels the trueſt gratification of which his nature is capable.</p>
               <p>This reprobated ſtrictneſs therefore, ſo far from being the ſource of diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and miſery, as is pretended, is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality the true cauſe of actual enjoyment, by laying the axe to the root of all thoſe turbulent and uneaſy paſſions, the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and yet imperfect gratification of which does ſo much more tend to diſturb

our happineſs than that ſelf-government chriſtianity enjoins.</p>
               <p>But all precepts ſeem rigorous, all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances are really hard, where there is not an entire conviction of God's right to our obedience, and an internal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of faith and love to make that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence pleaſant. A religious life is indeed a hard bondage to one immerſed in the practices of the world, the fleſh, and the faſhion. To a perfect chriſtian, it is "perfect freedom." He does not now abſtain from ſuch and ſuch things, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they are forbidden (as he did in the firſt ſtages of his progreſs), but becauſe his ſoul has no longer any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them. And it would be the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of all puniſhments to oblige him to return to thoſe practices, from which he once abſtained with difficulty, and through the leſs noble principle of fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="unknown:025845_0131_0FCF4230548A8B80"/>
There is not therefore perhaps a greater miſtake than that common noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on entertained by the more orderly part of the faſhionable world, that a little religion will make people happy, but that an high degree of it is incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with all enjoyment. For ſurely <hi>that</hi> religion can add little to a man's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which reſtrains him from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a wrong action, but which does not pretend to extinguiſh the bad principle from which the act proceeded. A religion which ties the hands, without changing the heart; which, like the hell of Tantalus, ſubdues not the deſire, yet forbids the gratification, is indeed an uncomfortable ſtate. Such a religion, though it may gain a man ſomething on the ſide of reputation, will give him but little inward comfort, if his heart be ſtill left a prey to that temper which produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the evil, even though terror or ſhame may have prevented the outward act.</p>

                  <pb n="126" facs="unknown:025845_0132_0FCF42329B862098"/>
That people devoted to the purſuits of a diſſipated life ſhould conceive of religion as a difficult and even unattain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtate, it is eaſy to believe. That they ſhould conceive of it as an unhappy ſtate, is the conſummation of their error and their ignorance: for that a <hi>rational</hi> being ſhould have his underſtanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened; that an <hi>immortal</hi> being ſhould have his views extended and enlarged; that a <hi>helpleſs</hi> being ſhould have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of aſſiſtance; a <hi>ſinful</hi> being the proſpect of pardon; or a <hi>fallen</hi> one the aſſurance of reſtoration, does not ſeem a probable ground of unhappineſs; and on any other ſubject ſuch reaſoning would not be admiſſible.</p>

               <head>A ſtranger, from obſerving the faſhionable mode of life, would not take this to be a chriſtian country.—Lives of profeſſing chriſtians examined by a compariſon with the Goſpel.—Chriſtianity not made the rule of life, even by thoſe who profeſs to receive it as an object of faith.—Temporizing divines contribute to lower the credit of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—Looſe harangues on morals not calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to reform the heart.</head>
               <p>THE chriſtian religion is not intended as ſome of its faſhionable profeſſors ſeem to fancy, to operate as a charm, a taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or incantation; and to produce its effect by our pronouncing certain my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical words, attending at certain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated places, and performing certain hallowed ceremonies: but it is an active, vital, influential principle, operating on
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:025845_0134_0FCF423B351DCB28"/>
the heart, reſtraining the deſires, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general conduct, and as much regulating our commerce with the world, our buſineſs, pleaſures, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, our converſations, deſigns and actions, as our behaviour in public worſhip, or even in private devotion.</p>
               <p>That the effects of ſuch a principle are ſtrikingly viſible in the lives and manners of the generality of thoſe who give the law to faſhion, will not perhaps be inſiſted on. And indeed, the whole preſent ſyſtem of faſhionable life is utterly deſtructive of ſeriouſneſs. To inſtance only in one particular amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is generally thought inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, and is in effect ſo vapid, that one almoſt wonders how it can be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: it would excite laughter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſo broken into the habit, were I to inſiſt on the immorality of
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:025845_0135_0FCF423D39BCE628"/>
paſſing one's whole life in a crowd. But thoſe promiſcuous myriads which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſociety, falſely ſo called, of the gay world; who are brought together without eſteem, remain without pleaſure, and part without regret; who live in a round of diverſions, the poſſeſſion of which is ſo joyleſs, though the abſence is ſo inſupportable, theſe, by the mere force of inceſſant and indiſcriminate aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation, weaken, and in time wear out the beſt feelings and affections of the human heart. And the mere ſpirit of diſſipation, thus contracted from inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable habit, even detached from all its concomitant evils, is in itſelf as hoſtile to a religious ſpirit, as more poſitive and actual offences. Far be it from me to ſay that it is as criminal; I only inſiſt that it is as oppoſite to that heavenly mindedneſs which is the offence of the chriſtian temper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:025845_0136_0FCF423F57FC4DF8"/>
We know that in the mingled maſs which celebrate the orgies of diſſipation, are many amiable and well-inclined hearts, whom nothing but the tyranny of faſhion could have driven thither. But let us ſuppoſe an ignorant and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced ſpectator, who ſhould have been taught the theory of all the religions on the globe, brought hither from the other hemiſphere. Set him down in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteſt part of our capital, and let him determine, if he can, except from what he ſhall ſee interwoven in the texture of our laws, and kept up in the ſervice of our churches, to what particular religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we belong. Let him not mix en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely with the moſt flagitious, but only with the moſt faſhionable; at leaſt, let him keep what they themſelves call <hi>the beſt company.</hi> Let him ſcrutinize into the manners, cuſtoms, converſations, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and diverſions, moſt in vogue, and
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:025845_0137_0FCF4240D6D43918"/>
then infer what is the eſtabliſhed religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the land.</p>
               <p>That it could not be the Jewiſh, he would ſoon diſcover; for of rites, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and external obſervances, he would trace but ſlender remains. He would be equally convinced that it could not be the religion of old Greece and Rome; for that enjoined reverence to the Gods, and inculcated obedience to the laws. His moſt probable concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be in favour of the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan faith, did not the exceſſive indulgence of ſome of the moſt diſtinguiſhed, in an article of intemperance prohibited even by the ſenſual Prophet of Arabia, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat that conjecture.</p>
               <p>How would the petrified enquirer be aſtoniſhed, if he were told that all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="132" facs="unknown:025845_0138_0FCF4243A6501330"/>
renewed mind, and non-conformity to the world, were ſpecific diſtinctions!</p>
               <p>When he ſaw the ſons of men of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſcarcely old enough to be ſent to ſchool, admitted to be ſpectators of the turbulent and unnatural diverſions of racing and gaming; and the almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant daughters, even of wiſe and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mothers (an innovation which faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on herſelf forbad till now), carried with moſt unthrifty anticipation to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and late-protracted ball; would he believe that we were of a religion which has required from theſe very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, a ſolemn vow that theſe children ſhould be bred up "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord?"</p>
               <p>When he beheld thoſe nocturnal clubs, ſo ſubverſive of private virtue and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic happineſs, would he conceive that we were of a religion which in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:025845_0139_0FCF4245664B8720"/>
terms "exhorts young men to be ſober-minded?"</p>
               <p>When he ſaw thoſe magnificent and brightly illuminated ſtructures which decorate and diſgrace the very precincts of the royal reſidence (ſo free itſelf from all theſe pollutions;) when he beheld the nightly offerings made to the demon of play, on whoſe cruel altar the fortune and happineſs of wives and children are offered up without remorſe; would he not conclude that we were of ſome of thoſe barbarous religions which enjoin unnatural ſacrifices, and whoſe horrid deities are appeaſed with nothing leſs than human victims? If any thing could add to his aſtoniſhment, it muſt be to obſerve, in ſome more private temples of this demon, that the fair ſacrifice is often a voluntary one, ſelf-offered, and at once both prieſteſs and victim.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:025845_0140_0FCF424700905920"/>
Now, ought we not to pardon our imaginary ſpectator, if he ſhould not at once conclude that all the various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of perſons, above noticed, profeſſed the chriſtian religion; ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to have no other way of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining but by the conformity of their manners to that rule by which he had undertaken to judge them? We indeed ourſelves muſt judge with greater lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and candidly take the preſent ſtate of ſociety into the account; which, in ſome few inſtances perhaps, muſt be allowed to diſpenſe with that literal ſtrictneſs, which more peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the firſt ages of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But as this is really a chriſtian country, profeſſing to enjoy the pureſt faith in the pureſt form; it cannot be unreaſonable to go a little farther, and enquire wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er chriſtianity, however firmly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and generally profeſſed in it, is really
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:025845_0141_0FCF424955797B78"/>
practiſed by that order of faſhionable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who, while they are abſorbed in the delights of the world, and their whole ſouls devoted to the purſuit of pleaſure, yet ſtill arrogate to themſelves the honourable name of chriſtians and occaſionally teſtify their claim to this high character, by a general profeſſion of their belief in, and a decent compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with, the forms of religion.</p>
               <p>This enquiry muſt be made, not by a compariſon with the ſtate of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in other countries (a mode always fallacious, whether adopted by nations or individuals, is that of comparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with thoſe who are ſtill worſe); nor muſt it be made from any notions drawn from cuſtom, decency, or any other human ſtandard; but from a ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture view of what real religion is; from any one of thoſe ſtriking and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive repreſentations of it, which may
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:025845_0142_0FCF4253081C2818"/>
be found condenſed in ſo many ſingle paſſages of the ſacred writings.</p>
               <p>Whoever then looks into the Book of God, and obſerves its prevailing ſpirit, and then looks into that part of the world under conſideration, will not ſurely be thought very cenſorious, if he pronounce that the conformity between them does not ſeem to be <hi>very</hi> ſtriking; and that the one does not very evidently appear to be dictated by the other. Will he diſcover that the chriſtian religion is ſo much as pretended to be made the <hi>rule of life,</hi> even by that decent order who profeſs not to have diſcarded it as an object of faith? Do even the more regular, who neglect not public obſervances, conſider chriſtianity as <hi>the meaſure of their actions?</hi> Do even what the <hi>world</hi> calls religious perſons employ their time, their abilities, and their fortune, as talents for which they however confeſs they believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:025845_0143_0FCF4254ECC8FB28"/>
accountable: or do they in any reſpect live, I will not ſay up to their profeſſion (for what human being does ſo?), but in any conſiſtency with it, or even with an eye to its predominant ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies? Do perſons in general of this deſcription ſeem to conſider the peculiar doctrines of the Goſpel as any thing more than a form of words, neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be repeated, and proper to be believed? But do they conſider them as neceſſary to be adopted into a governing principle of action?</p>
               <p>Is it conſiſtent to declare in the ſolemn aſſemblies that they are "miſerable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders," and that "there is no health in them," and never in their daily lives to diſcover any ſymptom of that humility which ſhould naturally be implied in ſuch a declaration?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="unknown:025845_0144_0FCF4255DC67A6F8"/>
Is it reaſonable, or conſiſtent with good ſenſe, earneſtly to lament having "followed the deſires of their own hearts," and then deliberately to plunge into ſuch a torrent of diſſipations as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indicates that they do not ſtruggle to reſiſt <hi>one</hi> of them? I dare not ſay this is hypocriſy, but ſurely it is inconſiſtency.</p>
               <p>"Be ye not conformed to this world," is a leading principle in the book they acknowledge as their guide. But after unreſiſtingly aſſenting to this, as a doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal truth, at church; how abſurd would they think any one who ſhould expect them to adopt it into their practice! Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the whole law of God does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a ſingle precept more expreſsly, more ſteadily, and more uniformly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. If it mean any thing, it can hardly be conſiſtent with that mode of life emphatically diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of <hi>faſhionable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="unknown:025845_0145_0FCF42579B7E8B30"/>
Now would it be much more abſurd (for any other reaſon but becauſe it is not the cuſtom) if our legiſlators were to meet one day in every week, gravely to read over all the obſolete ſtatutes, and reſcinded acts of parliament; than it is for the order of perſons of the above deſcription to aſſemble every Sunday, to profeſs their belief in, and ſubmiſſion to, a ſyſtem of principles, which they do not ſo much as <hi>intend</hi> ſhall be binding on their practice?</p>
               <p>But to continue our enquiry.—There is not a more common or more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible definition of human duty, than that of "Fear God, and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments." Now, as to the firſt of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable precepts, can we, with the utmoſt ſtretch of charity, be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to conclude that God is really "very greatly feared," in ſecret, by thoſe who give too manifeſt indications that
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:025845_0146_0FCF425C4C8C6ED0"/>
they live "without him in the world?" And as to the latter precept, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally grows out of the other—without noticing any of the flagrant breaches of the moral law, let us only confine our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the allowed, general, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious violation of the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and then enquire what apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy can be offered for this, by believers at leaſt, who ſcruple not to allow the authority of that book, which declares, among many other alarming denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the wilful and habitual offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in any one point is guilty of the breach of the whole law.</p>
               <p>Shall we have reaſon to change our opinion, if we take another divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the ſum and ſubſtance of religion, and apply it as a touchſtone in the preſent trial—"Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c. and thy neighbour as thyſelf?"
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:025845_0147_0FCF425E8E917248"/>
Now, judging by inference, do we ſee many public proofs of that heavenly-mindedneſs which would be the inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect of ſuch a fervent and animated dedication of all the powers, faculties, and affections of the ſoul to him who gave it? And, as to the great rule of ſocial duty expreſſed in the ſecond clauſe, do we obſerve very much of that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate kindneſs, that pure diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that conſcientious attention to the comfort of others, eſpecially of depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and inferiors, which might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from thoſe who enjoy the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of ſo unerring a ſtandard of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct? a ſtandard which, if impartially conſulted, muſt make our kindneſs to others bear an exact proportion to our ſelf-love: a rule in which chriſtian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, operating on human ſenſibility, could not fail to decide aright in every ſuppoſable caſe. For no man can doubt how he ought to act, towards another,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:025845_0148_0FCF63EAF619BB40"/>
while the correſponding ſuggeſtions of conſcience and feeling concur in letting him know how he would wiſh, in a change of circumſtances, that others ſhould act towards him.</p>
               <p>Or ſuppoſe we take a more detailed ſurvey, by a third rule, which indeed is not ſo much the principle as the effect of piety—"True religion, and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to viſit the fatherleſs and widows in their affliction, and to keep himſelf <hi>unſpotted from the world."</hi> Now if chriſtianity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts that obedience to the latter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction be the true evidence of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of thoſe who fulfil the former, is the beneficence of the faſhionable world <hi>very</hi> ſtrikingly illuſtrated by this ſpotleſs purity, this exemption from the pollutions of the world, which is here declared to be its infallible ſymptom?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="unknown:025845_0149_0FCF63EC806B3550"/>
But if I were to venture to take my eſtimate with a view more immediately evangelical; if I preſumed to look for that genuine chriſtianity which conſiſts in "repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt," to inſiſt that, whatever <hi>natural</hi> religion and <hi>faſhionable</hi> religion may teach, it is the peculiarity of the <hi>chriſtian</hi> religion to humble the ſinner and exalt the Saviour; to inſiſt that not only the groſsly flagitious, but that <hi>all,</hi> have ſinned; that <hi>all</hi> are by nature in a ſtate of condemnation; that <hi>all</hi> ſtand in need of mercy, of which there is no hope but on the Goſpel terms; that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life is promiſed to thoſe <hi>only</hi> who accept it on the offered conditions of "faith, repentance, and renewed obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;"—if I were to inſiſt on ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of our chriſtianity as theſe; if I were to expreſs theſe doctrines in plain ſcriptural terms, without lowering, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying, diſguiſing, or doing them away;
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:025845_0150_0FCF63EE6A15B650"/>
if I were to inſiſt on this belief, and its implied and correſponding practices; I am aware that, with whatever condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending patience this little tract might have been ſo far peruſed, many a faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reader would here throw it aſide, as having now detected the palpable enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt, the abettor of "ſtrange doctrines," long ago conſigned over by the liberal and the polite to bigots and fanatics. And yet, if the Bible be true, this is a ſimple and faithful deſcription of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity.</p>
               <p>After having, however, juſt ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hint that ſuch are indeed the humbling doctrines of the Goſpel, to which alone eternal life is promiſed; I ſhall, in deep humility, forbear enlarging on this part of the ſubject, which has been exhauſted by the labours of wiſe and pious men in all ages.

writers are not the favourite gueſts in the cloſets of the more faſhionable chriſtians; who, when they happen to be more ſeriouſly diſpoſed than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are fond of finding out ſome middle kind of reading, which recommends ſome half-way ſtate, ſomething between paganiſm and chriſtianity, ſuſpending the mind, like the poſition of Mahomet's tomb, between earth and heaven: a kind of reading which, while it quiets the conſcience by being on the ſide of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, neither awakens their fears, nor alarms their ſecurity. By dealing in general, it comes home to the hearts of none: it flatters the paſſions of the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by aſcribing high merit to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of certain right actions, and the forbearance from certain wrong ones; among which, that reader muſt be very unlucky indeed who does not find ſome performances and ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearances of his own.

him to keep heaven in his eye, and the world in his heart. It agreeably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the readers to themſelves as amiable perſons; guilty indeed of a few faults, but never as condemned ſinners under ſentence of death. It commonly abounds with high encomiums on the dignity of human nature; the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of virtue on health, fortune, and reputation; the dangers of a blind zeal, the miſchiefs of enthuſiaſm, and the folly of being "righteous over much;" with various other kindred ſentiments, which, if they do not fall in of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the corruptions of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may, by a little warping, be eaſily accommodated to them.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the too ſucceſsful practices of lukewarm and temporizing divines, who have become popular by blunting the edge of that heavenly tempered wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, whoſe ſalutary keenneſs, but for

               <p>But thoſe ſeverer preachers of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, who diſguſt by applying too cloſely to the conſcience; who probe the inmoſt heart, and lay open all its latent peccancies; who treat of principles as the only certain ſource of manners; who lay the axe to the root, oftener than the pruning knife to the branch; who inſiſt much and often on the great leading truthe, that man is a fallen creature, who muſt be reſtored, if he be reſtored at all, by means very little flattering to human pride—ſuch as theſe will ſeldom find acceſs to the houſes and hearts of the more modiſh chriſtians; unleſs they happen to owe their admiſſion to ſome ſubordinate quality of ſtyle; unleſs they can captivate, with the ſeducing graces of language, thoſe well-bred readers,

who are childiſhly amuſing themſelves with the garniſh, when they are periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for want of food; who are ſearching for poliſhed periods, when they ſhould be in queſt of alarming truths; who are looking for elegance of compoſition, when they ſhould be anxious for eternal life.</p>
               <p>Whatever comparative praiſe may be due to the former claſs of writers, when viewed with others of a leſs decent order yet I am not ſure whether ſo many books of frigid morality, exhibiting ſuch inferior motives of action, and ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate repreſentations of duty, have not done religion much more harm than good; whether they do not lead many a reader to enquire what is the loweſt degree in the ſcale of virtue with which he may content himſelf, ſo as barely to eſcape eternal puniſhment; how much indulgence he may allow himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:025845_0155_0FCF63F5775E31C0"/>
abſolutely forfeiting his chance of ſafety; what is the uttermoſt verge to which he may venture of this world's enjoyment, and yet juſt keep within a poſſibility of hope for the next: adjuſting the ſcales of indulgence and ſecurity with ſuch a ſcrupulous equilibrium, as not to loſe much pleaſure, yet not incur much penalty.</p>
               <p>This is hardly an exaggerated repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation: and to theſe low views of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is partly owing ſo much of that bare-weight virtue with which even chriſtians are ſo apt to content themſelves: fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for every inch of ground which may poſſibly be taken within the pales of permiſſion; and ſtretching thoſe pales to the utmoſt edge of that limitation about which the world and the Bible contend.</p>
               <p>But while the nominal chriſtian is perſuading himſelf that there can be no
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:025845_0156_0FCF63F6F80E99E8"/>
harm in going <hi>a little farther,</hi> the real chriſtian is always afraid of going too far. While the one is debating for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more diſputed ground, the other is ſo fearful of ſtraying into the regions of unallowed indulgence, that he keeps at a prudent diſtance from the extremity of his permitted limits, and is as anxious in reſtricting as the other is in extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. One thing is clear, and it may be no bad indication by which to diſcover the ſtate of a man's heart to himſelf: while he is contending for this allowance, and ſtipulating for the other indulgence, it will ſhew him that, whatever change there may be in his life, there is none in his heart; the temper remains as it did; and it is by the inward frame rather than the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act that he can beſt judge of his <hi>own</hi> ſtate, whatever may be the rule by which he undertakes to judge of that of another.</p>

                  </gap> wonderful that there are not more chriſtians, than that chriſtians, as they are called, are not better men: for if chriſtianity be not true, the motives to virtue are not high enough to quicken ordinary men to very extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions. We ſee them do and ſuffer every day, for popularity, for cuſtom, for faſhion, for the point of honour, not only more than good men do and ſuffer for religion, but a great deal more than religion requires them to do. For her <hi>reaſonable ſervice</hi> demands no ſacrifices but what are ſanctified by good ſenſe, ſound policy, right reaſon, and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt judgment.</p>
               <p>Many of theſe faſhionable profeſſors even go ſo far as to bring their right faith as an apology for their wrong prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. They have a commodious way of intrenching themſelves within the ſhelter of ſome general poſition of unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:025845_0158_0FCF63FAC0ED3A78"/>
truth. Even the great chriſtian hope, becomes a ſnare to them. They apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize for a life of offence, by taking refuge in the ſupreme goodneſs they are abuſing. That "God is all merciful," is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reply to thoſe who hint to them their danger. This is a falſe and fatal appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a divine and comfortable truth. Nothing can be more certain than the propoſition, nor more deluſive than the inference: for their deduction implies, not that he is merciful to ſin repented of, but to ſin continued in. But it is a moſt fallacious hope to expect that God will violate his own covenant, or that he is indeed "all mercy," to the utter exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his other attributes of perfect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, purity, and juſtice.</p>
               <p>It is a dangerous folly to reſt on theſe vague and general notions of uncovenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mercy; and nothing can be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive than this indefinite truſt in being
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:025845_0159_0FCF63FC36BED8C8"/>
forgiven in our <hi>own</hi> way, after God has clearly revealed to us that he will only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us in <hi>his</hi> way.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, no one does truly truſt in God, who does not endeavour to obey him. For to break his laws, and yet to depend on his favour; to live in oppoſition to his will, and yet in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his mercy; to violate his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and yet look for his acceptance, would not, in any other inſtance, be thought a reaſonable ground of conduct; and yet it is by no means as uncommon as it is inconſiſtent.</p>
               <p>But the life of a diſſipated chriſtian ſeems to be a perpetual ſtruggle to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile impoſſibilities: it is an endeavour to unite what God has for ever ſeparated, peace and ſin; unchriſtian practices with chriſtian obſervances; a quiet conſcience and a diſorderly life; a heart full of this

world, and an unfounded dependance on the happineſs of the next.</p>

               <head>View of thoſe who acknowledge chriſtianity as a perfect ſyſtem of morals, but deny its divine authority—Morality not the whole of religion.</head>
               <p>AS in the preceding chapter notice was taken of that deſcription of perſons who profeſs to receive chriſtianity with great reverence as a matter of faith, who yet do not pretend to adopt it as a rule of conduct; I ſhall conclude theſe ſlight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks with ſome ſhort animadverſions on another ſet of men, and that not a ſmallone, among the decent and the faſhionable, who profeſs to think it exhibits an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſyſtem of morals, while they deny
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:025845_0161_0FCF2CFFD81B5B30"/>
its divine authority; though that alone can make the neceſſity of obeying its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts binding on the conſciences of men.</p>
               <p>This is a very diſcreet ſcheme: for ſuch perſons at once ſave themſelves from the diſcredit of having their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding impoſed upon by a ſuppoſed blind ſubmiſſion to evidences and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities; and yet, prudently enough, ſecure to themſelves, in no ſmall degree, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of good men. By ſteering this middle kind of courſe, they contrive to be reckoned liberal by the <hi>philoſophers,</hi> and decent by the believers.</p>
               <p>But we are not commonly to expect to ſee the pure morality of the Goſpel very carefully transfuſed into the lives of ſuch objectors. And indeed it would be unjuſt to imagine that the precepts <hi>ſhould</hi> be moſt ſcrupulouſly obſerved by thoſe who reject the authority. The
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:025845_0162_0FCF6402A7147888"/>
influence of divine truth, muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſt prepare the heart for an unreſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience to its laws. If we do not depend on that pardon and acceptance which chriſtianity offers, we ſhall want the beſt motive to the actions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances which it enjoins. A lively belief <hi>muſt</hi> therefore precede a very hearty and complete obedience. We are told, on the very beſt authority, that truth ſanctifies the heart: and the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity adds, that, the "word of God is truth." That command therefore, for inſtance, to ſet "our affections on things above," will operate but faintly, till that ſpirit from which the command pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, touches the heart, and convinces it that no human good is worthy of the entire affection of an immortal creature. An unreſerved faith in the promiſer muſt precede our worthy performance of any duty to which the promiſe is annexed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="unknown:025845_0163_0FCF6403B3ACBAB0"/>
But as to a ſet of duties enforced by no other motive than a bare acquieſcence in their beauty, and a cold conviction of their propriety, but impelled by no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his authority who impoſes them; though we know not how well they might be performed by pure and impeccable beings, yet we know how they commonly <hi>are</hi> performed by frail and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly creatures, fallen from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and corrupt in their very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Beſides, nothing but a conviction of the truth of chriſtianity can reconcile thinking beings to the extraordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of things in the Creator's moral government of the world. The works of God are an enigma, of which his word alone is the ſolution. The dark veil which is thrown over the divine diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations in this lower world, muſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſhock thoſe who conſider only the
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:025845_0164_0FCF6406425050D0"/>
ſingle ſcene which is acting on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtage; but is reconcileable to him who, having learnt from revelation the nature of the laws by which the great Author acts, truſts confidently that the cataſtrophe will ſet all to rights. The confuſion which ſin and the paſſions have introduced; the triumph of wickedneſs, the ſeemingly arbitrary diſproportion of human conditions, accountable on no ſcheme but that which the Goſpel has opened to us—have all a natural tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to withdraw from the love of God the hearts of thoſe who erect themſelves into critics on the divine conduct, and yet will not ſtudy the plan, and get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the rules, ſo far as it has pleaſed the Supreme Diſpoſer to reveal them.</p>
               <p>Till therefore the word of God is uſed as "a lamp to their paths," men can neither truly diſcern the crookedneſs of
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:025845_0165_0FCF640778535790"/>
their own ways, nor the perfection of that light by which they are directed to walk. And this light can only be ſeen by its own proper brightneſs; it has no other medium. Till therefore "the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the Lord" is with men, they will not truly "fear him;" till he has "en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged their hearts" with the knowledge and belief of his word, they will not very vigorouſly "run the way of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments." Till they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that "faith without which it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe God," they will not attain that holineſs without which no man can ſee him.</p>
               <p>And indeed if God has thought ſit to make the goſpel an inſtrument of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muſt own the neceſſity of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as a divine inſtitution, before it is likely to operate very effectually on the conduct. The great Creator, if we may judge by analogy from natural things, is
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:025845_0166_0FCF640943A234D0"/>
ſo wiſe an oeconomiſt, that he always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapts, with the moſt accurate preciſion, the inſtrument to the work; and never laviſhes more means than are neceſſary to accompliſh the propoſed end. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chriſtianity had been intended for nothing more than a mere ſyſtem of ethics ſuch a ſyſtem ſurely might have been produced at an infinitely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſs expence. The long chain of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cy, the labours of apoſtles, the blood of ſaints, to ſay nothing of the great and coſtly ſacrifice which the goſpel records, might ſurely have been ſpared. Leſſons of mere human virtue might have been delivered by ſome ſuitable inſtrument of human wiſdom, ſtrengthened by the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble authority of human power. A bare ſyſtem of morals might have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to mankind with a more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable proſpect of advantage, by means not ſo repugnant to human pride. A mere ſcheme of conduct might have been
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:025845_0167_0FCF640A7A3D7C20"/>
delivered, with far greater probability of ſucceſs, by Antoninus the emperor, or Plato the philoſopher, than by Paul the tent-maker, or Peter the fiſherman.</p>
               <p>Chriſtianity, then, muſt be embraced entirely, if it be received at all. It muſt be taken, without mutilation, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſcheme, in the way in which God has been pleaſed to reveal it. It muſt be accepted, not as exhibiting beautiful parts, but as preſenting one conſummate whole, of which the perfection ariſes from coherence and dependence, from relation and conſiſtency. Its power will be weakened, and its energy deſtroyed, if every caviller pulls out a pin, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs a ſpring, with the preſumptuous view of new modelling the divine work, and making it go to his own mind. There is no breaking this ſyſtem into portions of which we are at liberty to chooſe one, and reject another. There is no ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:025845_0168_0FCF640CB7CD4358"/>
the evidences from the doctrines, the doctrines from the precepts, belief from obedience, morality from piety, the love of our neighbour from the love of God. If we profeſs chriſtianity at all, if we allow the Divine Author to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unto us "wiſdom and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs," he muſt be alſo "ſanctification and redemption."</p>
               <p>Chriſtianity, then, is aſſuredly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a mere ſet of rules; and piety, though it never pretended to be the ſubſtitute for a good life, is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary to its acceptance with God. The Goſpel never offers to make religion ſuperſede morality, but every where clearly proves that morality is not the whole of religion. Piety is not only neceſſary as a <hi>means,</hi> but is itſelf a moſt important <hi>end.</hi> It is not only the beſt principle of moral conduct, but is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable and abſolute duty in itſelf.
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:025845_0169_0FCF640E36C05B80"/>
It is not only the higheſt motive to the practice of virtue, but is a prior obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and abſolutely neceſſary, even when detached from its immediate influence on practical goodneſs. Religion will ſurvive all the virtues of which it is the ſource; for we ſhall be living in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt exerciſes of piety, when we ſhall have no objects on which to exerciſe many human virtues. When there will be no diſtreſs to be relieved, no injuries to be forgiven, no evil habits to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; there will be a Creator to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and adored, a Redeemer to be loved and praiſed.</p>
