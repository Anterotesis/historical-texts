            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE to the laſt Edition.</head>
            <p>THE Public is here preſented with a New Tranſlation of the MORAL MAXIMS of Francis the Sixth, Duke de la Rochefoucault: a performance of ſuch eſtimation, that its noble Author lived to ſee five or ſix Editions of it; and ſince his death it has run through as many more; not to mention Tranſlations. As far as the two languages permit, the Tranſlator has followed in the diſpoſition of the Maxims the alphabetical order of Mr. Amelot de la Houſſaye: to whom he is alſo beholden for many well-col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected authorities from the judicious Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus, and ſome other ancient writers. In his own notes he has chiefly aimed at the explanation, or illuſtration, of his Author's ſyſtem. He has rejected ſuch maxims as were manifeſt repetitions, or apparently ſpurious; and retained only ſuch as, after compariſon of the beſt Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he concluded to be genuine. He has alſo taken great care to <hi>expreſs the ſenſe of the Original</hi> (in which the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015864_0004_0F9A315E1F991C80"/>Tranſlations have been hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective); and at the ſame time (what none of them have attempted) to do the Duke de la Rochefoucault the juſtice to make him <hi>ſpeak Engliſh.</hi>

            <head>Advertiſement to the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Edition of 1775.</head>
            <p>THIS Edition of the Duke de la Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault's Maxims is not merely a republication of the laſt. The Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been reviſed, and treated with that ſort of freedom, which the former Editor ſeems to have taken with the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that preceded. From this attention, and various additional Notes, the Edition now ſubmitted to the Public may have obtained, it is hoped, ſome degree of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. But, after all, to transfuſe into our language the force and ſpirit of the original with conciſeneſs and perſpicuity is rather to be attempted than executed.</p>
            <p>High in eſteem as theſe Maxims are held, it muſt be allowed that the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Writer ſtands criticiſed by many as too ſevere a Cenſor, giving ill conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to indifferent actions, and aſcribing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to good ones unworthy motives.</p>
            <p>In favour of our Author's ſyſtem it is alledged, that perfect virtue is not to be found in the preſent ſtate of things; that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015864_0006_0F9A31620B5611B0"/>a mixture of error and truth conſtitutes too many of our actions; that He has conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the heart of man as corrupted by pride, ſeduced by ſelf-love, encompaſſed by bad example; that certain human ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the world miſtake for vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, are really no more than their reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances; that, in ſpite of the efforts of Reaſon, Pride and Self-love never fail to lurk in the receſſes of the heart, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe their venom, for the moſt part, through its motions and inclinations.</p>
            <p>But to enter into a regular defence of this noble Author is not the preſent deſign. M. De Voltaire indeed has not ſcrupled to aſſert, that theſe Maxims contributed more than any other work to form the taſte of the French nation, and give it a true reliſh for propriety and correctneſs. "Though," ſays he, <q>there is but one truth running through the whole piece, namely, that ſelf-love is the ſpring of all our actions and determinations; yet this thought preſents itſelf under ſuch a variety of forms, as never fail to ſtrike with new ſurprize. This little collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015864_0007_0F9A316379C70FB8"/>was much read and admired; it accuſtomed our authors to think, and to comprize their thoughts in a lively, correct, and delicate turn of phraſe; which was a merit utterly unknown to any European writer before him, ſince the revival of letters. His Memoirs<note n="*" place="bottom">Mem d'Anne d'Autriche.</note> are ſtill read, and his Maxims <hi>are known by heart.</hi>

            <p>In the Earl of Cheſterfield's Letters, lately publiſhed, we frequently view his Lordſhip both as an admirer and defender of our Author. <q>La Rochefoucault is, I know, blamed,</q> ſays his Lordſhip, <q>but, I think, without reaſon, for deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our actions from the ſource of ſelf-love. For my own part, I ſee a great deal of truth, and no harm at all, in that opinion. It is ſufficient that we ſeek our own happineſs in every thing we do; and it is as certain that we can only find it in doing well, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all our actions to the rule of right reaſon, which is the great law of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015864_0008_0F9A31648291B318"/>Nature. It is only a miſtaken ſelf-love that is a blameable motive, when we take the immediate and indiſcriminate gratification of a paſſion, or appetite, for real happineſs. But am I blameable, if I do a good action upon account of the happineſs which that honeſt conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will give me? Surely not. On the contrary, that pleaſing conſciouſneſs is a proof of my virtue, &amp;c. &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015864_0016_0F9A316D4B7CEB00"/>of weeping for the loſs of one who was dear to us, we weep for ourſelves: we weep over the diminution of our fortune, of our pleaſure, of our importance. Thus have the dead the honour of tears which ſtream only for the living. I call this a ſort of hypocriſy, becauſe we impoſe on ourſelves. There is another hypocriſy, which is leſs innocent, becauſe it impoſes on the world. This is the affliction of ſuch as aſpire to the glory of a great and immortal ſorrow: when time, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes all things, has worn out the grief which they really had, they ſtill perſiſt in their tears, lamentations, and ſighs. They aſſume a mournful behaviour; and labour, by all their actions, to demonſtrate that their affliction will not in the leaſt abate till death. This diſagreeable, this troubleſome vanity is common among am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious women. As the ſex bars all the paths to glory, they endeavour to render themſelves celebrated by the oſtentation of an inconſolable affliction. There is yet another ſpecies of tears, whoſe ſhallow ſprings eaſily overflow, and as eaſily day
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015864_0017_0F9A316DDD4FFB88"/>away: we weep, to acquire the reputation of being tender; we weep, in order to be pitied; we weep, that we may be wept over; we even weep, to avoid the ſcandal of not weeping.</p>

               <p n="88">LXXXVIII. After having ſpoken of the falſity of ſeeming virtues, it is proper to ſay ſomething about the falſity of the contempt of death: I mean that contempt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015864_0033_0F9A318261612A80"/>of death which the heathens boaſted to derive from their natural ſtrength, unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the hopes of a better life. There is a wide difference between ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death courageouſly, and contemning it: the one is common enough; but the other, I believe, never ſincere. Every thing has been written that can perſuade us that death is no evil; and ſome of the weakeſt as well as the greateſt of men have given celebrated examples in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this tenet. Yet I doubt whether any perſon of good ſenſe ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it; and the pains we take to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade ourſelves and others of it plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that it is no eaſy taſk. A man may, for many reaſons, be diſguſted with life; but he can have no reaſon for contemning death. Even ſuicides eſteem it no ſlight matter, and are as much ſtartled at it, and decline it as much as other people, when it comes in any other ſhape except that which they have choſen. The remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inequality in the courage of many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men proceeds from death's appearing differently to their imaginations, and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015864_0034_0F9A3182E4E1C9A8"/>ſeeming more inſtant at one time than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. By this means it happens, that, after having contemned what they did not know, they are at laſt afraid of what they do know. We muſt avoid conſidering death in all its circumſtances, if we would not think it the greateſt of all ills. The wiſeſt and braveſt are thoſe who make the beſt pretences for not conſidering it at all: for every one that views it in its proper light will find it ſufficiently terrible. The neceſſity of dying made the whole of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic fortitude. The philoſophers thought it beſt to do that with a good grace which was not to be avoided; and, being unable to make themſelves immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, they did all they could to immortalize their reputations, and ſave what they might out of the general wreck. To be able to put a good face on the matter, let us by no means diſcover even to ourſelves all we think about it; let us truſt rather to conſtitution, than to thoſe vain reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which make us believe we can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach death with indifference.

<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015864_0035_0F9A31839E61AA08"/>regretted, the deſire of leaving a fair reputation, the aſſurance of being deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the miſeries of life, and freed from the caprice of fortune, are alleviat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reflections, not to be rejected: but we muſt by no means imagine them infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Theſe ſerve indeed to embolden us, juſt as in war a poor hedge emboldens the ſoldiers to approach an inceſſant fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. At a diſtance, they view it as a ſhelter; when they come up, they find it but a ſorry defence. We flatter ourſelves too much, in fancying that death, when near, will appear what we judged it to be when diſtant; and that our opinions, which are weakneſs itſelf, will be firm e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough not to give way on this ſevereſt of trials. We muſt be alſo but ill-acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the effects of ſelf-love, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that <hi>that</hi> will permit us to think lightly of an action which muſt neceſſarily be its deſtruction. Reaſon, from whom we expect mighty aſſiſtance, is too feeble, on this occaſion, to make us believe what we wiſh to find true. It is ſhe, on the contrary, who betrays us; and, inſtead of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:015864_0036_0F9A3185624BD0D0"/>inſpiring a contempt of death, helps only to diſcover its horrors. Indeed all ſhe can do for us is, to adviſe us to avert our eyes, and ſix them on ſome other object. Cato and Brutus choſe noble ones. A footman, ſome time ſince, amuſed himſelf with dancing upon the ſcaffold he was going to be broken on. Thus different motives ſometimes produce the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And ſo true it is, that whatever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion there may be between the great and the vulgar, we often ſee them meet death with the ſame countenance: but there is always this difference, that the contempt of death ſhewn by heroes is owing to their love of glory, which hides it from their ſight; and in common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it proceeds merely from their want of ſenſibility, which prevents their being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the greatneſs of the evil, and leaves them at liberty to think of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">The contempt of death has been always very juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a virtue of the firſt claſs. Virgil makes it (as it truly is) eſſential to the character of a happy man: <q>Quique metus omnes, &amp; inexorabile fatum, Subjecit pedibus, ſtrepitumque Acherontis avari.</q>
                     <p>He muſt be ſuperior to every fear; even that of death, and its conſequences.—The fear of death is peculiar to man; and may perhaps be a neceſſary inſtinct to counterbalance rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which might elſe, too frequently, prompt him to quit his poſt: according to that noble thought of Lucan, <q>Victuroſque dei celant, ut vivere durent, Felix eſſe mori.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Gods cenceal from men the happineſs of death that they may endure life.—And though we find this inſtinct operates ſufficiently in men, when under no immediate preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; yet we may alſo obſerve that it is ſurmountable by the exertion of every paſſion, even in the weakeſt and moſt timid people; of this the numberleſs examples we continually ſee will not admit a doubt.

CCCXCVIII. Nothing is ſo capable of diminiſhing our ſelf-love, as the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that we diſapprove at one time of what we approve at another.</p>
               <p n="399">CCCXCIX. Self-love never reigns ſo abſolutely as in the paſſion of love: we are always ready to ſacrifice the peace of thoſe we adore, rather than loſe the leaſt part of our own.</p>
               <p n="400">CCCC. The ſelf-love of ſome people is ſuch, that, when in love, they are more taken up with their paſſion, than its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p n="401">CCCCI. Self-love is the love of ſelf, and of every thing for the ſake of ſelf. Self-love makes men idolize themſelves, and tyrannize over others, when Fortune gives the means.<note n="*" place="bottom">Self-love.] Self-love is the ſpring of all animal action. It is implanted by Nature in animals with a twofold view; the good of the individual, and that of the ſpecies: and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates on them by a twofold impulſe; an inſupportable unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs attendant on its ſuppreſſion, and a pleaſurable ſenſation annexed to its gratification. In brutes, this motive to action, being under the ſole direction of inſtinct, is in general uniform and evident, In man, inſtinct has been ſuperadded to reaſon, and ſelf-love becomes complex and myſierious. It is plain, from fact, that all animals are in ſome degree ſocial; ſome of them (if we may ſo ſpeak) living under monarchal, ſome oligarchal, others democratical, and the reſt patriarchal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The ſtifling, or exerting, the principle that thus unites them, has always its concomitant pain or pleaſure. And inſtinct, where ſhe is ſole governeſs, impells them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably and unerringly to Nature's end and their own good; which are always united, though not always abſolutely the ſame. For example, animals eat to appeaſe their bunger, or pleaſe their palate; they have no more view to ſuſtenance than the ſexes, in their intercourſe, have to propagation. Men, too, ſo far as they act under inſtinct, act unerringly; when that leaves them, they have recourſe to reaſon; which not being at all times, nor in all perſons, equally right and ſtrong, does not always prompt to what is equally true and juſt. Society is undoubtedly the intereſt of all mankind; and though an univerſal government has never yet been, nor moſt probably ever will be formed, yet the wants of every man make him confederate with, and join himſelf to, ſome particular public. Now, as in order to the eſtabliſhment of a ſtate it is indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſuperſede ſome private rights, which are indeed compenſated reflectively, though in a leſs obvious manner, this ſeems to produce caſes wherein the good of the government and that of the ſubject claſh. And certainly there are occaſionally inſtances where the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the commonwealth bear ſo bard on particular members as would give them a diſtaſte to ſociety, did not the uniting principle, the love of the ſpecies, the affection for the community of which they are part, lighten the oppreſſion, ſtill the grievance, and, by benevolent reflection, even ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it pleaſureable. To actions deduced from this ſource, the ſelf-love of the reſt of the Community (which reaps the benefit of theſe ſeeming ſelf-ſacrifices) aſcribes extraordinary merit, annexes attendant glory, and calls them virtuous: which virtue, though, relatively to the kind, it be highly meritorious, is yet not diſintereſted, becauſe repaid by the reflex pleaſure of the actor: and may alſo be carried ſo far as to become irrational and vicious; for 'to be vir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> He never reſts out of
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:015864_0102_0F9A30648C6EB958"/>himſelf; and ſettles on external things, juſt as the bee doth on flowers, to extract what may be ſerviceable. Nothing is ſo impetuous as his deſires, nothing ſo ſecret as his deſigns, nothing ſo artful as his conduct. His ſuppleneſs is inexpreſſible,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:015864_0103_0F9A3064CFA612B0"/>his metamorphoſes ſurpaſs thoſe of Ovid, and his refinements thoſe of chemiſtry. We cannot fathom the depth, nor pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the obſcurity of his abyſs. There concealed from the moſt piercing eye, he makes numberleſs turnings and windings:
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:015864_0104_0F9A30658ED09658"/>there is he often inviſible even to himſelf: there he conceives, breeds, and brings up, without being ſenſible of it, an infinity of likes and diſlikes; ſome of which are ſo monſtrous, that he knows them not when brought in to light, or at leaſt cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on himſelf to own them. From the night that envelopes him ſprings the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous notions he entertains of himſelf: thence his errors, his ignorance, his groſs and filly miſtakes with reſpect to himſelf. Thence is it that he imagines his ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons dead, when they are only aſleep, that he ſhall never deſire to run again when once tired; and that he has loſt all the appetites he has ſated. But this thick darkneſs, which hides him from himſelf, hinders him not from ſeeing perfectly well whatever is without him; in which he reſembles the eye, that ſees all things except itſelf. In his great concerns and important affairs, where the violence of deſire ſummoneth his whole attention, he ſees, perceives, underſtands, invents, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, penetrates, and divines all things; ſo that one would be tempted to believe that
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:015864_0105_0F9A30664F034300"/>each paſſion had its reſpective magic. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo cloſe and ſtrong as his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which he in vain attempts to break through on diſcovery of the greateſt impending miſery. Yet ſometimes, in a ſhort time, he effects, and without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what he had not been able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs with the greateſt efforts, for years. Whence may well be concluded, that it is by himſelf that his deſires are inflamed, more than by the beauty and merit of their objects; that it is his taſte that heightens and embelliſhes them; that it is himſelf that he purſues; and that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his inclination, when he follows things that are agreeable to his inclination. He is compoſed of contrarieties; imperious and obedient, ſincere and hypocritical, merciful and cruel, timid and bold. He has different inclinations, according to the different tempers that poſſeſs and devote him ſometimes to glory, ſometimes to wealth, ſometimes to pleaſure. Theſe he changes, as age and experience alter: and it is indifferent to him whether he has many inclinations, or only one; becauſe
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:015864_0106_0F9A3067104924C8"/>he can ſplit himſelf into many, or collect himſelf into one, as it is convenient or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to him. He is inconſtant; and the changes, beſides thoſe that happen from external cauſes, are numberleſs which proceed from himſelf. He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant through levity, through love, through novelty, through ſatiety, through diſguſt, through inconſtancy itſelf. He is capricious; and ſometimes labours with eagerneſs and incredible pains to obtain things that are no ways advantageous, nay even hurtful; but which he purſues mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it is his will. He is whimſical, and often exerts his whole application in employments the moſt trifling; takes the utmoſt delight in the moſt inſipid, and preſerves all his haughtineſs in the moſt contemptible. He is attendant on all ages and conditions; he lives every where; he lives on every thing; he lives on nothing. He makes himſelf eaſy either in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or privation, of things; he even goes over to thoſe who are at variance with him; he enters into their ſchemes, and, which is wonderful! along with
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:015864_0107_0F9A3067CFEE7208"/>them hates himſelf; he conſpires his own deſtruction; he labours to undo himſelf; he only deſires to BE; and, that granted, he conſents to be his own enemy. We are not therefore to be ſurprized if he ſometimes cloſes with the moſt rigid au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; and enters boldly into a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therewith to ruin himſelf; becauſe what he loſes in one place he regains in another. When we think he relinquiſhes his pleaſures, he but ſuſpends, or changes them; and even when he is diſcomfited, and we think we are rid of him, we find him triumphant in his own defeat. Such is ſelf-love! of which man's life is only a long and great agitation. The ſea is its repreſentative; in the flux and reflux of whoſe waves, ſelf-love may find a lively expreſſion of the turbulent ſucceſſion of its thoughts, and of its eternal motion.</p>

            <q>
               <p>THIS <hi>production bears ſo much the ſtamp of truth, freedom and virtue, that it is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing a work of ſuch character has not yet been tranſlated into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and laid before a nation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanting to countenance merit, wherever met with. The author is a</hi> SWISS, <hi>and writes with the freedom becoming a virtuous man, born in a country from whence li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, virtue, truth and ſimplicity, have not yet been expelled by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, vice, flattery and luxury. The applauſe of his own country and of Germany has rendered four large impreſſions neceſſary; to the laſt of which the author made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant additions. The French, a people not eaſily pleaſea in works of this nature, have read this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, tranſlated into their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, with diſtinguiſhed appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; and ſome of their capital writers have beſtowed large enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums upon it</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Impartial judges will, on peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of this work, find it to abound with ſterling ſenſe and judicious ſentiments; and although it may poſſibly appear to diſadvantage in the tranſlation, there will however ſtill remain ſome of the maſterly ſtrokes of our author, however weakened through the transfuſion of his original ideas into Engliſh expreſſions</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what gives us the beſt grounded hopes of the ſucceſs of this publication is derived from our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's aim to combat prejudice, and to promote the cauſe of liberty and virtue, which have always found the moſt numerous and moſt zealous friends in the thinking part of this great and wealthy nation.</hi>

               <hi>PENAL</hi> laws, ſo conſiderable a part of every ſyſtem of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of ſo great importance to the happineſs, peace and ſecurity of every member of ſociety, are ſtill ſo imperfect, and are attended with ſo many unneceſſary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of cruelty in all nations, that an attempt to reduce them to the ſtandard of reaſon muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to all mankind. It is not ſurpriſing, then, that this little book hath engaged the attention of all ranks of people in every part of Europe. It is now about eighteen months ſince the firſt publication; in which time it hath paſſed no leſs than ſix editions in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal language; the third of which was printed within ſix months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its firſt appearance. It hath been tranſlated into French; that tranſlation hath alſo been ſeveral times reprinted, and perhaps no book on any ſubject was ever recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with more avidity, more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally read, or more univerſally applauded.</q>
            <p>N. B.
