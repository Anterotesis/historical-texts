            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>The conſtitution of New-England CHURCHES, as ſettled by their Platform, may be fairly juſtified, from <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; the <hi>Light of Nature; Holy Scripture</hi>; and from the <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Excellent Nature</hi> of the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> itſelf. And laſtly from the <hi>Providence of GOD</hi> dignifying of it.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt demonſtration contains the voice of <hi>Antiquity</hi> in the following <hi>Chapters.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. I. To diſtribute the whole <hi>Chriſtian Aera</hi> into three Parts may ſerve to raiſe a clearer light, and make a brighter aſpect in this <hi>Eſſay.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. THE firſt diviſion contains the firſt three hundred years of chriſtianity, which may be accounted the moſt refined and pureſt time, both as to faith and manners, that the chriſtian church has been honored with; for that within this ſpace, is contained the miniſtry of the apoſtles and holy evangeliſts, and other eminent perſons authorized by them; and ſuch others who ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in office-truſt through the ſeveral ages, within the ſpace before named. This was the time of an immenſe effuſion of the Spirit of God upon the world, when there was ſuch a flux and inundation of the waters from the ſanctuary, mentioned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. This was the age of miracles; a time of extraordinary gifts, and when grace and true piety was in the greateſt elevation. Chriſtian religion was now a dangerous buſineſs; every man that took it up, lay
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012626_0003_0F8B8F030AF28938"/>
down his life, honor and fortune at ſtake; he that owns Chriſt, muſt bid defiance to all the celebrated deities of the Roman empire; and thereby run counter to the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the imperial court. So that rationally we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to find the churches of Chriſt in the pureſt capacity they were ever in; in all points, both of principles and practice. That whatever their government was if they continue the ſame from the days of the apoſtles, we may fairly conclude it to be authentic, and agreable with their grand and original copy. It is moſt apparent, that the churches in thoſe ages, were under too good an influence internally, and the eye of too direful a guard, externally to prevaricate with God, in the known principles of their order, any more than in their faith, though they were not without errors. Two or three hundred years, is a long time in the world, to keep up our conſtant mode and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, either in religious or civil affairs amongſt men, who are ſo inclined to err, and apt to change their faſhions; <hi>Nam eſt Natura hominum Novitatis Avida,</hi> That for the churches through thoſe many ages and in their ſeveral communities, to agree in their diſcipline amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and not eſſentially to differ from thoſe churches that were truely apoſtolical, invincibly infers, that their original was divine. But this will appear more plainly when we have made and finiſhed our ſurvey.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond grand diviſion of time, contains the ſpace of the next twelve hundred years, downward, more or leſs; within which circuit is included the commencement &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of a direful apoſtacy, both as to worſhip, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the churches. Some ſymptoms of theſe things were riſing within the former diviſion of time; but in this they grew a great pace, and to that degree, that the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world became a moſt notorious apoſtate. For as we have it in the idea of the reformation, the great Lord of time allowed a ſpace, wearing the denomination of time, times, and half a time: or in plainer expreſſions, twelve hundred and ſixty years; in which ſpace, all the effects of a horrible apoſtacy made a very <hi>Gehennon</hi> of that which was called Chriſtendom. And ſays Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> (in his preface, to the inquiry, into the original of the churches) <hi>Ambros</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was the pride, or ambition of the doctors of the church, which introduced the alteration in its order. And
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012626_0004_0F8B8F042D49B830"/>
moreover ſays the doctor, ſomewhat after this manner, viz. 'The ambition of church rulers, in the fourth and fifth centuries openly proclaimed itſelf to the ſcandal of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion; for that their intereſt led them to a devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the order and diſcipline of the church according to its firſt inſtitution': For that the directions given about it in ſcripture, make it a matter ſo weighty in itſelf, and attended with ſo many difficulties, it being laid under ſuch ſevere interdictions of lordly power, or ſeeking either of wealth or dignity; that it's no pleaſant thing to fleſh and blood, to engage in the conduct, and overſight of Chriſt's volunteers; to bear with their manners; to exerciſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience towards them in all their infirmities; and in all their weakneſſes, to continue a high valuation for them, as the flock of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood: All this requires abundance of ſelf-denial; and if ſo, then it's no wonder, that many of their prelates were willing gradually to extricate themſelves out of this uneaſy condition; and embrace all opportunities of introducing another order into the churches, that might tend more to the exaltation of their own power and dignity. And this was done accordingly; for the biſhops by their arbitrary rules ſhared the flock of Chriſt amongſt themſelves, and that without the conſent of the people, as though they had conquered them by the ſword. For thus they divide the ſpoil. This biſhop ſay they, ſhall have ſuch a ſhare and number of them under his power; and that other biſhop ſhall have ſo many; and ſo far ſhall the juriſdiction of one extend, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d ſo far another; that they ſoon canton out the whole Roman empire under a few patriarchs and head men. Theſe things were the ſubject of their decrees and laws, which (thoſe of Chriſt's being thrown by) were now become a rule for the churches. But yet neither did the biſhops long keep within thoſe bounds and limits, which their more modeſt ambition had at firſt preſcribed unto them; but went on, and took occaſion from theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings to contend amongſt themſelves about pre-eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, dignity, and power: In which conteſt, the biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> at length remained maſter of the field; and ſo <hi>Rome</hi> obtained the ſecond conqueſt of the world. And then his holineſs the head of it came to ride admiral of all the Sees; and then ſoon became lord of heaven and earth by the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012626_0005_0F8B8F04A71BB800"/>
ſame rule of proceſs which brought him to his high truſt. Hence, Query. What can't wakeful ambition, learning and fraud do, if jointly agreed, at rifling the greateſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures bequeathed to mankind; eſpecially when the world is generally gotten into a ſleepy fit.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Towards the latter end of this ſpace of time began a glorious reformation. Many famous perſons, memorable in eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, being moved by the ſpirit of God, and according to holy writ, led the way in the face of all danger; ſuch has <hi>Wickliff,</hi> who openly decryed the pope, as the very antichriſt; in the fourteenth century, and others in that age. And in the next century <hi>Martin Luther</hi> purſued the reformation with great boldneſs, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and conſtancy; this is that famous <hi>Luther,</hi> ſays my author, of whom they who acknowledge the leaſt, muſt yet make as much as Dr. <hi>More</hi> makes of him; for ſaith the Dr.
<q>I cannot think ſo very highly of <hi>Luther</hi> as ſome do; and yet I think him to have been a very happy inſtrument in the hand of God, for the good of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom againſt the horrid enormities of the papal hyrarchy. And though he might not be allowed to be the <hi>Elias,</hi> the conductor and chariot of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as ſome have ſtiled him; yet I think at leaſt he might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a faithful poſtilion in that chariot, who was well accoutred with his wax boots, oiled coat, and hood; and who turned the horſes noſes into a direct way from <hi>Babylon</hi> toward the ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>y of God, and held on in a good round trot, through thick and thin, not caring to beſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others in this high fogg, as he himſelf was finely beſpattered by others:</q>
About which time <hi>Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Melancthon</hi> and other chriſtian heroes alſo liſted into the ſame quarrel, and with great bravery and ſelf denial went forward with the reformation. Yet after the endeavours of ſuch men, and others without number, through ſeveral ages downward; the churches, which are called reformed, attained to a very imperfect reformation, as Dr. <hi>Increaſe Matther</hi> ſays. And the defect has not been ſo much in doctrine, as in worſhip and diſcipline. And notwithſtanding ſays the Dr. in this reſpect alſo, ſome churches have gone beyond others. Now to come to what I aim at; theſe churches in <hi>New-England,</hi> as to their order and diſcipline have ſurpaſſed all churches of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012626_0006_0F8B8F06DA7C9808"/>
reformation. And under the head of diſcipline, it ſeems to me, that Chriſt the captain of ſalvation, has given out his word to theſe churches, as to his troops coming up in the reer of time; and his word of command is—as you were; make good the old front; or place your ſelves in that regimental order, which the primitive churches were in whilſt they march't under my banners, and encountred the devil in their heathen perſecutors for the firſt three hundred years. For that the churches in <hi>New-England,</hi> and the primitive churches are eminently parallel in their government. Thoſe firſt ages of the church it is certain were many times much annoyed with many peſtilent and damnable hereſies; and many uſages in worſhip, too ſuperſtitious crept in amongſt them; yet they continued in the conſtitution of their church order very uniform and apoſtolical; and it is very obvious that theſe churches in this wilderneſs, in the eſſentials of government; are every way parallel to them.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall repreſent this buſineſs by a collection of parellel notes out of ſeveral authors of unqueſtionable veracity; and ſhall principally follow the guidance of one who has concealed his name; and ſtiles his treatiſe, 'An inquiry into the conſtitution, diſcipline, unity and worſhip of the primitive churches.' This author in his preface gives this fair account of his doings; ſays he, <hi>What I have written I have wholly collected out of the genuine, and unqueſtionably authentick writings of thoſe ages</hi>; meaning ſuch as writ in, or of the three firſt centuries of chriſtianity. And ſays he, <hi>I have been every way honeſt and unbiaſt.</hi> And being well aſſured of his fidelity; I ſhall endeavour to imitate his faithfulneſs, in tranſcribing what I find in him ſuiting my preſent purpoſe. And I ſhall be well and ſufficiently furniſhed when I have laid before the reader the notion which the ancients had of the church in its conſtituent parts both of officers and people, with the ſeveral authorities, powers, rights, immunities and prerogatives belonging unto each. And if we find that the primitive churches in their order and diſcipline, did exactly agree in the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of government; with the churches in <hi>New-England</hi>; we may rationally then conclude that if they were apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, ſo are we.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. Of the Church.</head>
                     <p>TO paſs over all other obſervations, the moſt uſual and common acceptation of the word <hi>Church,</hi> of which we muſt chiefly treat, is that of a particular church; which conſiſts of a ſociety of chriſtians, meeting together in one place, under their proper paſtors, for the performance of religious worſhip, and the exerciſing of chriſtian diſcipline. This deſcription of a church is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable with the <hi>Idiom</hi> both of ſcripture and antiquity. Thus <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who lived about the end of the ſecond century, gives us an account of the ſtate, order and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the churches. (<hi>Apol. ad Gen. Cap.</hi> 39.) The deſcription of a church he firſt lays down in theſe words, <hi>viz. Corpus ſumus de Conſcientia Religionis, et Diſciplinae Unitate, et Spei Foedere.</hi> We are a body united in the conſcience of religion, or for the conſciencious obſervation of the duties of religion; by an agreement in diſcipline, and in a covenant of hope. For whereas ſuch a body, or religious ſociety could not be united but by a covenant; he calls it a covenant of hope, becauſe the principal reſpect therein was had unto the things hoped for. This religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body, or ſociety thus united by covenant, did meet together in the ſame aſſembly, or congregation. For ſays he, <hi>Corpus ſumus, Coimus in Coetum, et Congregationem ut ad Deum, &amp;c.</hi> We are a body, and meet in an aſſembly, and congregation, to offer up our prayers unto God, and attend the duties of the chriſtian religion. So <hi>Iraeneus</hi> alſo in the ſecond century, tells us, <hi>That ſome of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſometimes the whole church of ſome certain place,— by faſting and prayer have raiſed the dead.</hi> Thus our own platform agrees in ſenſe with the opinion of the ancients. <hi>Plat. Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>A congregational church, is by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt, a part of the militant church, conſiſting of a company of ſaints by calling, united into one body by an holy covenant,</hi> &amp;c. But as to the independency, or real diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between church and church; this will more clearly appear in what follows. Therefore I ſhall proceed to conſider the conſtituent parts of a church, as divided,</p>
                     <p n="1">

                     <p>I SHALL proceed to diſtribute and enumerate the operations and immunities of the churches.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. With relation to the peculiar acts of the officers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The peculiar acts of the laity, or fraternity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The joint acts of them both; as performing the work and buſineſs of an organic church, or compleat corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I ſhall laſtly make ſome obſervations upon the union of diſtinct churches, by acts of ſiſterly fellowſhip or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And hereby I ſhall compleat the parallel, in the eſſentials of order, between the primitive churches, and thoſe of this country.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The peculiar acts of the officers or clergy. Under this head might be conſidered the functions of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular order, and degree of the clergy; which we may ſay were according to the pureſt antiquity, but three, viz. biſhops, prieſts or preſbyters, and deacons. I ſhall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally conſider the biſhop as the chief officer in truſt and dignity, in the primitive church. And in order to it,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In general obſerve, that though there were ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions in point of a tetular dignity and degree between a biſhop and preſbyter; yet they were really equal in order, and in the nature of their truſt. For that in an eccleſiaſtical ſenſe, biſhop and preſbyters are ſynonimous terms, ſetting forth the ſame office; and ſignify no more but an elder, a paſtor, ruler, or overſeer of a church.

                        <hi>Ignatius</hi> calls the apoſtles themſelves the preſbyters of the church; and <hi>Theodoret</hi> renders the reaſon of the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for ſaith he,
<q>The holy ſcriptures called the chief men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the ſenate or elderſhip.</q>
                        <hi>Wilſ. Dict.</hi> And indeed according to the apoſtle himſelf, preſbyters, or elders, and biſhop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, are plainly terms of office; and of equal ſignification. As in <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 5, 7. <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in</hi> Crete, <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt—ordain elders—For a biſhop muſt be blameleſs, as the ſteward of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In this diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hes, as head and chief officer of the church; for according to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> there was but one biſhop, ſtrickly ſo called, in a church at a time, though at the ſame time there were many elders or preſbyters in the ſame church; and the biſhop in a peculiar manner was related to his flock, as a paſtor to his ſheep and a parent to his children. <hi>Cyp. Epiſt.</hi> 38. § 1. <hi>p.</hi> 90. And the titles of this ſupreme church officer, are moſt of them reckoned up in one place, in <hi>Cyp. Epiſt.</hi> 96. <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhop, paſtor, preſident, governor, ſuperintendant or prieſt. And this officer is he, which in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is called, <hi>The angel of the church,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> thinks.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We may conſider more diſtinctly, the object of his care, or the dimenſions of the boſhops dioceſs. Its very obvious, that this great and ſuperior officer, as has been ſaid; had but one church under his paſtoral care. The dioceſſes government or dominion of theſe reverend pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, are never (according to antiquity) ſaid to contain churches, in the plural, but only a church, in the ſingular number. And the biſhop was uſually called the biſhop of this or that church. As <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Polycarp</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained biſhop of the church of <hi>Smyrna, &amp;c.</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is accurately to be obſerved, that the moſt frequent word uſed to denominate the extent of the biſhops care, or to ſet out the limits of his dioceſs, was that of a pariſh. So in the ſynodical epiſtle of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to <hi>Victor.</hi> The biſhopricks of <hi>Aſia</hi> are called pariſhes: and in the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> the word is ſo applied in ſeveral hundred pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es. It's very uſual there to read of biſhops of this and that pariſh. As the biſhop of the pariſh in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> the biſhop of the pariſh in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and in <hi>Corinth,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>c. For that the word <hi>Paroikia,</hi> which we render <hi>pariſh,</hi>
                        <pb n="11" facs="unknown:012626_0010_0F8B8F0C7A9C0B28"/>
ſignifies <hi>houſing,</hi> or <hi>living</hi> together. And in ordinary and civil uſe, it notes a village, ſmall town, or part of a town, of people or perſons dwelling together. And in a church ſenſe it ſignifies a competent number of chriſtians dwelling near together, and having one biſhop, paſtor or miniſter, or more ſet over them; with whom they meet at one time or place, to worſhip and ſerve God. So that pariſh in this ſenſe, is the ſame with a particular church or congregation. And this is plainly agreable with the ſenſe, cuſtom and platform of <hi>New-England</hi> churches.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the biſhops dioceſs exceeded not the bounds of a pariſh, or a ſmall town, or part of a town, is very evident from the following demonſtrations, according to antiquity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Demonſt.</hi> 1. For that all the people of a dioceſs did every Sunday, meet together in one place, to celebrate divine ſervice. Thus ſaith <hi>Juſtin Martyr, (Apol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 98.) All aſſemble together in one place, where the biſhop preaches, and prays.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Demonſt.</hi> 2. The biſhop had but one alter, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-table in his dioceſs, at which his whole flock re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſacrament from him. There is but one alter ſays <hi>Ignatius (Epiſt. ad Phila. p.</hi> 41.) as there is but one biſhop. So ſays <hi>Cyprian,</hi> we celebrate the ſacrament; the whole brotherhood being preſent. And thus it was in <hi>Juſtin Martyr's</hi> days. The biſhops whole dioceſs met together on Sunday, when the biſhop gave them the euchariſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Demonſt.</hi> 3. All the people of a dioceſs were preſent at church cenſures; as <hi>Origen</hi> deſcribes an offender, as appearing before the whole church. In <hi>Mat. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>m.</hi> 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Page</hi> 133. <hi>vol.</hi> 1. So <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> calls the cenſures of the church, the things commanded by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Demonſt.</hi> 4. No offenders were reſtored again to the churches peace, without the knowledge and conſent of the whole dioceſs; they were to plead their cauſe before the whole people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Demonſt.</hi> 5. When the biſhop of a church was dead, all the people of that church met together in one place to chuſe a new biſhop. So <hi>Sabinus</hi> was choſen biſhop of <hi>Emetria,</hi> by the ſuffrage of all the brotherhood. The
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012626_0011_0F8B8F0CDD7F9708"/>
whole dioceſs of the biſhops did meet together to manage church affairs. Thus when the ſchiſm of <hi>Feliciſſimus,</hi> in the biſhoprick of <hi>Carthage</hi> was to be debated, it was to be done according to the will of the people, and by the conſent of the laity. And when there were ſome hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about the reſtitution of the lapſed, <hi>Cyprian</hi> promiſed his whole dioceſs, that all thoſe things ſhould be examined before them, and judged by them. So that from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, it is very evident, that that dioceſs cannot poſſibly be more than one ſingle congregation; nor that church more than a congregational church, where all the people and members of that church meet together at one time, and in one place to pray together, to receive the ſacrament together; aſſiſt at church-cenſures together, and diſpatch church affairs together. And it is very apparent, that this was the method and way of the primitive churches, according to the preceeding obſervations. And <hi>New-England</hi> churches harmonize exactly in their common practice, as tho' they had taken their directions from them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The biſhops duty, or the ſeveral particular operations of his honourable office, were ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, praying with his people, adminiſtring the ſacraments, taking care of the poor, ordaining of miniſters, governing his flock, excommunicating of offenders, and abſolving of penitents. In a word, whatever can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized under thoſe three general heads of preaching, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and government, were parts of the biſhops function and office. And this alſo is very agreable with our plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Sex.</hi> 8. The power which Chriſt hath committed to the elders, is to feed and rule the church of God, &amp;c.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. The Prerogatives, or Peculiar Immunities of the Laity.</head>
                     <p>THE fraternity or body of the people had ſeveral high immunities inherent in them; and exerciſed by them as a church. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Voting and giving their ſuffrage, for the admiſſion and cenſure of members. To this purpoſe before.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="13" facs="unknown:012626_0012_0F8B8F0D8BACE058"/>2. The electing their own officers. For when a pariſh, or biſhoprick was vacant through the death of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, the members of that pariſh met in church to chooſe a fit perſon for his ſucceſſor; to whom they might commit the care and government of the church. When <hi>Alexander</hi> was choſen biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it was by cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion or choice of the members of that church. And ſo in the church of <hi>Rome</hi> when their biſhop was deceaſed; all the people met in the church to chooſe a ſucceſſor. <hi>Euſeb. Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. Though it is certain that after ſome time the aſpiring clergy rob'd the people of this as well as of other of their rights. As it is well repreſented by a late worthy anomolous author, writing <hi>de Ordinatione,</hi> p. 30. <hi>Creſcente Paulatim Cleri Poteſtate ad ſe magis indies,</hi> &amp;c. The power of the clergy gradually increaſing, they daily drew more new rights to themſelves, which they took from the people; thinking that the dignity which they had obtained, was not ample enough, if the people had any ſhare with them in elections. Therefore at length ſnatch or take the whole buſineſs into their own hands; the people through their ſupine negligence not much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of them. Yet that the people might be huſht into quiet (with much grace) they grant them the favor of beggars, viz. <hi>Poſtulare</hi>; to aſk for an officer. But this plundering of the churches falls within the ſecond grand diviſion of time. Not within the firſt three hundred years.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Of approbating of ordination. All the people were conſulted; and none were admitted into holy orders with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their approbation. As we are aſſured by <hi>Cyprian (Epiſt.</hi> 33.) who tells us it was his conſtant cuſtom, in all ordinations to conſult his people, and with their common counſel to weigh the merit of every candidate of the ſacred orders.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Of depoſing of their own officers the way. <hi>Pag.</hi> 96. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. For if their biſhops proved ſcandalous and wicked in life; heretical and apoſtates from the faith, the churches had power to degrade and depoſe them, and chooſe others in their room. There is a peculiar example of this kind in a letter from the church of <hi>Rome</hi> to the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> written by <hi>Clemens Romanus, Euſeb. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. upon which Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> makes this obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi> That

But yet in the whole epiſtle the church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is no where reproved, for aſſuming an authority to themſelves which did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them. It ſeems what <hi>Cyprian</hi> afterwards affirmed, was then acknowledged, namely, that the right of chooſing the worthy, and rejecting the unworthy was in the body of the people. But the <hi>Corinthian</hi> church is ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for the abuſe of their liberty and power, <hi>State of churches</hi>; p. 94. Alſo when two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> biſhops were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by their churches, that the ſaid churches might not ſeem to act by a power which belonged not to them; they ſent into <hi>Africa</hi> to ſeveral biſhops to know their judgment thereupon, who being convened in a ſynod (<hi>Anno. Dom.</hi> 258.) whereof <hi>Cyprian</hi> was preſident; they commended, and approved their proceedings; aſſuring them it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the divine law, which was expreſs, that none but thoſe that were holy and blameleſs, ſhould approach God's altar; that if they had continued to have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with their prophane biſhops, they would have been acceſſary to their guilt and villany and would have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted thoſe examples, and commands in ſcripture, which obliged a people to ſeparate from wicked, and ungodly miniſters, that they had not acted irregularly in what they had done; ſince the people had the chief power in chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worthy biſhops, ſo alſo of refuſing thoſe who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. And many other paſſages there are in that epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle which flatly aſſert the peoples power of depoſing ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous biſhops. Yet where the churches were aſſociated to render their action more unqueſtionable, they had aſſiſtance from others; but yet the power is plainly acknowledged to be inherent in the church. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 68. <hi>Apud Cyp.</hi> §. 1.2.3. <hi>p.</hi> 200.

That the laity did exerciſe judicial power in the church, is further evident from ſeveral teſtimonies. As in that of <hi>Clemens Romanus. (Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Ad Corinth,</hi> p. 69.) where he writes: <hi>Who will ſay according to the example of</hi> Moſes, <hi>If ſeditions, contentions, and ſchiſms are happened becauſe of me, I will depart, I will go whitherſoever you pleaſe, and I will do what ſhall be injoyned me by the people, ſo the church of Chriſt be in peace.</hi> So <hi>Origen</hi> diſcribes a criminal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And concerning ſuch matters he writes to the people, that when it ſhould pleaſe God to reſtore peace to the church, and reduce him from exile, then the caſe of the delinquents ſhould be examined in their preſence, and according to their judgment.

                     <p>It is very obvious by this time, (and he muſt blind his own eyes that won't ſee it) that the primitive churches according to the account we have of their regiment for the firſt three hundred years from Chriſt) were diſtinct, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical bodies; and neither diocaeſan, national, provincial nor claſſical, but properly congregational churches. And as ſuch, were perfect and compleat ſocieties incorporate; ſo that they had a power, and capacity of carrying on all church work within themſelves, and wanted not to borrow, or receive from others, for the ſupport of their being, and ſo were independent. Yet conſidering they were imperfect in their matter, and therefore to help forward their well-being, wanted the advantage of all good means; with the influence of the grace, love, knowledge, experience, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and counſel of each other; ſo they were dependent, and became mutually officious, and accountable each to other: ſomewhat after the manner, as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes

on the independency, and dependency of goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel churches. <hi>Pol. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. Says he, <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency implies two things.</hi> Either,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. An abſolute ſupremacy, oppoſed to ſubordination; and ſo a particular church is not independent, it being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to civil government, &amp;c. And alſo to the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of churches. Or,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Independency ſignifies a ſufficieny in its kind, for the attainment of its end. And in this ſenſe, independency is oppoſed to imperfection: And if we take it thus, then a particular church may be ſaid to be independent, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient to attain the end it was inſtituted for; it having compleat power, when rightly conſtituted, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe all the ordinances of God. And thus we find that the primitive churches in this ſenſe were independent churches: that is, every particular church had a ſufficient right, and power, without the concurrence and authority of any other church, to carry on the worſhip of God, and exerciſe of diſcipline in their diſtinct ſociety. And yet as they were parts of the univerſal church, held themſelves obliged to a ſuitable communion. And for the ſupport of unity, love, and concord amongſt them, and to adviſe about their common circumſtances and condition; and alſo to regulate their eccleſiaſtical affairs within their general limits, for their mutual advantage; did therefore form them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſynodical aſſemblies, &amp; and were governed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon by them; for their ſynodical decrees, canons or inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were accounted abligatory to all the churches, who had their repreſentatives in the ſynods. For indeed to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe elſe did they draw up their reſolves, but for the good and benefit of the whole community. And it would have been very fruitleſs to have made weariſome journeys, with great coſt and pains to determine ſuch things, as they judged ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the churches well-being; if after all, it were indifferent whether they were obeyed or no: or that when the whole was agreed, ſome ſhould reluct, and remonſtrate; and eſpecially when things were fairly ſettled by a joint ſuffrage in ſynods, ſome ſmall ſet of wiſe men ſhould hold themſelves wiſer than whole ſynods; and afterward ſhould of their own heads in their more private apartments ſet forward new ſchemes, which in itſelf is diſorderly, and a way to keep the churches conſtantly fluctuating and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

And indeed, conſidering the regularity, wiſdom and union in ſynodical ſettlements, whilſt that all ſorts of perſons intereſted, both officers and people having had their full liberty in debates, and their free votes and ſuffrages, in drawing up the decrees and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements; it is a bold intruſion, and little better than defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and trampling under foot the unity, love, honor an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And theſe were biſhops, preſbyters, deacons, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted lay-men, in behalf of the people of their reſpective churches. At a great ſynod at <hi>Antioch,</hi> which condemned <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> there were preſent biſhops, preſbyters, deacons, and the church of God; that is lay-men, who repreſented the people of their ſeveral churches. <hi>Euſeb. l.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 30.

I ſhall conclude this head or demonſtration with theſe weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſolemn words of the learned and famous Mr. <hi>Oakes,</hi> praeſident of the college, in his election ſermon. Conſider (ſays he) what will be the end of receeding, or making of a defection from the way of church government eſtabliſhed amongſt us. I profeſs that I look upon the diſcovery and ſettlement of the congregational way, as the boon, the gratuity, the largeneſs of divine bounty, which the Lord graciouſly beſtowed on this people, that followed him into this wilderneſs, and who were ſeperated from their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Thoſe good people who came over had more love, zeal, and affectionate deſire of communion with God, in pure worſhip and ordinances, and did more in order to it, than others; and the Lord did more for them than for any people in the world, in ſhewing them the pattern of his houſe, and the truer ſcriptural-way of church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and adminiſtrations. God was certainly in a more than ordinary way preſent with his ſervants, in laying of our foundations; and in ſettling church-order, according to the will and appointment of Chriſt. Conſider what will be the ſad iſſue of revolting from the way fixed on to one extreme or to another, whether it be to preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm or browniſm. 'As for the preſbyterians, it muſt be acknowledged, that there are amongſt them, as pious, learned, ſober, orthodox men, as the world affords; and that there is as much of the power of godlineſs among that party, and of the ſpirit of the good old puritans, as among any people in the world. And as for the ways of their church government, it muſt be confeſſed, that in the day of it, it was a great ſtep to reformation. The refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in king <hi>Edward</hi>'s days, was a bleſſed work, and the reformation of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> was then a larger ſtep, and in many reſpects purer than the other. And for my part, I fully believe that the congregational-way far exceeds both, and is the higheſt ſtep that has been taken towards reformation; and for the ſubſtance of it, it is the very ſame way that was eſtabliſhed and practiſed in the primitive times, according to the inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt.' Thus ends my firſt demonſtration in a fair paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel drawn up between the holieſt churches that ever were in
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012626_0019_0F8B8F179C266008"/>
the world, and the churches of <hi>New-England</hi>; and however they may differ in their morals, they are very harmonious in their order. And conſidering that the former cannot rationally be thought but they derived their conſtitution from the apoſtles, and ſo it muſt needs be of a divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: and if ſo then theſe in <hi>New-England</hi> who are faſhioned ſo exactly like them, muſt needs be of the ſame pedigree, &amp;c. But I ſhall wave all improvement of the premiſes, and leave the whole to the ſerious and judicious thoughts of every impartial reader, not doubting but he will find ſufficient evidence of the divine original of theſe churches in what has been ſaid. And that I might now obtain a <hi>ſuperſedeas,</hi> and forbear adding any further plea in their defence. But yet to gratify my own curioſity, and divert the reader, I ſhall proceed to inquire in to the natural reaſon of the conſtitution of thoſe churches we have been comparing. In this queſtion I ſhall go out of the common road, and take into an unuſual and unbeaten path; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in poſſibly I may fall into ſome thickets now and then, and be ſomewhat entangled; yet I hope the candid reader will afford ſome ſuccour by his tender clemency, and his friendly interpretation of my good intentions. For tho' I may in ſo devious a way, miſs of ſome part of the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet I have a great preſumption that I may open a road to men of greater learning, and a deeper ſearch, that will lead to a rich treaſure of knowledge, and wiſdom, for eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief under thoſe many queſtions and crabbed debates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning church-government in the chriſtian world; for to me it ſeems moſt apparent, that under Chriſt the reaſon of the conſtitution of theſe and the primitive churches, is really and truly owing to the original ſtate and liberty of mankind, and founded puculiarly in the light of nature.

I Shall diſcloſe ſeveral principles of natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; plainly diſcovering the law of nature; or the true ſentiments of natural reaſon, with reſpect to mans being and government. And in this eſſay I ſhall peculiarly confine the diſcourſe to two heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Of the natural (in diſtinction to the civil) and then,</item>
                        <item>2. Of the civil being of man. And I ſhall principally take baron <hi>Puffendorff</hi> for my chief guide and ſpokeſ-man.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. I ſhall conſider man in a ſtate of natural being, as a free-born ſubject under the crown of heaven, and owing homage to none but God himſelf. It is certain civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in general, is a very admirable reſult of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and an incomparable benefit to mankind, yet muſt needs be acknowledged to be the effect of human free-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts and not of divine inſtitution; it is the produce of mans reaſon, of human and rational combinations, and not from any direct orders of infinite wiſdom, in any poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive law wherein is drawn up this or that ſcheme of civil government. Government (ſays the Lord <hi>Warrington</hi>) is neceſſary—in that no ſociety of men can ſubſiſt without it; and that particular form of government is neceſſary which beſt ſuits the temper and inclination of a people. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be God's ordinance, but what he has particularly declared to be ſuch; there is no particular form of civil government deſcribed in God's word, neither does nature prompt it. The government of the Jews was changed five times. Government is not formed by nature, as other births or productions; if it were, it would be the ſame in all countries; becauſe nature keeps the ſame method, in the ſame thing, in all climates. If a common-wealth be changed into a monarchy, is it nature that forms, and brings forth the monarch? Or if a royal family be wholly extinct (as in <hi>Noah</hi>'s caſe, being not heir apparent from deſcent from Adam) is it nature that muſt go to work (with the kings bees, who themſelves alone preſerve the royal race in that empire) to breed a monarch before the people can have a king, or a government ſent over them? And thus we muſt leave kings to reſolve which is their beſt title to their crowns, whether natural right, or the conſtitution of government ſettled by human compacts,

under the direction and conduct of reaſon. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed under the head of a ſtate of natural being, I ſhall more diſtinctly explain the ſtate of human nature in its original capacity, as man is placed on earth by his maker, and cloathed with many inveſtitures, and immunities which properly belong to man ſeparately conſidered. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The prime immunity in mans ſtate, is that he is moſt properly the ſubject of the law of nature. He is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite animal on earth; in that this part of God's image, <hi>viz.</hi> reaſon is congenate with his nature, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in by a law immutable, inſtampt upon his frame, God has provided a rule for men in all their actions, obliging each one to the performance of that which is right, not only as to juſtice, but likewiſe as to all other moral virtues, the which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the dictate of right reaſon founded in the ſoul of man. <hi>Molloy, De Mao, Praef.</hi> That which is to be drawn from mans reaſon, flowing from the true current of that faculty, when unperverted, may be ſaid to be the law of nature, on which account, the holy ſcriptures declare it written on mens hearts. For being endowed with a ſoul, you may know from yourſelf, how and what you ought to act. Rom. 2.14. <hi>Theſe having not a law, are a law to themſelves.</hi> So that the meaning is, when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the law of nature to be the dictate of right reaſon, we muſt mean that the underſtanding of man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with ſuch a power, as to be able, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of human condition to diſcover a neceſſity of living agreably with this law: And likewiſe to find out ſome principle, by which the precepts of it, may be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſolidly demonſtrated. The way to diſcover the law of nature in our own ſtate, is by a narrow watch, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate contemplation of our natural condition, and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Others ſay this is the way to find out the law of nature. <hi>ſcil.</hi> If a man any ways doubts, whether what he is going to do to another man be agreable to the law of nature, then let him ſuppoſe himſelf to be in that other mans room; and by this rule effectually executed, a man muſt be a very dull ſcholar to nature not to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the knowledge of her laws.

                     <p n="3">3. An affection or love to mankind in general. And to give ſuch ſentiments the force of a law, we muſt ſuppoſe a God who takes care of all mankind, and has thus obliged each one, as a ſubject of higher principles of being, than meer inſtincts. For that all law properly conſidered, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a capable ſubject, and a ſuperiour power, and the law of God which is binding, is publiſhed by the dictates of right re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> as other ways: Therefore ſays <hi>Plutarch,</hi> to follow God and obey reaſon is the ſame thing. But moreover that God has eſtabliſhed the law of nature, as the general rule of government, is further illuſtrable from the man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſanctions in providence, and from the peace and guilt of conſcience in them that either obey, or violate the law of nature. But moreover, the foundation of the law of nature with relation to government, may be thus diſcovered. <hi>ſcil.</hi> Man is a creature extreamly deſirous of his own preſervation; of himſelf he is plainly expoſed to many wants, unable to ſecure his own ſafety and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, without the aſſiſtance of his fellows; &amp; he is alſo able of returning kindneſs by the furtherance of mutual good; but yet man is often found to be malicious, inſolent, and eaſily provoked, and as powerful in effecting miſchief, as he is ready in deſigning it. Now that ſuch a creature may be preſerved, it is neceſſary that he be ſociable; that is, that he be capable and diſpoſed to unite himſelf to thoſe of his own ſpecies, and to regulate himſelf towards them, that they may have no fair reaſon to do him harm; but rather incline to promote his intereſts, and ſecure his rights and concerns. This then is a fundamental law of nature, that every man as far as in him lies, do maintain a ſociableneſs with others, agreable with the main end and diſpoſition of human nature in general. For this is very apparent, that reaſon and ſociety render man the moſt potent of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And finally, from the principles of ſociableneſs it follows as a fundamental law of nature, that man is not ſo wedded to his own intereſt, but that he can make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good the mark of his aim: and hence he becomes capacitated to enter into a civil ſtate by the law of nature; for without this property in nature, viz. Sociableneſs,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012626_0024_0F8B8F1B0B3F3DF0"/>
which is for cementing of parts, every government would ſoon moulder and diſſolve.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond great immunity of man is an original liberty inſtampt upon his rational nature. He that intrudes upon this liberty, violates the law of nature. In this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I ſhall wave the conſideration of mans moral turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but ſhall view him phyſically as a creature which God has made and furniſhed eſſentially with many enobl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immunities, which render him the moſt auguſt animal in the world, and ſtill, whatever has happened ſince his creation, he remains at the upper-end of nature, and as ſuch is a creature of a very noble character. For as to his dominion, the whole frame of the lower part of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is devoted to his uſe, and at his command, and his liberty under the conduct of right reaſon, is equal with his truſt. Which liberty may be briefly conſidered, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally as to his mind, and externally as to his perſon.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The native internal liberty of man's nature implies, a faculty of doing or omitting things according to the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his judgment. But in a more ſpecial meaning, this liberty does not conſiſt in a looſe and ungovernable free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or in an unbounded licence of acting. Such licence is diſagreeing with the condition and dignity of man, and would make man of a lower and meaner conſtitution than brute creatures; who in all their liberties are kept under a better and a more rational government, by their inſtincts. Therefore as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, Thoſe perſons only who live in obedience to reaſon, are worthy to be accounted free: They alone live as they will, who have learnt what they ought to will. So that the true natural liberty of man, ſuch as really and truely agrees to him, muſt be underſtood, as he is guided and reſtrained by the tyes of reaſon, and laws of nature; all the reſt is brutal, if not worſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Mans external perſonal, natural liberty, antecedent to all human parts, or alliances muſt alſo be conſidered. And ſo every man muſt be conceived to be perfectly in his own power and diſpoſal, and not ro be controuled by the authority of any other. And thus every man, muſt be acknowledged equal to every man, ſince all ſubjection and all command are equally baniſhed on both ſides; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering all men thus at liberty, every m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to judge for himſelf, viz. What ſhall be moſt for his behoof, happineſs and well-being.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third capital immunity belonging to mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is an equality amongſt men; which is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the law of nature, till man has reſigned himſelf with all his rights for the ſake of a civil ſtate; and then his perſonal liberty and equality is to be cheriſhed, and preſerved to the higheſt degree, as will conſiſt with all juſt diſtinctions amongſt men of honor, and ſhall be agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the public good. For man has a high valuation of himſelf, and the paſſion ſeems to lay its firſt foundation (not in pride, but) really in the high and admirable frame and conſtitution of human nature. The word man ſays my author, is thought to carry ſomewhat of dignity in its ſound; and we commonly make uſe of this as the moſt proper and prevailing arguments againſt a rude inſulter, <hi>viz. I am not a beaſt or a dog: But am a man as well as yourſelf.</hi> Since then human nature agrees equally with all perſons; and ſince no one can live a ſociable life with another that does not own or reſpect him as a man; it follows as a command of the law of nature, that every man eſteem and treat another as one who is naturally his equal, or who is a man as well as he. There be many popular, or plauſible reaſons that greatly illuſtrate this equality, viz. that we all derive our being from one ſtock, the ſame common father of human race.

we all owe our exiſtence to the ſame method of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The nobleſt mortal in his entrance on the ſtage of life, is not diſtinguiſhed by any pomp or of paſſage from the loweſt of mankind; and our life haſtens to the ſame general mark: Death obſerves no ceremony, but knocks as loud at the barriers of the court, as at the door of the cottage. This equality being admitted, bears a very great force in maintaining peace and friendſhip amongſt men. For that he who would uſe the aſſiſtance of others, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting his own advantage, ought as freely to be at their ſervice when they want his help on the like occaſions. One good turn requires another, is the common proverb; for otherwiſe he muſt need eſteem others unequal to himſelf, who conſtantly demands their aid, and as conſtantly denies his own. And whoever is of this inſolent temper, cannot but highly diſpleaſe thoſe about him, and ſoon give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the breach of the common peace. It was a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproof which <hi>Charactacus</hi> gave the <hi>Romans. Num Si vos Omnibus,</hi> &amp;c. What! becauſe you deſire to be maſters of all men, does it follow therefore that all men ſhould deſire to be your ſlaves, for that it is a command of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures law, that no man that has not obtained a particular and ſpecial right, ſhall arrogate to himſelf a larger ſhare than his fellows, but ſhall admit others to equal privileges with himſelf. So that the principle of equality in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, is peculiarly tranſgreſſed by pride, which is when a man without ſufficient reaſon, prefers, himſelf to others. And though as <hi>Henſius,</hi> paraphraſes upon <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> politicks to this purpoſe. viz. Nothing is more ſuitable to nature, than that thoſe who excel in underſtanding and prudence, ſhould rule and controul thoſe who are leſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in thoſe advantages, &amp;c. Yet we muſt note, that there is room for an anſwer, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That it would be the greateſt abſurdity to believe, that nature actually inveſts the wiſe with a ſovereignity over the weak; or with a right of forcing them againſt their wills; for that no ſovereignity can be eſtabliſhed, unleſs ſome human deed, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant precede: Nor does natural fitneſs for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make a man preſently governor over another; for that as <hi>Ulpian</hi> ſays, <hi>by a natural right all men are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

without inequality; and this cannot be made without uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation or force in others, or voluntary compliance in thoſe who reſign their freedom, and give away their degree of natural being. And thus we come,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To conſider man in a civil ſtate of being; wherein we ſhall obſerve the great difference between a natural, and political ſtate; for in the latter ſtate many great diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions appear, or at leaſt many obvious diſtinctions are ſoon made amongſt men; which doctrine is to be laid open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a few heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Every man conſidered in a natural ſtate, muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be free, and at his own diſpoſe; yet to ſuit mans inclinations to ſociety; and in a peculiar manner to gratify the neceſſity he is in of public rule and order, he is impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to enter into a civil community; and diveſts himſelf of his natural freedom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd puts himſelf under government; which amongſt other th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>gs comprehends the power of life and death over him, together with authority to enjoin him ſome things to which he has an utter averſion, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit him other things, for which he may have as ſtrong an inclination; ſo that he may be often under this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, obliged to ſacrifice his private, for the public good. So that though man is inclined to ſociety, yet he is driven to a combination by great neceſſity. For that the true and leading cauſe of forming governments, and yielding up natural liberty, and throwing mans equality into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pile to be new caſt by the rules of fellowſhip; was really and truly to guard themſelves againſt the injuries men were liable to interchangeably; for none ſo good to man, as man, and yet none a greater enemy. So that,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The firſt human ſubject and original of civil power is the people. For as they have a power every man over himſelf in a natural ſtate, ſo upon a combination they can and do bequeath this power unto others; and ſettle it according as their united diſcretion ſhall determine. For that this is very plain that when the ſubject of ſovereign power is quite extinct, that power returns to the people again. And when they are free, they may ſet up what ſpecies of government they pleaſe; or if they rather incline to it, they may ſubſide into a ſtate of natural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if it be plainly for the beſt. In the Eaſtern country of the <hi>Magul,</hi> we have ſome reſemblance of the caſe; for
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012626_0028_0F8B8F22911D4578"/>
upon the death of an abſolute monarch, they live ſo many days without a civil head; but in that <hi>Interregnum,</hi> thoſe who ſurvive the vacancy, are glad to get into a civil ſtate again; and uſually they are in a very bloody condition when they return under the covert of a new monarch; this project is to indear the people to a tyranny, from the experience they have ſo lately had of an anarchy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The formal reaſon of government is the will of a community, yielded up and ſurrendered to ſome other ſubject, either of one particular perſon, or more, conveyed in the following manner.</p>
                     <p>Let us conceive in our mind a multitude of men, all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally free and equal; going about voluntarily, to erect themſelves into a new common-wealth. Now their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition being ſuch, to bring themſelves into a politick body, they muſt needs enter into divers covenants.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They muſt interchangeably each man covenant to join in one laſting ſociety, that they may be capable to concert the meaſures of their ſafety, by a public vote.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A vote or decree muſt then nextly paſs to ſet up ſome particular ſpecies of government over them. And if they are joined in their firſt compact upon abſolute terms to ſtand to the deciſion of the firſt vote concerning the ſpecies of government: Then all are bound by the majority to acquieſce in that particular form thereby ſettled, though their own private opinion, incline them to ſome other model.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. After a decree has ſpecified the particular form of government, then there will be need of a new covenant, whereby thoſe on whom ſovereignity is conferred, engage to take care of the common peace, and welfare. And the ſubjects on the other hand, to yield them faithful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. In which covenant is included that ſubmiſſion and union of wills, by which a ſtate may be conceived to be but one perſon. So that the moſt proper definition of a civil ſtate, is this, viz. A civil ſtate is a compound moral perſon. Whoſe will (united by thoſe covenants before paſſed) is the will of all; to the end it may uſe, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ſtrength and riches of private perſons towards maintaining the common pence, ſecurity, and well-being of all, which may be conceived as tho' the whole ſtate was now become but one man; in which the aforeſaid cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants may be ſuppoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="8">8. Sedition is ſickneſs, and civil war death.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The parts of ſovereignity may be conſidered: So,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As it preſcribes the rule of action: It is rightly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med legiſlative power.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As it determines the controverſies of ſubjects by the ſtandard of thoſe rules. So is it juſtly termed judiciary power.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As it arms the ſubjects againſt foreigners, or forbids hoſtility, ſo its called the power of peace and war.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As it takes in miniſters for the diſcharge of buſineſs, ſo it is called the right of appointing magiſtrates. So that all great officers and public ſervants, muſt needs owe their original to the creating power of ſovereignty. So that thoſe whoſe right it is to create, may diſſolve the being of thoſe who are created, unleſs they caſt them into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal frame. And yet muſt needs be diſſoluble if they juſtly forfeit their being to their creators.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The chief end of civil communities, is that men thus conjoined, may be ſecured againſt the injuries, they are liable to from their own kind. For if every man could ſecure himſelf ſingly; it would be great folly for him, to renounce his natural liberty, in which every man is his own king and protector.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The ſovereign authority beſides, that it inheres in every ſtate as in a common and general ſubject. So far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according as it reſides in ſome one perſon, or in a council (conſiſting of ſome ſelect perſons, or of all
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012626_0030_0F8B8F249F247150"/>
the members of a community) as in a proper and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſubject, ſo it produceth different forms of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, viz. Such as are either ſimple and regular, or mixt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The forms of a regular ſtate are three only, which forms ariſe from the proper and particular ſubject, in which the ſupream power reſides. As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A democracy; which is when the ſovereign power is lodged in a council conſiſting of all the members, and where every member has the privilege of a vote. This form of government, appears in the greateſt part of the world to have been the moſt ancient. For that reaſon ſeems to ſhew it to be moſt probable, That when men (being originally in a condition of natural freedom and equality) had thoughts of joining in a civil body, would without queſtion be inclined to adminiſter their common affairs, by their common judgment, and ſo muſt neceſſarily to gratify that inclination eſtabliſh a democracy; neither can it be rationally imagined, that fathers of families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet free and independent, ſhould in a moment, or little time take of their long delight in governing their own affairs, and devolve all upon ſome ſingle ſovereign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; for that it ſeems to have been thought more equitable, that what belonged to all ſhould be managed by all, when all had entered by compact into one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. The original of our government, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> (ſpeaking of the <hi>Athenian</hi> common-wealth) was taken from the equality of our race. Other ſtates there are compoſed of different blood, and of unequal lines, the conſequence of which are diſproportionable ſovereignity, tyranical or oligarchycal ſway; under which men live in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to eſteem themſelves partly lords, and partly ſlaves to each other. But we and our countrymen, being all born brethren of the ſame mother, do not look upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſtand under ſo hard a relation, as that of lords and ſlaves; but the parity of our deſcent incline us to keep up the like parity by our laws, and to yield the precedency to nothing but to ſuperior virtue and wiſdom. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it ſeems to very manifeſt that moſt civil communities aroſe at firſt from the union of families, that were nearly allied in race and blood. And though ancient ſtory make frequent mention of kings, yet it appears that moſt of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012626_0031_0F8B8F24CB6DF2F8"/>
them were ſuch that had an influence rather in perſwading, than in any power of commanding.

                     <p>A democracy is then erected, when a number of free perſons, do aſſemble together, in order to enter into a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for uniting themſelves in a body: And ſuch a preparative aſſembly hath ſome appearance already of a democracy; it is a democracy in <hi>embrio,</hi> properly in this reſpect, that every man hath the priviledge freely to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his opinion concerning the common affairs. Yet he who diſſents from the vote of the majority, is not in the leaſt obliged by what they determine, till by a ſecond covenant, a popular form be actually eſtabliſhed; for not before then can we call it a democratical government, <hi>viz.</hi> Till the right of determining all matters relating to the public ſafety, is actually placed in a general aſſembly of the whole people; or by their own compact and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al agreement, determine themſelves the proper ſubjects for the exerciſe of ſovereign power. And to compleat this ſtate, and render it capable to exert its power to anſwer the end of a civil ſtate: Theſe conditions are neceſſary.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That a certain time and place be aſſigned for aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That when the aſſembly be orderly met, as to time and place, that then the vote of the majority muſt paſs for the vote of the whole body.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That magiſtrates be appointed to exerciſe the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the whole for the better diſpatch of buſineſs, of every days occurrence; who alſo may with more mature diligence, ſearch into more important affairs; and if in caſe any thing happens of greater conſequence, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it to the aſſembly; and be peculiarly ſerviceable in putting all public decrees into execution. Becauſe a large body of people is almoſt uſeleſs in reſpect of the laſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and of many others as to the more particular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and exerciſe of power. Therefore it is moſt agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the law of nature, that they inſtitute their officers to act in their name, and ſtead.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſpecies of regular government, is an ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy;
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012626_0032_0F8B8F25832636A0"/>
and this is ſaid then to be conſtituted when the people, or aſſembly united by a firſt covenant, and having thereby caſt themſelves into the firſt rudiments of a ſtate; do then by common decree, devolve the ſovereign power, on a council conſiſting of ſome ſelect members; and theſe having accepted of the deſignation, are then properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with ſovereign command; and then an ariſtocracy is formed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third ſpecies of a regular government, is a monarchy, which is ſettled when the ſovereign power is conferred on ſome one worthy perſon. It differs from the former, becauſe a monarch who is but one perſon in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as well as in moral account, and ſo is furniſhed with an immediate power of exerciſing ſovereign command in all inſtances of government; but the forenamed muſt needs have particular time and place aſſigned; but the power and authority is equal in each.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Mixt governments, which are various and of divers kinds (not now to be enumerated) yet poſſibly the faireſt in the world is that which has a regular monarchy; ſettled upon a noble democracy as its baſis. And each part of the government is ſo adjuſted by pacts and laws that renders the whole conſtitution an <hi>eliſium.</hi> It is ſaid of the Britiſh empire, that it is ſuch a monarchy, as that by the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſubordinate concurrence of the lords and commons, in the making and repealing all ſtatutes or acts of parliament; it hath the main advantages of an ariſtocracy, and of a democracy, and yet free from the diſadvantages and evils of either. It is ſuch a monarchy, as by moſt admirable temperament affords very much to the induſtry, liberty, and happineſs of the ſubject, and reſerves enough for the majeſty and prerogative of any king, who will own his people as ſubjects, not as ſlaves, It is a kingdom, that of all the kingdoms of the world, is moſt like to the kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe yoke is eaſy, and burden light.

                     <p n="2">2. I ſhall now make ſome improvement of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012626_0033_0F8B8F2BB4951328"/>
principles of civil knowledge, fairly deduced from the law of nature. And I ſhall peculiarly refer to eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs, whereby we may in probability diſcover more clearly the kind, and ſomething of the nature of that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which Chriſt has placed in and over his church. The learned debates of men, and divine writ ſometimes ſeems to caſt ſuch a grandeur on the church and its officers, as though they ſtood in peerage with civil empire. Rev. 1.6, 9. 1 Pet. 2.9. 1 Cor. 4.8. 1 Cor. 12.28. 2 Cor. 10.8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t all ſuch expreſſions muſt needs be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways interpreted. God is the higheſt cauſe that acts by council; and it muſt needs be altogether repugnant, to think he ſhould fore-caſt the ſtate of this world by no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſcheme, than to order two ſovereign powers, in the ſame grand community, which would be like placing two ſuns in the firmament, which would be to ſet the univerſe into a flame : That ſhould ſuch an error happen, one muſt needs be forthwith extinguiſhed, to bring the frame of nature into a juſt temper and keep it out of harms way. But to proceed with my purpoſe I ſhall go back upon the civil ſcheme, and inquire after two things: Firſt of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt government in general, and then in ſpecial; whether any of the aforeſaid ſpecies of regular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be predictable of the church of God on earth.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In general, concerning rebellion againſt government, for particular ſubjects to break in upon regular communites duly eſtabliſhed, is from the premiſes to violate the law of nature; and is a high uſurpation upon the firſt grand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of mankind. Such rebels in ſtates, and uſurpers in churches affront the world, with a preſumption that the beſt of the brotherhood are a company of fools, and that themſelves have fairly monopolized all the reaſon of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature. Yea, they take upon them the boldneſs to aſſume a prerogative of trampling under foot the natural original equality and liberty of their fellows; for to puſh the proprietors of ſettlements out of poſſeſſion of their old, and impoſe new ſchemes upon them, is vertually to declare them in a ſtate of vaſſalage, or that they were born ſo; and therefore will the uſurper be ſo gracious as to inſure them they ſhall not be ſold at the next market: they muſt eſteem it a favor, for by this time all the original prerogatives of mans nature are intentionally a victim,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012626_0034_0F8B8F2C88A48E10"/>
ſmoaking to ſatiate the uſurpers ambition. It is a very tart obſervation on an Engliſh monarch, and where it may by proportion be applied to a ſubject muſt needs ſink very deep, and ſerve for evidence under this head. It is in the ſecret hiſtory of K. <hi>C.</hi> 2. and K. <hi>J.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 2. ſays my author, Where the conſtitution of a nation is ſuch, that the laws of the land are the meaſures both of the ſovereigns commands, and the obedience of the ſubjects, whereby it is provided; that as the one are not to invade what by conceſſions and ſtipulations is granted to the ruler; ſo the other is not to deprive them of their lawful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined rights and liberties; then the prince who ſtrives to ſubvert the fundamental laws of the ſociety, is the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and the rebel, and not the people, who endeavor to preſerve and defend their own. It's very applicable to particular men in their rebellions or uſurpations in church or ſtate.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In ſpecial I ſhall now proceed to enquire, whether any of the aforeſaid ſpecies of regular, unmixt governments, can with any good ſhew of reaſon be predictable of the church of Chriſt on earth. If the churches of Chriſt, as churches, are either the object or ſubject of a ſovereign power intruſted in the hands of men, then moſt certainly one of the fore-cited ſchemes of a perfect government will be applicable to it.</p>
                     <p>Before I purſue the enquiry, it may not be improper to pauſe, and make ſome caution here, by diſtinguiſhing between that which may have ſome reſemblance of civil power, and the thing itſelf; and ſo the power of churches is but a faint reſemblance of civil power; it comes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality nothing near to the thing itſelf; for the one is truly coercive, the other perſuaſive; the one is ſovereign power, the other is delegated and miniſterial: but not to delay, I ſhall proceed with my enquiry, and therein ſhall endeavor to humor the ſeveral great claimers of government in the church of Chriſt. And,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I ſhall begin with a monarchy. It's certain, his holineſs, either by reaſonable pleas, or powerful cheats, has aſſumed an abſolute and univerſal ſovereignity; this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ills his cathedral chair, and is adorned with a triple crown, and in defence thereof does proteſt, The Almighty has made him both key-keeper of heaven and hell, with
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012626_0035_0F8B8F2D06066390"/>
the adjacent territories of purgatory, and veſted in him an abſolute ſovereignity over the chriſtian world. And his right has ſo far prevailed, that princes and civil monarchs hold their crowns and donations as his dutiful ſons, and loyal ſubjects, he therefore decks himſelf with the ſpoils of the divine attributes, ſtiling himſelf, our Lord God, <hi>optimum, maximum et ſupremum numen in Terris</hi>; a God on earth, a viſible deity, and that his power is abſolute, and his wiſdom infallible. And many of the great potentates of the earth have paid their fealty, as though it was really ſo. One of them clad in canvas, going bare-foot in the depth of winter, (in obedience to the decree, ſtinting the pennance in proportion to the wickedneſs of princes) has waited many days for abſolution at his pious ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s. Another has thrown himſelf down proſtrate a humble peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent before him : He has placed his holy foot on the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs profane neck as cruſhing a vermine, crawling out of the ſtable of his ſovereignty; and others frequently kiſs his toes with very profound devotion. Theſe and ſuch like triumphant ſignals of his ſovereign power does he wear. And indeed if he is the univerſal monarch of the catholic church, princes that are members of it muſt needs knock under; for that in one world there cannot poſſibly be two <hi>Moſt High</hi>'s, any more than two <hi>Infinites.</hi> Thus you ſee the clergy, or goſpel miniſtry of the chriſtian world have ſo wiſely handled buſineſs, and managed the goſpel, that they have fairly (as they avouch) found a ſovereign power bequeathed in it to the miniſtry of Chriſt, and romaging more warily and nicely, at laſt found a ſpiritual monarch, very compleatly furniſhed with the keys of all ſorts of power hanging at his girdle; and may we not pronounce the wiſer they! ſeeing the world growing weary of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was willing to loll itſelf down to ſleep, and leave them in ſole truſt with the whole intereſt of God's kingdom. But the ſad enquiry is, whether this ſort of government has not plainly ſubverted the deſign of the goſpel, and the end for which Chriſt's government was ordained, viz. the moral, ſpiritual, and eternal happineſs of men?</p>
                     <p>But I have no occaſion to purſue this remark with tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous demonſtrations: It's very plain, it's written with blood in capital letters, to be read at midnight by the flames of <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and other ſuch like conſecrated fires.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012626_0036_0F8B8F2DC508AE58"/>
That the government of this eccleſiaſtical monarch has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſanctifying, abſolutely debauched the world, and ſubverted all good chriſtianity in it. So that without the leaſt ſhew of any vain preſumption we may infer, that God and wiſe nature were never propitious to the birth of this monſter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. An Ariſtocracy, which places the ſupream power in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect company of choice perſons. Here I freely acknowledge were the goſpel miniſtry eſtabliſhed the ſubject of this power, viz. To will and do, in all church affairs without controul, &amp;c. This government might do to ſupport the church in its moſt valuable rights, &amp;c. If we could be aſſured they would make the ſcripture, and not their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate will the rule of their perſonal and miniſterial actions: and indeed upon theſe terms any ſpecies of government, might ſerve the great deſign of redemption; but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how great an intereſt is embarked, and how frail a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom we truſt, though we ſhould rely upon the beſt of men, eſpecially if we remember what is in the hearts of good men, (viz. much ignorance, abundance of ſmall ends, many times cloked with a high pretence in rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ion; pride ſkulking and often breeding revenge upon a ſmall affront; and blown up by a pretended zeal; yet really and truly by nothing more divine than intereſt or ill nature) and alſo conſidering how very uncertain we are of the real good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe we eſteem good men; and alſo how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is to ſecure the intail of it to ſucceſſors: and alſo if we remind how chriſtianity by the foreſaid principle has been peel'd, rob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d and ſpolied already; it cannot conſiſt with the light of nature to venture again upon ſuch perils, eſpecially if we can find a ſafer way home. More diſtinctly.</p>
                     <p>It is very plain (allowing me to ſpeak emblematically) the primitive conſtitution of the churches was a democracy as appears by the foregoing parallel. But after the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian churches, were received into the favor of the imperial court, under the dominion of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great; there being many pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>liminaries which had furniſhed the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with a diſpoſition thereunto, they quickly deprived the fraternities of their rights in the government of the churches, when they were once provided of a plentiful maintenance though the liberality of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that when
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012626_0037_0F8B8F2F2113FCB0"/>
chriſtianity was ſo luxuriantly treated, as by his great bounty, and noble ſettlement, it is ſaid there was a voice heard from heaven, ſaying, Now is P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> poured into the church. But the ſubverſion of the conſtitution, is a ſtory too long now to tell. Take therefore part of it, out of a late author well verſed in antiquity, which may give ſome brief image of the whole.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Non multa ſeculu jus Plebis Illaeſum Manſit, neque Aliter Evenire Potuit, Quin Ill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The right of the people did not remain unhurt through many ages; neither could it well be otherways, but that it muſt be loſt, or much diminiſhed. <hi>Zonaras</hi> does confeſs that heretofore biſhops were choſen by the ſuffrage of the people. But many ſeditions happening among them; it was decreed that every biſhop ſhould hereafter be choſen by the authority of the biſhops of every province. The cauſe ſeemed to be ſo very ſpecious, that nothing could be more decent, or more conducive to the ſafety of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</p>
                     <p>Yet (ſays my author) if you do well weigh the buſineſs, you muſt needs acknowledge nothing could have happened more pernicious or deſtructive to the church of God. For ſoon after theſe things came to paſs, it is very obvious, that tyranny over the conſciences of the faithful; and an intolerable pride every where grew rampant among the guides of the church. Yet there was one thing ſtill very needful to be done; and that was to eſtabliſh or confirm the power which the metropolitans, and biſhops had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to themſelves. Therefore they fell to it tooth and nail to drive away the fraternity from all intereſt in electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And alas poor hearts! They began to ſleep with both ears; that then was ſcarce any enemy left to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, or controul the conquerors. This was the manner of the clergy till they had made themſelves the ſubjects of all power, and then acted arbitrarily, and did what they pleaſed in the church of God.</p>
                     <p>But let the learned, knowing world conſider, what the iſſue of all this was, <hi>ſcil.</hi> what a wretched capacity the drowſineſs and cowardiſe of the people; and the uſurpation and ambition of the miniſtry brought the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If thoſe who were truly godly on both ſides had in a few ages look'd down from heaven, and had eyed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing centuries, they might have beheld a world of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſorrowful impreſſions; to think that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had occaſioned the ruin of millions, by their remiſs and paſſive temper in one ſort; and too much humo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That for my own part I can upon experience, in ſome meaſure truly ſay (to the hiſtory of the primitive churches in the loſs of their government; and the conſequents which followed, when I am impelled to repeat it to myſelf) as one <hi>Eneas</hi> ſaid to queen <hi>Dido,</hi>

And not only ſo but from the nature of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it has no more barrier to it, againſt the ambition, inſults, and arbitrary meaſures of men, than an abſolute monarchy.

liberty after it is reſigned, (yet under due reſtrictions) ought to be cheriſhed in all wiſe governments; or otherwiſe a man in making himſelf a ſubject, he alters himſelf from a freeman, into a ſlave, which to do is repugnant to the law of nature. Alſo the natural equality of men amongſt men muſt be duly favored; in that government was never eſtabliſhed by God or nature, to give one man a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to inſult over another; therefore in a civil, as well as in a natural ſtate of being, a juſt equality is to be indulged ſo far, as that every man is bound to honor every man, which is agreable both with nature and religion, 1 Pet. 2.17. <hi>Honor all men.</hi> The end of all good government is to cultivate humanity, and promote the happineſs of all, and the good of every man in all his rights, his life, liberty, eſtate, honor, &amp;c. without injury or abuſe done to any. Then certainly it cannot eaſily be thought, that a company of men, that ſhall enter into a voluntary compact, to hold all power in their own hands, thereby to uſe and improve their united force, wiſdom, riches and ſtrength for the common and particular good of every member, as is the nature of a democracy; I ſay it cannot be that this ſort of conſtitution, will ſo readily furniſh thoſe in government with an appetite, or diſpoſition to prey upon each other, or embezle the common ſtock; as ſome particular perſons may be apt to do when ſet off, and intruſted with the ſame power. And moreover this appears very natural, that when the aforeſaid government or power, ſettled in all, when they have elected certain capable perſons to miniſter in their affairs, and the ſaid miniſters remain accountable to the aſſembly; theſe officers muſt needs be under the influence of many wiſe cautions from their own thoughts (as well as under confinement by their commiſſion) in their whole adminiſtration: And from thence it muſt needs follow that they will be more apt, and inclined to ſteer right for the main point, viz. The peculiar good, and benefit of the whole, and every particular member fairly and ſincerely. And why may not theſe ſtand for very rational pleas in church order?</p>
                     <p>For certainly if Chriſt has ſettled any form of power in his church he has done it for his churches ſafety, and for the benefit of every member: Then he muſt needs be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to have made choice of that government as ſhould leaſt expoſe his people to hazard, either from the fraud,

or arbitrary meaſures of particular men. And it is as plain as day light, there is no ſpecies of government like a democracy to attain this end. There is but about two ſteps from an ariſtocracy to a monarchy, and from thence but one to a tyranny; an able ſtanding force, and an ill nature, <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi> turns an abſolute monarch into a tyrant; this is obvious among the Roman <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and through the world. And all theſe direful tranſmutations are eaſier in church affairs (from the different qualities of things) than in civil ſtates. For what is it that cunning and learned men can't make the world ſwallow as an article of their creed, if they are once inveſted with an uncontroulable power, and are to be the ſtanding orators to mankind in matters of faith and obedience? indeed ſome very wiſe and learned men are pleaſed to inveigh, and reproach the notion of a democracy in the church, which makes the <hi>Cetu fidelium</hi> or community of the faithful the firſt ſubject of the power of government. This they ſay tends to <hi>Browniſm,</hi> and abhorred anarchy, and then ſay they upon ſuch praemiſes, it muſt needs follow that every member of the body muſt be an officer; and then every one muſt preach and diſpenſe the ſacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reply. Certainly ſuch gentlemen, either deſigns to poſe and baffle their reader with falacy; or they themſelves never took up, or underſtood the true ideas of the ſeveral ſpecies of government; in that a democracy is as regular a form, and as particular as any other.</p>
                     <p>For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. An abſolute or limited monarch can't manage the power or government devolved upon him, without the great officers of the crown, or a large ſet of miniſters; though poſſibly he may with quicker diſpatch iſſue out his decrees, yet he muſt execute all by his miniſtry. And why may not a democracy be indulged the ſame liberty? And this will prevent all anarchy or confuſion moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently. But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The bitter pill to ſwallow in this doctrine of a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy in the church, is the terrible power of life and death; or the accountableneſs of particular members to the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and eſpecially thoſe in the miniſtry; but yet this is agreable with the nature of the conſtitution, and eaſily
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012626_0041_0F8B8F3642632908"/>
managed without anarchy, or popular confuſion alſo, which would be made very evident, if we ſhould but run the parallel in all points between the democracy of the ſtate and church. But nextly from the premiſes, I ſhall</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Infer, That if theſe churches are not properly formed, yet are fairly eſtabliſhed in their preſent order by the law of nature. And will they be adviſed, I would exhort them to try who will be ſo bold as to dare to diſſeize them. A monarchy has been tried in the church with a witneſs, but it has abſolutely failed us. An ariſtocracy in a deep calm threw the democracy overboard, and took not only the helm in hand, but ſeized ſhip and cargo as their right and title; but after ſome time brought all to ſhip-wreck, and that in a good harbour too.</p>
                     <p>A democracy was the noble government which beat out in all the bad weather of ten bloody perſecutions under the management of antiquity. And this is our conſtitution, and what can't we be pleaſed? This conſtitution is as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable with the light and laws of nature as any other whatſoever, as has been fairly laid down and fully evinced, and more accommodated to the concerns of religion than any other. Therefore I ſhall now conclude my demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with this brief appeal to the common reaſon of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, viz.</p>
                     <p>How can it conſiſt with the honorable terms man holds upon here on earth; that the beſt ſort of men that we can find in the world; ſuch men as are adorned with a double ſett of enobling immunities, the firſt from nature, the other from grace; that theſe men when they enter into charter-party to man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ge a trade for heaven, muſt <hi>ipſo facto</hi> be clapt under a government, that is arbitrary and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic; yea that carries the plain ſymptoms of a tyranny in it, when the light of nature knows of a better ſpecies, and frequently has made uſe of it? It wants no farther demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, for its moſt apparent, that nature is ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of herſelf, that man in a natural ſtate of being, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God the firſt ſubject of all power, and therefore can make his own choice, and by deliberate compacts, ſettles his own conditions for the government of himſelf in a civil ſtate of being: And when a government ſo ſettled ſhall throw itſelf from its foundations, or the ſubjects of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power ſhall ſubvert or confound the conſtitution, they
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012626_0042_0F8B8F374A8BEF98"/>
then degrade themſelves; and ſo all power returns again to the people, who are the firſt owners. And what! Is man become ſo unfortunate, degraded and debaſed, as to be without all power in ſettling a government over himſelf, relating to the matters of his eternal well-being? Or when he comes back to a fathers houſe, muſt he fall into the capacity, of a meer paſſive being, and be put under ſuch tutors, as can eaſily turn tyrants over him, and no relief left for him in his own hands; this is certainly moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the light of nature, and very diſagreable with the liberty and free genius of a goſpel ſtate. Nay, in a word, if the government of the churches be ſettled by God, either in the hands of a church monarch, or ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, and the people are no ways the ſubject of church power: Nay, if they are not under Chriſt, the fountain of power; then the reformation ſo called, is but a meer cheat, a ſchiſm, and notorious rebellion; neither is there room left for the leaſt paliation, or ſhadow of excuſe, for the reformers in renouncing their obedience to their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic governors. And the Martyrologies which pretend to immortalize the fame of eminent heroes, muſt be changed into chronicles, handing along an account of the juſt and deſerved fate of a crew of rebels againſt God and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for what buſineſs had ſuch a company of illiterate and crack brain'd fellows to meddle with their rulers, or examine into their adminiſtrations? for if they have no right of power in government, they ſtand abſolutely bound to yield a paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance; and if they are ſo hardy and daring as to oppoſe their lawful rulers, the ſharpeſt penalty in this world, is two eaſy for them; the inquiſition is but dallying and playing with them, hell is their deſert. But how it comes about that a ſtate of grace, when in want of a ſuitable government, is become ſuch a vaſſal, and wiſe and cunning nature is by her crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor intruſted, and adorned with more enobling preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, I muſt leave, and reſign unto thoſe learned men to ſolve, who plead for an ariſtocracy in the churches of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But to wind up the whole diſcourſe in a few words, I acknowledge many objections may be here made, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral queſtions of moment might here fall under debate; but having obtained what I have principally ſought for, in traverſing the paths of nature, in the three following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; therefore with them, and with one objection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012626_0043_0F8B8F379C334CA0"/>
and alſo with ſome brief improvement of the grand hypotheſis in this demonſtration, I ſhall finiſh the argument.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Three particulars; or ſo many golden maxims, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the honor of congregational churches.</p>
                     <p>Particular 1. That the people or fraternity under the goſpel, are the firſt ſubject of power; or elſe religion ſinks the dignity of human nature into a baſer capacity with relation to eccleſiaſtical, than it is in, in a natural ſtate of being with relation to civil government.</p>
                     <p>Particular 2. That a democracy in church or ſtate, is a very honorable and regular government according to the dictates of right reaſon. And therefore,</p>
                     <p>Particular 3. That theſe churches of New-England, in their ancient conſtitution of church order; it being a democracy, are manifeſtly juſtified and defended by the law and light of nature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The objection. The plea from the law of nature for a democracy in the church, is as forceable for any other ſpecies of government; becauſe nature is furniſhed with ſuch a variety of ſchemes as has been pleaded to: And why may not the wiſe chriſtian nations take which likes them beſt?</p>
                     <p>Anſw. We muſt diſtinguiſh between man left ſolely to the direction of the law of nature, and as the ſubject of revelation, wherein divine wiſdom may interpoſe; and determine on ſome particular ſpecies, without hurting or croſſing the law of nature, Therefore,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I readily grant and acknowledge, a chriſtian people may ſettle what ſpecies of government they pleaſe, when they are ſolely left to determine by the law of nature, what government in the church they will have. But then we muſt remember, that by the argument or conceſſion, the power is originally in the people; and then our own caſe is ſecure and ſafe enough; both on the account of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of power, and eſpecially, for that the people the firſt ſubjects of power, have been pleaſed to ſettle a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy for their government, in the churches of this country. And if after the peaceable poſſeſſion of about an hundred years, any perſons can perſwade them to alter their government into any other ſpecies, this will be leſs worthy of blame, than craftily, or unfairly to force it out of their hands.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's granted, that according to the light of nature,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012626_0044_0F8B8F384AD58F40"/>
there be various regular models of government; but if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom is pleaſed to interpoſe and over-rule natures agitations, and caſt the ſcales for this or that particular form, nature will be but fair mannered to ſubmit to its author and rector. So that if we find that God has diſcloſed his mind by revelation, that his churches be the ſubjects of a democracy, then all ſtand obliged to comply under a double bond. And ſo we come under a proper criſis to enquire in the next place for ſcripture-evidence in the juſtification of theſe churches.</p>
                     <p>But before I proceed to it, I ſhall</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Make ſome brief improvement of the main <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> in the demonſtration; that is to ſay, if the government of the goſpel churches, be a democracy, theſe conſequences muſt neceſſarily follow, <hi>ſcil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſ.</hi> That the right of convoking councils eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, is in the churches.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſ.</hi> That ſuch a council has only conſultative not a juridical power in it. A juridical power committed to ſuch a repreſentative body is both needleſs, and alſo dangerous to the diſtinct and perfect ſtates they derive from. Compleat ſtates ſettled upon a body of immutable and imperial laws as its baſis, may want council; but to create a new ſubject of juridical power, is ſome way to endanger the being of the creators.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſ.</hi> That all the members of an eccleſiaſtical council, deriving from a democracy are ſubjects of equal power. Whatever the power is, the ſeveral delegates muſt from the nature of the government they derive from, be equal ſharers in it. Democratical ſtates, in their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative body can make but one houſe, becauſe they have but one ſubject of ſupream power in their nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their delegates, let them be who or what they may be, are under equal t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>t; ſo that none can juſtly claim ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over their fellows, or pretend to a higher power in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> ſuffrage. Indeed in ſuch kingdoms, where the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power is diſtributed and ſettled in divers ſubjects, that the ballance of power may be more even, for the ſafety of the whole, and of all parts under all acts of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power: From ſuch a ſettlement of power, there ariſes ſeveral diſtinct ſtates in the ſame government, which when convened as one ſubject of ſovereign power, they make dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent houſes in their grand ſeſſions; and ſo one houſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſtate can negative another. But in every diſtinct houſe of theſe ſtates, the members are equal in their vote; the moſt ayes make the affirmative vote, and moſt no's the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: They don't weigh the intellectual furniture, or other diſtinguiſhing qualifications of the ſeveral voters in the ſcales of the golden rule of fellowſhip; they only add up the ayes, and the no's, and ſo determine the ſuffrage of the houſe.</p>

                     <head>Demonſtration III. From Holy Scripture.</head>
                     <p>THIS plea has with ſuch variety of argument, and illuſtration, and by many repetitions, been purſued, by a great number of perſons emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for learning and piety, that I might here very fairly releaſe myſelf from this taſk. But yet to compleat the number of my arguments, I will briefly ſum up the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration for the readers uſe under a few heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Head. It muſt needs be allowed, as a fundamental principle relating to government, that (under God) all power is originally in the people. No man I think will deny it to be a very ſound principle in civil knowledge. But if any man will, I imagine it is ſufficiently ſet forth in the former demonſtration. And it is very plain that religion does always cultivate, and increaſe, rather than diminiſh any of natures juſt prerogatives. That it muſt needs ſtand for a paradox, or a riddle not to be expounded; if man is more of a ſlave by his religion than by his nature.</p>
                     <p>But let us take a brief view of man by ſcripture account under a religious notion, as the ſubject of grace, and he ſeems then not to have the leaſt ſpeck of vaſſalage in him; but is repreſented as though lord of himſelf and owner of heaven, and earth both, 1 Cor. 3.22.—<hi>all are yours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though its very certain that man has greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed himſelf by his apoſtacy; yet ſtill God puts abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of honor upon him in his reduction. As we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y conſider man in a remark or two, under the meaſures of divine grace in reſtoring him to favor. Firſt, God treats him as a creature of a very honorable character, as free and at his own diſpoſe. Or as though he were ſome high and mighty ſtate placed at the top of this globe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he courts him into an alliance as though he were likely to yield great honor to the crown. <hi>We are ambaſſadors—
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012626_0046_0F8B8F3A35D07188"/>
as though God did beſeech you by us; we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead—be reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20. This is much the tenor of Gods heralds in their addreſſes of capitulation. That certainly if God did not highly eſtimate man, as a creature exalted, by his reaſon, liberty and nobleneſs of nature, he would not careſs him as he does in order to his ſubmiſſion; but rather with ſome peeviſh and haughty monarch, or the bloody Mahomet, ſend his demands at the mouth of his canon. But inſtead of ſuch harſh mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, they are treated with the higheſt reaſon, attended with lenity and great acts of condeſcention. Nay, divine menaces are frequently cloathed with ſuch ſoft language as this; <hi>turn ye! turn ye! Why will ye dye!</hi> Yea under all impulſive means, which God wiſely and graciouſly makes uſe of to gain mans conſent, he ſets the will to turn about itſelf without forcing it, that ſo mans religion may be the free and candid emanations of his noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted nature. But when God has thus gained man; may we rationally imagine that in erecting his trophies he will aſſign and make him over to ſome petty and arbitrary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates in matters of religion? or ſettle him under a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic government as tho' he was the ſpoils of a ſpiteful war? No certainly, but man muſt now be conſidered as ſome high allie inveſted with more power than ever. This would ſtill be more evident if we ſhould conſider what Chriſt has done and how they ſtand joint heirs with him in his purchaſe and kingdom, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 16, 17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Head. The power placed in man that enables him to manage religious affairs, is not ſovereign, but limited and confined power. (1) All laws are enacted already, and, (2.) There is no coercive power needful in the church. The higheſt act in adminiſtring judicature, is excluding a perſon out of the ſociety. In the church there is no fees or fines, &amp;c. In civil empire to keep mankind in any good decorum, there's much hard work to be done, in peace and war; under mein proceſs, and in criminal cauſes. There's forming of armies, raiſing the poſſe comitatus, building of caſtles, &amp;c. cropping of ears, chopping off hands, and what not! ſo that civil government has need of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence power as well a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> treaſure, and to be cloathed with braſs and iron. But as for the church of God, faith, prayers and tears, are generally their beſt weapons againſt the hoſtility of foreigners; and in the government of their
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012626_0047_0F8B8F3A9457EA90"/>
home-born, it may be done by ſoft words, or hard words, 1 Theſ. 5.12. Heb. 3.13.—10.24.25. So that the buſineſs does not require abundance of external force, or form of government. That it's a thouſand pities to make ſuch a great noiſe and buſtle in the world about church power, as though the ſubjects of it were to furniſh armies and navies to encounter half the potentates on earth in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the church. When alas good men! as to all occaſion for power its quite another thing; and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it generally falls within reach of an ordinary reaſon. That certainly whatever the right of the brotherhood is as to the original of power; there cannot be abundance of bad omens in allowing them ſome ſhare in church judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Head. Power—this word ſeems to be all thunder. But however; it is very copious and may be applyed to God and his creatures. It is predicable of the latter, in their different claſſes and orders of being, and none ſo weak but have ſome ſhare of it. But to confine the word to polity, &amp;c. It is by ſome thus defined, viz.</p>
                     <p>Power or authority—Is that whereby a man may claim, or challenge any thing to ones ſelf, without the injury of another, upon a ſuppoſition, this is a true definition.</p>
                     <p>Query. <hi>Whether chriſtian people may not claim or chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the following rights or prerogatives without doing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to any,</hi> viz.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Whether if they are pleaſed (a ſuitable number of them) to enter into a religious ſociety, by punctual and voluntary compacts to ſupport the worſhip of God in the world; whether this may not be done without injuring and then,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When ſo united, whether they may not chuſe their own officers. (3.) Diſcipline their own members. (4) Repreſent themſelves upon proper emergencies, by their delegates; (all which are the principal pillars of a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,) whether I ſay they, can't do all theſe without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done to any others? But to proceed a little farther in opening the nature of power. If we unite <hi>Dunamis</hi> and <hi>Exouſia, viz.</hi> Strength of nature, and authority of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into one propoſition. Then political power may be thus defined. <hi>ſcil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Power is an ability, furniſhed with a lawful right to act. Now upon a preſumption of the validity of this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012626_0048_0F8B8F3B45F58EF8"/>
power may be eaſily apprehended as veſted in every church, and in every member and officer of a church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature, degree and duty of each ſubject of power; and may act and exert their ſeveral powers and authorities without any incongruity, or interfering one with another.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Head. That a goſpel church eſſentially conſidered as a body incorporated, is the ſubject of all church power. Though a church thus conſidered cannot formally exerciſe all branches of power belonging to it: neither can the ſubject of ſovereign power itſelf exert all acts of power till fitted with proper organs or a ſuitable miniſtry, and yet it can't be denied but that all power really, and all acts of power virtually, muſt needs be in it. And ſo in a church.</p>
                     <p>Therefore as to church power in the exerciſe of it; it may be diſtributed into what belongs (1) To the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of many, viz. The power of judgment and dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Or, (2.) To what belongs to one or more ſet off for that end, viz. The power of office. This diſtribution Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> purſues with great illuſtration. <hi>Surv. p.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 187. Here I ſhall confine myſelf to the conſideration of the exerciſe of that power which belongs to the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in diſtinction to office power. Which principle I ſhall purſue by evincing the truths of the following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. <hi>ſcil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That the ſcripture does warrant a government in goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel churches, conſiſting of the exerciſe of ſeveral diſtinct powers inherent in the fraternity, in diſtinction to office truſt. This may be evinced.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the recitation of the ſeveral diſtinct powers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the dignity which the ſcriptures puts upon the churches as free ſtates, and ſubjects of power in diſtinction from their officers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the recitation of the ſeveral diſtinct powers; both preparitory to, and reſulting from their combination.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is a preparatory power in them both as ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal &amp; ſanctified beings of forming themſelves into churches. This affirmation ſeems to me as fully contained in the genuine ſenſe of ſcripture, as though written in ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine manifeſto, in ſuch terms as theſe, viz. Let this be
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012626_0049_0F8B8F3EE2EB4CF0"/>
proclaimed through all the earth, that I the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, have inveſted all holy and good chriſtian people, both by nature and grace with power, to enter into church order, for the advance of my name, and their own edification. If we had ſuch an article in ſcripture written in terms, we ſhould have made great uſe of it in juſtifying our conſtitution; for it plainly ſettles all power original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (under Chriſt) in the people. And then if ſuch a power or faculty be in them when in ſeparate parts, as to aſſemble, and enter into ſolemn engagements, and thereby to enter into a church ſtate; it neceſſarily follows, that having imbodied they may eaſily go forward and provide for their own well-being. He that hath read the goſpel, and obſerved how many churches are mentioned, without notice taken, of the manner of their origination, muſt needs allow the obſervation to be a fair conſequence from it. It being ſo agreable with the light of nature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The powers reſulting from their combination may be more diſtinctly recited.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Power. The election of officers. Officers are for the well-being, and compleating of any ſtate. There is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular government can well ſubſiſt without them; theſe are the hands, the eyes, the ears and feet of government in adminiſtration. To ſeparate qualified perſons to the higheſt office truſt in a ſtate, is by civilians attributed to the creating power of ſovereignity. So that it muſt needs be a great power belonging to the church under this head, and that it is the churches prerogative I might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; <hi>Ex Jure Superioritatis.</hi> For that the church is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to its officers; and not the officers to the church. For that churches are not made for officers, but officers for churches; therefore ſays the apoſtle, 1 Cor. 3.22. <hi>All things are yours—whether Paul, or Apollos or Cephas.</hi> But I ſhall principally depend upon the example and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the apoſtolical church under this head. It is a celebrated ſaying of <hi>Cyprian</hi> in preſſing, Acts 1.26. To confirm the power of the people in chuſing and refuſing their officers. <hi>Plebs Chriſtiana maxime poteſtatem habet, vel Dignos Sacerdotes Eligendi, vel indignos Recuſandi.</hi> The higheſt power of electing worthy officers and rejecting unworthy is in the people. For the whole church, ſays <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012626_0050_0F8B8F411C260630"/>
vacancy by the death of <hi>Judas,</hi> Acts 1.23, 26. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is contrary to all civility and reaſon to imagine the apoſtles would be ſo trivial in their miniſtry, or prodigal of their own authority, as to indulge the fraternity in ſuch actions, viz. Such as electing an extraordinary officer, if the election of officers did not belong to them. So in the choice of the deacons mentioned, Acts. 6.2, 3, 5. The twelve called the multitude of the diſciples unto them, and ſaid—brethren look you out ſeven men, whom we may appoint over this buſineſs. The ſaying pleaſed the whole multitude and they choſe Stephen, &amp;c. It muſt needs be very ſurprizing, if the apoſtles ſhould thus dignify, and intruſt the brethren with a prerogative of electing theſe officers, if the power of election was not inherent in them. That unleſs any one can fairly make it out that the apoſtles were either in jeſt, or did they know not what, in direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the brethren, to do as they did in the recited examples; it muſt needs ſtand for a truth that the power of electing officers is in the fraternity of the church, by the judgment of Chriſt's apoſtles.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Power judicatory, Mat. 18.15, 20. This para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of holy writ, lays open a ſcheme of juridical power in the ſubject of it; that is the church: and this is to be obſerved, that from the firſt commencement of the proceſs to the final iſſue in the execution of the obſtinate and criminal member, all is to be aſcribed to the authority of the church; for what buſineſs has one man to interrupt another in his crimes and unlawful pleaſures, unleſs he has power ſo to do? And how comes one man to have power over another, unleſs conqueſt, hoſtility, or compacts have made them liable, as members of the ſame community, or ſubjects of the ſame government? Therefore the offended perſon, proceeding regularly for detecting a delinquent, muſt needs be ſuppoſed to derive his power from the ſame fountain, viz. the ſeſſions were the caſe is finally to iſſue by execution. And the ſubject of this power is the church. <hi>Tell the church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But moreover, let it be conſidered, that to ſpeak by way of alluſion, there be ſeveral removes of the action of treſpaſs, from one hearing to another; as though it go from an inferior to a ſuperior ſeſſions, and that Chriſt was here in this precept, ſettling inferior and ſuperior aſſizes in his kingdom. And indeed there cannot be a wiſer
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012626_0051_0F8B8F418514A8C0"/>
ſcheme drawn up, that ſhall carry the aſpect of more grace, love, humility, tender regard to honour, and alſo juſtice than this; both for the encouragement of religion, the awing of ſpectators, and keeping the church pure.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In making out proceſs, the firſt trial is to be had at the aſſizes of a mans own intellectual powers, reaſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, &amp;c. being aſſembled, are to ſet in judgment, hear the pleas, and the indictment being read and juſtified, muſt paſs ſentence; and at this bar the caſe may be fairly iſſued. <hi>If he ſhall hear thee thou haſt gained thy brother.</hi> So that moſt certainly the plaintiff has a right to enter his caſe at this ſeſſions, and here we ſee it may be iſſued; then certainly this is a branch of the power of judicature; otherwiſe an agrieved perſon might expect a very ſevere repulſe from a ſturdier offender, for interrupting a mans repoſe of mind in his own actions. What ſaucy clown is that? who dare challenge my conſcience with the cognizance of any crime? Bold-face! where's you commiſſion; <hi>Who made thee a ruler,</hi> Acts 7.27. In civil affairs particular men when injured, muſt not make bold to correct an ordinary treſpaſs upon their perſons, or intereſts, but by forms of law; if they do, eſpecially if by meaſures which are grievous, they may be indicted themſelves, for diſturbers of the peace; That certainly this branch of the text refers to a legal bar, and lawful power. So that the complaining party may commence his ſuit with boldneſs, produce his pleas, and demand juſtice. But the critical queſtion is, <hi>Who is judge of this court?</hi> Certainly it is ſome lay-mans powers, ſuppoſed to be very competent judges, as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſkilled in the rules of court, and how to apply them. And why may not all the judges contained in the whole ſeries of judicatory laid open in this text, be of the ſame ſort? for that the caſe is not ſo deep, but that the firſt judges and ſeſſions it comes before, are ſuppoſed by our wiſe Saviour and law-giver, capable fully to underſtand and traverſe it; and do juſtice and judgment upon it; to a final iſſue. But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Upon a defeat the proceſs goes forward, by remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuit by an appeal to a more impartial hearing. The next ſeſſions therefore by review, is to conſiſt of one or two of the brethren. <hi>(Take one or two more.)</hi> But poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſome may be ready to ſay, ah! <hi>We are like to have
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012626_0052_0F8B8F4249B89DF0"/>
very good juſtice, before ſo wiſe a ſeſſions!</hi> Well, it is what Chriſt has appointed, and let us keep his path, and it will bring us ſafe home; for that theſe perſons are commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by Chriſt, as capable judges, and therefore are to exerciſe one branch of the power fixed in the church. But when the caſe is gone thus far through the law, and the adverſe party will not ſubmit to the laſt verdict that is brought in, the caſe muſt be removed again. For that,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is allowed to have one trial more, and no more; and that is to be before the church. For if he hear not the church, he ſhall be as an heathen man, &amp;c. that is to ſay, the church ſhall then iſſue out execution, which is the end of the law.</p>
                     <p>Object. But the great and ſtupendous objection, which croſſes our way, is, that the governing church is here meant; that is to ſay, the preſbytery in their claſſes, and ſeveral ſeſſions, till you come home to the laſt appeal?</p>
                     <p>Anſw. 1. It is very unſcriptural to force ſuch an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation on the text; for if we conſider the etimology, and univerſal acceptation of the word church, the objection will be found very defective, both in its rhetori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k and divinity. There being no harbour for it, within the ſenſe of <hi>Farniby</hi>'s tropes or figures. And as for its divinity, let the objection but cite one text more, wherein church is mentioned, and officers are intended, and we will reſign. But without it to yield ſo great an intereſt upon ſo ſlender a claim is repugnant to juſtice and honor. But,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. How can wiſe men manage their ſouls, or bring them into ſuch a figure as to think that Chriſt ſhould have ſuch a far reach in his thoughts in ſuch eaſy caſes as are plainly contained in the text? The notions in the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are plainly ridiculous to the light of nature, in that civil meaſures adjuſt according to the degree and nature of ſuits and caſes. A cauſe of twelve-pence is triable by a ſingle juſtice, and one a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>peal brings the ſuit to the end of the law. Indeed caſes which are of greater weight and value have a larger ſcope in the law allowed them, &amp;c. And what! Is there the leaſt ſhadow for a pretence that ſuch caſes as are within our text, viz. ſuch as may be iſſued by one ſingle brother making his ſuit to his brothers reaſon and conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ience, &amp;c. or by two at the moſt, and that at the ſole charge of a few honeſt pleas from the heads of charity or piety? I ſay, are theſe caſes ſo grand as to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from one claſſis to another, till they arrive at the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012626_0053_0F8B8F42E08E4A20"/>
chief ſeat where the definitive ſentence is to be given forth? There is apparently ſome great fallacy in the objection, or certainly our bleſſed Saviour did not ſtate his caſes right; for let us again conſider, who muſt ſign the bill of coſt at laſt? or who muſt bear all the charges of writings, witneſſes, travels of horſes and men; and for all expence of time and money, from the ſeſſions firſt mentioned, and ſo from ſeſſions to ſeſſions, and from claſſis to claſſis, until all is brought to a final iſſue? when as poſſibly the original writ of proceſs, or firſt action, might not contain in real civil damage, a farthing more than about a groat or ſix-pence. And what can we think that our wiſe Saviour would adjuſt his ſettlements at no better a rate than this comes to? <hi>vah! proh Dolor!</hi> Men have plainly made a fool of mankind by corrupting this text, whereby they have ſet the diſcipline of the church at ſuch a charge, that millions of millions have run out in waſte, to humour their ambition; when as the wiſe and innocent churches of God in their ſingle capacities would have done better juſtice, and have drained nothing more from you, than ſome tears of contrition.</p>
                     <p>For,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. What is more natural, than to imagine a church of believers, with their ſet of graces, and common prudence, (eſpecially when under the influence of a regular miniſtry) ſhould be held capable to execute this rule, according to the full ſenſe of it; yea, tho' they bring the delinquent in the traverſe of the caſe, to the higheſt cenſure. Indeed it muſt be acknowledged, that excommunication, major or minor, is an awful reſult of authority; yet not really in every reſpect, and in all degrees quite ſo bitter as death it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And yet death is very frequently diſpens'd to capital ſinners, and that ſolely by the verdict of their peers, viz. Twenty-four good and lawful men of the vicinage, are in forms of law a ſufficent judicatory to take away a mans life, and the venerable bench of judges muſt not over-rule, but ſtand and ſay, Amen, in that good juſtice is done in the world by ſuch a ſmall company of illiterate men, the law having aſſigned them to this ſervice. To the foregoing precept, let us join Col. 4.17. 1 Cor. 5.12. Rev. 2.20. 1 Theſ. 5.14. Gal. 6.1.</p>

No freeman ſhall be taken, or impriſoned, or be diſſeiſed of his freehold, liberty or free cuſtoms, or be out-law'd or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled, or any other ways deſtroyed, nor will we preſs upon him nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his peers. Now gentlemen! Don't you think that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the king of heaven, is as careful and tender of his ſubjects, as the king of England is of his? And indeed, why ſhould not each ſett of ſubjects be equally and alike guarded from the hazard of oppreſſion, or the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary meaſures of each miniſtry unleſs thoſe that belong to the goſpel, are formed out of a diſtinct clay from each other?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Power. To repreſent themſelves in ſynodical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, for the eſtabliſhment of this power in the churches. See Acts 15.2.22.23. And for a more ample diſplay and confirmation of this point, I refer the reader to the excellent treatiſe of Dr. <hi>Increaſe Mather,</hi> in his diſquiſition concerning <hi>eccleſiaſtical councils.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The dignity which the ſcripture puts upon the churches as free ſtates, and ſubjects of power in diſtinction from their officers.</p>
                     <p>It is very plain that moſt of the epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> which make up a great part of the canon of ſcripture, were directed to the body of the brotherhood, and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly adapted for their uſe, with little or no notice at all taken of the miniſtry therein.</p>
                     <p>In ſum, when he was juſt concluding his letter and winding up his diſcourſe with his grace and reſpects to ſome choice chriſtian friends, he puts the officers in with them, and orders the brotherhood to give his ſalutations to them as perſons unconcerned with the contents of the epiſtle, Heb. 13.24. In the laſt verſe but one in the whole epiſtle, ſays the apoſtle, <hi>Salute all them that have the rule over.</hi> That whatever other meanings may be in ſuch methods of divine writings, they muſt needs reſpect ſome high powers and truſt veſted in the churches. Thoſe epiſtles ſent to the angels of the churches of <hi>Aſia</hi>; the principal ſhare of thoſe letters literally taken, which belonged to the officers,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012626_0055_0F8B8F4444975AA0"/>
is but the ſuperſcription; the contents of the letters are immediately directed to the fraternity. Where there is any thing amiſs the fraternity is reprehended: Where there is any thing worthy of credit, they are commended. Or if there is any thing in point of order or diſcipline to be done they are directed and commanded. All is to the churches. Therefore it is ſaid again and again, <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the ſpirit ſaith unto the churches,</hi> Rev. 1.7, &amp;c. Finally, let any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate man but read and well ponder the epiſtles to the <hi>Corinthian, Epheſian,</hi> &amp;c. churches, and obſerve the characters of the brotherhood; with the precepts how they ſhall act perſonally and with authority one towards another, &amp;c. he muſt then needs ſubject his mind to the force of this concluſion, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That Chriſt's goſpel churches in their fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities, are not ſuch cyphers as they ſtand in ſome men's accounts; but are really and truly proper bodies full of powers, and authorities, for the government of themſelves and all their concerns, as all democracies are.</p>

                     <p>From the excellent nature of the conſtitution, in that it exceeds all that have been yet extant in the chriſtian world. This I ſhall endeavor to illuſtrate by three pleas. <hi>Plea</hi> I.</p>
                     <p>In that it beſt ſuits the great and noble deſigns of the goſpel, and that in a peculiar manner as it tends to the promoting holineſs in the world; not only from the ſtrict nature of the conſtitution in the admiſſion of members, whence the churches become a more exact emblem of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, both for the illuminating and dreading of others, that beholding their goodneſs, may glorify God in the day of viſitation. 1 Pet. 2.12. But from the great advantage put into the hands of the beſt ſort of men, (ſolid, pious, wiſe and unbias'd men) of furniſhing a country with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons eminently qualified for the miniſtry, and keeping them ſo. There is no lurking place for <hi>Symony</hi> in this conſtitution. There is no buying and ſelling of offices, whereby the world has been miſerably cheated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched.

                        </gap>rinſic worth ſets the value, and holds the ſtrongeſt plea for preferment here. Hence every village, and corner of a town, where religious congregations are ſettled, are furniſhed with perſons for the goſpel miniſtry of ſuch
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012626_0056_0F8B8F4504AFE3E0"/>
learning, and bright ſaints, and of ſuch real and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virtue and zeal; that they muſt needs be very preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in carrying on the main deſign, &amp;c. But this plea is fully purſued by Dr. Owen, in his enquiry, &amp;c. (p. 120 and ſo on) whither I refer the reader that wants more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>

                     <p>For that it has the beſt ballance belonging to it of any church-government in the world. Other governments have generally too high a top, and are very lopſided too; nay the beſt we can meet with without vanity or envy it may be ſaid, that not only ſeemingly like <hi>Grantham</hi> ſteeple, but really it ſtands awry, and being ſo overloaded on na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's corrupt ſide, with learning, power and high truſt, it plainly hangs over ſeveral degrees from a true perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, towards Babylon: And if it falls it buries you; and then you muſt remember it has monopolized all power, ſo that you have none left to ſtir under your load, or creep out with. But here's a government ſo exactly poiſed, that it keeps its motions regular like the ſtupenduous ſpheres, unleſs ſome <hi>Phaeton</hi> chance to mount the chariot box, and becomes the driver. I have ſufficiently, I think, evinced the power in the brotherhood; and though every church is a body conſiſting of very numerous parts and a noble m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>niſtry, yet the balance of power is very exactly and with great advantage preſerved; both between the members of the body in general, and between themſelves, and their public miniſtry in ſpecial.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Between the members of the body. For beſides, the wiſdom, love and other enobling principles, in ſome meaſure actuating every member. The venerable major vote, which guides and governs the auguſt ſtates of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; nay all aſſembly's ſuperior and inferior, that have any equality of power diſperſed amongſt the members, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily keeps the whole body, in all points of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in an exact equipoiſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And as for the ſtate of the miniſtry; there is no grain of allowance wanted on their ſide, to make their office power, if not an even ballance arithmetically upon an accurate, and diſtreſſing trial: yet in the ſeries of a laudable miniſtration, it is an equivalent of power; at leaſt according to the terms of our conſtitution, <hi>Platf. C.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. But let the caſe be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="58" facs="unknown:012626_0057_0F8B8F46197FFFF8"/>
as may be, and let every fair principle which grants the power to be originally in the people, be yielded: and alſo eſtabliſh a proper judicature in the brotherhood; yet it's apparent in all examples, that the miniſtry of this conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution are held, if not in proper ſpeaking; yet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and religious courteſie, as though all power were inveſted in them; or at leaſt to ſuch a degree that there is no appearance of what many render the government grevious to them, if they are but contented, to be the maſters of an aſſembly of free-men, and not of ſlaves. Amongſt abundance of illuſtrations I will mention two.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The great veneration in man's mind towards thoſe who are ſenſibly cloathed with authority. <hi>If I am a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where it my honor, if a maſter where is my fear,</hi> Mat. 1.6. The prophet reaſons from the law of nature; there being ſuch a property planted in the ſoul by its maker to revere ſuperiors, and eſpecially men in public truſt. And alſo the authority ſhining in them, being ſuch bright rays both of the divine majeſty and benignity, there being ſuch a ſenſible good and benefit accruing thereby, to the reſt of mankind, hence ſprings a univerſal diſpoſition to obedience and ſubmiſſion, this is obvious through the whole civil miniſtry of the world; there is no need to make every judge in commiſſion, or chief magiſtrate a ſovereign prince to gain homage to him. No! but as ſoon as a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears veſted with authority, there is that in the ſoul of another which teaches reverence and obedience to him in his truſt, both from the ſuggeſtions of fear and ſenſe of intereſt. So that a learned, painful and pious miniſtry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the ſouls and happineſs of men; and taking indefatigable care to ſecure eternal life for them, has a moſt charming and endearing aſpect and influence upon all the rational powers. In ſo much that nature itſelf has a high value for ſuch ſubjects of truſt. And as for grace its ready to be laviſh of its victims.—ye received me as an angel of God even as Chriſt Jeſus.—If it had been poſſible ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14, 15. If any man doubts of the validity of this plea, let him but view what conqueſts have been made by the abuſe of theſe principles, and you will find the miniſtry of the chriſtian world have far exceeded <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in ſubduing mankind; for from an honeſt obedience they have brought them to lye down, &amp;
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012626_0058_0F8B8F46C2C463A8"/>
be trampled on by their ſpiritual owners. That there is no danger on the poople's ſide when things are well ſtated, if there be but a wiſe and due management on the other.</p>
                     <p>And ſtill it is more evident.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the extent of commiſſion, with the many enob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling prerogatives fixed in their truſt. Though they are the miniſtry, and but the miniſtry of a democracy, their commiſſion is ſo large, and high-prerogatives ſo numerous, they carry ſo great an appearance, as though in reality they were the ſubjects of all power. And I think it is ſo from the nature and modes of all regular government; for when a government has enacted their laws and precepts, and ſettled their miniſtry, they leave the ſway of things to them; that it is as tho' they had reſigned all the power to their miniſtry: So it is peculiarly in the affairs of goſpel churches. That let men at their leiſure view this illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the ſcripture, our platform, and by the laws and cuſtoms of nations, and they will find it a truth. That certainly a painful miniſtry may eaſily be reconciled to our conſtitution, unleſs they are raiſed to that temper of mind as he was, who had this for his motto, <hi>Aut Caeſar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aut Nihil.</hi> A <hi>Caeſar</hi> or nothing.</p>

                     <p>From the near affinity our conſtitution holds with the civil governments of ſome of the moſt flouriſhing common-wealths in the world.

And many times a government falls under ſcandal from diſtemper of mind, from falſe ends and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt intereſts, which ſway and over-rule mens thoughts relating to government, more than from the conſtitution itſelf.

Says Gordon of their government: The ſeven provinces of Holland being under a democratical government, are as it were ſeveral common-wealths; each province being a diſtinct ſtate; yea, and every city having an independent power within itſelf to judge of all cauſes, whether civil or criminal, and to inflict even capital puniſhments; but all joining toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make one republic, the moſt conſiderable in the world.</p>

of the fineſt and moſt incomparable government in the world. And this original happy form of government, is (ſays one) truly and properly called an Engliſh man's liberty: a privilege to be freed in perſon and eſtate from arbitrary violence and oppreſſion; and a greater inheritance than we derive from our parents. And this birth-right of Engliſh men ſhines moſt conſpiciouſly in two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In Parliaments; wherein the ſubject has by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, a ſhare in legiſlative power: And ſo makes his own laws, and diſpoſes of his own money.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In Jury's; whereby he has a ſhare in the executive part of law, ſo that no cauſes are tried, nor any man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to loſe his life, member or eſtate, but upon the verdict of his peers; his equal or neighbours, and of his own condition. Theſe two grand pillars of Engliſh liberty, are the fundamental vital privileges whereby we have been, and are ſtill preſerved more free and happy, than any other people in the world; and we truſt ſhall ever continue ſo. For whoſoever ſhall deſign to impair, pervert, or undermine either of theſe, do ſtrike at the very conſtitution of our government, and ought to be proſecuted and puniſhed, with the utmoſt zeal and vigour.—For to poyſon all the ſprings and rivers in the kingdom, could not be a greater mifchief; for this would only affect the preſent age, but the other would ruin and enſlave all our poſterity. I ſhall improve this example by three Queries.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Query</hi> 1. Ah! What's the matter with <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, men of ſuch courage to be ſurprized with ſuch fear, as tho' they were like to be taken captive, and turned into ſlaves in their own home? Why, in good truth, there may be a reaſon for it; therefore it becomes them to be very careful under this head; for if they make themſelves ſlaves in their own country, or let others do it for them, when they can prevent it, they both deny God who made and redeemed them, and plainly violate the law of nature?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Query.</hi> 2. Who is it Engliſh men are thus afraid of? Who do they thus reflect upon in their frights and fears? It is neither France nor the great Turk which dreads them! therefore it muſt needs be ſome body or another nearer home that threatens their liberty. And may not New-England's goſpel liberties deſerve ſo much fear and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012626_0061_0F8B8F4BC3C491B0"/>
although it ſhould ſo happen that ſome body ſhould be reflected upon by their cautiouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Query.</hi> 3. If the ſettling ſuch immunities, as the privilege of parliaments and juries in the hands of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be ſuch effectual barriers to preſerve a nation from tyranny and ſlavery; then whether when goſpel churches have the means in their own power, it been't their wiſdom to keep up the like barrier, or ſomething equivalent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; that they may preſerve themſelves ſafe from the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary meaſures of their own miniſtry? or thus, whether for Engliſh men, when their liberties in church or ſtate are faſt lockt up for them and their poſterity by law and regular ſettlements, it been't their beſt way to beware how they repeal thoſe laws, or weaken thoſe ſettlements?</p>
                     <p>But at preſent I ſhall leave it to other men to run the parrallel between our conſtitution, and the ſeveral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I have mentioned, and infer what more they ſhall think proper; only leaving to myſelf the liberty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the ſeveral examples of civil ſtates, which I have named, do ſerve abundantly to juſtify the noble nature of our conſtitution in church-order; for that the ſeveral famous and auguſt nations which I have mentioned, in all their glory at home, and ſucceſs in arms and trade abroad; their ſeveral governments which have brought them to all this, are either a perfect democracy, or very much mixed and blendiſhed with it.</p>
                     <p>Then why ſhould we in New-England be any more aſhamed, or leſs careful of our church-government, which keeps us from tyranny and ſlavery in the concerns of our conſciences, than thoſe nations are of their civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby they are preſerved from the like damnable circumſtances in the concerns of their outward life, and natural rights and fortunes?</p>

                     <p n="1">1. In the firſt ages of the chriſtian churches God has put many marks of diſtinguiſhing favour upon this conſtitution, both in the ſmiles and frowns of his providence.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. In their ſingular purity, and virtuous deportment in the midſt of a corrupt world. That (as Mr. Cotton ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) was a general eulogy belonging to their members, and aſcribed to them by the wiſer ſort of heathen, <hi>ſcil. Bonus vir, tantum Chriſtianus,</hi> He is a good man only is a chriſtian.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They were eminently ſupported and carried on by the grace and providence of God through all their direful ſufferings; the more they were waſted and deſtroyed, the more they grew and increaſed, as Iſrael in Egypt. Indeed whilſt they remained firm to their conſtitution, they were not only like an army in banners, but in reality the greateſt conquerors that ever appeared on earth. They merely baffled the bravery of the old Roman ſpirit, and were quite too hard for thoſe who had vanquiſhed the world. I have ſeen, ſays <hi>Euſebius,</hi> the executioner (tired with tormenting them) lye down panting and breathing, &amp;c. But I never ſaw the martyrs weary of ſufferings, nor heard them deſire a truce: Nay, were rather ambitious of the longeſt and moſt terrible ſufferings, that they might be martyrs in every member. Thus the churches endured hardneſs as good ſoldiers of Chriſt, thro' ten bloody perſecutions; and at laſt retreated by divine providence, under the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage of the great <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> And there the churches of God made the fineſt ſhow that ever was ſeen on earth, next to Chriſt in his transfiguration. Till this time the churches remained the ſubjects of their democratical government in ſome good meaſure though there were ſome ſymptoms of an alteration in the laſt century, but indeed after the churches were freed from the rage of heathen perſecutors, there quickly followed the perfect ſubverſion of their order.</p>
                     <p>So we come,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To conſider the frowns of Providence that purſued the chriſtian world after the ſubverſion of their primitive conſtitution. Sufficient obſervations have been made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the foregoing demonſtrations, ſetting forth the change of government which was made in the churches. And in ſhort, it was really and properly the altering the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of a democracy into an ariſtocracy; for to ſpeak plainly, the public officers to gratify their ambition, took all the power into their own hands, and ſettled all affairs and
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012626_0063_0F8B8F4E690B5AD0"/>
concerns acccording to their own minds without controul. But let us eye the providence of God, and we may obſerve that God did ſoon ſtain the pride and glory of theſe men; eſpecially in two eminent inſtances of his diſpleaſure, which I ſhall only mention.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Inſtance.</hi> 1. In the fatal <hi>Arian</hi> hereſy, that ſpread it ſelf like ſome mortal contagion, thro' the chriſtian world? that it was ſaid the whole world was become an <hi>Arian. Arius</hi> was the author of this damnable doctrine, viz. That our Saviour Chriſt was neither God, nor eternal, but a creature; and that he aſſumed only the body, not the ſoul of man, &amp;c. This damnable hereſy ſoon ſpread itſelf far and wide; the author was in the heighth of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and fell a victim to divine vengeance in the latter part of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s reign: But his hereſy continued and prevailed, and eſpecially amongſt the clergy. But this is very awful to obſerve, that when theſe men by their wit and cunning had once cozened and cheated the fraternity of their ancient rights and prerogatives, God left the devil to cheat and deceive them, as wiſe and learned as they were, of their true religion and ſouls together. What good did all their legerdemain to them now? Had not they better have kept holy and humble paſtors, confined to their parochial dioceſſes, and known and loved and preach't Chriſt the eternal Son of God, and him crucified, rather then ſtretcht their boundary like ſovereign princes, and ſo left to periſh under ſuch a dreadful diſpenſation, as the fruit of their ambition and infidelity?</p>
                     <p>To me (conſidering the commencement, the deadly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the rage, the univerſal prevalence and continuance of this damnable hereſy) it ſeems as though God had lookt down from heaven, and viewed the ſacrilegious robbery commitied upon the churches with deteſtation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſummonned a congreſs of the ſeveral ſtates of the other world. (1 Kings 22.19. I ſaw the Lord ſitting on his throne) and iſſuing out proclamation.—Be it known! That never has a nobler cauſe been ſo baffled and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiouſly betrayed by the dignified truſtees of it as this. I have been down amongſt my golden candleſticks, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous churches; I find the fraternity drowſy and remiſs, ſetting two low a value on their ine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>timable rights. And thoſe who ſhould rowſe them from their ſecurity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy, rather eſteem it a lucky omen; and therefore
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012626_0064_0F8B8F4EC76FE288"/>
to ſatiate their own ambition (inſtead of adviſing, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the churches in the ſtudy of their conſtitution; and ſo plead their cauſe for them) they conſult how to defraud them, they wreſt the ſcripture, darken all places which ſettle their titles, and to end all diſputes threaten them Diotrephes like (3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.) with the ſecular power that is now on their ſide. That they have at laſt abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupplanted them, ſtript and taken away the rights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the churches, and purchaſed at ſo dear a rate. That as though the Almighty ſhould ſay, my patience is out! And my juſtice has prepared a cup of confuſion for them; Who! of all this convocation will go and hand it to them? And there came forth ſeveral legions with an arch-devil at the head of them, and ſtood before the Lord, and ſaid, we will go and perſuade them; and God ſaid, you ſhall perſuade them, and prevail alſo; therefore go forth and do ſo, 1 Kings 22.22. As though God ſhould ſay, I have now in diſpleaſure abandoned them to ruin; they who ſhould have had a zealous regard to my ſettlements and as one chief end of their miniſtry, ſhould have ſought the happineſs of the people, and not their own eaſe, vain glory, pride and luxury; now leave them expoſed to obliterate the eſſentials of their faith, and ſo fall a ſacrifice to divine fury. Go you malignant powers do your worſt, the hedges are now down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Inſtance</hi> 2. The univerſal apoſtacy that has followed the ſubverſion of the old conſtitution. We may in ſome degree date Gods departure from his churches when they began to ſubvert the order of them, and ſo gradually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, till he—at laſt left them to periſh by whole ages together. It muſt not, indeed, be thought, or ſaid, but that God had a remnant through many ages, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued orthodox in faith, both in the miniſtry and brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But yet it is very obvious that chriſtianity <hi>Gradatim,</hi> declined till all was ſwallowed up in a univerſal and direful apoſtacy, never ſufficiently to be deplored; neither fully expreſt, unleſs we tranſcribe the volumns that contain it. I do account indeed that the deſtruction of the churches, in moral ſpeaking, may be attributed immediately and nextly to other cauſes, as ignorance, pride, hypocriſy, &amp;c. But remotely to the diſſolution of the order of them. For that the conſtitution forenamed was adjuſted by divine
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012626_0065_0F8B8F4F8BE21958"/>
wiſdom for preventing and remedying ſuch maladies as proved the ruin of the churches; that when the remedy was quite taken away, bad humours predominate, and ſymptoms of a deadly aſpect appear, and ſo death inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follows.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In the laſt century God has been very admirable in the works of providence, and has therein highly dignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our conſtitution. And we want no other evidence under this head than the recognition of what God has done for theſe famous Engliſh colonies in North-America; who have all along diſtinguiſhed themſelves, from all the world, by their ſingular regard both to the faith and practice of the true religion. Now let any other conſtitution on earth but parrallel ours; in the eminent ſhines of providence and in religious effects, and we will reſign the whole cauſe. But whilſt then, we will go on and rejoice in the grace of God, that we in theſe countries, are by his good providence over us, the ſubjects of the moſt ancient, ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal &amp; noble conſtitution in church order that ever was, will be, or can be; whilſt the laws of nature and grace remain unrepeal'd. For that it is a conſtitution which infinite wiſdom hath authorized and founded in the law of nature; and his omniſcient providence has eminently honored, and dignified, both by the ſmiles and frowns of his countenance, through all the ages of the chriſtian world to this very morning. And though ſome of the reverend churches within this grand conſociation (who ſettled upon the ſame platform with us) have with two great a precipitation made a defection from the conſtitution: Yet this is our comfort, that their alteration is not ſo firm, as the laws of the Medes and Perſians; for that thoſe who turned them off, may by the ſame power bring them on to their old baſis again. And let Chriſt pity, and help them. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly their preſent ſtate is portentous, from what may be obſerved from the proceedings of providence through the whole chriſtian Aera, unto this day.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall now conclude my whole eſſay, by annexing the joint teſtimony of thoſe eminent men, fathers in theſe churches, now in glory. viz. The reverend Mr. John
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012626_0066_0F8B8F504CDBA810"/>
Higginſon, and the reverend Mr. William Hubbard. And the rather becauſe Mr. Hubbard did ſome time before his death, deſire to have their teſtimony re-printed, and live with ſome other book which it might properly accompany. I am well ſatisfied the foregoing ſubject is the moſt proper companion, their teſtimony could have light on, in its travels through the world: I therefore make bold to invite the ſaid teſtimony, to ſet out again with freſh courage, and improve its excellent language, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with former acceptance it found with the churches to ingratiate and beſpeak favor for this ſmall treatiſe, its new allie and fellow-traveller.</p>

                     <p>But leaſt any ſhould think it abſurd, that I here produce ſuch venerable authority in way of epilogue, which ſhould rather in honor have been placed in the front of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. To this I reply, that in honor and prudence I chuſe here to place theſe worthies. For you muſt note; I am now retreating out of the field of battle, and I hope upon honorable terms too; and then the reer is the higheſt place in dignity; ſo that though they are bringers-up, its no diminution to them. And not only ſo, but out of prudent conduct; for though I preſume the enemy is fairly van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, yet ſome forlorn party may rally, and to gratify their deſperate fortune may diſturb us, but I hope theſe valiant and wiſe commanders thus poſted, will ſecure our reer, beat back the enemy, and bring all off with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. ABOVE ſeventy years have paſſed away, ſince one of us, and above ſixty, ſince the other of us came into <hi>New-England, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained help from God, we continue to this day.</hi>

                  <p>We are alſo informed, that many younger men of great worth, and hearty friends unto the church-ſtate of the country, ſcarce know what interpretation to put upon it; but find it a ſenſible diſadvantage unto them, that the elder men are ſo ſilent, and remiſs upon the manifeſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that call aloud for us to open our mouth in the cauſe of churches that we ſhould be loth to ſee led unto deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We that ſaw the perſons, who from four famous colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012626_0068_0F8B8F52EAC96650"/>
aſſembled in the ſynod, that agreed on our platform of Church Diſcipline, cannot forget their excellent charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They were men of great renown in the nation, from whence the Laudian perſecution exiled them; their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their holineſs, their gravity, ſtruck all men that knew them with admiration. They were Timothies in their houſes, Chryſoſtomes in their pulpits, Auguſtines in their diſputations. The prayers, the ſtudies, the humble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, with which they ſought after the mind of God, were as likely to proſper as any mens upon earth. And the ſufferings wherein they were confeſſors for the name and the truth of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, add unto the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which would perſwade us, that our gracious Lord would reward and honor them, with communicating much of his truth unto them. The famous Brightman had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Clariorem lucem adhuc Solitudo dabit, &amp;c.</hi> God would yet reveal more of the true church-ſtate unto ſome of his faithful ſervants, whom he would ſend into a wilderneſs, that he might there have communion with them. And it was eminently accompliſhed in what was done for and by the men of God, that firſt erected churches for him in this American wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>We do therefore in the firſt place, earneſtly teſtify, That if any who are given to change, do riſe up to unhinge the well eſtabliſhed churches in this land, it will be the duty and intereſt of the churches, to examine, whether the men of this treſpaſs, are more prayerful, more watchful, more zealous, more patient, more heavenly, more univerſally conſcientious, and harder ſtudents, and better ſcholars, and more willing to be informed and adviſed, than thoſe great and good men, who left unto the churches what they now enjoy: If they be not ſo, it will be wiſdom for the children to forbear pulling down with their own hands, the houſes of God, which were built by their wiſer fathers, until they have better ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>It is not yet forgot by ſome ſurviving ear-witneſſes of it, that when the Synod had finiſhed the Platform of Church Diſcipline, they did with an extraordinary eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoul and voice, then ſing together, the ſong of Moſes the ſervant of God, and the ſong of the Lamb, in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter of the revelation: God forbid, that in the loſs of that holy Diſcipline, there ſhould be hereafter occaſion to ſing about breaking down the carved work of
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012626_0069_0F8B8F53E008D610"/>
the houſes of God, with axes and hammers; or take up the eightieth pſalm for our lamentations.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was a joy unto us, to ſee and read, a book which the reverend preſident of our college lately publiſhed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tittle of 'The order of the goſpel profeſſed and practiſed by the churches of Chriſt in <hi>New-England</hi>:' A book moſt highly needful, and uſeful, and ſeaſonable; a moſt elaborate and well compoſed work, and well ſuited unto thoſe two worthy deſigns; 1ſt. the maintaining the congregational-church-diſcipline; and 2dly, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſweet ſpirit of charity and communion towards reforming preſbyterians, who are our united brethren. But we muſt here withal teſtify, that in that worthy book, there is nothing obtruded upon the churches, but what they who were here, capable of obſerving what was done ſixty years ago, do know to have been profeſſed and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the churches of <hi>New-England</hi>; (except in one or two) then and ever ſince, until of late, ſome who were not then born, have ſuggeſted otherwiſe. Yea, tis well known, that the churches then publickly maintained thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in ſeveral judicious diſcourſes, which were never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by any men whatever, unto this preſent time. And we do therefore moſt heartily commend that book, of the order of the goſpel, unto the peruſal and acceptance of the churches of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It was one of the ſongs (as the jewiſh maſters tell us) in the ſeat of the tabernacles, Bleſſed be our youth, which have not made our old men aſhamed. But alas, we that are old men muſt confeſs ourſelves aſhamed, when we ſee after what manner ſome of our youth, have expreſſed and behaved themſelves, and with what ſcoffs they have aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the order of the goſpel, in ſome things lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and ſcattered about the country: which have been ſo far from anſwering the arguments brought for our church order, that they have been by the wonderful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Chriſt, made uſeful to eſtabliſh the minds of ſerious chriſtians, in thoſe very points, which they ſee ſo weakly and ſo rudely oppoſed. We have taught our children in the catechiſm, called milk for babes, that there is to be a covenant of God in the churches, wherein they give up themſelves, firſt unto the Lord to be his people, and then to the elders and brethren of the churches to ſet forward the worſhip of God, and mutual edification. And
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:012626_0070_0F8B8F540EC111B0"/>
it cannot but be grievous unto us, as well as unto all ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous chriſtians, for my children of <hi>New-England,</hi> ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to vomit up their milk with ſcoffs upon that and other ſacred actions in our churches, too horrible to be repeated.</p>
                  <p>If they take from us, one of the ſongs among the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Jews, they would however leave us room for one of the ſighs uttered by a rabbi among them; the worſt fruit which we eat in our youth, excelled the beſt which we now eat in our old age, for in our days the world is changed.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Concerning all ſinful attempts to overturn the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the goſpel, hitherto upheld in the churches of New-England, and to ſpoil that glorious work of God, which we have ſeen him doing, with a ſeries of remarkable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, in erecting ſuch congregational churches in theſe ends of the earth; we would now therefore bear our teſtimony, that they are doubtleſs diſpleaſing to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who walks in the midſt of theſe golden can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks, and they will prove bitterneſs in the latter end.</p>
                  <p>And this we declare with the more concern upon our minds, becauſe of an obſervation, ſo plain, that he that runs may read it.</p>
                  <p>It is too obſervable, that the power of godlineſs, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly decaying and expiring in the country; and one great point in the decay of the power of godlineſs, is men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> growing weary of the congregational church-diſcipline, which is evidently calculated to maintain it.</p>
                  <p>If that church-diſcipline were more thoroughly and vigorouſly kept alive, even by thoſe that make profeſſion of it, it might be hoped, that the Lord would ſanctify it, for the revival of all godlineſs in the land.</p>
                  <p>But if this church-diſcipline come to be given up, we think it our duty, to leave this warning with the churches, that probably the apoſtacy will not ſtop there: For the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ame ſpirit that will diſpoſe the next generation to change their way, in one point, will diſpoſe them to more, and more changes (even in doctrine and worſhip as well as in manners) until it may be feared, the candleſtick will quickly be removed out of its place.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We do therefore humbly propoſe it, unto all the churches, as a great expedient, for the preſervation of our church-ſtate, that more prayer (even in whole days of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:012626_0071_0F8B8F54C61EE8E8"/>
ſet apart for that end) with other appointed means, may be uſed in the churches to obtain from the Lord, the out pourings of the ſpirit of grace on the riſing generation. If ſo rich a bleſſing were obtained, (and our heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will give his holy ſpirit unto them that aſk it) and if the riſing generation might be a praying, pious, devout and regenerate generation, there will not be ſuch danger as now there is, of their eaſily giving away the precious legacy which their fathers (now beholding the face of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in glory,) left unto them, or of their doting upon innovations fatal to the order of the goſpel among us.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Now as aged Joſeph ſaid, I die, and God will ſurely viſit you: even ſo, we the unworthy ſervants of the Lord, whoſe age bids us every day look for death, and our call to that world, where to be is by far the beſt of all, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with our prayers unto the Lord for theſe holy churches, that he would ſurely viſit them, and grant much of his gracious preſence and ſpirit in the midſt of them; and raiſe up from time to time, thoſe who may be happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of bringing down the hearts of the parents into the children. The Lord bleſs theſe his churches, and keep them ſtedfaſt, both in the faith and in the order of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and be with them, as he was with their fathers, and never leave them nor forſake them.</p>

of church-diſcipline, publiſhed by a Synod in the year 1648, next unto the Bible, which was the profeſſed, no perpetual, and only directory of theſe churches, they had platform of their church government, more exact than their famous John Cotton's well known book of the keys; which book, endeavors to lay out, the juſt lines and bounds, of all church power, and ſo defines the matter; that as in the ſtate, there is a diſperſion of powers into ſeveral hands, which are to concur into all acts of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; from whence ariſes the healthy conſtitution of a common-wealth: In like ſort, he aſſigns the powers in the church, unto ſeveral ſubjects, wherein the united light of ſcripture, and of nature, have placed them with a very ſatisfactory diſtribution.'</p>
                  <p>"He aſſerts, That a preſbyterated ſociety of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, hath within itſelf, a compleat power of ſelf-reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or if you will, of ſelf-preſervation; and may within itſelf, manage its own choices of officers, and cenſures, of delinquents. Now a ſpecial ſtatute-law of our Lord, having excepted women and children, from enjoying any part of this power, he finds only elders and brethren to be the conſtituent members, who may act in ſuch a ſacred corporation; the elders he finds the firſt ſubject entruſted with government; the brethren endowed with privilege, in ſo much that though the elders are to rule the church, and without them there can be no elections, admiſſions, or excommunications, and they have a negative upon the acts of the fraternity, as well as 'tis they only that have the power of authoritative preaching and adminiſtring the ſacraments: Yet the brethren have ſuch a liberty that without their conſent, nothing of common concernment may be impoſed upon them. Nevertheleſs, becauſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular churches of elders and brethren may abuſe their powers, with manifold miſcarriages, he aſſerts the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary communion of churches in Synods, who have authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to determine, declare and enjoin, ſuch things as may rectify the male-adminiſtrations, of any diſorders, diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and confuſions of the congregations which fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their cognizance. But ſtill ſo as to leave unto the particular churches themſelves, the formal acts, which are to be done purſuant unto the advice of the council; upon
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:012626_0073_0F8B8F58A17CD488"/>
the ſcandalous and obſtinate refuſal whereof, the council may determine to withdraw communion from them, as from thoſe who will not be counſelled, againſt a notorious miſmanagement of the juriſdiction which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has given them. This was the deſign of that judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious treatiſe, wherein was contained the ſubſtance of our church diſcipline; and whereof we have one remarkable thing to relate as we go along. That great perſon who afterwards proved one of the greateſt ſcholars, divines and writers in this age, then under prejudices of converſation, ſet himſelf to write a confutation of this very treatiſe, of the keys; but having made a conſiderable progreſs in his undertaking, ſuch was the ſtrength of this unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble book, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtead of confuting it, it conquered him; and this book of the keys, was happily ſo bleſſed of God for the conveyance of congregational principles into the now opened mind of this learned man, that he not only wrote in defence of Mr. Cotton, but alſo expoſed himſelf to more than a little ſorrow and labour all his days, for the maintaining of thoſe principles. Upon which occaſion the words of the Doctor (Owen, in his review of the true nature of ſchiſm) are, this way of impartial examining all things by the word, and laying aſide all prejudicate reſpect unto perſons, or preſent traditions, is a courſe that I would admoniſh all to beware of, who would avoid the danger of being made (what they call) independants. Having ſaid thus much, of that book, all that we ſhall add con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, is, That the eminent Mr. Rutherford him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in his treatiſe entitled, a ſurvey of the ſpiritual anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, has theſe words, Mr. Cotton in his treatiſe of the keys of the kingdom of heaven, is well ſound in our way; if he had given ſome more power to aſſemblies, and in ſome leſſer points."</p>

they may enquire into the condition of the churches, and adviſe ſuch things as may be for the advantage of our holy religion. But the more particular time is beſt left to the determination of each reſpective aſſociation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5thly, That the aſſociations ſhall direct when there is occaſion for this council to convene, on any emergency, and ſhall direct whether the whole, or only a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe conſociated paſtors and churches ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene on ſuch occaſions.</p>
                  <p n="6">6thly, It appears agreable to the preſent condition of our churches, and from our beginnings acknowledged, that no act of the councils are to be reckoned as concluded and deciſive, for which there has not been the concurrence of the major part of the paſtors therein concerned.</p>
                  <p n="7">7thly, The determinations of the councils thus provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for the neceſſities of the churches are to be looked upon as final and deciſive, except agrieved churches and paſtors, have weighty reaſons to the contrary, in which caſes there ſhould be proviſion for a further hearing; and it ſeems proper that the council convened on this occaſion, ſhould conſiſt of ſuch paſtors as may be more for number than the former, and they ſhould be ſuch, as ſhall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to, and convened for this purpoſe by the miniſters of an aſſociation, near to that whereto theſe of the former council belonged, unto which the agrieved ſhould accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly apply themſelves, and in this way expect a final iſſue?</p>

                  <p>IT is not from any diſreſpect, or for want of honor to the reverend elderſhip and paſtors of your ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, that I apply myſelf more immediately and thus abruptly to your ſelves in this dedication. But for that it ſeems moſt agreable with my preſent provence. The privileges of the fraternity being ſo peculiarly the theme and ſubject of my pains, I eſteem it very proper to introduce my following eſſays, with a few words of advice more directly to yourſelves if you may be thence moved and encouraged to aſſiſt for the ſupport of Chriſt's and your own intereſts. I deſire to be without offence to any, and pray that all ſuch worthy perſons, wiſe and faithful paſtors in theſe churches (who are as much obliged by their office to ſtand by and defend the eſtabliſhed intereſt and rights of them as I am, and far more capable) will interpret my whole action in the moſt favorable ſenſe. And tho' I have not with the noble <hi>Cortius</hi> leapt into a chaſm made in the forum; yet I have ventured to ſtep into the gap, to keep the breach, till better hands come up, for the ſervice of

my country, and in defence of their ſacred liberties; ſo that I hope many of you will come in with a new ſupply and recruit of courage and argument, when and where mine fails; and for the preſent I preſume none of you will be offended, tho' I do thus immediately addreſs the churches over which you preſide, with the following prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their intereſt and duty wrapped up in each other.</p>
                  <p>Then, <hi>Honorable Brethren!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. In general, my advice is to you, that in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and with all gracefulneſs which becomes wiſe men, you will with zeal, courage and faithfulneſs, ſtand in the defence of, and maintain your church liberties; God certainly obliges you to do it, with all the diſcretion and bravery of ſpirit, which becomes free men, in withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vaſſalage or a ſervile ſtate, Gal. 5.1, 13. Stand faſt therefore in the liberties, wherewith Chriſt has made us free, and be not intangled again with the yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: The plea is as forcible againſt a chriſtian, as a Jeweiſh Thraldom. For brethren, ye have been called unto liberty. I muſt acknowledge I have no particular prejudice againſt any of the governments of chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant churches in the world, ſo as to defraud or diſpoſſeſs any of them of heaven; or monopolize ſo great a royalty to our own; but yet I am of this opinion, conſidering the juſt title of the crown, the churches, the people, the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of ſoil and climate together, that the conſtitution and way of New-England churches cannot be mended by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, To inſtance in the civil part, or intereſt of the crown, I think it very eaſy to evince, by the precepts both of religion and policy, that the parliament (that wiſe and auguſt council of the nation) could not have invented an eſtabliſhment in church order, more for the ſervice of the imperial crown of the Britiſh empire than our preſent conſtitution, eſpecially in ſuch a country and climate as this is.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not now any ways enter upon the queſtion, but only give juſt a ſhort hint as to the revenue. Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſtitution does indeed, ſomewhat more than ſip; it takes an honeſt healthful draught at natures fountains, but leaves the flowing ſtreams for empire to ſit at, till filled with ſatiety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="unknown:012626_0081_0F8B8F5FB4A6A728"/>The eccleſiaſticks in ſome kingdoms in Europe are ready not only to chide with crowned heads, but to take them by the throat, and wring out of their hands, if not almoſt a moiety, yet a vaſt ſhare of the golden fleeces that ſhould ſupply the public treaſuries, and cloath the nakedneſs of the kingdoms, and the people have no more wit but to juſtify and defend them in their claims and oppreſſions, and that till they themſelves (in great numbers) are as thin and ragged as penury itſelf; for by their rules of adjuſtment, when the church hath gotten an unconſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhare, then the crown or ſubject muſt be almoſt ſtarved; for there is not left a ſufficient and plentiful ſupply for both.</p>
                  <p>But now our New-England conſtitution is very fair-mannered; for when its ſits down to the ſtalled ox (made ready) it carves temperately and (without much defacing) leaves the whole to the empire to make its armies and navies, with the reſt of its needful and unwearied ſervants welcome. That in loyalty to your prince, and for the ſupport of the royal revenue, you may juſtly preſerve your freedoms.</p>
                  <p>Let us alſo conſider the beſt good of a whole people.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain, true grace is the one thing needful, and the main concern for the improvement of the powers both of prince, noble and peaſant, and tho' grace be of that nature that it will grow (after a faſhion and in ſome ſort of ſoil) almoſt under any government; yet it is moſt agreable with laws of piety and wiſdom (for the good of all in general) to chuſe and ſecure that conſtitution and form of government that is moſt agreable, and which moſt naturally breeds it, and in greateſt plenty.</p>
                  <p>By the ſuffrage of our nation, that government which ſenſibly clogs tyranny, and preſerves the ſubject free from ſlavery, under the ambition of men of great fortune and truſt, is the only government in the ſtate to advance mens temporal happineſs; and we in this country honor the reſolve in civil affairs, and alſo affirm (upon great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) that ſuch a conſtitution in church government is (alſo) the only way to advance grace and mans eternal happineſs; and we are the more ratifyed in our opinion, for that the experiment has on the other hand been tried, with a witneſs, in almoſt all kingdoms of the chriſtian world, and that firſt, by diſſeiſing the fraternity of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt

in church government, only they have had the liberty to be governed with a hook in their noiſe (like wild cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in a ſtring) by the mercy and pleaſures of their drivers; but as for any ſhare in the exerciſe of government, they have had no more, than the horſes in the royal ſtables, for that their ſpiritual owners having ſeized all the keys of church power, they profeſs no dividend ſhall be made, and alſo they themſelves being uncontrolable by any, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable to any, unleſs it be to Chriſt himſelf, as they pretend: Though I believe, thouſands of them never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with him, nor think that he ever will audit any accompts of theirs.</p>
                  <p>But however, for the comfort and glory of the preſent life, the whole government of the ſpiritual kingdom, in all its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Therefore let theſe churches and the noble fraternity of them, ſtand their ground, keep faſt hold of what you have got, Rev. 3.11. Hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy crown.</p>

                        <p>Now if any of Chriſt's churches, are vacated of this officer, by ſuch jealouſies as theſe, or of the like nature, can the officers be without blame? and if ſo, then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt born ſon may not juſtly imprecate future bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs on his own mothers womb, for fear leſt he ſhould be ſupplanted of the inheritance, by the next ſon or brother born of the ſame ventre?</p>

                        <p>For that no officer's particular conſcience muſt be a rule to govern any particular church, contrary to the churches own law, or rule of eſtabliſhment; For if it be, then the churches muſt have as many diſtinct charters, and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing books of canons, as their paſtors have differing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; which is a plain in-let to all ſorts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
                        <p n="3">3dly, Such officers who plead the cuſtom of the churches, and ſo make the illegal omiſſions of ſome, a ſanctuary for the ſame fault in others; but whether this plea from cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom will hold officers exempt from blame, when weighed in a juſt ballance? Cuſtom is juſtly allowed a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror in the world, it ſubdues whole kingdoms to its empire, and all men ſubmit and adhere to its demands and dictates, as to an oracle? But then it muſt be cuſtom that is honorable, laudable, and uninterrupted, otherways
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:012626_0088_0F8B8F691E69ACD0"/>
a cuſtom which continually croſſes a plain precept is very culpable, and contracts a long ſeries of guilt, and may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be purſued with a tedious train of ſad conſequences, altho' it ſhould with much preſumption wipe its mouth and ſay, I am innocent. Therefore cuſtom is no plea in this caſe, but rather renders all who depend upon it, to be reduced to a deſperate poſture in their thoughts and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for tho' there is a cuſtomary omiſſion, that hath prevailed in the churches to a ſad degree, as to this office, yet the omiſſion has all along croſſed a precept, and has been confronted by the cuſtom of other churches in the land, who have attended their duty; ſo that thoſe churches who have maintained the practice, have kept lawful poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the right, and the title being matter of record, and founded in law, there remains no ſhelter here from cuſtom for delinquents.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Whether thoſe officers are juſtifiable, who honor the office, yet do honeſtly and uprightly think that the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row extent of territory may (as to many churches) ſerve as a ſuperſede as to the office? For what need of ſo many great commiſſions in ſo ſmall bodies? But whether ſmall churches have not great work belonging to them, ſufficient to improve a full compleat ſet of officers, and poſſibly, all little enough to do the work well, if the nature and extent of it be rightly conſidered and faithfully managed; for who is ſufficient for theſe things?</p>

                        <p>WHETHER the churches, as incorporate bodies, are free from blame when they don't regularly endeavour to compleat themſelves in all offices, and proſecute their claim to this with effect?</p>
                        <p>The ruling elders are the churches privilege, and a very great right, on which their well-being and ſtability does much depend, and the great omiſſion in the country has probably brought things to that poſture of fickleneſs as we now find them at? Then whether the churches can be exempt from blame, when they ſuffer ſuch vacancies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, when it is in the power of their hands to remedy it?</p>

                           <hi>Queſtion,</hi> Whether any church can poſſibly, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rules of order, proceed to elect ruling elders, when
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:012626_0089_0F8B8F69CE719DD8"/>
other of their officers in actual rule and truſt, ſhall refuſe to call and guide the church in the choice?</p>
                        <p>I ſhall indeed tranſgreſs the bounds of my own inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the civility of an epiſtle, if I ſhould now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a full and compleat anſwer to this queſtion.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall therefore at preſent only juſt indix the principal titles or heads for anſwer, by pointing briefly at the duties of officers, and the prerogatives of the churches in the caſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is moſt apparent through the whole miniſtry of the world (unleſs in abſolute monarchies) that it is the duty of all public officers, to miniſter according to the plain rules of the public ſtate, and not by their own fancy or wills, and ſo in this caſe, the chief ruling officer or officers (then in being) in point of conduct are obliged to lead the church in their opperation, according to the churches plain and ſettled principles, and not reluct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their own perſwaſions do otherwiſe incline them; It is now plainly too late for any officer to pretend conſcience againſt eſtabliſhed rules: This objection ſhould have been made before they had taken office. But now it is out of ſeaſon, for they were elected and ordained to govern the church, not by their own thoughts, as the rule, but by the churches canon, and that by their own conſent, when they took office. And moreover, this is moſt evident, that if ſuch powers which belong to the inſide of mens being, viz. their hearts, fancies, notions, judgments, imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or conſciences, call them by what names you pleaſe, or let the owners freely fix the titles (the odds is not great,) now if theſe are to be the rule of churches, then paſtors and ruling officers have (in their degree) as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute a dominion over the churches, as the great Turk has over his baſhaws, and other vaſſals.</p>
                        <p>But I hope none here will claim this dominion. And if not, then let paſtors and teachers do their duty in point of conduct (if the churches are not remiſs in theirs) and this great vacancy may be ſoon ſupplied, and there is alſo a relief for officers, if their juſt prerogatives are any ways toucht by the traverſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2dly, To confine the diſcourſe to this preſent example, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ſhorten terms, for brevity's ſake, it muſt be granted that any particular officer ſenſible of his duty, that ſhall undertake to gratify and lead the church, in the election
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:012626_0090_0F8B8F6A9C410458"/>
and choice, &amp;c. This makes the caſe very eaſy in point of conduct; yea, tho' other officers in the ſame church, if there be any, ſhould either oppoſe or not act. For that any one ruling officer in a church, where they may be many of the ſame nature, he himſelf is vertually the whole college of officers in any office-act that he performs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. As in civil affairs, a particular executor ſo far ſuſtains the whole executorſhip, as that he can make a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid act in that miniſtry, though many others are joined with him in the ſame teſtament, and yet don't nor won't act with him, in this or that affair, tho' confirmed in their truſt; which principal is founded in the nature of a joint tenancy in general, and in a joint truſt in particular, held by many equals.</p>
                        <p n="3">3dly, The caſe is very difficult when the ſtanding officers join as one man, and will not guide the church in theſe elections referred to, &amp;c. And I muſt needs ſay, I fear here has been the great bar to this office.</p>
                        <p>We may from intereſt, as well as duty, rationally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the inclinations of the churches, and the deſires of many of them have been made known by repeated and honorable ſolicitations therein, ſaying to Archipus, fulfil thy miniſtry, Cor. 4.17. And we may alſo affirm, the principle is plain, the office is acknowledged, at home and abroad to be of divine original. But however this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is a formal eſtabliſhment by theſe churches, and not now to be diſputed. Yet the officers pretend, they ſee no reaſon to give way to the churches deſire or demands, neither will they conduct in this caſe, though their duty does oblige, that ſo the church may be compleated in its officers; no! they are pleaſed by acts of a ſuperintending power, to lock the church door, and turn the key againſt this office, and no pleas or perſwaſions can alter their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. But hereby the officers do plainly abdicate their office, by changing the acts of a limited truſt, bounded by precept into what is meerly arbitrary; ſo in a degree, they break up the relation between themſelves and the church, and by ſuch an eſſential error, ſo contrary to the churches charter, and their own commiſſion they forfeit all at once, tho' lenity and mercy may favor them with a long life; yet in the eye of juſtice they are dead men, if not in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet in law, and upon their OBSTINACY may juſtly be DEGRADED, therefore in ſuch a caſe when it comes to
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:012626_0091_0F8B8F6B607C3538"/>
that extremity, the churches may and ought to call in council, and proceed in their work and duty for their own well being, after the manner of an inorganic church, platform, chap. 10. And this I need not ſtand to deſcribe, our platform, the laws of the province, and the practice of the churches in other caſes, and vacancies will do it.</p>
                        <p>Then whether theſe congregational churches thro' theſe provinces may not juſtly reflect blame upon themſelves, for too ſupine negligent a frame of ſpirit, towards ſo great an intereſt, and ſo noble an office, ſeeing they have ſuch a ſhare in government, and can fairly reſque themſelves and their own rights, by the power and principles of their own eſſence, when their other officers neglect duty?</p>

                  <p>There being now under cognizance, ſuch as are of hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable families, and yet arreſted and brought by due courſe of law to anſwer for high crimes, it muſt not be ſuppoſed rudeneſs in manners, though they be ſomewhat freely and ruſty handled whilſt the proſecution is held agreable with the impeachment and rule of juſtice. And as for myſelf, who am under commiſſion from authority, to appear in defence of my country's ſacred liberties: I can in my own juſtification, affirm, that I have no diſhonorable inclinations, but carry a juſt mind, ſo as to condemn no man or thing, but upon plain evidence, nor to aggravate any plea beyond its juſt bounds.</p>
                  <p>Therefore tho' in the following pages there may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, a great liberty in argument, with a mixture of ſatyrs, as tho' none but my inferiors were involved in the charge; yet aſcribe it unto my love and veneration for ſo great an intereſt as I appear for, and not to any baſe intent of ſinking the honor, or darkening the luſtre of men. I neither deſire nor deſign to hurt any man, no, not ſo much as an hair on his head, but I ſolely aim at ERROR, that is the butt I level for.</p>
                  <p>Thus having by this brief, but ſincere apology, ſecured the honor of my intentions, if I am worthy of belief; I ſhall no longer interrupt the proceſs, but ſhall nextly, draw up the indictment, upon which theſe propoſals are to paſs, and abide a trial.</p>

                  <p>HERE is miſchief, miſchief in <hi>Summo Gradu</hi>; yea, exorbitant miſchief. This is the charge I offer to make good againſt the propoſals, at the bar of common reaſon; in order thereto, I ſhall proceed, and expect to produce ſufficient evidence under two heads.</p>

                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="query">
                     <head>2d Query.</head>
                     <p>Whether length of time has diſcovered any eſſential error in the government of theſe churches?</p>
                     <p>And 1ſt, it has, or 2dly, it has not.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If time has made any ſuch diſcovery, yet the propoſals have not been ſo fair as to detect it, or deſcribe wherein, or in what reſpect. The great ſervice theſe churches, with their government, have done, in ſubduing and beautifying a wilderneſs, beſpeaks ſome conſiderable reſpect from all men, who value wiſdom or piety; that it muſt needs ſeem a harſh piece of juſtice, without any formal trial for them to be driven from plenty, and ſent to the doors of their own tenants, to beg for a booty, out of that eſtate which was once their own at leaſt, by a ſeiſin in fact, if not in law; for that the propoſals kill, and take poſſeſſion with far leſs ceremony or legal formalities, than Ahab did, in gaining the right of Naboth's vineyard; when as if there is any eſſential error in their frame or conſtitution, and that they have either ignorantly or treacherouſly aſſumed any peculiar prerogative which be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>longs

to Chriſt's throne, as king, that was never their due to poſſeſs (and ſo being conſidered as uſurpers, are dead in law) yet notwithſtanding it would not have offended againſt the laws of gratitude in ſending them to their graves, to have put ſome more marks of honor upon them, by certain ſolemn and uſual forms of trial in the prologue of their diſſolution; for they have been certainly great and good ſervants to the public, that if they deſerve to die, they ought to die under all the marks of honor which juſtice can allow of, at the leaſt a grand ſeſſions, a jury, and liberty to make plea in their own defence, and under the influence of royal council, ſhould have been granted; unleſs they may be treated as conquerors, ſerve unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate pirates, who when taken, are without form of law hung up at the yards-arm.</p>
                     <p n="2">2dly. But if no ſuch diſcovery can be made, whether it is a wiſe and juſt thing for men to alter their government? The churches of Chriſt in this country, have been in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this form of government; and it hath been eſtabliſhed by certain legal and orderly familiarities, and univerſal conſent; and has continued upwards of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years. And as the poet ſays, <hi>Pervarios Caſus Per Tot Diſcrimina Rarum Tendimus in Caelum,</hi> They have paſſed various changes, and great temptations, and yet to this day by this beſome of diſcipline have been kept as clean ſwept, as any churches of God in the world; and any ſuch embroilments as have lately happened in the churches, have been more the folly of adminiſtrators, in not keeping to the rules of government, than from any defect in the conſtitution. Then what reaſon have we to meditate a change? No, certainly; it will be more divine and agreable with the law of our religious gratitude, to join with the rev. Mr. Nicholas Noyſe, in his doxology, or uſe of triumph and praiſe for the great mercies he recites in his election ſermon, p. 79. ſays he, Thanks be to God and the king! our houſes and our lands are our own, without every mans being at the coſt of a charter; and yet we have the liberty of our religion, and the free exerciſe of it, without ſubſcribing new articles of faith, worſhip or diſcipline; which is a great favor of God, if we have wiſdom and grace to improve it rightly.</p>
                     <p>

elſe will do it for us? No ſurely! But it will be more agreable, with both our policy and duty, to follow the good advice Mr. <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> leaves us in his golden-ſtreet, page 40, in theſe words, "Where we have a platform left us that is according to the word of our gracious Lord, and the pattern in the mount; we ſhall be great enemies to ourſelves, if we do not keep to it."</p>

                     <head>3d Query.</head>
                     <p>Whether it be not great boldneſs for any particular gentlemen to invade, null, alter or weaken ſo great a right and property, as is the government of theſe churches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent?</p>
                     <p>Government is the greateſt bleſſing in the world, of a worldly nature; it is felony, cheaper by far to the looſers, to plunder men of their eſtate and wealth, nay, and of their lives too, then to diſpoil them of government; for by the latter, you harraſs and worry them in the world, with plagues and miſeries, worſe than death itſelf, that the baſeſt is far better than no government; a churliſh tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is better than an inſolent anarchy, where men are without law, and all hail fellows, not well but badly met. And for men to alter or ſwap government, without all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted parties are agreed, is a very bold intruſion.</p>
                     <p>That, yea, that government which is in any good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure formed, and does agree with the natural freedom of human beings, and is adjuſted by the laws of wiſdom and honor, and plainly, and fairly eſtabliſhed; is too much of God in the world, and too great a royalty belonging to men, for any to play the knave or fool with.</p>
                     <p>And when a government hath done all things in the main well, and has reapt in a great ſtock of bleſſings, now to ſhuffle it out of place, is fickleneſs, and not policy; for a ſenſible ſeries of bleſſings will always atone for ſome ſeeming defects in a conſtitution. Therefore when all Iſrael met at Ramah, in a general aſſembly, to alter their conſular government, which had been crowned with ſignal bleſſings, they got ill will in the court of heaven for it, 1 Sam. 8.7.</p>
                     <p>The great ſucceſs which attended, ſignified it to be a theocracy, and that it had more of God, than of man in it, which is an argument, <hi>(Caeteris Paribus)</hi> for all other governments, and ſo for this of New-England churches, which has been honored with great ſucceſs, and many

                     <head>5th Query.</head>
                     <p>We muſt needs then enquire, from whence the propoſals derive their force? Who gives them letters of attorney, or commiſſion to ſue theſe churches (by a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>) out of poſſeſſion of their government? To me (I muſt needs confeſs) the attempt is very daring; and I ſee no way of reconciliation, unleſs the ſcheme drawn in the propoſals can be fairly ſheltered under ſome more authentic and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious umbrage, than the bold dictates, tho' of the wiſeſt of men, when they are pleaſed to ſet themſelves up oracles for their country.</p>
                     <p>So I come,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To the more critical examination of the propoſals themſelves, which I ſhall attend,</p>

                     <p n="2">2. More particularly, by taking a ſurvey of them in their diſtinct ſections.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. More generally, by enquiring into their original, and nature.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By making a more exact inqueſt and ſearch after their original; and in this debate, they forfeit their eſſence, unleſs they can derive their pedigree, either,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From Gods immediate inſpiration. Or,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From ancient revelation. Or,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From right reaſon, which is a ray of divine wiſdom, inſtampt upon human nature. Or,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. From the platform of the churches, which is a ſyſtem of government, collected by our anceſtors out of ſeveral fountains, and principally from the ſcriptures. Now in purſuing this diſtribution, I ſhall diligently enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we can hear of their original under any of theſe heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="102" facs="unknown:012626_0101_0F8B8E611D1DD798"/>1. As to immediate inſpiration, I muſt needs preſume, theſe gentlemen will not dare to aſſert, that they are ſent immediately from God with this meſſage to the churches; they are too good and wiſe to pretend (with enthuſiaſts) to immediate viſion, or a ſpirit of prophecy; both the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and manner of their writing, ſufficiently convinces, that theſe propoſals are their own ſentiments; they durſt not put, a, Thus ſaith the Lord upon them; ſuch an inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too heavenly and royal for ſuch coin; for both they and we know, according to, Deut. 30.12. It is not in heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, who ſhall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may know it, and do it? There is no need to ſend meſſengers to that court, to learn by immediate and extraordinary information, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laws of our duty or intereſt; for that God hath made all things ſufficiently plain, by this time of day, either by ſcripture or reaſon, for the conduct and government of his churches; yea, of the ſubjects of his univerſal intellectual monarchy in this world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to ancient revelation; holy ſcripture, that beſt, tho' not the biggeſt of books, is the ſaint's library, and the clergy-man's pandects, whence he takes the rules for the management of his truſt: ſo that it is very amuſing, that the bible ſhould be forgotten in drawing up ſuch ſchemes as theſe; as, tho' the uſuage of the pope's conclave, which turns the bible out of doors for a wrangler, and gives the chief ſeat to tradition, &amp;c. were here in faſhion. Indeed, I cannot but eſteem them very unfortunate propoſals, to be turned ſo naked into the world, as not to have the leaſt tincture of ſcripture to guard them from contempt; no, not ſo much as a citation, that might admit of ſo much as a ſtrained conſequence in their defence. And ſo, tho' leſs prophane, yet they are alſo leſs politic than the moſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate of hereticks, who always bring their errors on the ſtage, guarded with ſcriptures, and craftily endeavour to make their citations look with ſuch an aſpect, as tho' they were encampt on their ſide. But here we have nothing for our faith to lean on, but ſo many auſterer <hi>Ipſe Dixits,</hi> as bitter pills of dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h for the churches to ſwallow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of the confection of heaven, or the ſweet manna ſprinkled upon them; or elſe only ſo many naked human preſumptions, as arrows or bolts, too raſhly ſhot out againſt the ſides of our churches, and no word of ſcripture
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:012626_0102_0F8B8E61F0F595A8"/>
to tip or feather them. Nay, it is very memorable, and I account fatal, and to be obſerved that God, that ſacred title of the almighty, with which the holy ſcripture does ſo abound, is not once named (as I can find) in the whole treatiſe; as tho' the moſt ſacred titles, as well as ſections of that heavenly book, would move fears, and irritate jealouſies, rather than pour down ſolace and comfort upon this undertaking. Therefore, in a word, the whole bible is thrown by as a ſealed parchment, or as one that never prophecies good to ſuch adventurers. Therefore theſe propoſals being apprehended as ſea rovers, and indicted upon the ſtatute of piracy; and upon examination being found without the prince of princes colours, and yet do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great miſchief, in aſſaulting and wounding his churches and lawful ſubjects, on their honeſt occaſion; being bound on a voyage to their own country, they can no ways in juſtice eſcape, but muſt paſs under the ſentence, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the pains of death, for they are taken fighting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>3. As to REASON.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Recta Ratio,</hi> Right reaſon, that great oracle in human affairs, is the ſoul of man ſo formed and endowed by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a certain ſagacity or acumen (in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar examples, ſharpened by the conſtitution of nature by grace and ſtudy) whereby mans intellect is enabled to take up (<hi>pro Medulo,</hi> or in a degree) the true idea or preception things agreable with, and according to their natures. So that if we bring theſe propoſals under examination by the laws of reaſon; we muſt enquire, whether they are agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the nature and conſtitution of the churches, if they fully harmonize with their principles of eſſence, then they may be enroled for canons; but if they jar, and are plainly repugnant, we may then lawfully cenſure them, and pronounce them irrational. Whether theſe churches are conſtituted by ſcripture or reaſon, yea or no, that is not our queſtion, but being of ſuch a frame or conſtitution, as they now are, and always have been; all who pretend to ſupport and preſerve them, and yet take ſuch meaſures, as will utterly overthrow and diſſolve them, ſuch repairers have apparently deſerted the dictates and government of right reaſon.</p>
                     <p>And here we may collect an induction of ſome few hints of certain particulars for evidence; the platform aſſerts a
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:012626_0103_0F8B8E628F5D8478"/>
claſſes to be no goſpel form of church order; the propoſals ſay it is; or they abuſe our credulity. The propoſals or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the aſſociation to have the firſt cognizance of church caſes; our government ſays, no, it belongs to the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of particular churches. The propoſals gives power to the aſſociation to have the firſt cognizance of church caſes; our government ſays, no, it belongs to the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of particular churches. The propoſals gives power to the aſſociation to limit elections, and to direct them; but our government ſays, no, it will not conſent; the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of officers is the prerogative of the churches, and they wont, as yet, part with it, &amp;c. So that when we can by the rules of grammar, reſolve yea and nay, to be the ſame voice and word, then you may reconcile the propoſals and the platform; that certainly whatever there be of religion, the method is apparently diſagreable with common reaſon.</p>
                     <p>4. As to the PLATFORM.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall repreſent it by a kind of a ſhort proſopopa, thus, viz. enquiring whether the propoſals are reduced from this fountain, the platform with all its chapters, and with one joint conſent, as plain as the tongue in their heads can utter it, ſay, that ever ſince it poſſeſt the government, ſo much as dream'd of them. It may ſay with deſtruction, (Job 28.22.) we have heard of the fame of theſe things, with our ears, but never imagined ſo much as a ſeminal virtue in our own being, for their procreation; but rather ſtarts with the news of their approach, out of fear of its own diſſolution, from their repugnant and formidable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therefore as in a grievous fright from ſurprize, cries out with <hi>Athaliah,</hi> treaſon, treaſon! And begs that zeal and conſcience, thoſe two ſollicitors for the crown, will at this grand court of Oyer and Terminer, implead and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them as traitors to the prince of peace, and felons to theſe churches, Chriſt's loyal ſubjects. So I come,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To enquire into the nature of theſe propoſals, by ſurveying their compoſition and properties.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. Their compoſition.</p>
                     <p>They ſeem a conjunction of almoſt all the church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the world, and the leaſt part is congregational. Indeed, at the firſt caſt of the eye, the ſcheme ſeems to be the ſpectre or ghoſt of preſbyterianiſm, or the government of the church by claſſes; yet if I don't miſtake, in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:012626_0104_0F8B8E6346802F40"/>
there is ſomething conſiderable of prelacy in it, only the diſtinct courts of biſhops, with the ſteeples of the churches, tythes, ſurplice, and other ornaments, do not ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo viſible, as to be diſcerned at the firſt look, yet with a micreſcope you may eaſily diſcern them really to be there in <hi>Embrio, et in Rerum natura</hi>; For this is a known maxim, <hi>Quod neceſſario Subintellegitur non deeſt.</hi> What is neceſſarily underſtood, or lies hid in the intention of a deſign, is really there, by a juſt interpretation; therefore theſe propoſals which dare revolt ſo far at a ſtep, as theſe have done, muſt needs underſtand no leſs in their aim, than an enobling government for clergy-men, which our princes and parliaments have adorned the churches with. This ſeems rational, that thoſe which never ſtick at robbing the churches of ſuch an immenſe treaſure, as the propoſals carry off, will never ſtand. Shall we! ſhall we! at the offer of a biſhoprick, which is a barrony with all its rights, and royal appurtenances.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo ſomething in it, which ſmells very ſtrong of the infallible chair, to aſſume the power of making rules, to engroſs all principles of proceſs, the right of election, the laſt appeal, the negative vote, and all ſuperintending power in matters eccleſiaſtic, as the prerogatives of clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, diſtinct from all other eſtates, and miniſters in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; or thus, for the clergy to monopolize both the legiſlative and executive part of canon law, is but a few ſteps from the chair of univerſal peſtilence, and by the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der here ſet up, clergymen may, if they pleaſe, clamber thus high; for when they are inveſted with what is in theſe propoſals provided and intended for them, who then can controul them, but the Almighty himſelf? as was ſaid of thoſe daring men, Gen. 11.6. And now nothing will be reſtrained from them, which they have imagined to do; for who can now with-hold from them infallibility, or ſtop the direful and definitive ſentence? Who can limit their power, or ſhorten their arm in their executions? Their bulls can now upon any affront, bellow and thunder out a thouſand terrible curſes, and the poor affrighted and invaſſal'd laity, both princes and ſubjects (being here as in the grave, put under one and the ſame to pick) muſt fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt Property, is Diſorder. Order is both the beauty and ſafety of the univerſe; take away the decorum where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the whole hangs together, the great frame of nature is unpin'd, and drops piece from piece; and out of a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtructure we have a chaos. Theſe propoſals are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very miſchievous, if not in matter, yet in the manner of production; they are full of diſorder, being things born out of due time, their conception is without counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, from the rule of order. Indeed, there is no ſtatute to be found that will juſtify the firſt coitus of the parents, neither will any allow their ſocial life; that the birth muſt bear the attender, of being both begotten and born, out of lawful wedlock, and ſo in point of honor fall under the cenſure of the Levitical law, and muſt be kept back from promotion; for, Deut. 32. "A baſtard ſhall not enter into the congregation."</p>
                     <p>That to paſs all other remarks, if we are under miſtake in the aſſertions; I then demand and enquire, where is that lawful authority, which publiſhed legal banes, with the conſent of all the intereſted perſons, and the regular conſummation of the match? If any rule can be found to ſhelter and honor the conception and birth, let it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and it eſcaping other felonies with life, this ſcandal ſhall be taken off, but otherwiſe it muſt remain as a bar to the tenth generation.</p>
                     <p>The 2d Property, is Uſurpation. The propoſals ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently uſurp the church prerogatives. It has been aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it is true, theſe churches have been ſettled upon the platform of their own government for upwards of ſixty years; they have often reviſed and re-inforc'd the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both as the principles of their conſociation and union in general, and the form of government, for every church in particular.—Then for theſe propoſals without licence to aſſume a legiſlation, and form a government ſo repugnant to their own, can be no leſs than uſurping a dominion over them, contrary to the rule, 1. Pet. 5.3. neither as being lords over God's heritage. Leſſer acts againſt empire, hath coſt many a bold man his he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="107" facs="unknown:012626_0106_0F8B8E66F6FAE3E0"/>
out all the enobling royalties, liberties and enfranchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it, and ſacrifice them to their own ambition! It is enough to put mankind into an uproar.</p>
                     <p>It is freſh in memory, that when ſome of our Engliſh princes (and one would think, if any men may, they may be allowed to aſpire, yet when they) have preſumed on leſs things than theſe propoſals reach after, in gratifying their aim at an abſolute monarchy, when as they have not dared to lay out with ſuch freedom, a new form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a wide mouth, gaping to devour the Engliſh liberties, (as theſe propoſals do the churches,) but only with much ſecrecy, covin and policy, they have by ſome more clandeſtine meaſures, been intruding upon the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent liberties of the Engliſh nation. Every one knows what direful convulſions this has bred in the bowels of the kingdom. And may it not ſerve to enliven this plea? To invite all ſuch who are with <hi>Plato,</hi> owners of a great genius at inventing new, or modelling old government, to try their ſkill in altering the Engliſh monarchy, and ſee how it will be probated. That is, ſuppoſe you ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to interdict the royal aſſent, or convert the preſent monarch into a duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> or diſſolve the lords in parliament or (rather in harmony with this ſcheme) turn the burgeſſes and knights of the ſhires (as a ſort of men not fit for politics in parliament) out of doors? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our ſovereign, the peerage, or ſubjects of Engliſh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties would take it well? And whether chriſtian men may make bolder with the eſtabliſhed government of Chriſt's churches, than with that which belongs to civil affairs? In honor to the <hi>New-England</hi> churches, and with venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Engliſh monarchy, I dare aſſert, that there is in the conſtitution of our church government, more of the Engliſh civil government in it, and it has a better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion to ſuit the true Engliſh ſpirit, than is in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh church, or any other, both as to the legiſlative and executive part of government. Indeed, conſidering how things are at home in church and ſtate, I have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ready to query, why the nation ſhould be ſo ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with their civil, and yet ſo careleſs and regardleſs of their goſpel liberties, ſo as to truſt their conſciences, with their clergy, more immediately, and yet wont venture their eſtates with their learned judges, without the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and mediation of juries; as though they were more
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:012626_0107_0F8B8E6723621B00"/>
careful and wiſe in ſecuring their eſtates than their ſouls, and valued one far more than the other. But I ſhall go on with the compariſon.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the legiſlation; our <hi>New-England</hi> convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on admits, and the government does profeſs the fraternity as neceſſary to the being of all ſynodical aſſemblies, that as far as legiſlation ſpiritual, is left to men, and as they have a great treaſure, viz. their ſalvation embarked, ſo they have a great intereſt in the management of it; and herein they agree with the Engliſh caution and wiſdom, in the modes of civil government of the empire; for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are one great eſtate in the civil legiſlation; and they have a great power in the management of that great truſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to adminiſtration, or the executive part of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, our <hi>New-England</hi> government grants a juridical power to the frat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ity, and makes them proper judges in all eccleſiaſtical caſes and adminiſtrations, on perſons cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizable, or that muſt paſs a trial juridice; which is agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the conſtitution, nature and practice of the civil government of the empire; for under the proſecutions of law, no Engliſh ſubject in life, limb or eſtate, muſt be paſt upon, but by the judgment of his PEERS; yea, in all pleas of the crown, ſuch confidence has the government put in the loyalty and diſcretion of the commons, that our Engliſh juries are ſtated arbitrators, and umpires between our prince and his ſubjects. Yea ſuch a dependance has the whole nation in keeping theſe liberties in their own hands, that they reckon the commons in parliament, and juries in the common wealth, to be the great pillars of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh honor and liberties, and they eſteem them as ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts built by the wiſdom of our anceſtors to defend us from tyranny and ſlavery.</p>
                     <p>That conſidering the affinity in theſe two conſtitutions, one would be ready to query, whether the heroic true En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſpirit is not parent to both? Or whether they are not equal debtors to the goſpel, for their original? The improvement of this compariſon is briefly this; ſuppoſe ſome of the great miniſters of ſtate ſhould venture to ſweep away all thoſe civil enfranchizements which are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh-mens birth-right, and ſet up an arbitrary power, with a prete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="109" facs="unknown:012626_0108_0F8B8E67C765FF48"/>
would not be chains ſtrong enough to hold them, as trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to a well formed government, and then laid faſt by a mittimus for great uſurpers? And whether the plea will not hold in juſt proportions, on the other ſide of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon?</p>
                     <p n="3">3d Property, Riotous. The nature of a riot may (in part) be thus deſcribed; it is an unlawful aſſembly of more than three met in one place, to do an unlawful act, as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently breaking down of walls, and pulling up of hedges, and wrongfully entering into other mens rights and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and that in affray and terror of the people. In managing this plea, I ſhall only deſire that the illegality of the aſſembly which formed theſe propoſals, with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and things they intend, and the ancient boundaries which they plainly invade, together with the fearful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions that many good and ſober people in the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage have concerning the enterprize, may be critically examined; and I doubt not but when we obtain the ſuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of this honorable court, it will determine, the implead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed criminals are of a riotous nature, and ſo the indictment will ſtand more valid againſt them.</p>

                     <p>And I am ſure there is great ſtore of this in theſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals; I ſhall inſtance but in two particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In timing the challenge that is here made, to brave a rich and powerful enemy at ſo great a diſtance, and invite him by ſound of trumpet to a pitch'd battle, when ſurprize and ambuſhments might be laid, and do the work with the expence but of a tenth part of the blood which this may coſt. This is not agreable with the art of war; Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel would have put a deriſion upon ſuch meaſures. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob's ſons when taking a bloody deſign in hand, firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to ſtupify and blunt the courage of their enemies, and then came upon them by ſurprize, e'er they could arm in their own defence, (though it does not juſtify their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet it magnifies their ſubtilty) for thereby they bro't their deſign about; whenas if they had gone a more blunt
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:012626_0110_0F8B8E6CCA949288"/>
and daring way to work, Simon and Levi had not been half a breakfaſt for the Hivites. Gen. 34.25.</p>
                     <p>So here, had the churches been convened, and no noiſe made of this deſign, they poſſibly (tho' their treaſures are fortified by right, and ſo in ſafety, and their troops more, ten to one, than their enemies) yet by ambuſhments or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, they might have chanced to have been coakered or conquered out of all, by being flattered, over-awed, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-argued, into a ſurrender or ſubmiſſion; but we may now rationally hope the alarm will rouze the whole camp, and each ſquadron will rebound it to the next with a <hi>hinc Proximas Urit Ucalogon</hi>; and ſo the plot may upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, blame its own bad conduct, more than its fortune.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The deſign itſelf (<hi>Quo ad fluem Executionis</hi>) let it come to birth, as is deſigned or deſired, and the very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens would either frown upon, or laugh at it for its folly: If we examine the climate of the country, the degrees of latitude, and the ſeveral ſtars that chiefly govern, there is no good policy in the deſign; ſo that, methinks the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal frame of nature cries it down for a <hi>Non compos mentis</hi>; for there are no ſuch great creatures as are here conceived, can fare in hard cold countries as the <hi>Camelion</hi> does in warm, there muſt be a very great hoard to ſupport them; and nature does honeſtly confeſs, ſhe cannot anſwer the bills of fare, which belong to their table, and do her duty to the royal exchequer; and this muſt be maintained, or all breaks to pieces.</p>
                     <p>Again, let it be conſidered, whether it been't great intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual weakneſs, or want of policy, for one generation to contrive needleſs loads for the next, eſpecially when they may get as well to heaven, without carrying ſuch packs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the road? It has been univerſally the humor of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, according to the laws of nations and nature, when rouſed by the regular dictates of ſelf-love, to endeavor that every following generation might be more lightſome, free, noble and happy than that which did immediately preceed.</p>

                     <p>Such is the merciful fore-ſight of mankind, and his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable care and fore-caſt for ſuch as ſhall follow, tho' they may never be ſeen or known by their wiſe progenitors.</p>
                     <p>But here is plainly a conſpiracy very heterogenious to ſuch judicious acts of human providence; a deſign plainly, if not perfectly to enſlave, yet to bring poſterity into a needleſs vaſſalage and thraldom.</p>
                     <p>This is an acknowledged verity amongſt wiſe ſtatiſts, That that monarch who has the command of the ſeas, can at his pleaſure command any maritime country. And ſo, thoſe men who have the command and empire of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of mankind, can command their eſtates, and indeed whatſoever elſe is grateful to them.</p>
                     <p>Then, whereabouts are we in our politics, when we have delivered up the royalties that are challenged? And in what a weak capacity ſhall we leave poſterity in? Nay, theſe virtuoſo's themſelves ſeem to be hardened with the oſtrich againſt their own natural iſſue, unleſs the thing would chance to ſpring up as quick as Jonas's goard, and hang as full of pearls and diamonds, as the ſeas, and rocks of <hi>India,</hi> and they themſelves ſhall have the firſt ſhake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fill all their coffers, with this harveſt, or at leaſt, that they are aſſured that they can and ſhall entail their offices as ſecurely as their lands, upon their own children; as was the order of prieſthood, and the faſhion of the houſe of Levi.

                           <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There is no doubt or queſtion to be made, but that the miniſters and paſtors of Chriſt's churches may meet in greater or leſſer numbers; for they are maſters of themſelves, and no more accountable how they ſpend their time, than other men are; but to meet at certain times &amp; places, as political incorporate bodies, or in the form of claſſes, for the exerciſe and management of government, this muſt be determined by ſome precept iſſued from a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power; and without this, ſuch who give the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and exhibit the call, are very diſpotic and arbitrary; and thoſe who attend it, are ſervile in their ſubmiſſion; for there is no man in his right wits will take this honor unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was <hi>Aaron,</hi> Heb. 5.4. The offer or invitation, bids defiance to our conſtitution; for our platform denies the claſſical ſtate of the church under Chriſt, chap. 2. ſect. 5. Therefore this is a daring article, in the criminals caſe; and as it ſtrikes at the vitals of our government, it muſt in the TRIAL bear weight accordingly.</p>

Or may we conclude the beſt model is to follow the civil diſtinctions made by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? And if ſo, then the paſtors of each claſſes are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered through a territory of twenty or thirty miles ſquare, more or leſs, and then it muſt needs follow, that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator, to diſcharge his duty, provide meſſengers to cite all theſe diſtinct gentlemen upon any emergency; but the great difficulty is, what kind of meſſenger it muſt be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther king <hi>Solomon</hi>'s tell-tale bird may be truſted with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch importance? Or, whether the moderator muſt re-imburſe him? Or, muſt he go on his own coſt, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to equity in that law? 1 Cor. 9.7. Who goeth to warfare on his own charge? It is apparently an error, that care hath not been taken to find horſe and man, and bating-places for both on this journey, otherwiſe for a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power to preſcribe chargeable offices, and leave them deſtitute of a temporal ſupport, they muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty die to ſave charges, or turn mendicants, or hope in their travel to meet with the prophet's juniper-tree; all which are as diſagreeing with good reaſon as the propoſal it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The moderator has an unlimited power during the prorogation of the aſſembly. (1.) He muſt judge of emergencies, that he may ſummon the members; and being left veſted with ſuch a prerogative, if after he has made his citation, he recants, he can then countermand his own order, though the gentlemen ſhould be all mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ready to move. (2.) If there chance to be an emergency of common concernment, if he finds his own favorites involved in the guilt and danger; he then gives no notice, but ſtifles the buſineſs, and ſo cheats the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. (3.) And upon any diſguſt, it is now at his mercy to null the whole frame; for he muſt be in place till another be choſen; and how will they get together, if he will not give the word? Unleſs they are creators of themſelves the ſecond time, as they were the firſt. That to inſtitute ſuch charitable deſigns without a fund, and tie ſuch truſt and dominion on the ſhoulders of men after ſuch a lax and careleſs manner, and leave them at ſuch looſe ends, as eaſily to make fools of men; for my own part, I ſlight ſuch methods in government.</p>

Theſe are to feed and rule the churches, they are to receive the accuſations, and prepare them for the churches hearing. This ſection of the platform fixes both proceſs and judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in particular paſtors and churches, without any limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? But the propoſal allows no proceſs to be opened. till letters of licence be obtained, from the claſſes. But why may not all other perſons in office be thus fettered, as well as paſtors of churches? Are theſe the only ſtudents of wiſdom and righteouſneſs, that are ſtrangers to the nature of actions, to the rule and application of it? All other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, in truſt and commiſſion, who are wiſe and loyal, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the hardeſt articles in their employ; and who may ſay to them, why do ye ſo? Our judges never ſtick to hang a man, ſo long as their commiſſions and the law will bear them out, and they themſelves are left, to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of both. And that this propoſal is a ſanctuary for officers againſt a ſtorm: alas! the moſt that we can make of it, is a covering of fig-leaves, and may ſerve for a harbour to cowards and fools, but not for men of ſpirit and conduct.

                        <p n="1">1ſt. For though there is a deſign of new-modelling of men, and bringing clergy-men into another form of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet there is no intent divulged, that they ſhall co-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, bed and board together upon certain charters, as the Friars or Benedictines, in their royal monaſtries.

For, as for the occaſional meeting of men, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſober and virtuous, what buſineſs can be ſuppoſed for a watch, for about the ſpace of twenty-four, or forty-eight hours in ſuch examples?

Theſe and ſuch like royalties, are their <hi>Formalis ratio,</hi> or the formal cauſe (<hi>per Quam Res eſt id quod eſt</hi>) by which they are, what they are; and this will be very evident, if we do but read a ſhort lecture on the churches eſſence ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomized, or let their eſſential and conſtituent parts and powers be viewed in the hiſtory, and philoſophy of their own beings, and we ſhall quickly diſcern your miſtake; for that end read platform, chap. 5. ſect. 2. Ordinary church power, viz. of privilege belongs to the brotherhood, and may be acted or exerciſed immediately by themſelves. And more directly to the caſe in hand, look into chap. 10. ſect. 6. Where there we read<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If an elder offend incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the matter ſo requiring, as the church had power to call him to office, ſo they have power, according to order (the council of other churches, where it may be had, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting thereto) to remove him from his office; and being now but a member, in caſe he add contumacy to his ſin, the church that had power to receive him into their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,

hath alſo the ſame power to caſt him out, that they have concerning any other members.</p>
                        <p>Now herein we find an eſſential article in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and being of theſe churches, that they have and hold ſuch juriſdiction over their own members; that the higheſt tribunal eccleſiaſtical on earth, is there; and that their own delinquent private members, and publick officers are triable only there, and there they muſt receive the definitive ſentence, and abide the execution of it.</p>
                        <p>And if ſo, then I ſhall make bold to revive my query again, viz. Whether the propoſal is either honorable, civil or honeſt, thus to tumble down at one blow, this high ſeat of authority? and to break open our priſon doors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and looſe the fetters of our great offenders? and at the beſt to take them out of our hands, and make their mittimus to foreign paſtors to do juſtice upon them, and yet in the mean time to profeſs, they are doing us no other injuries but only repairing and mending our churches? Again, whether this is fair, and work-man-like amongſt honeſt men.</p>
                        <p>But to make a ſtop here, I muſt remind you, that this head is not to be paſſed over ſlightly; for this is the one thing in the eſſence of our churches, it is their peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchizement and birth-right, and we may not ſell it with Eſau, at a cheap market; if we do, we undo ourſelves; for indeed you muſt know, here lies the marring or mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our churches; here is laid up their ſtrength, and here hangs the pick-lock of their treaſure; for by this key ſtolen, or wrinched out of their hands, the churches of Chriſt in the world, have been expoſed and plundered, for more than a thouſand years, and many of them have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at this day left them, comparatively, but a poor, ſtarved, ſhabbid implicit faith, and a dull, fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In a word, the uſurpations of the paſtors, ſince the great revolt, having unſhackled one another, and broke looſe from the reſtrictions they are juſtly ſubjected to, under the churches power of privilege, has utterly undone the chriſtian world, from this root of bitterneſs and pride, from this ſeed ſprung up, the man of ſin, as we have it in an anomulous author, viz. the Elethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, page 4.

As though he ſhould ſay, the firſt ſpawn or embryo of that inſolent Hector, or aſpiring Nimrod, (who firſt robbed the laiety of their chriſtian liberties, and then hunted down the potentates of the world, and brought them as a rich ſpoil, into his habitation of violence) took its commencement from this principle, viz. from the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies aſſuming to themſelves this eccleſiaſtical preheminence, viz. firſt their obtaining an exemption from the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the churches, for their crimes, and then in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves of the ſole and abſolute juriſdiction (by a diſpotic government) over the churches themſelves.</p>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the reply, I ſhall, firſt, conſider our candidates under trial; as to their qualification; and (ſecondly) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead the propoſal on a juſt prejudice from the corruption of the clergy.</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt. We may conſider our candidates under trial, as to their qualifications, (1.) As to their human learning; and here we abſolutely object againſt the trial of aſſociations, as bootleſs, uſeleſs and perilous, both to them and to us.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the aſſociation, it is no diminution, or treſpaſs upon the laws of honor or truth to affirm, "That the ſettled miniſtry in general (with ſome reaſonable exception) is leſs expert in grammar and points of philoſophy, than our learned children are at the degree of junior batchellors," and that from diſ-uſe, proved from all experience, <hi>Nam uſus Promotos facit</hi>; and alſo for the ſake of more divine ſtudies, which croud out thoſe firſt ideas a great pace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that obſervation, on a learned memory, <hi>Imago Imaginem Expellit, Aliiſ<expan>

Therefore it is a pity to expoſe ſuch venerable perſons to the hazard in this ſervice, leaſt when they become poſers of others, they ſhould be poſed themſelves. I do remember an odd ſtory when I was at college; it was retained as a reproach on a very divine and worthy perſon; tho' he was bred in England a good ſcholar, and alſo had been a ſchool-maſter, and had taught the grammar in his young times, but yet having laid by in a great meaſure, the uſe of ſuch things, for the ſake of more valuable and heavenly ſpeculations, being at the ſolſtice, and one of the corporation, ventured

                        <p n="2">2dly. To US. Accademical learning we profeſs to be a very eſſential accompliſhment in the goſpel miniſtry. It is introduced by the ordinary bleſſing of God upon human endeavours, to ſupply the place of the cloven tongues, and thoſe other miraculous gifts and endowments of mind, impreſt upon Chriſt's ambaſſadors, whereby fiſher-men commence <hi>(per Saltum)</hi> doctors of divinity; and in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant were ſtock'd with ſuch principles of religion, reaſon, and philoſophy, that they were capable to diſpute with Athens it ſelf, and baffle the greateſt wits ſhe could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, in defence, and for the advancement of Chriſt's kingdom, Act 17.18.</p>
                        <p>Thus it is very reaſonable that the churches ſhould be well aſſured of the ſufficiency of the learning of thoſe perſons, e'er they preſume on the miniſtry; yet there is a fairer way in view, fuller of honor and ſafety, than what the propoſal directs to.</p>
                        <p>Our accademy is the ſtore-houſe of learning, and this all mankind will aſſent to. When you have loſt the company of the muſes, there they are found in their freeholds, where they hold the ballance of honor amongſt the learned. This is the place, if not of the goddeſs Minerva or Apollo, yet the Bethel or temple of God himſelf; the God of wiſdom, where he, as chief architect, with his under workmen, form wiſe and learned men, and where you may have them wrought off at firſt-hand: Then certainly here we are to ſecure our credulity and confidence in this affair; here we are to know whether they be of the right ſtamp, yea or no.</p>

                           </gap>ege; for this I am ſure muſt needs ſtand for a verity, that the judgment of a real honeſt and ſkilful artificer (keeping cloſe to his ſhop) concerning the nature and qualities of an edge tool which he hath wrought, and hammered on his own anvil, out of its firſt rude matter, muſt certainly excel him that hath been long from the trade, that only takes it, turns and tries the edge ſlightly, or has but a tranſient view of it: ſo that hence we may fairly infer, that (as to human learning) <hi>Harvard's Commendamus</hi> is moſt valuable and ſufficient, and juſtly ſupplants theſe teſtimonials.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. With reſpect to the more evangelical qualifications of the goſpel miniſtry, we ſhall be ready to honor the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the aſſociates, yet muſt take liberty to object a few things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Suppoſe we, that the trial is made <hi>per Contionem ad Clerum,</hi> by preaching a ſermon, in audience of the aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and I think this is the way propoſed and generally agreed upon, as the ſquare or rule moſt agreable with gunter, to take the dimenſions, length and breadth of our candidates by.</p>
                        <p>Reply 1. What can a ſermon do at deciding this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? for that the moſt ſenſible and valuable, who are uſually moſt humble and tender, are liable by this ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious examination, to be baffled by their own timerity, and quite daſh'd out of countenance by their own fear. Alas! upon their firſt entrance upon the ſtage, to appear in ſo auguſt and awful a preſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>e, this muſt needs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate and put their thoughts into a raffle, as having in their affrighted minds the reſemblance of their going into the Spaniſh inquiſition, rather then dwelling amongſt the ſofter meaſures of the goſpel? Luther himſelf, (that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd inſtance of ſpirit and magnanimity, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member of his life) hardly ever got over ſomething of a panick fear attending him, through the courſe of his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and indeed men of the quickeſt ſenſes are moſt liable to theſe paroxiſms. Then ſurely to put our tyros to this teſt, which may daunt and diſpirit the greateſt hero, is no ways proportionable, eſpecially ſeeing they may under the inſpection of learned, honeſt and judicious men, both paſtors and churches, and thereby under covert of more private invitations (with all their natural fear) creep into this noble work, and keeping on, as their courage and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:012626_0123_0F8B8E7A87FC53A8"/>
ſtrength will bear the journey, may, gradatim attain a juſt and ſufficient probation, as our learned youth have hitherto done.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, the bold and brazen, who can make a greater figure with half the ſtock, by many ſhirking tricks, and diſſembling artifices, defended and ſupported with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and delivery, may obtain the <hi>Euge Juvenis,</hi> that they no ways deſerve, as will be found, when they come to be detected by a more dilatory ſearch, or a more tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Analyſis</hi> made of them. That, to conclude, as the proverb is, <hi>Una Hirundo non facit ver</hi>; one ſwallow makes not the ſpring; ſo in this trial, one good or mean ſermon cannot determine the man, or umpire his caſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Suppoſe the trial muſt be made, and the queſtion determined by a perſon's converſation. And this is a very great article in the ſtate of all ſerviceable men, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the miniſtry, 1 Tim. 4.12. 1 Pet. 5.3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enſamples to the flock. Then certainly a more intimate converſe and ſociety, is a very invincible plea. By the laws and cuſtoms of England, the vicinage muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as affording the moſt competent judges, when perſons reputation lies at ſtake in criminal caſes, becauſe they are preſumed to know ſomewhat conſiderable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and caſes of their own knowledge; and ſo more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of giving a juſt verdict. So in the caſe, what do thoſe perſons know of our learned youth, who make up the aſſociation? Our candidates appear on a certain day, (as blazing ſtars once in an age, and are gazed on, and then they vaniſh) Now what judgment can be made on a mans converſation, by ſuch a tranſient view? unleſs they muſt be handled in this conſiſtory, as perſons that have been bound to the peace, and in open court are to be delivered from their recognizance by three outcries?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Suppoſe the whole ſtock of miniſterial qualifications muſt be enquired into, and judgment muſt paſs by the direction of apoſtolic law, 1 Tim. 3.2. Tit. 1.6.9. <hi>Let them be blameleſs, ſober, apt to teach,</hi> &amp;c. and add what more you pleaſe, which the ſcripture mentions, to fill up the character of an evangelical miniſter, to compleat him in all his gifts and graces, either in his beginnings, or in his riper ſtate; and it is moſt apparent, that our particular paſtors and churches, with the learning, experience, grace, wiſdom and diſcretion they are owners of, can make a more
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:012626_0124_0F8B8E7B901BEE90"/>
upright, judicious and ſolid trial; and give a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our candidates from their frequent converſe with them, and their occaſional and repeated preaching amongſt them, than the wiſeſt aſſociation in the world can do; and it is eaſier diſſembling with the latter, than the former, unleſs the aſſociation will take them home, and both winter and ſummer them.</p>
                        <p>Now then, conſidering that their degrees with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs teſtimony of the college (when particularly deſired) are ſufficient teſtimonials of their learning; and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their other good gifts and miniſterial qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, obtained by converſe, and their occaſional preaching, has been the chief teſt and trial for our candidates; and by theſe methods they have been approbated in order to ſettlement in office-truſt; and this has been the cuſtom of the country and churches for near four ſcore years. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude this argument, I make this proclamation, That if any perſon or perſons, diſaffected with our old ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, and way in church conduct, will produce one example led into the public miniſtry by this practice, which has juſtly offended him, and he will or can evince this to be the blameable cauſe, we will then ſurrender the cuſtom to your mercy.</p>
                        <p n="2">2dly. I ſhall now implead the propoſal on a juſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or preſumption of corruption in the clergy, tho' we are in charity for the preſent, yet in this way propoſed, we have no aſſurance for the future, againſt the corruptneſs of ſuch ſocieties; and let any ſober man obſerve, and he will find abundance of poor tools under the mark of the office, where theſe meaſures, and ſuch like, are in force and form. How oft is it repeated, that poor ſordid, debaucht wretches are put into Holy Orders, when as they were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be put into the ſtocks, or ſent to bridewell for mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, than to be ſent with their teſtimonials, to work in Chriſt's vineyard?

In general, <hi>Paul</hi> ſolves a worſe caſe, than can be found (pick whilſt you are weary for an example to quadrate with the objection, and render it forceable) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all our learned youth, who have hitherto adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured upon the miniſtry, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.18. What then? &amp;c. as tho' he ſhould ſay, What's that to you ſir? If Chriſt be preached, all is well. And as to our caſe, we may ſay, deſpiſe not the day of ſmall things, all men muſt have a beginning, and every bird which is pretty well fleg'd muſt begin to fly. And ours are not of the neſt where <hi>Icharus</hi> was hatch'd, whoſe feathers were only glewed on; but theſe belong to the angelic hoſt, and their wings grow out from their eſſence; therefore you may allow them, with the lark, now and then to dart heaven-ward, though the ſhell or down be ſcarce off from their heads. And ſo we conclude with our charitable and divine apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "What then! if Chriſt be preached, whether in pretence, or in truth, either by old or by young, yet therein we do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice, &amp;c. to ſee our <hi>Nazarites,</hi> ſo forward and well-diſpoſed, it ſhall add to our joy, and no ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our horror, unleſs our ambition ſhould ſurprize us with fear, that ſuch young ſtars ſhould out-ſhine us.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Under the goſpel, we have no preciſe time, though there was under the law, when to begin and enter into the miniſtry, the goſpel knows no bar from time where perſons are other ways meetly qualified. Days and qualifications, are divers things, and the latter are the eſſentials of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt. It is not how old, but how capable a perſon is, which is the main point to be enquired after here. Therefore where (in ſome good meaſure) there is an honeſt life, a gracious heart, an orthodox head, and a learned tongue, there is no reaſon to ſend ſuch youths to <hi>Jerico,</hi> with <hi>David</hi>'s meſſengers, (though their beards are not yet grown) to wait upon time and nature, for ſuch an accompliſhment; for certainly thoſe recited are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal in the argument. It is a ſtory in the hiſtory of Perſia, "That when the Grecians ſent ſome very young noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men upon an embaſſage to that court, the Perſians reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Grecian republic, for ſending b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Alſo, our platform aſſerts the free electing power of the churches, chap. 5.

In theſe words, the power granted by Chriſt unto the body of the church and brother-hood is a prerogative or privilege which the church doth exerciſe in the admiſſion of her own members, and in chuſing their own officers. Now if Chriſt has given theſe high powers and authorities to his churches, he has certainly furniſhed them with ſkill and wiſdom to manage them.</p>

noble matter pre-exiſting, and repeſented in various ſhapes and forms, with a ſound of motion, and various ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies and antipathies appearing, and repreſented by the propoſal; but yet can hear of no ſuperintending ſiat, or any creating voice to over-rule, or ſay, <hi>Let it be.</hi> But only if perſons are diſpoſed, or indiſpoſed, the buſineſs muſt be managed as wiſely as you can; and if it ſhould ſo chance, that ſome fine thing (never before ſeen in the country) ſhould be made out of theſe materials, without the help of a creating power, the world would be a great debtor to the accident; and the churches may they not be juſtly ſtript of their being to make room for it, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it?</p>
                        <p>But to be more diſtinct, and ſomewhat more cloſe in my anſwer, I muſt remind you, that our bleſſed Lord commands us to pray, Mat. 6. Our father which art in heaven, &amp;c. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. And if ſincere, he hath promiſed, to ſtabliſh us, and keep us from evil. 2 Theſſ. 3.3. From theſe divine principles, the queſtion is, whether thoſe paſtors are the ſtable or unſtable, the reaſonable, or unreaſonable men, viz. Either thoſe who have promoted this deſign in the country, or thoſe who have withſtood it? And alſo where has temptation prevailed moſt? And to put this debate under a brighter light, I will make bold to recite a brief hiſtory of this matter, till we bring you to the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of theſe propoſals, and to the day wherein they were born; with ſome preſent improvement of the hiſtory.</p>
                        <p>About thirty years ago, more or leſs, there was no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the aſſociations of paſtors in theſe colonies, and in ſome parts and places, there is none yet. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the country had ſuffered much in the ſlaughters and depredations committed by the heathen, and by many other afflictions, the neighbouring miniſters in ſome counties, met to pray together, &amp;c. and for no other intent, that I ever knew or heard of. But after they had continued their meetings for ſome years, and others following the example began to converſe together, and communicate caſes, as beſt ſuited each perſon; and at laſt perceiving they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gotton into a claſſical form, before they tho't of it, they began to give their meetings the ſpecious titles of claſſes, aſſociations and eccleſiaſtical conventions, &amp;c. as ſecurely as tho' theſe titles were a fruit growing out of our
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:012626_0136_0F8B8E89DD8FD730"/>
own conſtitution; and by degrees began to dream that they were really, and <hi>de Jure,</hi> what their new titles and late cuſtom had made them only <hi>de facto</hi>; and time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their inclinations and purpoſes to compaſs a more formal and compleat ſettlement. It is certain, their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities were conſiderable, the keys of the church trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures being put into their hands. The more the main point is ſtudied, the more glory appears to feed mens ambition, like the impreſſion by the eye, on our great parents in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, Gen. 3.8. The tree was pleaſant to the eyes, a tree to be deſired. Alas! Alas! empire and ſupream rule is a glorious thing! <hi>Parcere ſubjectis et debellare Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbus,</hi> is a very royal buſineſs. Now this conceit did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin pretty much to predominate, eſpecially in ſome gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that were inclin'd to preſbyterain principles, men of worth and learning, who improving their advant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But to make ſhort, and conclude my ſtory; when they had thus far advanced and ripened their deſign, out comes theſe propoſals, like Aaron's golden calf, the fifth day of November, 1705.</p>
                        <p>Thus have you a ſhort account how things have been carried on, relating to aſſociations; and having a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent criſis, I ſhall improve the hiſtory, to promote my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſign, in a few particulars.</p>

the nature of their truſt, and no more go beyond their own line, 2 Cor. 10.16.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whether theſe propoſals here offered to view, be not like Aaron's golden calf? And whether they ought not to be ſerved, as Moſes dealt with that, (Exod. 32.20.) when he took it, and burnt it in the fire; and ground it to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for that it is very evident, that though it be but a calf now, yet in time it may grow (being of a thirſty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) to become a ſturdy ox, that will know no whoa, and it may be paſt the churches ſkill then to ſubdue it.</p>
                        <p>For if I am not much miſtaken (and <hi>Pareus</hi> too) That great and terrible beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns, deſcribed in the Revelations 13, was nothing elſe a few ages ago, but juſt ſuch another calf as this is. It was indeed finely ſhap'd, &amp; of neat limbs, when it was firſt calved; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the great potentates of the earth were much raviſhed with its aſpect and features; ſome offered to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle it on the choiceſt cows amongſt all the herds of royal cattle, (that it might be large) hoping to ſtock their own countries with the breed, &amp; when it was grown to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able magnitude, to render it more ſhapely and fair, they put iron tips on to its horns, and beſet its ſtupenduous bulk with very rich ornaments, that they might make it the more awing to all beholders, and if poſſible, by ſuch artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to add to the natural pride rnd choler of the creature.</p>
                        <p>But alas, poor men! they have paid dear for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality and fondneſs; for this very creature that was but a calf when they firſt began to feed it, is now grown to be ſuch a mad furious and wild bull, that there is ſcarce a chriſtian monarch on earth, unleſs the great <hi>Anne,</hi> their Sweediſh and Pruſſian majeſties, and their High Mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, with this exception, there is ſcarce a potentate in the world, the beſt horſe-man or huntſ-man of them all, that dare take this beaſt by the horns, when he begins to bounce and bellow. Indeed the emperor within theſe few years, has recovered ſo much courage, that he took him by the tail, to drive him out of his royal granges, being quite angry, and weary with his cropping and brouzing on the flowers of his imperial crown. But otherwiſe the beaſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally goes at large and does what he will in all princes dominions, and keeps them in awe. Therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, and infer, <hi>Obſta Principiis</hi>! It is wiſdom to nip ſuch growths in the bud, and keep down by early ſlaughter

It is an obſervation, on the monarchy of bees, that the drones formerly ſuppoſed to be not only a lumpiſh, but a uſeleſs bee, yet is of that nature, and ſo eſſential a member of that common-wealth, that it is really the male-bee, and does impregnate the females, who are the ſole labourers in that kingdom, but when that criſis is over, the poor drones are by common conſent baniſhed, as a great incumberment.

                        <p n="3">3. Is there any certificate, order, or vote, from the churches, as the womb of this council? If there be, the propoſals ſhall then paſs for the innocent midwife, and no harm ſhall come. But alas! if we ſearch all church records, the purſuit is blankt! Therefore it muſt ſtand for a daring intruſion upon the churches power of privilege.</p>
                        <p>It is and will be acknowledged, with great juſtice and ſatisfaction, that the paſtors of the churches are in a high ſtation, as they repreſent the great ſhepherd, and their

truſt is noble and great; they are rulers, and to conduct all tranſactions, &amp;c. But yet muſt never infringe the churches power of privilege in any branch of it? It becomes the holineſs, wiſdom and honor of the ruling officers at a criſis, when the churches are in exerciſe of this power, not to allow themſelves to dictate too imperiouſly: They muſt never indeed, in all their miniſtration, talk with ſuch an elevated language, as in the 3d ſection of the ſecond part, in theſe words, viz. That each church chuſe and depute one or more (private members) to attend their paſtor in their ſtated ſeſſion, &amp;c. As tho' the high commiſſion court was returned from exile, and now opened, and ſome of your graces were to be lord chancellor; this plainly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth too high a creſt. What! to conſider yourſelves as a diſtinct eſtate from the churches, and to ſend out of your higher houſe your orders to be obey'd in the lower houſe, &amp;c? But, I ſay, this is not right, for in convening and calling of councils the churches are your ſuperiors; and upon a ſevere interpretation of their canons, they may, if they pleaſe, leave you at home. For tho' you have been elected once into office, yet in the exerciſe of this their power, you ſtand but competitors with other principal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for their choice &amp; election, to determine you members of an eccleſiaſtical council: Poſſibly this doctrine may ſeem to be but a very crude doſe. But yet I aſſure you, it is approbated by a college of very able and learned phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and I hand it to you as I find it made up in the churches cheſt of medicines, platform, chap. 16. ſect. 2. The efficient cauſe of eccleſiaſtical councils, or ſynodical aſſemblies, next under Chriſt, is the power of the churches ſending forth their elders and other meſſengers, &amp;c. ſect. 3.

Or have you commiſſion with inſtructions from thence to erect within the province, ſuch coſtly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable aſſemblies, as are here projected? Nay, if you can find or pick up amongſt the old ſtatutes, that are not quite worn out, or produce one venerable precept or example throughout the whole Engliſh empire, for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of church or ſtate therein; we will ſtate your caſe, and grant you one imparlance (with due time) if you can make any reaſonable preſumption, it may be had for your juſtification; and in the mean time, I ſhall venture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a few principles of the Engliſh government, that are like the <hi>Vana Cava,</hi> or great arteries in nature, which circulate the blood and ſpirits thro' the imperial body; and if they don't all with a joint voice (like a jury in their return, where no man diſſents) condemn your council and whole ſcheme, you ſhall ſtill have a goal delivery, and be ſet free.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Principle</hi> I. There is no one of the three eſtates of the empire, can make a valid act to bind the ſubject, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute any new forms of government.</p>
                        <p>It is certain the parliament, that ſupream court, by an united voice, is very tranſcendent; it makes null, enacts, and abrogateth all laws, ſtatutes and ordinances concerning matters eccleſiaſtical, civil, martial, martime, &amp;c. Therefore all acts, inſtitutions, creations of truſt, corporations and offices either originally and immediately, or by a fair conſequence, derive from this fountain the imperial crown, inricht with many prerogatives, and adorn'd with many ample flowers; they were there planted by the creating power of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no Engliſh monarch can at pleaſure enlarge that garden with a new ſpecies. That to meet with ſuch things as theſe now under debate within an Engliſh province, &amp;c. Query, Whether they are enacted by ſingle men, or ſmall factions; or by the united voice of the kingdom? If not by the latter, they muſt die traitors to the empire, as tranſgreſſing againſt the eſſentials of its conſtitution, and liberty of conſcience is no city of refuge here.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Principle</hi> II. All Engliſh men are privileged by and ſtrickly bound to the law; that's the fruitful reaſon of all good, and rule of duty. To be bound to the peace, or
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:012626_0145_0F8B8E91C95E3180"/>
the good behavior, is to be bound to the law, that's every mans maſter and guide. Query, whether theſe propoſals, and this council, have not put a ſlight upon this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Principle</hi> III. The vengeance or vindictive juſtice of the nation, flames (in the ſanction of the law) againſt all tranſgreſſors.</p>
                        <p>Every one that breaks the law, breaks from the rule of his duty and truſt, and in a degree violates the power of the nation, and uſurps the whole legiſlation; therefore in the execution of theſe direful ſanctions and penalties affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſtatutes, the omnipotent power of the nation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges the glory of its own independence and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs upon its inſolent ſubjects, according to that, Gen. 2.17. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> Therefore I may ſay to this council, <hi>Memento Mori.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Principle</hi> IV. Every great perſon is under the awe of the law, either as directive or coerſive.</p>
                        <p>It is the ſaying of thoſe who are ſkilled in the law, That <hi>Reg in Rego Suo, Superiores habet, DEUM et LEGEM</hi>; The king has in his realm two ſuperiors, GOD and the LAW, tho' he is only under the directive; but all his great ſubjects are under the coerſive power of it. The nobles and great miniſters in church and ſtate look upon the law as the watchful eye of ſome direful numen. The ſuperior clergy-men, the great biſhops of the kingdom, tho' they appear maſters of ſuch prerogatives, yet they have nothing but what they derive from the law; and the laws are their boundaries, ſaying <hi>Hitherto you ſhall go, and no further at your peril.</hi> That thoſe great men might as well have undertaken with <hi>Archimides,</hi> to have removed the earthly globe (upon condition) as to have done ſuch a thing as this. What! to alter the conſtitution of church government, which is eſtabliſhed by the ſtatute, and canon law of church and nation? This is to blow up the whole kingdom. <hi>Ergo,</hi> put out your matches, and diſſolve your trains.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Principle</hi> V. All Engliſhmen live and die by laws of their own making. That they are never pleaſed with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart law-makers.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Principle</hi> VI. That Engliſh government and law is a charter-party ſettled by mutual compact between perſons
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:012626_0146_0F8B8E928834E038"/>
of all degrees in the nation, and no man muſt ſtart from it at his peril.</p>
                        <p>Query, Whether theſe propoſals have kept to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of this great covenant?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Principle</hi> VII. Engliſhmen hate an arbitrary power (politically conſidered) as they hate the devil.</p>
                        <p>For that they have through immemorial ages been the owners of very fair infranchizements and liberties, that the ſenſe, favor or high eſteem of them are (as it were) <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,</hi> tranſmitted with the elemental materials of their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Had the late reigns, before the acceſſion of the great <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> to the throne of England, but taken the meaſures of them, and her preſent majeſty, in depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vice, and advancing the union and wealth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the prowice and bravery of the nation, they might by this time have been capable to have given laws to any monarch on earth; but ſpending their time in the purſuit of an abſolute monarchy (contrary to the temper of the nation, and the ancient conſtitution of the government) through all the meanders of ſtate craft: It has apparently kept back the glory, and dampt all the moſt noble affairs of the nation. And when under the midwifry of <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilan</hi> art, and cunning of a daring prince, this MONSTER, tyranny, and arbitrary government, was at laſt juſt born, upon the holding up of a finger! or upon the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>The very name of an arbitrary government is ready to put an Engliſhman's blood into a fermentation; but when it really comes, and ſhakes its whip over their ears, and tells them it is their maſter, it makes them ſtark mad; and being of a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The emperor (ſay they) is the king of kings, the king of Spain is the king of men, the king of France the king of aſſes, and the king of England the king of devils; for that the Engliſh nation can never be bridled, and rid by an arbitrary prince. Neither can any chains put on by diſpotic and arbitrary meaſures hold theſe legions. That to conclude this plea, I find not amongſt all the catalogues of heroes or worthy things in the Engliſh empire, peers to theſe undertakers; therefore we muſt needs range them with the arbitrary princes of the earth, (ſuch as the great <hi>Czar</hi> or <hi>Ottoman</hi> monarch) who have no other rule to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by, but their own will. And therefore under this branch of our diſcourſe, and their arbitrary meaſures, I ſhall venture to annex the following Theſes, as concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fairly deducted from the premiſes, and leave them to conſideration.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theſis</hi> 1. They have out-king'd all kings on earth, whoſe prerogatives are bounded, and their kingdoms go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by law.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theſis</hi> 2. They have out biſhop't all the biſhops of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> whilſt they they themſelves have acted with ſuch lawleſs liberty, and left the biſhops fettered in the ſtatutes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theſis</hi> 3. They have out-pop't the pope himſelf, who is head of an hierarchy, ſupported by certain laws, acts and ordinances, for the maintaining an harmony or union between head and members. So in the next place,</p>
                        <p n="4">4. We come to ſurvey the work cut out for this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>CATO,</hi> that great and grave philoſopher, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly demand (when any new project was propounded unto him) <hi>Cui Bono</hi>? or what good was like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue? Now in this preſent buſineſs, the definition pretends to make a ſatisfactory anſwer to ſuch a queſtion, viz. In the employment of this annual council; and that is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the condition of the churches, and adviſe ſuch things as may be for the advantage of our holy religion.</p>
                        <p>It is certain, conſidering the nature of the creature here formed, there had need be ſome <hi>Herculean</hi> labor aſſigned. Thoſe who are purveyors, and muſt provide quarters, will find it very chargeable, that it had need do very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:012626_0148_0F8B8E940709E140"/>
buſineſs. As once king <hi>James</hi> the firſt ſaid to big-lim'd country fellow, who came to court to be a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſome that knew him, told the king how many bowls full, and quarters of mutton he would eat at a meal; ſays the king to the fellow, You ſirrah, that eat ſo much more than other men, if you cannot do ſo much more work than other men, by my ſo'l (ſays the king) I'll hang you. So here, there had need go a handſome ſtock of ſmall cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and other expences to maintain one ſeſſions: that if it has confidence to meet, and is treated with an ordinary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, if it cant do abundance of work, it will be waſte charges, and great incumberment.</p>
                        <p>Now, if this be all that is here propoſed (in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) the creators are very defective in their proportions; for tho' the work mentioned is in itſelf good work; but it's all done already to their hands, there is nothing of this nature neglected in <hi>New-England</hi> churches; at leaſt, no means or methods wanted; but as God ſays, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.4. "What could have been done more for my vineyard, that I have not done in it:" may properly be applied to the churches here, and all for the anvantage and good of our holy religion; that, in a word, there is no want in this country, unleſs it be the want of good and honeſt hearts; and I ſuppoſe you have none of thoſe to bequeath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.9. Upon the firſt view of this ſtupenduous buſineſs, I was ready to fancy, whether or no you had dream'd of, or ſeen king <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth a coming with his old caſe and queſtion, which involved the pope, his conclave, and all the accademies in Europe, and whether you were get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a mighty caſuiſt ready, to take the king's conſcience into conſideration? Or, whether you had news of the old <hi>Arian</hi> war, its breaking out again, that you ſhould in ſuch haſte, (without citing other eſtates for the defence of the kingdom, but only by virtue of your prerogative) run up ſuch a formidable and coſtly redoubt? But if it be all come to this, and there is no more to do, than what every pious and wiſe man does every day, every week, and every ſeſſions, it is even another fit or paroxiſm of the mountains bringing forth, as the poet ſays, <hi>Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſervitude, may not vie it for merit, as equal in pains with any of the great prelates in Europe, in their laborious viſitations; who when they come into ſome capital town in the other part of their dioceſs, and being treated with the ſolemn formalities of ſumptuous feaſts by the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood, and having ſpent the bigeſt part of their paſtoral viſit in glutting themſelves with honor and full tables; at laſt begin the other part of their work, and inquire (poſſibly) how many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in this great town, and whether there be any chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, phyſicians or ſchool-maſters, that do good to their neighbours without licence? Or, whether there be any new <hi>Golgotha</hi>'s to be dedicated, for the ſecurer retreat of the dead to that place? Or, whether the pariſh curates read ſervice well, and obſerve to time their particular leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with the canonical days? And eſpecially, whether the bells are kept in good order? All which makes up a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piece of ſervice, to requite a crown or kingdom for the revenues of a barony! And, whether it may be thought, that our great and yearly council, will come a whit behind the aforeſaid miniſtry in the firſt or laſt part of ſervice mentioned? And whether if they do but equal them, we may not be thought to have made a wiſe ſettlement? But notwithſtanding we ſhall grant, the propoſal makes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a chriſtian duty; for that it becomes all men, who bear a love to Chriſt, to enquire into the ſtate of his chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, both for the manifeſting their love to men, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their prayers and gratitude to GOD. Therefore,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to their outward and temporal ſtate, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ourſelves, by virtue of neighbourhood, by chriſtian travellers, and public letters of intelligence: and thus we may rationally, and with very good moral certainty know the ſtate of the churches, both in other countries and our own; and thus good Nehemiah informs bimſelf at <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> how it fared with his brethren at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Neh. 1.2, 3.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As to their moral ſtate (which conſiſts in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, faith, manner of worſhip, diſcipline and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) this is diſcovered particularly, by their directories, confeſſions of faith, platforms, rubrick, liturgies, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther canonical ſyſtems, made public for that end, &amp;c. And conſidering, that whatever of this nature is neceſſary for the advance of religion, is well adjuſted in this country, it muſt needs be but a vain repetition, or ſeaſeleſs tautology

for a council to meet yearly or quarterly for this end, viz. To enquire what news, or whether New-England's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith is the ſame this year, as it was laſt? Or, whether all the churches, their manner of worſhip, is this ſabbath as it was the other? And as to their converſation (which may ſeem to lie moſt out of ſight) ſufficient provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made by the principles of our wiſe platform (for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the communion of churches) for our enquiry and information here alſo.

Or whether or no theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods dont divulge the whole mind of God to each plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Or, whether theſe gentlemen have any ſecrets of wiſdom not yet made known?

I muſt needs ſay, its plainly ſome of <hi>Joab</hi>'s friendſhip, when he ſpake quietly and peaceably to <hi>Abner,</hi> ſmiled in his face, as his friend, but ſtabbed him to the heart, under the fifth rib, that he dropt, and died.</p>
                        <p>But however, I ſhall endeavor, to reſque myſelf from all impatience, and with deliberation ſum up my anſwer, in an appeal to your own reaſons concerning thoſe ſeveral created truſts, which God has eſtabliſhed, and cloathed with his own authority, every one of which is acted with great vigor, and ſucceſs; and whether you think you can do more than all theſe for religion? Or preſcribe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new which they never tho't of. As,</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="152" facs="unknown:012626_0151_0F8B8E97E3407D88"/>1ſt. Civil authroity, in two great branches.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Legiſlative power (that civil omnipotence) is doing very great things for religion, by their proclamations, and all penal laws enacted for the cruſhing of immorality and vice, and all their wiſe and exact precepts for the ſupport of juſtice and piety. They are opening many civil chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, whereby they are conveying judgment, juſtice and righteouſneſs down our ſtreets, from the great fountain. Nay, this great and dread aſſembly puts awe upon all mankind. And the more daring and deſperate are kept within compaſs, from a ſenſe of this moſt terrible ſeat of thunder hanging over their heads, &amp; upon every affront ready to break in ſtrokes of vengeance and woes upon them, eſpecially if they grow beyond the reach of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law.</p>
                        <p>And in ordinary caſes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The executive power, or miniſters of the law, are like a ſtanding camp to awe, and a flying army to beat off the enemy; they have their ſpies and ſcouts out in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very quarter to obſerve his motions, and break his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, viz. In the innumerable numbers of all ſorts of civil officers; and thus by the ſword of juſtice they hunt down ſin and impiety in the land. They are a terror to evil men and a praiſe to them that do well; for the civil authority, by their wiſe and juſt precepts, their perſonal and noble examples and zealous adminiſtrations, out-do <hi>Plato</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all his moral reaſons; for they can turn a Sodom into a Sion, and keep Sion to be Sion evident by the hiſtory &amp; chronicles of ſeveral governments of God's ancient people. <hi>Nam Regis ad Exemplum Totus Componitur Orbis.</hi> For chief rulers, by their good or bad meaſures, can make or marr, kill or cure a nation, in a moral ſenſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <hi>The churches.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>View once more, from ſome lofty promontory or <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gah,</hi> thoſe goodly tents and tabernacles of Iſrael! Liſten! Is not God with them, and the ſhout of a king amongſt them? Are they not as valleys ſpread forth, and as gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens by the river ſide, which the Lord hath planted? And yet notwithſtanding, may we, muſt we under your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, break up their fences, to give them another ſort of culture? Nay, conſider well! Are not the flowers bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wed, and the weeds more kept down, than in moſt of the incloſures in the world, belonging to the great huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man?
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:012626_0152_0F8B8E98850990E8"/>
And may you not (in reckoning up of means) allow us peculiarly to aſcribe to their government and other of their meaſures agreeing with the nature of it in dreſſing the ground? But I will not enlarge this head; it is obvious enough from their miniſtry, from their faith, their diſcipline and converſations.</p>
                        <p n="2">3. <hi>The nurſeries of learning.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Query.</hi> Were a council called, of all the learned heads of the whole univerſe, could they dictate better laws, and adviſe better meaſures for the acquirement of learning, the increaſe of virtue and good religion, than are in that royal province?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The families of the country with their oeconomy and family religion; if we take a ſurvey of the whole land we ſhall find religion placed in the body politick, as the ſoul in the body natural. <hi>Nam eſt Tota Anima, in Toto Corpore, et Tota in Qualibet parte</hi>; that is, the whole ſoul is in the whole body, and whole in every part. That were any other part of the body organized beſides the head, it would be capable to exerciſe reaſon, &amp;c. So religion is placed and exerciſed in its principles, virtues and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments through the families of the country, ſo many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſo many little ſanctuaries.</p>
                        <p>I do acknowledge, there is no general rule, but has its execptions; but under this caution I may affirm, there is no ſuch ſpot of earth in the earthly globe (ſo belaboured with family devotion, reading God's word, catechizing and well inſtructing youth, with neat and virtuous exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and divine prayers, <hi>non ex Codice, ſed ex Corde,</hi> not out of books, but out of hearts, the ſolemnizing ſabbaths and
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:012626_0153_0F8B8E9B5DF6E218"/>
and family attendance on public means) as is <hi>New-England.</hi> And if ſo, then what need have we of this late invention? Therefore to conclude, I ſhall, for my own part, with the jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Laccoon,</hi> enter a caution againſt taking down the ſides of the city, or opening the walls of our Sion to let in this Trojan horſe; and let all Iſrael ſay, amen! For, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, tho' we want to have our hearts renewed daily, but as for means, though we have no glut, we have plenty enough, and want no new inſtitutions.</p>
                        <p>We come now to meaſure, and find out the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the council.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Certain, viz. Once in the year at the leaſt, all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations in the country, and according to the moſt plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interpretation of the propoſals, one or more lay-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates ſhall join and meet yearly and every year in the great aſſemblies.</p>
                        <p>Anſwer. As <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays of time, <hi>Vivo in Tempore, Loquor de Tempere, ſed Neſcio quid ſit Tempus,</hi> I live in time, I ſpeak of time, but yet I know not what time is. So I do imagine, the dictators did not well weigh time by exact ballance, in all its contents, ſenſe and meaning, when they carved out ſuch a large proportion to this illegal claimer. Time is juſtly eſteemed precious, in relation to heaven and grace, and alſo very valuable with reſpect to the intereſt of nature and this life. Therefore, care ſhould be had, that it been't ſquandered away waſtfully. Our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural lives, healths and honor, families and eſtates are all very ſignificant and coſtly things, and their dependence is much on the well huſbanding of time, inſomuch that in hard &amp; penurious climates, the inhabitants had need be very ſaving of time for the ſupport of all theſe great intereſts, and eſpecially ſeeing there is ſo much time already ſet off for religion. As,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The ſeventh part of time is aſſigned by the wiſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of time, and that well improved, will do much for the ſupport of religion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. There are great proportions (out of the time left to our diſpoſe) frankly bequeathed for the good of religion, as in courts, churches, college, ſchool, families, cloſets, and in many other ſacred intervals, breathing ſpells from the hurry of buſineſs, render to men more ſedate and heavenly (called time out of ſeaſon) and all for the ſervice of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then to add and make this offering alſo, without a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mandate, is but a work of ſuperarrogation or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:012626_0154_0F8B8E9D90B8B360"/>
and ſo will prove not only a needleſs, but an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant victim.</p>
                        <p>And moreover, to add a juſt aggravation or two, to ſet forth the evil in the impoſition, I ſhall, with them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the plea.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aggravation</hi> I. Is taken from the great and ſufficient care and proviſion made by the 15th and 16th chapters of our platform, for the convening of occaſional and needful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, for the ſervice of the churches, and ſupport of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon all emergencies. Then what need we throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſo many years of time at a venture, as is here ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the propoſal, before our neceſſities or occaſions call for the expence; unleſs we would in imitation of the <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Coloſs,</hi> or <hi>Egyptian Pyramids,</hi> erect a monument of our vain glory and pride, more than of our prudence, policy or duty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Aggravation</hi> II. Is taken from the great affront real and rational, done to empire.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Real,</hi> In making thus bold, with the time and eſtates of loyal ſubjects.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Rational</hi>; For let us but conſider, that about three hundred men (gown men, and ſword-men) with twice the number of attendants, which will make up near a thouſand ſtrong (and all well hors'd and provided) to be muſtered no man living on earth can tell for what, cannot be well reſented by crowned heads, thoſe admirers of order: That the project carried on, may breed jealouſies in the heart of our prince, leaſt that <hi>Ket, Cade, Straw</hi> or <hi>Tyler</hi> have pitch't upon an oak of reformation again, with an intent to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawl the government, &amp;c. And eſpecially ſeeing the crown was never adviſed of any ſuch thing (as is propoſed) by the regular forms of empire. There is danger of loſing our time, and the credit of our loyalty together; that all things conſidered, the beſt way will be for us to keep well, whilſt we are well; and therefore let every man and ſociety be adviſed to improve their time wiſely, keep in their poſt and honeſtly ſtudy to do their own buſineſs, which God, law and regular ſettlements has intruſted them with; and we may then hope things will go well with us, and our holy religion.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Uncertain,</hi> viz. When the creators pleaſe, and can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, for the more particular time is beſt left to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of each aſſociation, as the propoſal affirms. And
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:012626_0155_0F8B8E9E759BB1A0"/>
thus we are left very uncertain, when, where or whether it will ever be; ſo that I preceive, you have no great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon it, neither muſt we; The wiſdom of civil government hath another ſort of conduct. Such things are not left to diſcretion, for that would be indiſcretion, and the way to turn the world into a bedlam, or the dwelling-place of mad men. And in the example before us, ſuppoſe the arbitrators (when the queſtion for the time is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſhould differ, and hotly diſpute the matter; and ſome ſhould plead, it was beſt to be in the winter, and ſome in the ſummer; ſome argue for the fall, and ſome for the ſpring, according as every mans temper leads him; and at laſt, referring to a majority of voices, ſhould they (for want of an odd man) lock it by an equal vote, and ſo keep it like a game atcheſs for ſeveral years on the table, and neither ſide get the maſtery; we may then in our diſtreſſes hollow whilſt our throats ach, &amp; no help comes; for they have voted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves faſt (like two bucks in their own horns) and can't ſtir for our relief.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. We muſt, according to promiſe, make ſome enquiry whether this council is to meet, or for the place of meeting?</p>
                        <p>It is held in opinion, that caſtles in the air, &amp; immaterial ſubſtances do not occupy place; philoſophy aſſigns them no more than a <hi>Ubi,</hi> where many may exiſt in <hi>Puncto Indiviſibli,</hi> or on the point of a needle; and if this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil is (as I apprehend it) belonging to that conjugation or cataloglue of beings, it will then have this privilege be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, viz. There will be no houſe to build, nor houſe rent to pay,</p>
                        <p n="7">7. We come now (in the laſt place) to conſider its maintainance, by three queries.</p>
                        <p n="1">1<hi>ſt. Query,</hi> Whether the churches in their expiring, muſt (as all criminals do) pay for their own execution, and their eſtates be confiſcate, and reſerved as a fund, yielding a certain ſtipend per annum, to ſupport their executioners?</p>
                        <p n="2">2<hi>d. Query,</hi> Whether the contingent fees of the ſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the free and voluntary contribution of clients, may be thought a medium ſufficient? Or,</p>

                        <p>It is certain, in the hiſtory of God's works, he firſt makes his houſe, &amp;c. then furniſhes his table with great varieties; and then invites his gueſts, and makes them welcome; and ſo it is with all regular created efficients both rational and natural; but in this ſcheme there is nothing done for the ſupport of the new born infant, but like a run-away dam, you leave it to the mercy of the heavens. But poſſibly the relief is ſtored up in your creating power; ſo that if the charitable churches will but find a cradle for the firſt night, and naturalize it, you will by your creating fiat, ſoon find a fortune, if all the tythes in the province will do it.</p>
                        <p>Thus, according to engagement, we have paſſed through the ſeveral heads, relating to the ſtanding council, and I think by the analyſis, it is ſufficiently reſolved into its firſt nothing; and therefore in what remains, I ſhall be more brief in my anſwer.</p>

The ſpecificating act, that impowers any member for an eccleſiaſtical council, is the churches electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or delegation, according to our government; ſo that the members ſent, are inveſted with the power, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thoſe who ſend them: The officers have no more of this power devolved upon them, than any member, and therefore can challenge no more right (as elders) in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor or in a negative vote, than any others, as is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in all repreſentative bodies; therefore all acts muſt be determined by the majority of the whole, as in the houſe of commons, though made up of men of many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent characters, when in their own countries, both as to their truſt, learning and wiſdom, and other diſtinguiſhing qualifications; yet the meaneſt man there has as great a force and power in his vote or ſuffrage, as the beſt man in the houſe, for that they all equally repreſent the nation, one man as much as another: So in this caſe; for that the churches and officers were never yet ſince New-England ſtood, held or accounted two diſtinct eſtates in an eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical council. Therefore,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Your challenge plainly defines your intention, that is to null the power of the churches, and ſet up yourſelves, as the ſubject or fountain of a ſuperintending power. And then, if the churches may have ſo much favor as to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves by their lay-delegates, in a council you ſhall ſee meet to call, you muſt needs allow them to be a diſtinct houſe and eſtate. And if ſo, then you muſt grant
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:012626_0159_0F8B8EA258A9ACC8"/>
them the privilege of a major vote, as well as yourſelves, and ſo nothing can be acted but by their compliance alſo. But I muſt acknowledge, I have no plenipotentiary power to ſettle articles of agreement, for the infringing any of the rights of the churches, and therefore muſt draw up my memorials or complaints of incroachments upon ancient lines and boundaries, and ſo leave them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The church of England has been wont to look upon us as men out of our wits, therefore they term us phantics, or mad-men, but much more now. What! for men to break from the government they themſelves have eſtabliſhed by conſent and practice, and arbitrarily to rally together, and draw up a direful ſentence (if not in terms, yet in intent) for the diſſolution of a country full of the beſt churches of Chriſt in the world, and then (as it were) upon the bold ſound of a trumpet, to excite others to ratify the dead warrant, in order to execution! What can this import or ſignify in the thoughts of conſiderate men, but a vertiginous brain? We might have learned better, and more caution, from that mother church of the
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:012626_0160_0F8B8EA315622EA0"/>
nation, if not from common reaſon; for though our ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign confides in the loyalty of the Engliſh clergy, yet to maintain the grandeur of government, and keep in good repair that common ſence which keeps every man in his ſtation, therefore, according to the law and cuſtom of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, the convocation, both the higher and lower houſe of that learned and auguſt aſſembly, neither debates nor tranſacts any matter whatſoever, but what our ſovereign by commiſſion expreſly alloweth of, according to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; ſo that certainly to acquit yourſelves for wiſe men you ſhould have done no leſs (in a matter of ſuch weight and moment) than have petitioned the public authority for commiſſion, before you had ventured thus far.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But poſſibly ſome may ſay, We have petitioned authority to eſtabliſh our councils, ſince we have drawn them up in form.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is to be prepoſterous, and agrees with that illegal way of hanging men and then judging them; but however it ſeems they turned a deaf ear to your demands; and well they might, for they are two wiſe men to alter the laws of the province, long cuſtoms and orderly ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the churches to gratify an implicit faith in the ſtark naked <hi>Ipſe Dixits</hi> of any men; that unleſs you can produce a mandamus from the crown, or a precept from a higher court, which by its divine authority ſhall awe and direct them, you may alway expect ſuch entertainment in your precarious addreſſes; for moſt certainly you beg at the wrong door. For you beg without a brief.</p>

By the queſtion propoſed, the comfort, ſupport, and well being of theſe churches was peculiarly pretended, then why might not they be nextly adviſed with, for their approbation or eſteem? for if you intend it for a new ſuit, or change of apparel, or a ſet of armour for this army in banners, it muſt be the only way to try it on, it being now ſo near finiſhing; and if it be done work-man-like, you will have the credit and they the comfort of it; but if it prove too ſtrait-laced, or ſhould they feel themſelves as David in

They are ſtrict in their government; curious, yet charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their admiſſions; in the election of all officers, they are nice, cautious, judicious, and in the main hitherto very ſucceſsful.

Then why ſhould you diſturb them?</p>
                  <p>You acknowledge them to be holy churches, and you may well!

                  <head>The following is an Extract from a Book intituled, <hi>New-England's LAMENTATIONS,</hi> wrote by the Reverend Mr. JOHN WHITE, late Paſtor of the firſt Church in <hi>Glouceſter</hi>; to which is ſubjoined a Letter by another Hand, ſhewing Reaſons for adhering to our PLATFORM, as a Rule of Church-Government, and Objections againſt Ruling Elders anſwered: Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and Letter are here inſerted at the Requeſt of a Number of the Subſcribers to Mr. WISE's two Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</head>
                  <p>"THE preſent weak and ſhattered ſtate of our CHURCHES, on the account of their Order, Government, and Diſcipline, (ſays Mr. <hi>White</hi>) is matter of LAMENTATION. This is evident to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very perſon of obſervation. Hence particular churches run into confuſion. Many are aggrieved, and abide year after year in their ſorrowful circumſtances. And a farther evidence thereof, is the ineffectualneſs of councils to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieve the aggrieved, and to make peace. As alſo anti-councils, whereby contrary reſults are given on the ſame caſe, to the great reproach of councils, and blemiſh of our church government, and diſcouragement of the aggrieved, who are ready to lie under their troubles as remedileſs. Hence it is that ſome councils have perſwaded the church and aggrieved, to promiſe to acquieſce in the determination of the council, before they heard the caſe, by which their conſciences have been enſnared, and the council turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſolemn Arbitration. This therefore is matter of juſt Lamentation.</p>
                  <p>I come to enquire,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Into the MEANS, which have brought us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe lamentable circumſtances. In a word, 'tis our being prejudiced againſt, and not attending to the rules and principles of congregational churches, as laid down in our platform. To go from the rule is arbitrary; and to go againſt profeſſed principles, making our wills the rule, is tyranny. And when a people fairly poſſeſſed of liberties
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:012626_0165_0F8B8EA854299730"/>
and privileges, are thus dealt with, this leads directly to contention and confuſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Theſe churches have not attended the rule, as to the compleat organization of churches. 'Tis the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of a church to chuſe its own officers; as, platform, chap. 10. ſect. 5. viz. The power granted by Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body of the church and brotherhood, is a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and privilege which the church exerciſeth, in chuſing their own officers, whether elders or deacons, &amp;c. So ch. 6. ſect. 4. Of elders ſome attend chiefly to the miniſtry of the word, as paſtors and teachers; ſome attend eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto rule, who are therefore called ruling-elders. Now the want of theſe officers expoſes churches to arbitrarineſs, contentions and confuſions. As alſo it renders the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the church, in ſome caſes impracticable. An inſtance of all theſe great inconveniencies, we have lately had in a neighbour church; where all poſſible endeavors have been uſed by the aggrieved (a very great and valuable part of the church) to have a church-meeting, and when there was great occaſion for it; and yet it could not be obtained: They had not a church-meeting for about 14 years: Whereas if they had been furniſhed with a full ſupply of officers, they might have eaſily obtained it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> that means put an end to a long and very threatning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tention. Beſides, had the paſtor called the church to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at their requeſt, there being but one elder, viz. a teaching one, and he the (ſuppoſed) offending party, it was not poſſible according to congregational principles, to have proceeded to judge and cenſure in that caſe. For miniſters are under no eccleſiaſtic government, but in the church, where they are members as well as miniſters. Now 'tis a rule in the congregational government, as in plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, chap. 10. ſect. 11. No church-act can be conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or perfected, without the conſent of both; that is, the elderſhip and brethren. Now tis not at all proper, that an accuſed and faulty elder ſhould be a judge in his own caſe; therefore when he is the peccant party and no ruling elders to join the brethren in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>act of diſcipline and cenſure, there cannot be a valid act. And ſo it is alſo when a miniſter is the accuſer. Thus by the diſuſe of ruling el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (ſo neceſſary in our conſtitution) the government is rendered weak; yea, in ſome caſes impracticable. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was that when the ſynod convened, <hi>Oct.</hi> 15, 1679,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:012626_0166_0F8B8EA9229E1B38"/>
to enquire what wanted reformation in the land, and to propoſe expedients therefor; in the 5th place they ſay,
<q>Tis requiſite that the utmoſt endeavors ſhould be uſed, in order for a full ſupply of officers in the churches, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſt's inſtitution; the defect of theſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches on this account is very lamentable, there being in moſt of the churches only one teaching officer for the burthen of the whole church to lie upon. The Lord Chriſt would not have inſtituted paſtors, teachers, ruling elders, (nor the apoſtles ordained elders in every church) Acts 4.23. Tit. 1.5. if he had not ſeen there was need of them for the good of his people; therefore for men to think they can do well enough without them, is to break the ſecond commandment, and to reflect upon the wiſdom of Chriſt, as if he did appoint unneceſſary officers in his church. Experience hath evinced, that perſonal inſtruction and diſcipline have been happy means to reform degenerate congregations; yea, and owned by the Lord for the converſion of many ſouls. But where there are great congregations, it is impoſſible for one man beſides his public labours, fully to attend thoſe other things of great importance, and neceſſary to be done, in order to an effectual reformation of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and congregations.</q>
Thus the ſynod.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, theſe churches have reduced their church-ſtate to great darkneſs, by not attending the rule of our conſtitution in councils. It has been the practice of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils convened according to the ſecond way of communion in our platform, who are only to hold forth light, and give advice, to uſurp the power of judgment in matters of fact, as alſo the power of admonition, in caſe of offence. Which to do is proper to the third way of communion; and ſuppoſes that a church wants correction for an offence, and not merely light and counſel. And by this means the third way of communion has been ſhut out, and not practiced. This thing I am bold to ſay, has been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of all our anti-councils, as well as the contentions and confuſions churches have been left in, after all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors uſed by neighbor churches, by way of councils.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I come to the other thing remaining, and that is, the METHODS of our relief.</p>
                  <p>And here I would ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let our churches be adviſed to get compleatly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:012626_0167_0F8B8EA9DB728CE0"/>
with church-officers according to the platform. By this time I hope ye ſee the neceſſity of it. Ariſe, for this matter belongs to you; and tis juſt matter of offence if you neglect it any longer.</p>
                  <p>Remember, it is neceſſary in a congregational church: And the miniſters and members of theſe churches would do well to get reconciled to every part, and branch of the conſtitution. Prejudices againſt, averſions and diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the ſame, have greatly threatened the utter diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe churches. Our government is firm and ſtrong; but if ſuch as ſhould keep it in good repair, do weaken it, it is in danger of falling to pieces. A brick houſe (be it never ſo firm) if every tenant takes out a brick, in time it will be weak, and ſhatter to pieces. But ſome objections offer, which it may be needful to remove.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Obj. Our reverend paſtors are againſt it, and think that the office is not of divine right.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. 1. Miniſters ſhould reconcile themſelves to the congregational government before they accept of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral office in ſuch a church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are eſpecially three ſcriptures, which may ſatisfy the ſcrupulous, as to the divine right of ruling el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; as, Rom. 12.8. 1 Tim. 5.17. 1 Cor. 12.28. God has ſet in his church, governments. Theſe are church governors and diſtinct from teachers; who elſe can they be but ruling elders? Let ſuch as have any conſciencious ſcruples in this affair, weigh in the ballance of the ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the arguments brought for the divine right of ruling elders, in a book entitled, <hi>Jus Divinum Regiminis Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtici</hi>; as alſo a ſheet not long ſince publiſhed, entitled, <hi>The Divine Right of Ruling Elders</hi>; as alſo, a rational and nervous letter lately publiſhed on this argument. Enough is ſaid in theſe to ſatisfy an unprejudiced mind as to their divine right.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis the right and privilege of the brethren to chuſe their officers; and therefore if they be clear in the matter, they ſhould not be diſcouraged or obſtructed in the uſe of their juſt liberties.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the paſtors will be ſo arbitrary, as utterly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to call the church together to chuſe theſe officers; I ſuppoſe, the church may look upon themſelves in that caſe, and ſo far, to be without a ruler; and may conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e for this purpoſe, as when they have no miniſter to chuſe
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:012626_0168_0F8B8EAA8704D448"/>
one. It muſt be a great abuſe of a miniſter's power, to obſtruct the church in the exerciſe of that power or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, Chriſt has given them, for the preſervation of their peace and purity. Engliſhmen can't patiently ſubmit to arbitrary meaſures. Two kings, within our memory, have ſmarted for attempting it. One loſt his head, the other his empire. And will Engliſh Chriſtians tamely ſubmit thereto? Can they be eaſy, when thoſe, who by divine appointment are to miniſter to them for their ſpiritual edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Lord it over them who are God's heritage? 'Tis unreaſonable for any to deſire or expect it, and baſe for chriſtians to ſubmit to it.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 2. We would proceed to chuſe ruling elders, if there were any men in the church fit for it.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. 'Tis God's work to fit men for offices in church or ſtate. 'Tis your duty to chuſe ſuch as are beſt qualified, and depend upon God farther and more fully to fit them. I remember, as introductory to our election of ruling el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, near thirty years ago, I preached from thoſe words, Num. 11.25. And the Lord came down in a cloud, and ſpake unto him, (that is to Moſes) and took of the ſpirit that was upon him, and gave it to the ſeventy elders.— There is the reſidue of the ſpirit to furniſh for every office of truſt, to which one and another is choſen. And in that the getting ruling elders was oppoſed by many in town and church, I preached another ſermon from thoſe words in 2 Tim. 2.25. In meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves. Reformations are commonly attended with great oppoſitions. Lay aſide then I pray, your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting, and attend your duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let diſcipline be prudently, ſtrictly, and impartially exerciſed in particular churches. Negligence and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality herein is very hurtful to the peace, purity, and growth of churches.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let councils move in their proper ſphere: Let them act agreable to their nature, and the rules laid down in the platform. Let ſuch as are called to give advice, and to hold forth light, do that; and proceed no further.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Come into the practice of the third way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as laid down in the platform. When a church is rent with diviſion among themſelves, and lie under any open ſcandal, and yet refuſe to conſult with other churches
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:012626_0169_0F8B8EAB5E159578"/>
for healing and removing the ſame, this is matter of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and the aggrieved making a complaint hereof to a particular church, this church is in a chriſtian manner to make enquiry, and demand an account of the other church, in order to their conviction and admonition, if faulty; or in order to their vindication, if innocent: as in platform, chap. 15. There has been in times paſt, great oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the practice of this rule. But the late venerable council held at Salem, ſaw cauſe to countenance the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that way of the communion of churches, and adviſed the aggrieved there, in caſe they receive not ſpeedy ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from the reverend paſtor, purſuant to the reſult and advice of ſaid council, to apply to a particular church in the neighbourhood for help, as directed in the third way of communion. Which thing I humbly apprehend will prove of greater ſervice toward the eſtabliſhing theſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, than any thing done for ſcores of years. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis that rule, and the wiſe practiſing it, that wipes off the raproach of independency from congregational churches. They are unaccountable, unleſs in this way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis this rule that preſerves churches pure in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion one with another. For if a church gives offence, &amp; continues obſtinate in any ſinful way, and other churches held communion with ſuch diſorderly church, &amp; dont uſe all poſſible means to reclaim her, they are partakers of her ſin. But there is no other regular way to enquire into her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, to convince her, and admoniſh her, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate her from their communion, but this. Altho' one church has not authority over another, yet churches have power to preſerve the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> purity, and to put a church obſtinately offending out of their communion; or elſe they muſt hold fellowſhip with her in a ſinful way.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This rule is neceſſary to the peace of particular churches, as it will effectually relieve perſons aggrieved. There can't much peace be expected where a great part of a church, are gauled by arbitrary meaſures. But in this way they muſt give ſatisfaction, or ſuſtain the ſentence of non-communion. And this opens a door for all aggrieved ones, to reſettle in an orderly way, in ſtated fellowſhip in ſome neighbour church, as tho' they had been diſmiſſed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This rule doth effectually hinder anti-councils, or having councils againſt councils; of which there have been too many inſtances, to the great reproach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:012626_0170_0F8B8EAC2E30D828"/>
of theſe churches. For if aggrieved perſons are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to call councils, the church has power and liberty to call them; and by this means, anti-councils come upon the ſtage. But if the aggrieved make complaint to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church, there is no poſſibility of anti-councils. Tis therefore mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h to be wondered at, that ſuch mighty op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition has been made againſt introducing this rule into practice in theſe churches. And tis matter of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the way is prepared by the foreſaid council at Salem, for the practice thereof.</p>
                  <p>Obj. It may be objected, this rule was not put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the early days of theſe churches.</p>
                  <p>Anſ. 1. Our fathers were but men, and had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Hence, though they in the ſynod declared ſo fully for the full ſupply of officers in the church; and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the ſynod was approved by the general court, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending the ſame to the ſerious conſideration of all the churches; yet how ſhamefully has this expedient for reformation been diſregarded by moſt of our churches!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſuppoſe the true reaſon why the third way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was not practiſed in our early days, was becauſe then there was little or no occaſion for it; churches were more tender and willing to receive light, when offered by councils called in the ſecond way of communion: And when it is thus, there is no room for the practice of this rule.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add the following moving conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our church-government is too good to be ſlighted and thrown away. I am perſuaded 'tis nearer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and better warranted and ſupported by it, than any church government in the world.</p>
                  <p>As to the church of England, there is no ſcripture foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for their hierarchy, as, arch-biſhops, lord-biſhops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> arch-deacons, officials, chancellors, &amp;c. Of late, by one and another maſterly hand, the following truth has been ſet in ſo clear a light, that none but the wilfully ignorant can reſiſt it, viz. That the ſcripture biſhop, is no other than the paſtor of a particular church. And it is an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and uſurpation, that they are dignified as they are in the church of England. Beſides, to take out of the hands of the preſbyters or paſtors all rule in the church, is unſcriptural; for what is more plain, than that they who watch for ſouls, are to rule over them alſo? as Heb. 13.17. Their taking away from churches the liberty of
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:012626_0171_0F8B8EACD8A19E48"/>
chuſing their own officers, is an intollerable invaſion of the right of churches, as well as their introducing many unſcriptural ceremonies into divine worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Again, the preſbyterian government, I grant, has been accompanied with eminent holineſs; as witneſs the church of Scotland, Geneva, and many other reformed churches. And I acknowledge there is but little difference between them and us; eſpecially, if we have ruling elders, and practiſe the third way of communion. Yet wherein we differ, I am humbly of opinion we have the ſcripture on our ſide. Let any if they can, give a genuine interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the 1 Cor. 5 chap. and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lude the brethren from having any hand in church diſcipline and cenſures. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what is written, Mat. 18. Tell it to the church; that is ſay they, to the miniſters. This is to put the ſcripture upon the rack, to make it ſpeak what we would have it. Let us then be thankful for our conſtitution; ſtrictly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to and practiſe it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our church-government, if ſtrictly adhered to, will effectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lly anſwer all the intentions of government. There is no member in a church, no church in the whole conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of churches, tho' never ſo ſtubborn and obſtinate, but muſt ſubmit, or ſuſtain the dreadful ſentence of non-communion: which methinks no good miniſter and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian can make light of.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude the whole with a few words further by way of advice or counſel.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us be very thankful to God, who has hitherto ſecured for us our civil and ſacred privileges; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our great barrenneſs and unprofitableneſs, yea, and our many and great provocations. God is ſlow unto anger, and abundant in goodneſs and kindneſs. We have for an 100 years enjoyed the diſpenſation of the glorious goſpel, in its power and purity, and free from perſecution. What could God have done for this his vineyard, which he has not done, in order to our fruitfulneſs?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us be warned againſt withdrawing from the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of theſe churches, until we find more pure chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and worſhip; and of a more ſcriptural faith and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Such as break with, and break off from theſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, becauſe their ſtubborn wills will not ſubmit to the juſt and regular cenſures of the church to which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; or becauſe they cant have their will, as to the place
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:012626_0172_0F8B8EADB1DC4840"/>
of their worſhip; theſe deſerve the character of heady and high-minded. And if their unreaſonable deſires are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the civil government, then they will turn churchmen. Surely ſuch church-men are guilty of will-worſhip with a witneſs. Theſe converts are worthy to be called children of Belial, who riſe up againſt lawful autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and take ſanctuary in the church. The church of England doth too much honor our churches, when they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thoſe worthy of their fellowſhip, who are worthy to be rejected by us. I would wiſper in the ears of theſe thoughtleſs and unnatural converts, not to ſay apoſtates; will you raſhly, and to have your wills in leſſer matters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to a ſtate of bondage, when you enjoy matchleſs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and privileges? Will you take upon you a yoke which your gracious predeceſſors could not bear? Will you bring a burd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en upon poſterity, which is intollerable, to humour and eaſe yourſelves? Know, when the yoke is once on your necks, you muſt pay the tythe, the tenth part of which you are apt now to think is too much for you to give, or your miniſter to receive. And do you think the vaſt arrearages will not be recovered, one way or other? I mean the vaſt ſums expended for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the goſpel; that is, for the bringing over our churches to the mother church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Be kind to your miniſters; and dont give them any juſt provocation to deſert you, or to endeavor to reconcile themſelves to the diſcipline and ceremonies of the church. The diſcount of the bills of credit has inſenſibly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly hurt them in times paſt; and it is well if it be not ſo to this day with ſome. I am fully perſuaded that miniſters ſalaries ought in juſtice to be raiſed nearly in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the depreciation of the bills of credit; for the price of the neceſſaries of life riſe in proportion. By no means diſcourage the hearts, or weaken the hands of your faithful miniſters, who are willing to ſpend and be ſpent, in the ſervice of your precious ſouls. Eſpecially be cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at this juncture, when ſo great temptations are laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them to deſert you, and go home and take orders.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, and finally, Study the principles of your faith and order; be heartily reconciled to, and be zealous in the defence and practice of them. And as often as any of our holy churches do want a paſtor, I would adviſe them when treating with any candidate in order to ſettlement,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:012626_0173_0F8B8EAFE3B5AD88"/>
to know his mind with reſpect to the profeſſed faith and order of theſe churches; and proceed not to election; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he has given his aſſent to the one, and his promiſe to practiſe according to the other. This indeed is implicitly done by his acceptance of the invitation of a congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal church; but the more explicit, the better. And when the elders and meſſengers of neighbour-churches are (upon invitation) convened, to aſſiſt in the ſolemn ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a paſtor to the ſacred work of the goſpel-miniſtry, in his ordination; they would doubtleſs do well to ſatisfy themſelves in theſe things, leſt they be found to lay their hands too ſuddenly upon his head.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, Let us then ſtand faſt in the liberties wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, Gal. 5.1. Our country thinks it worth while to ſpend many thouſands, in defence of their civil privileges, ſettled upon us by charter; and are not theſe ſacred privileges of equal, yea of greatter worth and value? O then let us contend ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for the faith and order of the goſpel, leſt we be found to deſpiſe our birth-right, and to deſtroy ourſelves."</p>

                  <head>REASONS For adhering to our PLATFORM, as a Rule of Church-Government, and Objections againſt Ruling ELDERS anſwered. In a Letter to a Friend. By another Hand.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Received a meſſage from you, that a friend of yours deſires to have ſome reaſons (drawn up in writing) to ſhew why we ſhould adhere to the PLATFORM as a rule of church-government, at leaſt till another &amp; better be provided. I wiſh a better head were employed in aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſons for it: But to gratify you (in the interim) I ſhall give you the general reaſons inducing me to be of the opinion that we ought ſo to do. But firſt I premiſe, that whereas it is objected, That the ſcriptures are the only rule both of worſhip and diſcipline, and that it is both ſinful and dangerous to ſet up human compoſures as our rule; I perfectly agree with the objectors and acknowledge that no human compoſure ought to be received, which diſagrees with the holy ſcriptures. But if the platform muſt be rejected merely becauſe it is of human compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; then by the ſame parity of reaſon, not only the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation principles, but alſo all ſermons, confeſſions of faith, creeds, catechiſms, and the like, are to be rejected, theſe being alſo human compoſures. And it is very obſervable that the ſame perſons who are for rejecting the platform, would at the ſame time have us ſubject to ſuch a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they themſelves ſhall from time to time fancy to be agreable to the ſcriptures; not allowing us to judge for ourſelves, whether it be agreable to the ſcripture or not; nor willing to be governed or reſtricted themſelves by any rule, except the ſcriptures in the ſenſe they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves underſtand them, or (which is one and the ſame thing) by any other than what agrees with their own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And with this allowance I ſuppoſe the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could comply with the ſcripture as the rule of his government.</p>
                  <p>But that there ought to be a platform extracted from the Holy ſcriptures, as a particular rule of church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that it is our wiſdom and intereſt to adhere to ours, at leaſt till another and better be provided, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to me, from the following conſiderations, viz.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="176" facs="unknown:012626_0175_0F8B8EB154662718"/>1. The nature, uſe and ends of all government neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily imply ORDER: Order cannot be preſerved without known and certain rules: The duties of rulers and ruled muſt be ſtated, circumſcribed, and limited by a rule; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe rulers may be tyrants at pleaſure, and ſubjects rebel whenever they have opportunity, and neither of them be accountable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Tho' the ſcriptures are in themſelves a perfect rule, and the only ſtandard by which all other rules are to be tried; yet it is evident that through the darkneſs or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of men's minds, this rule is very diverſly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and practiſed upon, both with reſpect to doctrine and diſcipline. Hence the authors of the moſt corrupt doctrines pretend to the ſcriptures to ſupport their tenets. So with reſpect to church-government, the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaliſt, the preſbyterian, the epiſcopalian, yea, and even the papiſt, pretend to rule and govern according to the ſcripture. So that they don't ſo much differ upon the queſtion, whether the ſcripture ſhall be the rule, as upon the queſtion, how the ſcripture is to be underſtood; or what is agreable and what contrary to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence it follows, that without ſome platform or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, there can be no orderly government upheld. This appears to be agreable to the ſenſe both of papiſts &amp; proteſtants, epiſcopalians, preſbyterians and congregationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts; who all have their platforms or conſtitutions of church-government.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The church-government in this country is founded upon a particular compact or agreement: wherein the officers and members of each particular church combine to ſet forward the worſhip of God, and maintain the diſcipline of his kingdom, in a way which they judge to be agreable to the Holy Scriptures; and to act in way of conſociation with other churches of the ſame principles, for their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good and edification. 'Upon this foundation were the churches of New-England firſt ſettled; and for their more regular proceeding therein the platform (expreſſing their ſenſe of the ſcripture relating to church order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) was compoſed and conſented to by the churches in our primitive times: And this form of government is ſo far eſtabliſhed, that our general conſent to continue and abide in this way, would ſecure to us the privileges of it. And this indeed is our only barrier againſt epiſcopacy; unleſs ſome other form of government (not diſallowed by
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:012626_0176_0F8B8EB209552CE8"/>
the crown) be received and embraced by the churches.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But if we ſlight the method of government in our platform, and don't by agreement fix on another, it will follow, that either the government of the church muſt ceaſe, or a government impoſed and enforced by human laws muſt ſucceed. I preſume moſt certainly, the churches (ſo unhinged) muſt immediately fall into an abſolute inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency at firſt: and the members of each individual church, muſt either be allowed to be under no government but what will ſuit with their own private judgment on the ſcriptures (which they may be tempted to vary or alter as occaſion may offer;) or elſe a power of judging for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as to the meaning of the ſcripture muſt be denied to the brethren, and put over to the miniſter for him to judge and determine as he thinks fit, and to ſtate and fix the boundaries both of his own authority and the people's obedience, as he ſhall from time to time underſtand the ſcripture. And who can tell how much or how often his judgment may alſo vary, upon occaſions or temptations which may offer? But ſuch a confuſed ſtate of things can't laſt long; a more certain and regular form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will quickly be found neceſſary; and perhaps a preſbyterian government may be ſought after, but not found to be attainable. May it not therefore be proper (before we part with our platform) not only to enquire whether the preſbyterian conſtitution be more agreable to the ſcripture; but alſo whether that government can be ſet up and ſupported here, unleſs ſome other laws than we have hitherto had, be enacted, and do obtain the royal appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. That the royal approbation may be obtained in favor of the way of the church of England, can't be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but that it will be obtained in favor of a preſbyterian church government here, ſeems hardly probable: which if duly conſidered, it may well be wondered how gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (who would not be willing that themſelves or poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be placed under epiſcopacy) can think of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from our own platform; at leaſt till another and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be inſtituted in the room thereof.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Our platform was doubtleſs the reſult of great tho't and deliberation, and of earneſt prayer and ſupplication; compoſed and conſented to by men of as great learning, piety and prudence as any our age affords; and ſuch as had
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:012626_0177_0F8B8EB2CD059288"/>
more knowledge and larger experience of the ſtate of the church at home and abroad, than perhaps any among us of the preſent age have; and as careful of avoiding human inventions as the beſt of us. Now the platform agreed with their underſtanding of the ſcripture, not only then, but many years after, when it was reviſed by a ſucceeding ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. And I am perſwaded, if it were now impartially conſidered and compared with the ſcripture, it would be found very conſonant therewith. And even that part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of which aſſerts the office of the ruling elder (which is as I ſuppoſe the moſt diſtaſtful, to ſuch as would explode the platform) agrees with the ſcripture not only in the judgment of the divines and churches in New-England in our pureſt times; but alſo in the judgment of the moſt famous reforming divines and churches that have been in other parts of the world. Both the neceſſity and divine authority of that office having been aſſerted by divines vaſtly more in number than thoſe (among preſbyterians and congregationaliſts) who do or have decried it; and not inferior to them in learning, piety or ſolid judgment. I am told by a gentleman of learning and ingenuity, That the proteſtant churches of Geneva, France, Scotland, Holland, and in general almoſt all the churches of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation (except epiſcopalians) have upheld this office; and that it has never been denied by any conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of proteſtant churches (exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pt as aforeſaid) till that about the ſpace of fifty years ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a number of miniſters roſe up in New-England, who did oppoſe it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole therefore, tho' no man's conſcience ought to be bound by this or any other platform, in any matter which he verily believes to be contrary to the ſcripture; yet it ſeems impoſſible to conceive, how a particular church can uphold an orderly diſcipline, or a number of churches form a conſociation, unleſs they do unite in the foundation-principles of church-government; or that the civil authority preſcribe the rules or canons of church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and enforce obedience, and ſubjection thereto, as in the caſe of national churches.</p>
                  <p>From the foregoing conſiderations laid together, I think it will appear to be the wiſdom and intereſt of all thoſe who prefer our own conſtitution before a national church government, and its forcing canons, ſteadily to adhere to our platform; at leaſt till another and better be found,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:012626_0178_0F8B8EB398F51960"/>
and (after mature conſideration) conſented to and agreed upon by the churches.</p>
                  <p>And now becauſe the office of a ruling elder is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial branch of congregational church-government, which if left out, quite alters the conſtitution, and changes the government of the church into a monarchical form; and becauſe I apprehend that the prejudices that are taken againſt the platform, are principally upon this head; I would now acquaint your friend (tho' this is further than his requeſt expreſſes) upon what grounds I ſatisfy my ſelf reſpecting the objections I meet with againſt that office.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whereas it is objected, That the generality of our miniſters do not hold this office to be of divine inſtitution: to this objection I oppoſe the judgment of formor divines (more in number, and not leſs capable of judging as to the meaning of the ſcriptures;) as alſo the judgment of ſeveral divines now living among us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas'tis objected, that according to Eph.IV.8.11.12. the ordinary officers left by Chriſt in the church, are only paſtors and teachers; and according to Phil. 1.1. biſhops (or paſtors) and deacons are the only officers mentioned: I ſatisfy my ſelf as to this objection, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the word biſhop, paſtor and ſhepherd, ſignify one and the ſame thing whenever applied to eccleſiaſtical officers; and imply a power af teaching, overſeeing, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and governing. The word paſtor is applicable to all rulers whether civil or eccleſiaſtical, and is ſo uſed in ſcripture; and tho' the word biſhop ſeems in a more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated ſenſe to belong to the eccleſiaſtical ruler; yet under that word ſo appropriated are comprehended all eccleſiaſtical rulers, guides, overſeers, ſhepherds; even as the word magiſtrate comprehends all civil rulers of every rank and ſtation. So that neither of theſe expreſſions do exclude any ſort of elder, overſeer or ruler in the church; but on the contrary do include and comprehend them all. And tho' a power of teaching, overſeeing and ruling, may all be attributed to one man; yet it does not follow that the power of overſeeing and ruling muſt lie ſolely and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in him. For there may be, and is, a government, where there is not a lordly power, or (which is the ſame thing) power in a ſingle officer, which has no other branch of government to check and controul it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas 'tis objected, That we have not men capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp;c. If it be ſo indeed, that there are no men in our
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:012626_0179_0F8B8EB49E5895D0"/>
churches, that have ſkill enough or integrity enough to guide in the external adminiſtrations of the government and diſcipline of the church; and capable too of aſſiſting, directing, exhorting and comforting their brethren, as they may have opportunity; our degeneracy is very lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table indeed. Our churches have then none ſuitable for ſervice in eccleſiaſtical councils. Every thing at home and abroad muſt be left to the prudence and fidelity of the miniſters; and wo to that church (if ſuch a thing ſhou'd bappen) that falls under the influence of a miniſter no bet-qualified than themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I find an aſſertion in a late printed pamphlet, that the keys of doctrine and diſcipline were committed to the apoſtles. And again, To be ſure to the ſame perſons is there committed the ruling and feeding of the flock. The author refers to the laſt chapter of Matthew. But would he reſtrain the power of ruling to the perſons of the apoſtles or to the perſons of goſpel miniſters as their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in the work of teaching and baptizing, and to them only; he muſt then either prove the government of the church to be monarchical, or elſe that every church is obliged to provide a number of ſuch teaching elders.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another objection is, That if we will have ruling elders, we muſt provide them a maintainance; and this, ſome ſuppoſe, would fright us out of the notion of ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. But to me it appears no ways formidable. For in the firſt place, I don't believe that double honor princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intends maintainance (as ſome would have it, from 1 Tim. 5.17.) and the next words proves no more than this, that a ſuitable reward is due, according to the labour performed. It therefore remains to be proved, that a ruling elder muſt ſpend his whole time in the ſervice of the church, before he is entitled to a maintainance from the church. But if a ſuitable and honorable reward were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned in proportion to their ſervice, I believe no body would have reaſon to complain; and abundance of good might be done, and evil prevented, by their prudent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which would take up no great quantity of time. And in extraordinary matters, I ſee no reaſon but their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors ſhould be handſomely rewarded. Submitting the whole to the cenſure of your friend, (unknown to me) I reſt</p>

                  <head>The PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE ſetting forth of the publick confeſſion of the faith of churches hath a double end, and both tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to public edification: Firſt, the maintenance of the faith intire within itſelf: Secondly, the holding, forth of unity and harmony, both amongſt, and with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther churches. Our churches here, as (by the grace of Chriſt) we believe and profeſs the ſame doctrine of the truth of the goſpel, which generally is received in all the reformed churches of Chriſt in Europe, ſo eſpecially we deſire not to vary from the doctrine of faith and truth held forth by the churches of our native country. For though it be not one native country that can breed us all of one mind; nor ought we to have the glorious faith of our Lord Jeſus with reſpect to perſons, yet as <hi>Paul,</hi> who was himſelf a Jew, profeſſed to hold forth the doctrine of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith, and of the reſurrection of the dead, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he knew his godly country-men did, who were Jews by nature, (<hi>Gal</hi> 2.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.6, 7.) ſo we who are by nature Engliſh-men, do deſire to hold forth the ſame doctrine of religion (eſpecially in fundamentals) which we ſee and know to be held by the churches of <hi>England,</hi> according to the truth of the goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The more we diſcern (that which we do, and have cauſe to do with inceſſant mourning and trembling) the unkind, and unbrotherly, and unchriſtian contention of our godly brethren and country-men in matters of church government; the more earneſtly do we deſire to ſee them join together in one common faith; and ourſelves with them. For this end, having peruſed the public confeſſion of the faith, agreed upon by the reverend aſſembly of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and finding the ſum and ſubſtance thereof (in matters of doctrine) to expreſs not their own judgment only, but ours alſo; and being likewiſe called upon by our godly magiſtrates, do draw up a public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of that faith which is conſtantly taught, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally profeſſed amongſt us; we thought good to preſent unto them, and with them to our churches; and with
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:012626_0183_0F8B8EB9AABFF458"/>
them to all the churches of Chriſt abroad, our profeſſed and hearty aſſent and atteſtation to the whole confeſſion of faith (for ſubſtance of doctrine) which the reverend aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſented to the religious and honorable parliment of <hi>England</hi>: Excepting only ſome ſections in the 25, 30. &amp; 31. chapters of their confeſſion, which concerns points of controverſy in church diſcipline; touching which we refer ourſelves to the draught of church diſcipline in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>The truth of what we here declare, may appear by the unanimous vote of the ſynod of the elders and meſſengers of our churches, aſſembled at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the laſt of the ſixth month, 1648, which jointly paſſed in theſe words; This ſynod having peruſed and conſidered (with much gladneſs of heart, and thankfulneſs to God) the confeſſion of faith publiſhed of late by the reverend aſſembly in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> do judge it to be very holy, orthodox and judicious in all matters of faith; and do therefore freely and fully conſent thereunto, for the ſubſtance thereof. Only in thoſe things which have reſpect to church-government and diſcipline, we refer ourſelves to the platform of church-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, agreed upon by this preſent aſſembly; and do therefore think it meet, that this confeſſion of faith ſhould be commended to the churches of Chriſt, and to the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed court, as worthy of their due conſideration &amp; acceptance. Howbeit, we may not conceal, that the doctrine of vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, expreſſed in chap. 10. ſect. 1. and ſummarily repeated in chap. 13. ſect. 1. paſſed not without ſome debate. Yet conſidering the term of vocation, and others by which it is deſcribed, are capable of a large, or more ſtrict ſenſe and uſe, and that it is not intended to bind apprehenſions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in point of order or method, there hath been a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condeſcendency thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Now by this our profeſſed conſent and free concurrence with them in all the doctrinals of religion, we hope it may appear to the world, that as we are a remnant of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the ſame nation with them, ſo we are profeſſors of the ſame common faith, and fellow-heirs of the ſame common ſalvation. Yea moreover, as this our profeſſion of the ſame faith with them, will exempt us (even in their judgments) from ſuſpicion of hereſy; ſo (we truſt) it may exempt us in the like ſort from ſuſpicion of ſchiſm: that though we are forced to diſſent from them in matters of
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:012626_0184_0F8B8EBA44CCBAB0"/>
church-diſcipline, yet our diſſent is not taken up out of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy of ſpirit in ourſelves (whom they ſee willingly condeſcend to learn of them) neither is it carried with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable conſoriouſneſs towards them, (both which are the proper and eſſential characters of ſchiſm) but in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of wiſdom, as we walk along with them, and follow them as they follow Chriſt; ſo where we conceive a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent apprehenſion of the mind of Chriſt (as it falleth out in ſome few points touching church-order) we ſtill reſerve due reverence to them (whom we judge to be, through Chriſt, the glorious lights of both nations) and only crave leave (as in the ſpirit we are bound) to follow the Lamb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erſoever he goeth, and (after the apoſtles example) as we believe, ſo we ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>And if the example of ſuch poor out-caſts as ourſelves might prevail, if not with all (for that were too great a bleſſing to hope for) yet with ſome or other of our breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in <hi>England,</hi> ſo far as they are come to mind and ſpeak the ſame thing with ſuch as diſſent from them, we hope in Chriſt it would not only moderate the harſh judging and condemning of one another in ſuch differences of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as may be found in the choiceſt ſaints; but alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent (by the mercy of Chriſt) the peril of the diſtraction and deſtruction of all churches in both kingdoms. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if brethren ſhall go on to bite and devour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the apoſtle feared (as we alſo with ſadneſs of heart do) it will tend to the conſuming of them, and us all: which the Lord prevent.</p>
                  <p>We are not ignorant, (that beſides theſe aſperſions of hereſy and ſchiſm) other exceptions alſo are taken at our way of church-government, (but as we conceive) upon as little grounds. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That by admitting none into the fellowſhip of our church but ſaints by calling, we rob many pariſh churches of their beſt members, to make up one of our congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is not only to gather churches out of churches, (a thing unheard of in ſcripture) but alſo to weaken the hearts and hands of the beſt miniſters in the pariſhes, by deſpoiling them of their beſt hearers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we provide no courſe for the gaining and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of ignorant, and erroneous, and ſcandalous perſons,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:012626_0185_0F8B8EBC69E7D050"/>
whom we refuſe to receive into our churches, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the wholſome remedy of church-diſcipline.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That in our way we ſow ſeeds of diviſion, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of edification in every family; whilſt admitting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to churches only voluntaries, the huſband will be of one church, the wife of another; the parents of one church, the children of another; the maſter of one church, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of another. And ſo the parents and maſters being of different churches from their children and ſervents, they cannot take a juſt account of their profiting by what they hear; yea, by this means the huſbands, parents and maſters ſhall be chargeable to the maintenance of many other churches, and church-officers, beſides their own; which will prove a charge and burthen unſupportable.</p>
                  <p>But for anſwer, as to the firſt; for gathering churches out of churches, we cannot ſay that it is a thing unheard of in ſcripture. The firſt chriſtian church was gathered out of the Jewiſh church, and out of many ſynagogues in that church, and conſiſted partly of the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and partly of the <hi>Galileans</hi>; who though they kept ſome communion in ſome part of publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the temple, yet neither did they frequent the ſacrifices, nor repair to the ſanhedrim for the determining of their church cauſes, but kept intire aad conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the apoſtles church in all the ordinances of the goſpel. And for the firſt chriſtian church of the Gentiles at <hi>Antioch,</hi> it appeareth to have been gathered and conſtituted partly of the diſperſed brethren of the church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (whereof ſome were men of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Cyrene</hi>) and partly of the believing Gentiles. <hi>Acts.</hi> 11.20, 21.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, the firſt chriſtian church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that at <hi>Antioch,</hi> were gathered not out of any chriſtian church, but of the Jewiſh temple and ſynagogues, which were ſhortly after to be aboliſhed: and their gathering to <hi>Antioch</hi> was upon occaſion of diſperſion in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,</p>
                  <p>We deſire it may be conſidered, 1. That the members of the Jewiſh church were more ſtrongly and ſtraitly tied by expreſs holy covenant, to keep fellowſhip with the Jewiſh church till it was aboliſhed, than any members of chriſtian pariſh churches are wont to be tied to keep fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with their pariſh churches. The epiſcopal canons, which bind them to attend on their pariſh church, it is
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:012626_0186_0F8B8EBC9607B1B8"/>
likely they are now aboliſhed with the epiſcopacy. The common law of the land is ſatisfied (as we conceive) if they attend upon the worſhip of God in any other church, though not within their own pariſh. But no ſuch like covenant of God, nor any other religious tie lieth upon them to attend the worſhip of God in their own pariſh church, as did lie upon the Jews to attend upon the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in their temple and ſynagogues.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though the Jewiſh temple church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was to be aboliſhed, yet that doth not make the deſertion of it by the members to be lawful, till it was aboliſhed. Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abolition is no warrant for preſent deſertion, unleſs it be lawful, in ſome caſe, whilſt the church is yet in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtanding, to deſert it; to wit, either for avoiding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent polutions, or for hope of greater edification, and ſo for better ſatisfaction to conſcience in either. Future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, or foreſight of them do not diſſolve preſent relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, elſe wives, children, ſervants, might deſert their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, parents, maſters, when they be mortally ſick.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What the members of the Jewiſh church did, in joining to the church at <hi>Antioch</hi> in time of perſecution, it may well be conceived the members of any chriſtian church may do the like for ſatisfaction of conſcience. Peace of conſcience is more deſirable than the peace of the outward man; and freedom from ſcruples of conſcience is more comfortable to a ſincere heart, than freedom from perſecution.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, theſe members of the chriſtian church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that joined to the church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> removed their habitations together with their relations; which if the brethren of the congregational way would do, it would much abate the grievance of their departure from their preſbyterial churches.</p>
                  <p>We verily could wiſh them ſo to do, as well approving the like removal of habitation, in caſe of changing church relations (provided that it may be done without too much detriment to their outward eſtates) and we for our parts have done the ſame. But to put a neceſſity of removal of habitation in ſuch a caſe, it is to foment and cheriſh a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principle of making a civil co-habitation, if not a formal cauſe, yet at leaſt a proper adjunct of church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which the truth of the goſpel doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Now to fom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. We do not think it meet or fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that the members of the church ſhould firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince their brethren of their ſinful defects, and duly wait for their reformation, before they depart from them. For if we muſt take ſuch a courſe for the healing of a private brother, in a way of brotherly love, with much meekneſs and patience; how much more ought we ſo to walk with like tenderneſs towards a whole church.</p>
                  <p>Again, 2. By the haſty departure of ſound members from a defective church, reformation is not promoted, but many times retarded, and corruption increaſed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, while ſincere members breathing after purity of reformation abide together, they may (by the bleſſing of God upon their faithful endeavors prevail much with their elders and neighbours towards a reformation, it may be ſo much as that their elders in their own church ſhall receive none to the ſeals but viſible ſaints; and in the claſſis ſhall put forth no authoritative act (but conſultative only) touching the members of other churches, not touching their own, but with the conſent (ſilent conſent at leaſt) of their own church. Which two things, if they can obtain with any humble, meek, holy, faithful endeavors, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they might (by the grace of Chriſt) find liberty of conſcience to continue their relation with their own preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial church without ſcruple.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But to add a word further, touching the gathering of churches out of churches: what if there were no expreſs example of ſuch a thing extant in the ſcriptures? That which we are wont to anſwer the antipaedo-baptiſts, may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice here: It is enough, if any evidence thereof may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from juſt conſequence of ſcripture-light. Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> his judgment concerning this caſe paſſeth (for ought we know) without exception, which he gave in his fourth look of conſcience, in anſwer to two queſtions, chap. 14. num. 16. If any (ſaith he) wronged with unjuſt vexation,

or providing for his own edification, or in teſtimony againſt ſin, depart from a church, where ſome evils are tolerated, and join himſelf to another more pure, yet without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of the church he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>leaveth, he is not therefore to be held as a ſchiſmatic, or as guilty of any other ſin.</p>
                  <p>Where the tripartite disjunction which the judicious doctor putteth, declareth the lawfulneſs of the departure of a church member from his church, when either through wearineſs of unjuſt vexation, or in way of proviſion for his own edification, or in teſtimony againſt ſin, he joineth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to another congregation more reformed; any one of theſe he judgeth a lawful cauſe of departure, tho' all of them do not concur together. Neither will ſuch a practice deſpoil the beſt miniſters of the pariſhes of their beſt hearers.</p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes the miniſters themſelves are willing to join with their better ſort of hearers in this way of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and then they and their hearers continue ſtill their church relation together; yea, and confirm it more ſtraitly and ſtrongly, by an expreſs renewed covenant, tho' the miniſters may ſtill continue their wonted preaching to the whole pariſh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the miniſters do diſlike the way of thoſe whom they otherwiſe count their beſt members, and ſo refuſe to join with them therein; yet if thoſe members can procure ſome other miniſters to join with them in their own way, and ſtill continue their dwelling together in the ſame town, they may eaſily order the times of the public aſſembly, as to attend conſtantly upon the miniſtry of their former church, and either after or before the public aſſembly of the pariſh, take an opportunity to gather together for the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſacraments and cenſures, and other church-ordinances amongſt themſelves. The firſt apoſtolic church aſſembled to hear the word with the Jewiſh church in the open courts of the temple, but afterwards gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for breaking of bread, and other acts of church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, from houſe to houſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Suppoſe preſbyterial churches ſhould communicate ſome of their beſt gifted members towards the erecting &amp; gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another church, it would not forthwith be their detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but may be their enlargement. It is the moſt noble &amp; perfect work of a living creature (both in nature and grace) to propagate and multiply his kind; and it is the honor
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:012626_0189_0F8B8EC046EB4D20"/>
of the faithful ſpouſe of Chriſt to ſet forward the work of Chriſt as well abroad as at home. The church in Cant. 8.8. to help forward her little ſiſter church was willing to part with her choice materials, even beams of cedar, and ſuch precious living ſtones as were fit to build a ſilver palace. In the ſame book the church is ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a garden, ſometimes to an orchard, Cant. 4.12, 13. No man planteth a garden or orchard, but ſeeketh to get the choiceſt herbs and plants of his neighbours, and they freely impart them; nor do they account it a ſpoil to their garden and orchard, but rather a glory. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, we go not ſo far, we neither ſeek nor aſk the choice members of the pariſhes, but accept them being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, They are not offered by the miniſters, nor by the pariſh churches (who have moſt right in them) but only by themſelves,</p>
                  <p>It may juſtly be demanded, what right or what power have either the miniſters or pariſh church over them? Not by ſolemn church government, for that, tho' it be the firmeſt engagement is not owned, but rejected. If it be their joining with the pariſh in calling and election of a miniſter to ſuch a congregation at his firſt coming, there is indeed juſt weight in ſuch an engagement; nor do we judge it ſafe for ſuch to remove from ſuch a miniſter, unleſs it be upon ſuch grounds as may juſtly give him due ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. But if the union of ſuch members to a pariſh-church, and to the miniſtry thereof, be only by co-habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation within the precincts of the pariſh, that union, as it was founded upon human law, ſo by human law it may eaſily be releaſed. Or otherwiſe, if a man remove his habitation, he removeth alſo the bond of his relation, and the ground of offence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It need not be fear'd that all the beſt hearers of the beſt miniſters, no, nor the moſt of them will depart from them upon point of church government. Thoſe who have found the preſence and power of the ſpirit of Chriſt breathing in their miniſters, either to their converſion or edification, will be ſlow to change ſuch a miniſtry of faith and holineſs, for the liberty of church-order. Upon which ground, and ſundry other ſuch like, there be, doubtleſs, ſundry godly and judicious hearers in many pariſhes in England, that do and will prefer their relation to their miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:012626_0190_0F8B8EC0AC1C9270"/>
(though in a preſbyterial way) above the congregation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al confederation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But if all, or the moſt part of the beſt hearers of the beſt miniſters of pariſhes ſhould depart from them, as preferring in their judgment, the congregational way, yet in caſe the congregational way ſhould prove to be of Chriſt, it will never grieve the holy hearts of godly miniſters, that their hearers ſhould follow Chriſt; yea many of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (upon due deliberation) will be ready to go along with them. It never grieved nor troubled <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> that his diſciples departed from him to follow after Chriſt, John 3. But if the congregational way ſhould prove to be, not the inſtitution of Chriſt (as we take it) but the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, then doubtleſs the preſbyterial form (if it be of God) will ſwallow up the other, as Moſes's rod devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rods of the Egyptians. Nor will this put a neceſſity upon both the oppoſite parties to ſhift for themſelves, and ſeek to ſupplant one another, but only it will call upon them <hi>(Aletheuein en agape)</hi> to ſeek and follow the truth in love, to attend in faithfulneſs each unto his own flock, and to adminiſter to them all the holy things of God, and their portion of food in due ſeaſon; and as for others, quietly to forbear them, and yet to inſtruct them with meekneſs, that are contrary minded, leaving it to Chriſt (in the uſe of all good means) to reveal his own truth in his own time, and mean while endeavoring to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, Phil. 3.15.16. Eph. 4.3.</p>
                  <p>To the 2d exception, that we take no courſe for the gaining, and healing, and calling in of ignorant and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous perſons, whom we refuſe to receive into our churches, and ſo exclude them from the remedy of church-diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>We conceive the receiving of them into our churches, would rather loſe and corrupt our churches, than gain and heal them. A little leaven laid in a lump of dough, will ſooner leaven the whole lump, than the whole lump will ſweeten it. We find it therefore ſafer to ſquare rough and unhewn ſtones before they be laid into the building, rather than to hammer and hew them when they lie unevenly in the building. And accordingly two means we uſe to gain and call in ſuch as are ignorant and ſcandalous.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The public miniſtry of the word, upon which they
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:012626_0191_0F8B8EC10C047A20"/>
are invited by counſel, and required by wholeſome laws. And the word it is, which is the power of God to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the calling and winning of ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Private conference, and conviction by the elders, and other able brethren of the church, whom they do the more reſpectively hearken unto, when they ſee no hope of enjoying church-fellowſhip, or participation in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments for themſelves or their children, till they approve their judgments to be ſound and orthodox, and their lives ſubdued to ſome hope of a godly converſation. What can claſſical diſcipline, or excommunication itſelf do more in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>The third exception wrapeth up in it a three-fold domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical inconvenience, and each of them meet to be eſchewed. 1. Diſ-union in families between each relation. 2. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of edification, for want of opportunity in the governors of families to take account of things heard by their children and ſervants. 3. Diſburſements of chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maintenance to the ſeveral churches, whereunto the ſeveral perſons of their families are joined.</p>
                  <p>All which inconveniencies either do not fall out in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational churches, or are eaſily redreſſed; for none are orderly admitted into congregational churches, but ſuch as are well approved by good teſtimony to be duly obſervant of family-relation: or if any otherwiſe diſpoſed ſhould creep in, they are either orderly healed, or duly removed in a way of Chriſt. Nor are they admitted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they can give ſome good account of their profiting by ordinances, before the elders and brethren of the church, and much more to their parents and maſters. Godly, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in the univerſity can take an account of their pupils; and godly houſholders in the city can take an account of their children and ſervants, how they profit by the word they have heard in ſeveral churches, and that to the greater edification of the whole family, by the variety of ſuch adminiſtrations. Bees may bring more honey and wax into the hive, when they are not limited to one garden of flowers, but may fly abroad to many.</p>
                  <p>Nor is any charge expected from wives, children or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to the maintenance of congregational churches, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they be furniſhed with perſonal eſtates or livings, which may enable them to contribute of ſuch things as they have; and not of ſuch things as they
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:012626_0192_0F8B8EC1D4ABFA18"/>
have not. God accepteth not robbery for a ſacrifice. And though a godly houſholder may juſtly take himſelf bound in conſcience to contribute to any ſuch church, whereto his wife, or children, or ſervants do ſtand in relation, yet that will not aggravate the burthen of his charge no more than if they were received members of the ſame church whereto himſelf is related.</p>
                  <p>But why do we ſtand thus long to plead exemptions from exception? The Lord help all his faithful ſervants (whether preſbyterial or congregational) to judge and ſhame ourſelves before the Lord, for all our former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances to greater enormities in church government, than are to be found either in the congregational or preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way; and then ſurely either the Lord will clear up his own will to us, and ſo frame and ſubdue us all to one mind and one way, (Ezek. 43.10.11.) or elſe we ſhall learn to bear one anothers burthens in a ſpirit of meekneſs. It will then doubtleſs be far from us, ſo to atteſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Chriſt, as to deteſt the diſciples of Chriſt: ſo to contend for the ſeamleſs coat of Chriſt, as to crucify the living members of Chriſt; ſo to divide ourſelves about church-communion, as thro' breaches to open a wide gap for a deluge of anti-chriſtian, and profane malignity to ſwallow up both church and civil ſtate.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall we ſay more? Is difference of church order become the in-let of all the diſorders in the kingdom? Hath the Lord indeed left us to ſuch hardneſs of heart, that church-government ſhall become a ſnare to Zion (as ſometimes Moſes was to Egypt, Exod. 20.7.) that we cannot leave conteſting and contending about it, till the kingdom be deſtroyed? Did not the Lord Jeſus, when he dedicated his ſufferings for his church, and his alſo unto his father, make it his earneſt and only prayer for us in this world, that we all might be one in him? Joh. 17.20, 21, 22, 23. And it is poſſible that he (whom the Father heard always, Joh. 11.42.) ſhould not have this laſt moſt ſolemn prayer heard and granted? Or ſhall it be granted for all the ſaints elſewhere, and not for the ſaints in England, ſo that amongſt them diſ-union ſhall grow
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:012626_0193_0F8B8EC2B6459DA0"/>
even about church union and communion? If it be poſſible for a little faith (ſo much as a grain of muſtard-ſeed) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a mountain, is it not poſſible for ſo much ſtrength of faith as it is, to be found in all the godly in the kingdom, to remove thoſe images of jealouſy, and to caſt thoſe ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling blocks out of the way, which may hinder the free paſſage of brotherly love amongſt brethren? It's true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the national covenant doth juſtly engage both parties faithfully to endeavor the utter extirpation of the antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian hierarchy; and much more of all blaſphemies, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and errors. Certainly, if congregational diſcipline be independent, from the inventions of men is it not much more independent from the deluſions of ſatan? What fellowſhip hath Chriſt with beliel? Light with darkneſs? Truth with error? The faithful Jews needed not the help of the Samaritans, to re-edify the temple of God; yea, they rejected their help when it was offered, Ezra. 4.1, 2, 3. And if the congregational way be a way of truth (as we believe) and if the brethren that walk in it be zealous of the truth, and hate every falſe way (as by the rule of their holy diſcipline they are inſtructed, 2 Joh. 10.11.) then verily there is no branch in the national covenant, that engageth the covenanters to abhor either the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational churches or their way; which being duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, do no leſs effectually extirpate the anti-chriſtian hierarchy, and all blaſphemies, hereſies, and pernicious errors, than the other way of diſcipline doth, which is more generally and publickly received and ratified.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord Jeſus commune with all our hearts in ſecret, and he who is the king of his church, let him be pleaſed to exerciſe his kingly power in out ſpirits, that ſo his kingdom may come into our churches in purity and peace, AMEN.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. Of the form of church government; and that it is one, immutable, and preſcribed in the word.</head>
                  <p>ECcleſiaſtical polity, or church gevernment or diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, is nothing elſe but that form and order that is to be obſerved in the church of Chriſt upon earth, both for the conſtitution of it, and all the adminiſtrations that therein are to be performed. Ezek. 43.11. Col. 2.5. 1 Tim. 3.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Church government is conſidered in a double reſpect, either in regard of the parts of government themſelves, or neceſſary circumſtances thereof. The parts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are preſcribed in the word, becauſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the King and lawgiver of his church, is no leſs faithful in the houſe of God than was Moſes, who from the Lord delivered a form and pattern of government to the children of Iſrael in the old Teſtament; and the holy ſcriptures are now alſo ſo perfect, as that they are able to make the man of God perfect, and throughly furniſhed unto every good work; and therefore doubtleſs to the well ordering of the houſe of God. Heb. 3.5, 6. Exod. 25.40. 2 Tim. 3.16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The parts of church-government, are all of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly deſcribed in the word of God, being parts or means of inſtituted worſhip, according to the ſecond command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and therefore to continue one and the ſame unto the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as a kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, until he ſhall deliver it up unto God, even to the father. So that it is not left in the power of men, officers, churches, or any ſtate in the world to add or diminiſh, or alter any thing in the leaſt meaſure therein. 1 Tim. 3.15. 1 Chron. 15.13. Exod 20.4. 1 Tim. 6.13, 16. Heb. 12.27, 28. 1 Cor. 15.24. Deut. 12.32.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The neceſſary circumſtances, as time and place, &amp;c. belonging unto order and decency, are not ſo left unto men, as that under pretence of them they may thruſt their own inventions upon the churches, being circumſcribed in the word with many general limitations, where they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in reſpect of the matter, to be neither worſhip

it ſelf, nor circumſtances ſeparable from worſhip. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their end, they muſt be done unto edification. In reſpect of the manner, decently and in order, according to the nature of the things themſelves, and civil and church cuſtom. Doth not even nature itſelf teach you? Yea, they are in ſome ſort determined particularly, namely, that they be done in ſuch a manner, as all circumſtances conſidered, is moſt expedient for edification: So, as if there be no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of man concerning their determination, the determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them is to be accounted as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <p>THE catholic church is the whole company of thoſe that are elected, redeemed, and in time effectually called from the ſtate of ſin and death, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. This church is either triumphant or militant. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, the number of them who are glorified in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Militant, the number of them who are conflicting with their enemies upon earth. Heb. 12, 23. Rom. 8.17. 2 Tim. 2.12. and 4.8. Eph. 6.12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This militant church is to be conſidered as inviſible, and viſible. Inviſible, in reſpect of their relation wherein they ſtand to Chriſt, as a body unto the head, being united unto him by the ſpirit of God, and faith in their hearts. Viſible, in reſpect of the profeſſion of their faith, in their perſons and in particular churches. And ſo there may be acknowledged an univerſal viſible church. 2 Tim. 2.19. Rev. 2.17. 1 Cor. 6.17. Eph. 3.17. Rom. 1.8. 1 Theſſ. 1.8. Iſa. 2.2. 1 Tim. 6.12.</p>

to the church order of the goſpel. In order, and ſo beſides the ſpiritual union and communion common to believers, they enjoy moreover an union and communion eccleſiaſtical-political. So we deny an univerſal viſible church. Acts 19.1. Col. 2.5. Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.12.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſtate of the members of the militant viſible church walking in order, was either before the law, oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical, that is in families; or under the law national; or ſince the coming of Chriſt, only congregational. (The term independent we approve not.) Therefore neither na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, provincial nor claſſical. Gen. 18.19, Exod. 19.6.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A congregational church is by the inſtitution of Chriſt a part of the militant viſible church, conſiſting of a company of ſaints by calling, united into one body by an holy covenant, for the public worſhip of God, and the mutual edification one of another, in the fellowſhip of the Lord Jeſus. 1 Cor. 14.23, 36. and 1.2. and 12.27.

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the matter of the viſible church, both is reſpect of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and quantity.</head>
                  <p>THE matter of a viſible church are ſaints by calling. 1 Cor. 1.2. Eph. 1.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By ſaints, we underſtand, 1. Such as have not only attained the knowledge of the principles of religion, and are free from groſs and open ſcandals, but alſo do together with the profeſſion of their faith and repentance, walk in blameleſs obedience to the word, ſo as that in chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſcretion they may be accounted ſaints by calling, (though perhaps ſome or more of them be unſound and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites inwardly) becauſe the members of ſuch particular churches are commonly by the Holy Ghoſt called ſaints &amp; faithful brethren in Chriſt; and ſundry churches have been reproved for receiving and ſuffering ſuch perſons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in fellowſhip amongſt them, as have been offenſive and ſcandalous; the name of God alſo by this means is
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:012626_0197_0F8B8EC911CC1B48"/>
blaſphemed, and the holy things of God defiled and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned, the hearts of the godly grieved, and the wicked themſelves hardened, and holpen forward to damnation. The example of ſuch doth endanger the ſanctity of others: A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 2. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch, who are alſo holy. Heb. 6.1. 1 Cor. 1.5. Rom. 6.17. 1 Cor. 1.2. Phil. 1.2. Col. 1.2. Eph. 1.1. 1 Cor. 5.12, 13. Rev. 2.14.15, 20. Ezek. 44.7, 9, and 23.38, 39. Num. 19.20. Hag. 2.13, 14. 1 Cor. 11.27.29. Pſal. 37.21. 1 Cor. 5.6. 2 Cor. 7.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The members of churches, though orderly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, may in time degenerate, and grow corrupt and ſcandalous, which though they ought not to be tolerated in the church, yet their continuance therein, through the defect of the execution of diſcipline and juſt cenſures, doth not immediately diſſolve the being of a church, as appears in the church of Iſrael, and the churches of Galatia and Corinth, Pergamus and Thyatira. Jer. 2.21. 1 Cor. 5.12. Jer. 2.4. Gal. 5.4. 2 Cor. 12.21. Rev. 2.14, 15. and 21.21.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The matter of the church in reſpect of its quantity, ought not to be of greater number than may ordinarily meet together conveniently in one place; nor ordinarily fewer, than may conveniently carry on church-work. Hence when the holy ſcripture makes mention of the ſaints combined into a church eſtate, in a town or city where was but one congregation, it uſually calleth thoſe ſaints (the church) in the ſingular number; as, the church of the Theſſalonians; the church of Smyrna, Philadelphia, and the like: But when it ſpeaketh of the ſaints in a nation or province, wherein there were ſundry congregations, it frequently and uſually calleth them by the name of chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in the plural number, as the churches of Aſia, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Macedonia, and the like; which is further confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what is written of ſundry of thoſe churches in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, how they were aſſembled and met together, the whole church in one place, as the church at Jeruſalem, the church at Antioch, the church at Corinth, and Cenchrea, though it were more near to Corinth, it being the port thereof, and anſwerable to a village, yet being a diſtinct congregation from Corinth, it had a church of its own, as well as Corinth had. 1 Cor. 14.21. Mat. 18.17. Rom.
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:012626_0198_0F8B8EC94551E0A0"/>
16.1. 1 Theſſ. 1.1. Rev. 2.8. and 3.7. 1 Cor. 16.1, 19. Gal. 1.2. 2 Cor. 8.1. 1 Theſſ. 2.14. Acts 2.46. and 5.12. and 6.2. and 14.27. and 15.38 1 Cor. 5.4. and 14.23. Rom. 16.1.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Nor can it with reaſon be thought but that every church appointed and ordained by Chriſt, had a miniſtry ordained and appointed for the ſame; and yet plain it is, that there were no ordinary officers appointed by Chriſt for any other than congregational churches; elders being appointed to feed, not all flocks, but the particular flock of God, over which the Holy Ghoſt had made them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, and that flock they muſt attend, even the whole flock; and one congregation being as much as any ordinary elder can attend, therefore there is no greater church than a congregation, which may ordinarily meet in one place.

                  <p>SAINTS by calling muſt have a viſible political union among themſelves, or elſe they are not yet a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar church, as thoſe ſimilitudes hold forth, which the ſcripture makes uſe of to ſhew the nature of particular churches, as a body, a building, houſe, hands, eyes, feet, and other members muſt be united, or elſe (remaining ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate) are not a body. Stones, timber, though ſquared, hewn and poliſhed, are not a houſe, until they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted and united; ſo ſaints or believers in judgment of charity, are not a church, unleſs orderly knit together. 1 Cor. 12.27. 1 Tim. 3.15. Eph. 2.22. 1 Cor. 12.15, 16, 17. Rev. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Particular churches cannot be diſtinguiſhed one from another, but by their forms: <hi>Epheſus</hi> is not <hi>Smyrna,</hi> nor <hi>Pergamus Thyatira,</hi> but each one a diſtinct ſociety of itſelf, having officers of their own, which had not the charge of others; virtues of their own, for which others are not praiſed; corruptions of their own, for which others are not blamed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This form is a viſible covenant, agreement or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, whereby they give up themſelves unto the Lord, to the obſerving of the ordinances of Chriſt together in the
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:012626_0199_0F8B93254F33EC08"/>
ſame ſociety, which is uſually called the church covenant: For we ſee not otherwiſe how members can have church power one over another mutually. The comparing of each particular church to a city, and unto a ſpouſe, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to conclude not only a form, but that form is by way of covenant. The covenant, as it was that which made the family of Abraham, and children of Iſrael to be a church and people unto God, ſo it is that which now makes the ſeveral ſocieties of Gentile believers to be churches in theſe days. Exod. 19.5, 8. Deut. 29.12, 13. Zech. 11.14. and 9.11. Eph. 2.19. 2 Cor. 11.2. Gen. 17.7. Deut. 29.12, 13. Eph. 2.12, 18.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This voluntary agreement, conſent or covenant, (for all theſe are taken here for the ſame) altho' the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and plain it is, the more fully it puts us in mind of our mutual duty, and ſtirreth us up to it, and leaveth leſs room for the queſtioning of the truth of the church eſtate of a company of profeſſors, and the truth of member-ſhip of particular perſons; yet we conceive the ſubſtance of it is kept, where there is a real agreement and conſent of a company of faithful perſons to meet conſtantly together in one congregation, for the public worſhip of God, and their mutual edification; which real agreement and conſent they do expreſs by their conſtant practice in coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the publick worſhip of God, and by their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſubjection to the ordinances of God there; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if we conſider how ſcripture-covenants have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into, not only expreſsly by word of mouth, but by ſacrifice, by hand-writing and ſeal, and alſo ſometimes by ſilent conſent, without any writing or expreſſion of words at all. Exod. 19.5. and 20.8 and 24.3.17. Joſh. 24.18 to 24. Pſal. 50.5. Neh. 9.3, 8 and 10. 1. Gen. 17. Deut. 29.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This form being by mutual covenant, it followeth, it is not ſaith in the heart, nor the profeſſion of that faith, nor co-habitation, nor baptiſm. 1. Not ſaith in the heart, becauſe that is inviſible. 2. Not a bare profeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that declareth them no more to be members of one church than another. 3. Not co-habitation; atheiſts or infidels may dwell together with believers. 4. Not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, becauſe it pre-ſuppoſeth a church eſtate, as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in the old teſtament, which gave no being to the church, the church being before it, and in the wilderneſs
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:012626_0200_0F8B932602E77FF0"/>
without it. Seals pre-ſuppoſe a covenant already in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. One perſon is a compleat ſubject of baptiſm, but one perſon is uncapable of being a church.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All believers ought, as God giveth them opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereunto, to endeavour to join themſelves unto a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church, and that in reſpect of the honor of Jeſus Chriſt, in his example and inſtitution, by the profeſſed acknowledgement of, and ſubjection unto the order and ordinances of the goſpel; as alſo in reſpect of their good of communion, founded upon their viſible union, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the promiſes of Chriſt's ſpecial preſence in the church; whence they have fellowſhip with him, and in him one with another; alſo, for the keeping of them in the way of God's commandments, and recovering of them in caſe of wandering (which all Chriſt's ſheep are ſubject to in this life) being unable to return of themſelves; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the benefit of their mutual edification, and of their poſterity, that they may not be cut off from the privileges of the covenant. Otherwiſe if a believer offends, he remains diſtitute of the remedy provided in that behalf. And ſhould all believers neglect this duty of joining to all particular congregations, it might follow thereupon, that Chriſt ſhould have no viſible political churches upon earth.

                  <p>THE firſt ſubject of church power, is eitheir ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme or ſubordinate and miniſterial: The ſupreme (by way of gift from the father) is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: The miniſterial is either extraordinary as the apoſtles, prophets and evangeliſts; or ordinary, as every particular congregational church. Mat. 18.18. Rev. 3.7. Iſa. 9.6. John 20.21.23. 1 Cor. 14.32. Tit. 1.5. 1 Cor. 5.12.</p>

ſuch as belongs to the brotherhood.

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Of the officers of the church, and eſpecially of paſtors and teachers.</head>
                  <p>A Church being a company of people combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by covenant, for the worſhip of God, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth thereby, there may be the eſſence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a church without any officers, ſeeing there is both the form and matter of a church; which is implied when it is ſaid, The apoſtles ordained elders in every church, Acts 14.23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nevertheleſs, though officers be not abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the ſimple being of churches, when they be called, yet ordinarily to their calling, they are, and to their well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being; and therefore the Lord Jeſus, out of his tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, hath appointed and ordained officers, which he would not have done, if they had not been uſeful and needful for the church; yea, being aſcended into heaven, he received gifts for men, and gave gifts to men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of officers for the church are juſtly accounted no ſmall parts, they being to continue to the end of the world, and for the perfecting of all the ſaints. Rom. 10.17. Jer. 3.15. 1 Cor. 12.28. Eph. 4.11. Pſal. 68.18. Eph. 4.8, 11, and 4.12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe officers were either extraordinary or ordinary: Extraordinary, as apoſtles, prophets, evangeliſts; ordinary, as elders and deacons. The apoſtles, prophets and evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts as they were called extraordinarily by Chriſt, ſo their office ended with themſelves. Whence it is that Paul directing Timothy how to carry along church ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, giveth no direction about the choice or courſe of apoſtles, prophets or evangliſts, but only of elders <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="203" facs="unknown:012626_0202_0F8B932C7AF92B00"/>
of the church of Epheſus, he committed the care of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the church to no other but unto the elders of that church. The like charge doth Peter commit to the elders. 1. Cor. 12.28. Eph. 4.11. Acts 8.6, 16, 19. and 11.28. Rom. 11.13. 1 Cor. 4.9. 1 Tim. 3.1, 2, 8 to 13. Tit. 1.8. Acts 20.17, 28. 1 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Of elders (who are alſo in ſcripture called biſhops) ſome attend chiefly to the miniſtry of the word, as the paſtors and teachers; others attend eſpecially unto rule, who are therefore called ruling elders. 1 Tim. 2.3. Phil. 1.1. Acts 20.17, 28. 1 Tim. 5.17.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The office of paſtor and teacher, appears to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct. The paſtors ſpecial work is, to attend to exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therein to adminiſter a word of wiſdom: The tercher is to attend to doctrine, and therein to adminiſter a word of knowledge: And either of them to adminiſter the ſeals of that covenant, unto the diſpenſation whereof they are alike called; as alſo to execute the cenſures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a kind of application of the word: The preaching of which, together with the application thereof, they are alike charged withal. Eph. 4.11. Rom. 12.7.8. 1 Cor. 12.8. 2 Tim. 4.1, 2. Tit. 1.9.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And foraſmuch as both paſtors and teachers are given by Chriſt for the perfecting of the ſaints, and edifying of his body; which ſaints and body of Chriſt is his church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE ruling elders office is diſtinct from the office of paſtor and teacher. The ruling elders are not ſo called, to exclude the paſtors and teachers from ruling, becauſe ruling and governing is common to theſe

                  <p n="2">2. The ruling elders work is to join with the paſtor and teacher in thoſe acts of ſpiritual rule, which are diſtinct from the miniſtry of the word and ſacraments committed to them. Of which ſort theſe be as followeth: 1. To open and ſhut the doors of God's houſe by the admiſſion of members approved by the church; by ordination of officers choſen by the church, and by excommunication of notorious and obſtinate offenders renounced by the church, and by reſtoring of penitents forgiven by the church. 2.

To prepare matters in private, that in public they may be carried to an end with leſs trouble, and more ſpeedy diſpatch. 4. To mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the carriage of all matters in the church aſſembled; as, to propound matters to the church, to order the ſeaſon of ſpeech and ſilence, and to pronounce ſentence according to the mind of Chriſt, with the conſent of the church.</p>

To feed the flock of God with a word of admonition. 9. And as they ſhall be ſent for, to viſit and pray over their ſick brethren. 10.

The ſcripture telleth us how they ſhould be qualified, — "Grace, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not given to filthy lucre." —They muſt firſt be proved and then uſe the office of a deacon, being found blameleſs. The office and work of a deacon, is to receive

the offerings of the church, gifts given to the church, and to keep the treaſury of the church, and therewith to ſerve the tables, which the church is to provide for; as the Lord's table, the table of the miniſters, and of ſuch as are in neceſſity, to whom they are to diſtribute in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Acts 6.3. Phil. 1.1. 1 Tim. 3.8. 1 Cor. 12.28. 1 Tim. 3.8, 9. Acts 4.35. and 6.2, 3. Rom. 12.8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The office therefore being limited unto the care of the temporal good things of the church, it extends not to the attendance upon, and adminiſtration of the ſpiritual things thereof, as the word and ſacramentss, or the like. 1 Cor. 7.17.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ordinance of the apoſtle, and practice of the church, commends the Lord's day as a fit time for the contribution of the ſaints. 1 Cor. 16.1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The inſtituting of all theſe officers in the church, is the work of God himſelf, of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of the Holy Ghoſt; and therefore ſuch officers as he hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, are altogether unlawful either to be placed in the church, or to be retained therein, and are to be looked at as human creatures, meer inventions and appointments of men, to the great diſhonor of Chriſt Jeſus the Lord of his houſe, the king of his church, whether popes, patriarchs, cardinals, arch-biſhops, lord-biſhops, arch-deacons, offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, commiſſaries, and the like. Theſe and the reſt of that hierarchy and retinue, not being plants of the Lord's planting, ſhall be all certainly rooted out and caſt forth. 1 Cor. 12.28. Eph. 4.8, 11. Acts 20.28. Mat. 15.13.</p>

                  <p>NO man may take the honor of a church officer unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. Heb. 5.4.</p>

<pb n="206" facs="unknown:012626_0205_0F8B933514E8F378"/>
this manner of calling ended with them as hath been ſaid: Or mediate, by the church. Gal. 1.1. Acts 14.23. and 6.3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is meet that before any be ordained, or choſen officers, they ſhould be firſt tried and proved, becauſe hands are not ſuddenly to be laid upon any, and both elders and deacons muſt be of honeſt and good report. 1 Tim. 5.22. and 7.10. Acts 16.2. and 6.3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The things in reſpect of which they are to be tried, are thoſe gifts and virtues which the ſcripture requireth in men that are to be elected into ſuch places, viz. that the elders muſt be blameleſs, ſober, apt to teach, and endued with ſuch other qualifications as are laid down, 1 Tim. 3. 2. Tit. 1.6 to 9. Deacons to be fitted as is directed, Acts 6.3. 1 Tim. 3.8 to 11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Officers are to be called by ſuch churches whereunto they are to miniſter. Of ſuch moment is the preſervation of this power, that the churches exerciſed it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the apoſtles. Acts 14.23. and 1.23. and 6.3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A church being free, cannot become ſubject to any, but by a free election; yet when ſuch a people do chuſe any to be over them in the Lord, then do they become ſubject, and moſt willingly ſubmit to their miniſtry in the Lord, whom they have ſo choſen. Gal. 5.13. Heb. 13.17.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And if the church have power to chuſe their officers and miniſters, then in caſe of manifeſt unworthineſs and delinquency, they have power alſo to depoſe them: for, to open and ſhut, to chuſe and refuſe, to conſtitute in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and remove from office, are acts belonging to the ſame power. Rom. 16.17.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We judge it much conducing to the well-being and communion of churches, that where it may conveniently be done, neighbour churches be adviſed withal, and their help be made uſe of in the trial of church-officers, in order to their choice, Cant. 8.8, 9.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The choice of ſuch church-officers belongeth not to the civil magiſtrates, as ſuch, or dioceſan-biſhops, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons; for of theſe, or any ſuch-like, the ſcripture is wholly ſilent, as having any power therein.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. Of ordination, and impoſition of hands.</head>
                  <p>CHURCH officers are not only to be choſen by the church, but alſo to be ordained by impoſition of hands and prayer, with which at the ordination of elders, faſting alſo is to be joined. Acts 13.3. and 14.23. 1 Tim. 5.22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ordination we account nothing elſe but the ſolemn putting a man into his place and office in the church, whereunto he had right before by election; being like the inſtalling of a magiſtrate in the common wealth. Ordination therefore is not to go before but to follow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. The eſſence and ſubſtance of the outward calling of an ordinary officer in the church, doth not conſiſt in his ordination, but in his voluntary and free election by the church, and his accepting of that election; whereupon is founded that relation between paſtor and flock, between ſuch a miniſter and ſuch a people. Ordination doth not conſtitute an officer, nor give him the eſſentials of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. The apoſtles were elders without impoſition of hands by men; Paul and Barnabas were officers before that impoſition of hands, Acts 13.3. The poſterity of Levi were prieſts and levites, before hands were laid on them by the children of Iſrael. Numb. 8.10. Acts 6.5, 6. and 13.2.3. and 14.23. 1 Tim. 4.14. 1 Tim. 5.22.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In ſuch churches where there are elders, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands in ordination, is to be performed by thoſe elders.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In ſuch churches where there are no elders, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands may be performed by ſome of the brethren orderly choſen by the church thereunto. For if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may elect officers, which is the greater, and wherein the ſubſtance of the office doth conſiſt, they may much more (occaſion and need ſo requiring) impoſe hands in ordination, which is leſs, and but the accompliſhment of the other. Numb. 8.10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Nevertheleſs, in ſuch churches where there are no elders, and the church ſo deſire, we ſee not why impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands may not be performed by the elders of other churches. Ordinary officers laid hands upon the officers
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:012626_0207_0F8B93368917D1E0"/>
of many churches: The preſbytery at Epheſus laid hands upon Timothy, an evangeliſt; the preſbytery at Antioch laid hands upon Paul and Barnabas. 1 Tim. 4.14. Acts 13.3.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Church officers are officers to one church, even that particular church over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made them overſeers. Inſomuch as elders are commanded to feed, not all flocks, but that flock which is committed to their faith and truſt, and dependeth upon them. Nor can conſtant reſidence at one congregation be neceſſary for a miniſter, no, nor yet lawful, if he be not a miniſter to one congregation only, but to the church univerſal; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he may not attend one part only of the church to which he is a miniſter, but he is called to attend unto all the flock. 1 Pet. 5.2. Acts 20.28.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He that is clearly looſed from his office relation unto the church whereof he was a miniſter, cannot be looked at as an officer, nor perform any act of office in any other church, unleſs he be again orderly called unto office; which when it ſhall be, we know nothing to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but impoſition of hands alſo in his ordination ought to be uſed towards him again. For ſo Paul the apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived impoſition of hands twice at leaſt from Annanias. Acts 9.17. and 13.3.</p>

                  <p>SUPREAM and lordly power over all the churches upon earth doth only belong unto Jeſus Chriſt, who is king of the church, and the head thereof. He hath the government upon his ſhoulders, and hath all power given to him both in heaven and earth. Pſal. 2.6. Eph. 1.21, 22. Iſa. 9.6. Matt. 28.18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A company of profeſſed believers eccleſiaſtically confederate, as they are a church, before they have officees, and without them; ſo even in that eſtate, ſubordinate church power, under Chriſt, delegated to them by him, doth belong to them in ſuch a manner as is before expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, chap. 5. ſect. 2. and as flowing from the very nature and eſſence of a church: It being natural to all bodies, and ſo unto a church body, to be furniſhed with ſufficient power for its own preſervation and ſubſiſtence.

This government of the church is a mixt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (and ſo hath been acknowledged long before the term of independency was heard of) in reſpect of Chriſt, the head and king of the church, and the ſovereign power reſiding in him, and exerciſed by him, it is a monarchy; in reſpect of the body or brotherhood of the church, and power from Chriſt granted unto them, it reſembles a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy; in reſpect of the preſbytery, and power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them, it is an ariſtocracy.

                  <p n="5">5. The power granted by Chriſt unto the body of the church and brotherhood, is a prerogative or privilege which the church doth exerciſe. 1. In chuſing their own offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whether elders or deacons. 2. In admiſſion of their own members, and therefore there is great reaſon they ſhould have power to remove any from their fellowſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Hence in caſe of offence, any brother hath power to convince and admoniſh an offending brother; and in caſe of not hearing him, to take one or two more to ſet on the admonition; and in caſe of not hearing them, to proceed to tell the church; and as his offence may require, the whole church hath power to proceed to the cenſure of him, whether by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition or excommunication; and upon his repentance, to reſtore him again unto his former communion. Acts 3.5. and 14.23. and 9.26. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. Tit. 3.10. Col. 4.17. 2 Cor. 2.7, 8.</p>

                     <pb n="210" facs="unknown:012626_0209_0F8B93381158E718"/>6. In caſe an elder offend incorrigibly, the matter ſo requiring, as the church had power to call him to office, ſo they have power according to order (the council of other churches, where it may be had, directing thereto) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him from his office; and being now but a member, in caſe he add contumacy to his ſin, the church that had power to receive him into their fellowſhip, hath the ſame power to caſt him out, that they have concerning any other member. Col. 4.17. Rom. 16.17. Mat. 18.17.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Church government or rule, is placed by Chriſt in the officers of the church, who are therefore called rulers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while they rule with God; yet in caſe of male adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are ſubject to the power of the church, as hath been ſaid before. The Holy Ghoſt frequently, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, where it mentioneth church rule, and church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, aſcribeth it to elders; whereas the work and duty of the people is expreſſed in the phraſe of obeying their elders, and ſubmitting themſelves unto them in the Lord. So as it is manifeſt, that an organic or com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>oat church is a body politic, conſiſting of ſome that are governors, and ſome that are governed in the Lord. 1 Tim. 5.17. Heb. 13.17. 1 Theſſ. 5.12. Rom. 12.8. 1 Tim. 5. 17. 1 Cor. 12.28, 29. Heb. 13.7, 17.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The power which Chriſt has committed to the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, is to feed and rule the church of God, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to call the church together upon any weighty occaſion; when the members, ſo called, without a juſt cauſe, may not refuſe to come, nor when they are come, depart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are diſmiſs'd, nor ſpeak in the church before they have leave from the elders; nor continue ſo doing when they require ſilence; nor may they oppoſe nor contradict the judgment or ſentence of the elders, without ſufficient and weighty cauſe, becauſe ſuch practices are manifeſtly contrary unto order and government, and in-lets of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, and tend to confuſion. Acts 20.28. and 6.2. Num. 16.12. Ezek. 46.10. Acts 13.15. Hoſ. 4.4.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It belongs alſo unto the elders to examine any offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers or members before they be received of the church; to receive the accuſations brought to the church, and to prepare them for the churches hearing. In handling of offences, and other matters before the church, they have
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:012626_0210_0F8B9338D2663868"/>
power to declare and publiſh the counſel and will of God, touching the ſame, and to pronounce ſentence with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the church. Laſtly, They have power, when they diſmiſs the people, to bleſs them in the name of the Lord. Rev. 2.2. 1 Tim. 5.19. Acts 21.18, 22, 23. 1 Cor. 5.4, 5. Numb. 6. 23 to 26.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. This power of government in the elders doth not any wiſe prejudice the power of privilege in the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; as neither the power of privilege in the brethren doth prejudice the power of government in the elders, but they may ſweetly agree together; as we may ſee in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the apoſtles, furniſhed with the greateſt church power, who took in the concurrence and conſent of the brethren in church adminiſtrations. Alſo that ſcripture, 2 Cor. 2.9. and 10.6. do declare, That what the churches are to act and do in theſe matters they were to do in a way of obedience, and that not only to the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the apoſtles, but alſo of their ordinary elders. Acts 14.15, 23, and 6.2. 1 Cor. 5.4. 2 Cor. 26.7. Heb. 13.17.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. From the premiſes, namely, That the ordinary power of government belonging only to the elders, power of privilege remaineth with the brotherhood (as the power of judgment in matters of cenſure, and power of liberty in matters of liberty) it followeth, that in an organic church and right adminiſtration, all church acts proceed after the manner of a mixt adminiſtration, ſo as no church act can be conſummated or perfected without the conſent of both.</p>

Moreover, the ſcripture doth not only

call elders, labourors and workmen, but alſo ſpeaking of them doth ſay, that the labourer is worthy of his hire; and requires, that he which is taught in the word ſhould communicate to him in all good things; and mentions it as an ordinance of the Lord, that they which preach the goſpel ſhould live of the goſpel; and forbiddeth the muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn, 1 Cor. 9.14, 15.

                  <p n="3">3. The apoſtle (Gal. 6.6.) enjoining, that he which is taught communicateth to them that teacheth in all good things, doth not leave it arbitrary, what or how much a man ſhall give, or in what proportion, but even the latter as well as the former, is preſcribed and appointed by the Lord, 1 Cor. 16.2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Not only members of churches, but all that are taught in the word, are to contribute unto him that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in all good things. In caſe that congregations are defective in their contributions, the deacons are to call upon them to do their duty: if their call ſufficeth not, the church by her power is to require it of their members; and where church power, through the corruption of men, doth not or cannot attain the end, the magiſtrate is to ſee that the miniſtry be duly provided for, as appears from the commended example of Nehemiah. The magiſtrates are nurſing fathers, and nurſing mothers, and ſtand charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the cuſtody of both tables; becauſe it is better to prevent a ſcandal that it may not come, and eaſier alſo, than to remove it when it is given.

                  <p>THE doors of the churches of Chriſt upon earth do not by God's appointment ſtand ſo wide open, that all ſorts of people, good or bad, may freely enter therein at their pleaſure, but ſuch as are admitted thereto, as members, ought to be examined and tried firſt, whether they be fit and meet to be received, into church-ſociety or not. The eunuch of Ethiopia, before his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was examined by Philip, whether he did believe on Jeſus Chriſt with all his heart. The angel of the church at Epheſus is commended for trying ſuch as ſaid they were apoſtles, and were not. There is like reaſon for trying of them that profeſs to be believers. The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers are charged with the keeping of the doors of the church, and therefore are in a ſpecial manner to make tryal of the fitneſs of ſuch who enter. Twelve angels are ſet at the gates of the temple, leſt ſuch as where cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially unclean ſhould enter thereinto. 2 Chron. 23.19. Mat. 13.25. and 22.12. Acts 8.37. Rev. 2.2.

The weakeſt meaſure of faith is to be accepted in thoſe that deſire to be admitted into the church, becauſe weak chriſtians, if ſincere, have the ſubſtance of that faith, repentance and holineſs which is required in church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and ſuch have moſt need of the ordinances for their confirmation and growth in grace. The Lord Jeſus would not quench the ſmoaking flax, not break the bruiſed reed, but gather the tender lambs in his arms, and carry them gently in his boſom. Such charity and tenderneſs is to be uſed, as the weakeſt chriſtian, if ſincere, may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded nor diſcouraged. Severity of examination is to be avoided. Rom. 14.1. Mat. 12.20. Iſa. 40.11.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In caſe any through exceſſive fear, or other infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be unable to make their perſonal relation of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eſtate in public, it is ſufficient that the elders having received private ſatisfaction, make relation thereof in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic before the church, they teſtifying their aſſents thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; this being the way that tendeth moſt to edification. But where perſons are of great abilities, there it is moſt expedient that they make their relations and confeſſions perſonally with their own mouth, as David profeſſeth of himſelf, Pſal. 66.16.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A perſonal and public confeſſion, and declaring of God's manner of working upon the ſoul, is both lawful, expedient and uſeful, in ſundry reſpects, and upon ſundry grounds. Thoſe three thouſand, Acts 2.37, 41. before they were admitted by the apoſtles, did manifeſt that they were pricked in the heart at Peter's ſermon, together with earneſt deſire to be delivered from their ſins, which now wounded their conſcience, and their ready receiving of the word of promiſe and exhortation. We are to be ready to render a reaſon of the hope that is in us, to every one that aſketh us; therefore we muſt be able and ready upon any occaſion to declare and ſhew our repentence for ſin, faith unfeigned, and effectual calling, becauſe theſe are the reaſons of a well grounded hope. I have not hidden my righteouſneſs from the great congregation, Pſal. 40.10. 1 Pet. 3.15. Heb. 11.1. Eph. 1.18.</p>

way alſo be performed by ſuch as have formerly been members of ſome other church, and the church to which they now join themſelves as members may lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſame. Thoſe three thouſand, Acts 2, which made their confeſſion, were members of the church of the Jews before, ſo were they that were baptiſed by John. Churches may err in their admiſſion and perſons regularly admitted, may fall into offence. Otherwiſe if churches might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude their members, or if church members, might obtrude themſelves upon other churches without due trial, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo requiring, both the liberty of churches would hereby be infringed, in that they might not examine thoſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whoſe fitneſs for communion they were unſatisfied; and beſides, the infringing of their liberty, the churches themſelves would unavoidably be corrupted, and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances defiled, whilſt they might not refuſe, but muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the unworthy; which is contrary unto the ſcripture, teaching that all churches are ſiſters, and therefore equal. Mat. 3.1, 6. Gal. 2.4. 1 Tim. 5.24. Cant. 8.8.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The like trial is to be required from ſuch members of the church as were born in the ſame, or received their memberſhip and were baptiſed in their infancy, or minor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, by virtue of the covenant of their parents, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown up unto years of diſcretion, they ſhall deſire to be made partakers of the Lord's ſupper; unto which, becauſe holy things muſt not be given to the unworthy, therefore it is requiſite, that theſe as well as others, ſhould come to their trial and examination, and manifeſt their faith and repentance by an open profeſſion thereof, before they are received to the Lord's ſupper, and otherwiſe not to be admitted thereunto. Yet theſe church members that were ſo born, or received in their child-hood, before they are capable of being made partakers of full communion, have many privileges which others (no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. Of church members their removal from one church to another, and of recommendation and diſmiſſion.</head>
                  <p>CHURCH members may not remove or depart from the church, and ſo one from another as they pleaſe, nor without juſt and weighty cauſe, but ought to live and dwell together, foraſmuch as they are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to forſake the aſſembling themſelves together. Such departure tends to the diſſolution and ruin of the body, as the pulling of ſtones and pieces of timber from the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of members from the natural body tends to the deſtruction of the whole. Heb. 10.25.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is therefore the duty of church-members in ſuch times and places where council may be had, to conſult with the church whereof they are members about their removal, that accordingly they having their approbation, may be encouraged or otherwiſe deſiſt. They who are joined with conſent, ſhould not depart without conſent, except forced thereunto. Pro. 11.16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If a member's departure be manifeſtly unſafe and ſinful, the church may not conſent thereunto; for in ſo doing, they ſhould not act in faith, and ſhould partake with him in his ſin. If the caſe be doubtful, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not to be perſwaded, it ſeemeth beſt to leave the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto God, and not forcibly to detain him. Rom. 14.23. 1 Tim. 5.22. Acts 21.14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Juſt reaſons for a member's removal of himſelf from the church, are, 1. If a man cannot continue without partaking in ſin. 2. In caſe of perſonal perſecution; ſo Paul departed from the diſciples at Damaſcus. Alſo in caſe of general perſecution, when all are ſcattered. 5. In caſe of real, and not only pretended want of competent ſubſiſtence, a door being opened for better ſupply in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, together with the means of ſpiritual edification. In theſe or like caſes, a member may lawfully remove, and the church, cannot lawfully detain him. Eph. 5.11. Acts 9.25, 29, 30. and 8.1. Neh. 13.20.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To ſeperate from a church, either out of contempt of their holy fellowſhip, or out of covetouſneſs, or for
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:012626_0216_0F8B933E26C93300"/>
greater enlargements, with juſt grief to the church; or out of ſchiſm, or want of love, and out of a ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in reſpect of ſome unkindneſs, or ſome evil only conceived, or indeed in the church, which might and ſhould be tolerated and healed with a ſpirit of meekneſs, and of which evil the church is not yet convinced (tho' perhaps himſelf be) nor admoniſhed; for theſe or the like reaſons to withdraw from public communion in word, or ſeals, or cenſures, is unlawful and ſinful. 2 Tim. 4.10. Rom. 16.17. Judge 5.19. Eph. 4.2, 3. Col. 3.13. Gal. 6.1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Such members as have orderly removed their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ought to join themſelves unto the church in order where they do inhabit, if it may be; otherwiſe, they can neither perform the duties, nor receive the privileges of members. Such an example tolerated in ſome, is apt to corrupt others, which if many ſhould follow, would threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the diſſolution and confuſion of churches, contrary to the ſcripture. Iſa. 56.8. Acts 9.26. 1 Cor. 14.33.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Order requires that a member thus removing, have letters teſtimonial, and of diſmiſſion from the church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he yet is, unto the church whereunto he deſireth to be joined, leſt the church ſhould be deluded; that the church may receive him in the faith, and not be corrupted by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving deceivers, and falſe brethren, until the perſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed be received into another church, he ceaſeth not by his letters or diſmiſſion to be a member of the church whereof he was, the church cannot make a member no member, but by excommunication. Acts 18.27.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If a member be called to remove only for a time, where a church is, letters of recommendation are requiſite, and ſufficient for communion with that church, in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and in their watch; as Phoebe, a ſervant of the church at Cenchrea, had letters written for her to the church at Rome, that ſhe might be received as becometh ſaints. Rom. 16.1, 2. 2 Cor. 3, 1.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Such letters of recommendation and diſmiſſion were written for Apollos, for Marcus to the Coloſſians; for Phoebe to the Romans, for ſundry others to other churches.
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:012626_0217_0F8B933EC1767B30"/>
And the apoſtle telleth us, that ſome perſons, not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known otherwiſe, have ſpecial need of ſuch letters, though he for his part had no need thereof. The uſe of them is to be a benefit and help to the party for whom they are written, and for the furthering of his receiving amongſt the ſaints in the place whereto he goeth, and the due ſatisfaction of them in their receiving of him. Acts 18.27. Col. 4.10. Rom. 16.1. 2 Cor. 3.1.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIV. Of excommunication, and other cenſures.</head>
                  <p>THE cenſures of the church are appointed by Chriſt for the preventing, removing, and healing of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences in the church; for the reclaiming and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of offending brethren, for the deterring others from the like offences, for purging out the leaven which may infect the whole lump; for vindicating the honor of Chriſt, and of his church, and the holy profeſſion of the goſpel; and for preventing of the wrath of God, that may juſtly fall upon the church, if they ſhould ſuffer his covenant, and the ſeals thereof to be profaned by notorious and obſtinate offenders. 1 Tim. 5.20. Deut. 17.12, 13. Jude 5.19. Deut. 13.11. 1 Cor. 5.6. Rom. 2.24. Rev. 2.14, 15, 16, 20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If an offence be private, (one brother offending another) the offender is to go and acknowledge his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for it unto his offended brother, who is then to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him; but if the offender neglect or refuſe to do it, the brother offended is to go and convince and admoniſh him of it, between themſelves privately: If thereupon the offender be brought to repent of his offence, the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher hath won his brother; but if the offender hear not his brother, the brother offended is to take with him one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed, (whether the word of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, if the offender receive it; or the word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, if he refuſe it;) for if he refuſe it, the offended brother is by the mouth of the elders to tell the church, and if he hear the church, and declare the ſame by peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:012626_0218_0F8B933F84CBE7C0"/>
confeſſion, he is recovered and gained; and if the church diſcern him to be willing to hear, yet not fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his offence, as in caſe of hereſie, they are to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe to him a public admonition; which declaring the offender to lie under the public offence of the church, doth thereby withold or ſuſpend him from the holy fellowſhip of the Lord's ſupper, till his offence be removed by peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent confeſſion. If he ſtill continue oſtſtinate, they are to caſt him out by excommunication. Mat. 5.23, 24. Luke 17.3, 4. Mat. 18.15, 26, 17. Tit. 3.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But if the offence be more public at firſt, and of a more heinous and criminal nature, to wit, ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the light of nature, then the church, without ſuch gradual proceedings, is to caſt out the offender from their holy communion, for the further mortifying of his ſins, and the healing of his ſoul in the day of the Lord Jeſus. 1 Cor. 5.4, 5, 11.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In dealing with an offender, great care is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that we be neither over ſtrict or rigorous, nor too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent or remiſs; our proceeding herein, ought to be with a ſpirit of meckneſs, conſidering ourſelves, leaſt we alſo be tempted; and that the beſt of us have need of much forgiveneſs from the Lord.

                  <p n="5">5. While the off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nder remains excommunicate, the church is to refrain all member-like communion with him in ſpiritual things, and alſo from all familiar communion with him in civil things, further than the neceſſity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, domeſtical or civil relations do require; and are therefore to forbear to eat and drink with him, that he may be aſhamed. Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.11. 2 Theſ. 3.6, 14.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Excommunication being a ſpiritual puniſhment, it doth not prejudice the excommunicate in, nor deprive him of his civil rights, and therefore toucheth not princes, nor other magiſtrates in point of their civil dignity or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the excommunicate being but as a publican, and a heathen, (heathens being lawfully permitted to come to

                  <p n="7">7. If the Lord ſanctify the cenſure to the offender, ſo as by the grace of Chriſt he doth teſtify his repentance with humble confeſſion of his ſins, and judging of himſelf, giving glory unto God, the church is then to forgive him, and to comfort him, and to reſtore him to the wonted brotherly communion, which formerly he enjoyed with them, 2 Cor. 2.7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The ſuffering of the prophane or ſcandalous livers to continue in fellowſhip, and partake in the ſacraments, is doubtleſs a great ſin in thoſe that have power in their hands to redreſs it, and do it not: Nevertheleſs, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Chriſt and his apoſtles in their times, and the prophets and the other godly in theirs, did lawfully par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Lord's commanded ordinances in the Jewiſh church, and neither taught nor practiſed ſeparation from the ſame, though unworthy ones were permitted therein, and inaſmuch as the faithful in the church of Corinth, wherein were many unwor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hy perſons and practices, are never commanded to abſent themſelves from the ſacraments, becauſe of the ſame; therefore the godly in like caſes are not preſently to ſeparate, Rev. 2.14, 15, 20. Mat. 23.3. Acts 3.1. 1 Cor. 6. and 15.12.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. As ſeparation from ſuch a church wherein prophane and ſcandalous perſons are tolerated, is not preſently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; ſo for the members thereof, otherwiſe unworthy, hereupon to abſtain from communicating with ſuch a church in the participation of the ſacraments is unlawful. For as it were unreaſonable for an innocent perſon to be puniſhed for the faults of others, wherein he hath no hand, and whereunto he gave no conſent; ſo is it more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that a godly man ſhould neglect duty, and puniſh himſelf, in not coming for his portion in the bleſſing of the ſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>CHAP. XV. Of the communion of churches one with another.</head>
                  <p>ALTHOUGH churches be diſtinct and therefore may not be confounded one with another, and equal, and therefore have not dominion one over another; yet all the churches ought to preſerve church communion one with another, becauſe they are all united unto Chriſt, not only as a myſtical but as a political head, whence is derived a communion ſuitable thereunto. Rev. 1.4. Cant. 8.8. Rom. 16.16. 1 Cor. 16.19. Acts 15.23. Rev. 2.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The communion of churches is excerciſed ſundry ways. 1. By way of mutual care, in taking thought for one anothers welfare. 2. By way of conſultation one with another, when we have occaſion to require the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and counſel of other churches, touching any perſon or cauſe wherewith they may be better acquainted than our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As the church at Antioch conſulted with the apoſtles and elders of the church at Jeruſalem, about the queſtion of circumciſion of the Gentiles, and about the falſe teachers that broached that doctrine. In which caſe, when any church wanted light or peace amongſt themſelves, it is a way of communion of churches (according to the word) ta meet together, by their elders and other meſſengers in a ſynod, to conſider and argue the points in doubt or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and having found out the way of truth and peace, to commend the ſame by their let<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the churches whom the ſame may concern. But if a church be rent with diviſions among themſelves, or lie under any open ſcandal, and yet refuſe to conſult with other churches for healing or removing of the ſame, it is matter of juſt offence both to the Lord Jeſus, and to other churches, as bewraying too much want of mercy and faithfulneſs, not to ſeek to bind up the breaches and wounds of the church and brethren; and therefore the ſtate of ſuch a church calleth aloud upon o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>her churches to exerciſe a fuller act of brotherly communion, to wit, by way of admonition. 3. A third way of communion of churches is by way of admonition, to wit, in caſe any public offence be found in a church, which either diſcern not or are ſlow in proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to uſe means for the removing and healing thereof. Paul had no authority over Peter, yet when he ſaw Peter not walking with a right foot, he publickly rebuked him before the church. Though churches have no more authority one over another, than one apoſtle had over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet as one apoſtle might admoniſh another, ſo may one church admoniſh another, and yet without uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. In which caſe, if the church that lieth under offence, do not hearken to the church that doth admoniſh her, the church is to acquaint other neighbour churches with that offence which the offending church ſtill lieth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, together with the neglect of their brotherly admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given unto them; whereupon thoſe other churches are to join in ſeconding the admonition formerly given; and if ſtill the offending church continue in obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and impenitency, they may forbear communion with them, and are to proceed to make uſe of the help of a ſynod, or council of neighbour churches walking orderly (if a greater cannot conveniently be had) for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. If they hear not the ſynod, the ſynod having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared them too obſtinate, particular churches approving and accepting the judgment of the ſynod, are to declare the ſentence of non-communion reſpectively concerning them; and thereupon, out of a religious care to keep their own communion pure, they may juſtly withdraw themſelves from participation with them at the Lord's table, and from ſuch other acts of holy communion as the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of churches doth otherwiſe allow and require. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, if any members of ſuch a church as live under

public offence, do not conſent to the offence of the church, but do in due ſort bear witneſs againſt it, they are ſtill to be received to wonted communion; for it is not equal that the innocent ſhould ſuffer with the offenſive.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y of communion of churches is by way of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation. The members of one church occaſionally coming to another, we willingly admit them to partake with us at the Lord's table, it being the ſeal of our communion, not only with Chriſt, nor only with the members of our own churches, but alſo of all the churches of the ſaints; in which regard we refuſe not to baptize their children preſented to us, if either their own miniſter, be abſent, or ſuch a fruit of holy fellowſhip be deſired with us. In like caſe, ſuch churches as are furniſhed with more miniſters than one, do willingly afford one of their own miniſters to ſupply the place of an abſent or ſick miniſter of another church for a needful ſeaſon. 5. A fifth way of church communion, is by way of recommendation, when the member of one church hath occaſion to reſide in another church, if but for a ſeaſon, we commend him to their watchful fellowſhip, by letters of recommendation, but if he be called to ſettle his abode there, we commit him according to his deſire, to the fellowſhip of their covenant, by letters of diſmiſſion. 6. A ſixth way of church communion is in caſe of need, to miniſter relief and ſuccour one unto another, either of able members, to furniſh them with officers, or of outward ſupport, to the neceſſities of poorer churches, as did the churches of the Gentiles contribute liberally to the poor ſaints at Jeruſalem. Cant. 8.8. Acts 15.2, 6, 22, 23. Ezek. 34.4. Gal. 2.11 to 14. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. by proportion. Gen. 18.25. 1 Cor. 12.13. Rom. 16.1. Acts 18.27. and 11.22, 29. Rom. 13.26, 27.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When a company of believers purpoſe to gather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a church fellowſhip, it is requiſite for their ſafer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:012626_0223_0F8B93434400AC68"/>
and the maintaining the communion of churches, that they ſignify their intent unto the neighbour churches, walking according unto the order of the goſpel, and deſire their preſence, and help, and right hand of fellowſhip, which they ought readily to give unto them, when there is no juſt cauſe to except againſt their proceedings. Gal. 2.1, 2. and 9. by proportion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Beſides theſe ſeveral ways of communion, there is alſo a way of propagation of churches: when a church ſhall grow too numerous, it is a way, and fit ſeaſon to propagate one church out of another, by ſending forth ſuch of their members as are willing to remove, and to procure ſome officers to them, as may enter with them into church eſtate amongſt themſelves. As bees, when the hive is too full, iſſue forth by ſwarms, and are gathered into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hives, ſo the churches of Chriſt may do the ſame upon like neceſſity; and therein hold forth to them the right hand of fellowſhip, both in their gathering into a church, and in the ordination of their officers, Iſa. 40.20. Cant. 8.8.9.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. Of Synods.</head>
                  <p>SYNODS orderly aſſembled, and rightly proceeding according to the pattern, Acts 15, we acknowledge as the ordinance of Chriſt; and tho' not abſolutely neceſſary to the being, yet many times, through the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of men, and preverſeneſs of times, neceſſary to the well-being of churches, for the eſtabliſhment of truth and peace therein, Acts 15.2 to 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Synods being ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies, are therefore made up of ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical cauſes. The next efficient cauſe of them under Chriſt, is the power of the churches, ſending forth their elders and other meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, who being met together in the name of Chriſt, are the matter of a ſynod: and they in arguing, debating, and determining matters of religion according to the word, and publiſhing the ſame to the churches it concerneth, do put forth the proper and formal acts of a ſynod, to the
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:012626_0224_0F8B9344046B7C28"/>
conviction of errors and hereſies, and the eſtabliſhment of truth and peace in the churches, which is the end of a ſynod, Acts 15.2, 3, 6, 7, to 23, 31. and 16.4, 15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Magiſtrates have power to call a ſynod, by calling to the churches to ſend forth their elders, and other meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, to counſel, and aſſiſt them in matters of religion; but yet the conſtituting of a ſynod is a church act, and may be tranſacted by the churches even when civil magiſtrates may be enemies to the churches, and church-aſſemblies, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.4, 5, to 11. <hi>Acts.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It belongeth unto ſynods and councils, to debate and determine controverſies of faith, and caſes of conſcience; to clear from the word holy directions for the holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and good government of the church; to bear witneſs againſt male adminiſtration and corruption in doctrine or manners in any particular church; and to give directions for the reformation thereof; not to exerciſe church cenſures in way of diſcipline, nor any other act of church authority or juriſdiction, which that preſidential ſynod did forbear, <hi>Acts.</hi> 15.1, 2, 6, 7. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15, 13. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.6, 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.24, 28, 29.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſynods directions and determinations ſo far as conſonant to the word of God, are to be received with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and ſubmiſſion; not only fort heir agreement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (which is the principal ground thereof, and without which they bind not at all) but alſo ſecondarily for the power where by they are made, as being an ordinance of God appointed thereunto in his word, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Becauſe it is difficult, if not impoſſible, for many churches to come together in one place, in all their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers univerſally; therefore they may aſſemble by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates or meſſengers; as the church at <hi>Antioch</hi> went not all to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but ſome ſelect men for that purpoſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none are or ſhould be more fit to know the ſtate of the churches nor to adviſe of ways for the good thereof, than elders; therefore it is fit that in the choice of the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers for ſuch aſſemblies they have ſpecial reſpect unto ſuch; yet inaſmuch as not only Paul and Barnabas, but certain others alſo were ſent to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from <hi>Antioch,</hi> and when they were come to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not only the
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:012626_0225_0F8B9344CF3F80E0"/>
apoſtles and elders, but other brethren alſo do aſſemble and meet about the matter; therefore ſynods are to conſiſt both of elders, and other church members endued with gifts, and ſent by the churches, not excluding the preſence of any brethren in the churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.2, 22, 23.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVII. Of the civil magiſtrates power in matters eccleſiaſtical.</head>
                  <p>IT is lawful, profitable and neceſſary for chriſtians to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelves together into church eſtate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to exerciſe all the ordinances of Chriſt, according unto the word, although the conſent of the magiſtrate could not be had thereunto; becauſe the apoſtles and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in their time did frequently thus practiſe, when the magiſtrates all of them being <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> and moſt perſecuting enemies, would give no countenance or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſuch matters, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 47. and 4.1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Church government ſtands in no oppoſition to civil government of common-wealths, nor any way intrencheth upon the authority of civil magiſtrates in their juriſdiction; nor any whit weakneth their hands in governing, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrengtheneth them, furthereth the people in yielding more hearty and conſcionable obedience unto them whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome ill affected perſons to the ways of Chriſt have ſuggeſted, to alienate the affection of kings and princes from the ordinances of Chriſt; as if the kingdom of Chriſt in his church could not riſe and ſtand without the falling and weakening of their government, which is alſo of Chriſt; whereas the contrary is moſt true, that they may both ſtand together and flouriſh, the one being helpful unto the other, in their diſtinct and due adminiſtrations. <hi>John</hi> 18.36. <hi>Acts</hi> 25.8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The power and authority of magiſtrates is not for the reſtraining of churches, or any other good works, but for helping in and furthering thereof; and therefore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and countenance of magiſtrates, when it may be had,
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:012626_0226_0F8B934586EE5678"/>
is not to be ſlighted or lightly eſteemed; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, it is part of that honor due to chriſtian magiſtrates to deſire and crave there conſent and approbation therein, which being obtained, the churches may then proceed in their way with more encouragement and comfort. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13, 4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is not in the power of magiſtrates to compel their ſubjects to become church members, and to partake at the Lord's table; for the prieſts are reproved that brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ones into the ſanctuary: Then as it was unlawful for the prieſt, ſo it is as unl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wful to be done by civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, thoſe whom the church caſt out it they were in, the magiſtrate ought not to thruſt them into the church, nor to hold them therein, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As it is unlawful for church officers to meddle with the ſword of the magiſtrate, ſo it is unlawful for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to meddle with the work proper to church officers. The acts of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> who were not only princes, but prophets, were extraordinary, therefore not imitable.

                  <p n="6">6. It is the duty of the magiſtrate to take care of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, and to improve his civil authority for the obſerving of the duties commanded in the firſt, as well as for obſerving of the duties commanded in the ſecond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

                  <p n="7">7. The objects of the power of the magiſtrate are not things meerly inward, and ſo not ſubject to his cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance and view, as unbelief, hardneſs of heart, erroneous opinions not vented, but only ſuch things as are acted by the outward man; neither is their power to be exerciſed in commanding ſuch acts of the outward man, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neglect thereof; as are but meer inventions &amp; devices of men, but about ſuch acts as are commanded and forbidden in the word; yea, ſuch as the word doth clearly determine, though not always clearly to the judgment of the magiſtrate or others, yet clearly in itſelf.

                  <head>A PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE Lord Jeſus Chriſt witneſſed a good confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the time when he ſaid, To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the truth; and be taketh notice of it, to the praiſe and high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the church in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> that they held faſt his name, and had not denied his Faith. Nor are they worthy the name of chriſtians, who, though the Lord by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence call them publickly to own the truth they have profeſſed, ſhall nevertheleſs refuſe to declare what they believe, as to thoſe great and fundamental principles in the doctrine of Chriſt, the knowledge whereof is neceſſary unto ſalvation. We find how ready the apoſtle was to make A Confeſſion of his Faith; though for that hope's ſake he was accuſed and put in chains. And the martyr's of Jeſus, who have laid down their lives in bearing witneſs to the truth, againſt the infidelity, idolatry, hereſy, apoſtacy of the world, when Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, Arian, or overſpread with Popiſh darkneſs: Having their feet ſhod with the preparation of the goſpel of peace, were free and forward in their teſtimony, confeſſing the truth, yea, ſealing it with their blood. With the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth unto righteouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation, <hi>Rom. 10.10.</hi> Nor is there a greater evidence of being in a ſtate of ſalvation, than ſuch a confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if made in times or places where men are expoſed to utmoſt ſuffering upon that account. <hi>1 John, 4.15.</hi> And if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith be, in ſome caſes, of ſuch importance and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as hath been expreſſed; it muſt needs be in itſelf, a work pleaſing in the ſight of God, for his ſervants to declare unto the world, what thoſe principles of truth are, which they have received, and are (by the help of Chriſt) purpoſed to live and die in the ſtedfaſt profeſſion of. Some of the Lord's worthies have been of renown among his people in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect;
<pb facs="unknown:012626_0234_0F8B934D0C73FD00"/>
eſpecially <hi>Iraenius</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> of old, and of latter times <hi>Beza,</hi> all whoſe (not to mention others) Confeſſions, with the advantage which the church of God hath received thereby, are famouſly known.</p>
                  <p>And it muſt needs tend much to the honor of the dear and bleſſed name of the Lord Jeſus, in caſe many churches do join together in their teſtimony. How ſignally the Lord hath owned the Confeſſion of the four general Synods or Councils for the ſuppreſſion of the hereſies of thoſe times, needs not to be ſaid, ſince no man can be ignorant thereof, that hath made it his concern to be acquainted with things of this nature. The Confeſſion of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and of the reformed proteſtant churches abroad, (which alſo, to ſhew what harmony in reſpect of doctrine there is among all ſincere profeſſors of the truth, have been publiſhed in one volume) all theſe have been of ſingular uſe, not only to thoſe that lived in the ages when theſe declarations were emitted, but unto poſterity, yea, unto this day.</p>
                  <p>There have been ſome who have reflected upon theſe New-Engliſh churches for our defect in this matter, as if our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were unknown; whereas it is well-known, that as to matters of doctrine we agree with other r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>formed churches: Nor was it that, but what concerns worſhip and diſcipline, that cauſed our fathers to come into the wilderneſs, while it was a land not ſown, that ſo they might have liberty to practiſe accordingly. And it is a ground of holy rejoicing before the Lord, that now there is no advantage left for thoſe that may be diſſaffected towards us, to object any thing of that nature againſt us. For it hath pleaſed the only wiſe God ſo to diſpoſe in his Providence, as that the elders and meſſengers of the churches in the colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> did, by the call and encouragement of the honored General Court, meet together <hi>Sept. 10, 1679.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſynod at their 2d ſeſſion, which was <hi>May 12, 1680,</hi> conſulted and conſidered of a Confeſſion of Faith. That which was conſented unto by the elders and meſſengers of the
<pb facs="unknown:012626_0235_0F8B934DDC885240"/>
congregational churches in <hi>England,</hi> who met at at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> (being for the moſt part, ſome ſmall variations except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſame with that which was agreed upon firſt by the Aſſembly at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and was approved of by the Synod at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> Anno <hi>1648,</hi> as alſo by a General Aſſembly in <hi>Scotland</hi>) was twice publickly read, examined and approved of: that little variation which we have made from the one, in compliance with the other may be ſeen by thoſe who pleaſe to compare them. But we have (for the main) choſen to expreſs ourſelves in the words of thoſe Reverend Aſſemblies, that ſo we might not only with one heart, but with one mouth glorify God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>As to what concerns church-government, we refer to the Platform of Diſcipline agreed upon by the elders and meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of theſe churches, Anno <hi>1648,</hi> and ſolemnly owned and confirmed by the late Synod.</p>
                  <p>What hours of temptation may overtake theſe churches, is not for us to ſay. Only the Lord doth many times ſo order things, that when his people have made a good Confeſſion, they ſhall be put upon the trial one way or other, to ſee whether they have (or who among them hath not) been ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in what they have done.</p>
                  <p>The LORD grant that the loins of our minds may be ſo girt about with truth, that we may be able to withſtand in the evil day, and having done all, to ſtand.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. Of the holy Scripture.</head>
                  <p>ALTHOUGH the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence, do ſo far manifeſt the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wiſdom and power of God, as to leave men unexcuſable; yet are they not ſufficient to give that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and of his will, which is neceſſary unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Therefore it pleaſed the Lord at ſundry times, and in diverſe manners to reveal himſelf, and to declare that his will unto his church; &amp; afterwards for the better preſerving and propagating of the truth, and for the more ſure eſtabliſhment and comfort of the church againſt the corruption of the fleſh, and the malice of ſatan and of the world, to commit the ſame wholly to writing: Which maketh the holy ſcripture to be moſt neceſſary; thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ways of God's revealing his will unto his people being now ceaſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Under the name of holy ſcripture, or the word of God written, are now contained all the the books of the old and new teſtament, which are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Of the Old Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Geneſis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joſhua, Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Eſther, Job, Pſalms, Proverbs, Eccleſiaſtes, The Song of Songs, Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hoſea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah, Malachi.</p>
                  <p>Of the New Teſtament.</p>

                     </gap>deth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth it ſelf) the author thereof; and therefore it is to be received, becauſe it is the word of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We may be moved and induced by the teſtimony of the church, to an high and reverened eſteem of the holy ſcripture. And the heavenlineſs of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majeſty of the ſtyle, the conſent of all the parts, the ſcope of the whole (which is, to give all glory to God) the full diſcovery it makes of the only way of mans ſalvation, the many other incomparable excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it ſelf to be the word of God; yet notwithſtanding, our full preſwaſion and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the infallible truth and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the holy ſpirit, bearing witneſs by and with the word in our hearts.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The whole counſel of God concerning all things neceſſary for his own glory, man's ſalvation, faith and and life, is either ſet down in ſcripture, or by good and neceſſary conſequence may be deduced from ſcripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be neceſſary for the ſaving underſtanding of ſuch things as are revealed in the world: And that there are ſome circumſtances concerning the worſhip of God and government of the church, common to human actions and ſocieties, which are to be ordered by the light of nature, and chriſtian prudence, according to the general rules of the word, which are always to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. All things in ſcripture are not alike plain in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor alike clear unto all: Yet thoſe things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known, believed and obſerved for ſalvation, are ſo clearly propounded and opened in ſome place of
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:012626_0238_0F8B9350131B1530"/>
ſcripture or other, that not only the learned, but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, in a due uſe of the ordinary means, may attain unto a ſufficient underſtanding of them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The old teſtament in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> (which was the native language of the people of God of old) and the new teſtament in <hi>Greek,</hi> (which at the time of writing of it was moſt generally known to the nations) being immediately inſpired by God, &amp; by his ſingular care &amp; providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical; ſo as in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of religion, the church is finally to appeal unto them. But becauſe theſe original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto and intereſt in the ſcriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read and ſearch them; therefore they are to be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, that the word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worſhip him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the ſcriptures may have hope.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The infallible rule of interpretation of ſcripture, is the ſcripture it ſelf; and therefore when there is a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the true and full ſenſe of any ſcripture (which is not manifold, but one) it muſt be ſearched and known by other places, that ſpeak more clearly.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The ſupream judge by which all controverſies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men and private ſpirits, are to be examined, and in whoſe ſentence we are to reſt, can be no other, but the holy ſcriptures delivered by the Spirit; into which ſcripture ſo delivered, our faith is finally reſolved.</p>

                  <p>THERE is but one only living and true God; who is infinite in being and perfection, a moſt pure Spirit, inviſible, without body, parts, or paſſions, immutable, immenſe, eternal, incomprehenſible, almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, moſt wiſe, moſt holy, moſt free, moſt abſolute, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things according to the counſel of his own immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and moſt righteous will, for his own glory, moſt

loving, gracious, merciful, long-ſuffering, abundant in goodneſs and truth, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin, the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him, and withal, moſt juſt and terrible in his judgments, hating all ſin, and who will by no means clear the guilty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God hath all life, glory, goodneſs, bleſſedneſs, in, and of himſelf; and is alone in, and unto himſelf, all-ſufficient, not ſtanding in need of any creatures which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them, but only manifeſting his own glory in, by, unto and upon them. He is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things; and hath moſt ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatſoever himſelf pleaſeth: In his ſight all things are open and manifeſt, his knowledge is infinite, infallible and independent upon the creature, ſo as noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to him contingent or uncertain. He is moſt holy in all his counſels, in all his works, and in all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. To him is due from angels and men, and every other creature, whatſoever worſhip, ſervice or obedience, as creatures, they owe unto the creator, and whatever he is further pleaſed to require of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the unity of the God-head there be three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of one ſubſtance, power, and eternity, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt: The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is of none, neither begotten, nor proceeding: The Son is eternally begotten of the Father: The Holy Ghoſt eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son. Which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and comfortable dependance upon him.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of God's eternal Decree.</head>
                  <p>GOD from all eternity did by the moſt wiſe and holy counſel of his own will, freely and unchangably or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain whatſoever comes to paſs: Yet ſo, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by neither is God the author of ſin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures, nor is the liberty or contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of ſecond cauſes taken away, but rather eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Although God knows whatſoever may or can come to paſs upon all ſuppoſed conditions, yet hath he not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:012626_0240_0F8B935197C62E80"/>
any thing, becauſe he foreſaw it as future, or as that which would come to paſs upon ſuch conditions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the decree of God for the manifeſtation of his glory, ſome men and angels are predeſtinated unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and others fore-ordained to everlaſting death.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Theſe angels and men thus predeſtinated, and fore-ordained, are particularly and unchangeably deſigned, and their number is ſo certain and definite, that it cannot be either increaſed or diminiſhed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thoſe of mankind that are predeſtinated unto life, God before the foundation of the world was laid, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his eternal and immutable purpoſe, and the ſecret counſel and good pleaſure of his will, hath choſen in Chriſt unto everlaſting glory, out of his meer free grace and love, without any foreſight of faith or good works, or perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as conditions or cauſes moving him thereunto, and all to the praiſe of his glorious grace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, ſo hath he by the eternal and moſt free purpoſe of his will fore-ordained all the means thereunto: Wherefore they who are elected, being fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> are redeemed by Chriſt, are effectually called unto faith in Chriſt by his Spirit working in due ſeaſon, are juſtified, adopted, ſanctified, and kept by his power, through faith, unto ſalvation. Neither are any other redeemed by Chriſt, or effectually called, juſtified, adopted, ſanctified and ſaved, but the elect only.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The reſt of mankind God has pleaſed, according to the unſearchable counſel of his own will, whereby h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="7">7. The doctrine of this high myſtery of predeſtination, is to be handled with ſpecial prudence and care, that men attending the will of God revealed in his word, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience thereunto, may from the certainty of their effectual vocation, be aſſured of their eternal election. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="2">2. The Son of God, the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, being very and eternal God, of one ſubſtance, and equal with the Father, did, when the fullneſs of time was come, take upon him mans nature, with all the eſſential proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and common infirmities thereof, yet without ſin, being conceived by the power of the holy Ghoſt in the womb of the virgin Mary, of her ſubſtance: So that two whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and diſtinct natures, the godhead and the manhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were inſeperably joined together in one perſon, without converſion, compoſition, or confuſion; which perſon, is very God and very man, yet one Chriſt, the only mediator between God and man.</p>

When God converts a ſinner, and tranſlates him into a ſtate of grace, he freeth him from his natural bondage under ſin, and by his grace alone enables him freely to will and to do that which is ſpiritually good; yet ſo, as that by reaſon of his remaining corruption, he doth not perfectly nor only will that which is good, but doth alſo will that which is evil.</p>

                  <p>THOSE whom God effectually calleth, he alſo freely juſtifieth, not by infuſing righteouſneſs into them, but by pardoning their ſins, and by accounting and accepting their perſons as righteous, not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Chriſt's ſake alone; nor by imputing faith itſelf, the act of believing, or any other evangelical obedience to them, as their righteouſneſs, but by imputing Chriſt's active obedience unto the whole law, and paſſive obedience in his ſufferings and death, for their whole and ſole righteouſneſs, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and reſting on him and his righteouſneſs by faith; which faith they have not of themſelves, it is the gift of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith thus receiving and reſting on Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, is the alone inſtrument of juſtification; yet it is not alone in the perſon juſtified, but is ever accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with all other ſaving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt by his obedience and death did fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the debt of all thoſe that are juſtified, and did by the ſacrifice of himſelf, in the blood of his croſs, undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſtead the penalty due unto them, make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, real and full ſatisfaction to God's juſtice in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half: Yet inaſmuch as he was given by the Father for them, and his obedience and ſatisfaction accepted in their ſtead, and both freely, not for any thing in them, their juſtification is only of free grace, that both the exact juſtice and rich grace of God might be glorified in the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God did from all eternity decree to juſtify all the elect, and Chriſt did in the fullneſs of time die for their ſins and riſe again for their juſtification: Nevertheleſs, they are not juſtified perſonally, until the holy Spirit doth in due time actually apply Chriſt unto them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God doth continue to forgive the ſins of thoſe that are juſtified; and although they can never fall from the ſtate of juſtification, yet they may by their ſins fall under God's fatherly diſpleaſure: And in that condition they

                  <p n="6">6. The juſtification of believers under the old teſtament was in all theſe reſpects one and the ſame with the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of believers under the new teſtament.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. By this faith a chriſtian believeth to be true what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ravealed in the word, for the authority of God himſelf ſpeaking therein, and acteth differently upon that which each particular paſſage thereof containeth, yielding obedience to the commands, trembling at the threatnings, and embracing the promiſes of God for this life, and that which is to come. But the principal acts of ſaving faith are accepting, receiving, and reſting upon Chriſt alone, for juſtification, ſanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This faith, although it be different in degrees, and may be weak or ſtrong, yet it is in the leaſt degree of it different in the kind or nature of it (as is all other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace) from the faith and common grace of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary believers; and therefore, though it may be many times aſſailed and weakned, yet it gets the victory, growing up in many to the attainment of a full aſſurance through Chriſt, who is both the author and finiſher of our faith.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XV. Of Repentance unto Life and Salvation.</head>
                  <p>SUCH of the elect as are converted at riper years, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometime lived in the ſtate of nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſerved divers luſts and pleaſures, God in their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual calling giveth them repentance unto life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas there is none that doth good, and ſinneth not, and the beſt of men may through the power and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of their corruptions dwelling in them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall into great ſins and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; God hath in the covenant of grace mercifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that believers ſo ſinning and falling, be renewed through repentance unto ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This ſaving repentance is an evangelical grace, whereby a perſon being by the holy Ghoſt made ſenſible of the manifold evils of his ſin, doth by faith in Chriſt humble himſelf for it with godly ſorrow, deteſtation of it, and ſelf-abhorrency, praying for pardon and ſtrength of grace, with a purpoſe and endeavor by ſupplies of the Spirit, to walk before God unto all well-pleaſing in all things.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As repentance is to be continued through the whole courſe of our lives, upon the account of the body of death, and the motions thereof; ſo it is every man's duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of his particular known ſins, particularly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Such is the proviſion which God hath made thro' Chriſt in the covenant of grace, for the preſervation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers unto ſalvation, that although there is no ſin ſo ſmall, but it deſerves damnation, yet there is no ſin ſo great, that it ſhall bring damnation on them who truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; which makes the conſtant preaching of repentance neceſſary.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. Of good Works.</head>
                  <p>GOOD works are only ſuch as God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his holy word, and not ſuch as without the warrant thereof are deviſed by men out of blind zeal, or upon any pretence of good intentions.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="255" facs="unknown:012626_0252_0F8B935B4F87C4E0"/>2. Theſe good works done in obedience to God's commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and living faith, and by them believers manifeſt their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, ſtrengthen their aſſurance, edify their brethren, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the profeſſion of the goſpel, ſtop the mouths of the adverſaries, and glorify God, whoſe workmanſhip they are, created in Chriſt Jeſus thereunto, that having their fruit unto holineſs, they may have the end eternal life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their ability to do good works is not at all of themſelves, but wholly from the Spirit of Chriſt: And that they may be enabled thereunto, beſides the graces they have already received, there is required an actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the ſame holy Spirit to work in them to will and to do, of his good pleaſure; yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty, unleſs upon a ſpecial motion of the Spirit, but they ought to be diligent in ſtirring up the grace of God that is in them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They who in their obedience attain to the greateſt height which is poſſible in this life, are ſo far from being able to ſupererogate, and to do more than God requires, as that they fall ſhort of much, which in duty they are bound to do.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We cannot by our beſt works merit pardon of ſin, or eternal life at the hand of God, by reaſon of the great diſproportion that is between them, and the glory to come; and the infinite diſtance that is between us, and God, whom by them we can neither profit, nor ſatisfy for the debt of our former ſins; but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable ſervants: And becauſe as they are good, they proceed from his Spirit, and as they are wrought by us, they are defiled and mixed with ſo much weakneſs and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they cannot endure the ſeverity of God's judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Yet notwithſtanding, the perſons of believers being accepted through Chriſt, their good works alſo are accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, not as though they were in this life wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable and unreproveable in God's ſight, but that he looking upon them in his Son is pleaſed to accept and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that which is ſincere, although accompanied with many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Works done by unregenerate men, although for the matter of them, they may be things which God commands, and of good uſe both to themſelves and others; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they proceed not from an heart purified by faith, nor are done in a right manner, according to the word, nor to a right end, the glory of God; they are therefore ſinful, and cannot pleaſe God, nor make a man meet to receive grace from God; and yet their neglect of them is more ſinful and diſpleaſing to God.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVII. Of the Perſeverance of the Saints.</head>
                  <p>THEY whom God hath accepted in his beloved, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called and ſanctified by his Spirit, can neither totally nor finally fall away from the ſtate of grace, but ſhall certainly perſevere therein to the end, and be eternally ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This perſeverance of the ſaints depends not upon their own free-will, but upon the immutability of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of election, from the free and unchangeable love of God the Father, upon the efficacy of the merit and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and union with him, the oath of God, the abiding of his Spirit, and the ſeed of God within them, and the nature of the covenant of grace, from all which ariſeth alſo the certainty and infallibility thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And though they may through the temptation of Satan, and of the world, the prevalency of corruption re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in them, and the neglect of the means of their preſervation, fall into grievous ſins, and for a time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue therein, whereby they incur God's diſpleaſure, and grieve his holy Spirit, come to have their graces and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts impaired, have their hearts hardened, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences wounded, hurt and ſcandalize others, and bring temporal judgments upon themſelves; yet they are and ſhall be kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVIII. Of the Aſſurance of Grace and Salvation.</head>
                  <p>ALTHOUGH temporary believers, and other unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men may vainly deceive themſelves with falſe hopes and carnal preſumptions of being in the favor of God, and ſtate of ſalvation, which hope of theirs ſhall periſh, yet ſuch as truly believe on the Lord Jeſus, and love him in ſincerity, endeavoring to walk in all good conſcience before him, may in this life be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly aſſured that they are in a ſtate of grace, and may rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, which hope ſhall never make them aſhamed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This certainty is not a bare conjectural and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſwaſion, grounded upon a fallible hope, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſurance of faith, founded on the blood and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, revealed in the goſpel, and alſo upon the inward evidence of thoſe graces, unto which promiſes are made, and on the immediate witneſs of the Spirit, teſtifying our adoption, and as a fruit thereof, leaving the heart more humble and holy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This infallible aſſurance doth not ſo belong to the eſſence of faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties before he be partaker of it; yet being enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may without extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary revelation, in the right uſe of ordinary means attain thereunto: And therefore it is the duty of every one to give all diligence to make his calling and election ſure, that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt, in love and thankfulneſs to God, and in ſtrength and chearfulneſs in the duties of obedience, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>CHAP. XIX. Of the Law of God.</head>
                  <p>GOD gave to <hi>Adam</hi> a law of univerſal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence written in his heart, and a particular precept of not eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, as a covenant of works, by which he bound him and all his poſterity to perſonal, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, exact and perpetual obedience, promiſing life upon the fulfilling, and threatened death upon the breach of it, and endued him with power and ability to keep it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3.

not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but alſo in reſpect of the authority of God the creator, who gave it: Neither doth Chriſt in the goſpel any way diſſolve, but much ſtrengthen this obligation.</p>

                  <p>THE covenant of works being broken by ſin, and made unprofitable unto life, God was pleaſed to give unto the elect the promiſe of Chriſt, the ſeed of the woman, as the means of calling them, and begetting in them faith and repentance: In this promiſe, the goſpel, as to the ſubſtance of it, was revealed, and was therein effectual for the converſion and ſalvation of ſinners.</p>

This promiſe of Chriſt, and ſalvation by him, is revealed only in and by the word of God; neither do the works of creation or providence, with the light of nature, make diſcovery of Chriſt, or of grace by him, ſo much as in a general or obſcure way; much leſs that men deſtitute of the revelation of him by the promiſe or goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſhould be enabled thereby to attain ſaving faith or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>

The revelation of the goſpel unto ſinners made in divers times, and by ſundry parts, with the addition of promiſes and precepts for the obedience required therein, as to the nations and perſons to whom it is granted, is meerly of the ſovereign will and good pleaſure of God, not being annexed by virtue of any promiſe to the due im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of men's natural abilities, by virtue of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon light received without it, which none ever did make, or can ſo do: And therefore in all ages the preaching of the goſpel hath been granted unto perſons and nations, as to the extent or ſtraitning of it, in great variety, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the counſel of the will of God.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Prayer with thankſgiving, being one ſpecial part of natural worſhip, is by God required of all men; but that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son, by the help of his Spirit, according to his will, with underſtanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, &amp; perſeverence: And when with others in a known tongue.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Prayer is to be made for things lawful, and for all ſorts of men living, or that ſhall live hereafter, but not for the dead, nor for thoſe of whom it may be known that they have ſinned the ſin unto death.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The reading of the ſcriptures, preaching &amp; hearing of the word of God, ſinging of pſalms, as alſo the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſtration of baptiſm and the Lords ſupper, are all parts of religious worſhip of God, to be performed in obedience unto God, with underſtanding, faith, reverence and godly fear. Solemn humilations with faſtings, and thankſgiving upon ſpecial occaſions, are in their ſeveral times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be uſed in an holy and religious manner.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Neither prayer, nor any other part of religious worſhip, is now under the goſpel either tied unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is preformed, or towards which it is directed: But God is to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped every where in ſpirit and in truth, as in private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies daily, and in ſecret each one by himſelf, ſo more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly in the public aſſemblies, which are not careleſly nor willfully to be neglected, or forſaken, when God by word or providence calleth thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As it is of the law of nature, that in general a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time by Gods appointment be ſet apart for the worſhip of God; ſo by his word in a poſitive, moral and perpetual commandment, binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in ſeven for a ſabbath to be kept holy unto him, which from the beginning of the world to the reſurrection of Chriſt, was the laſt day of the week, and from the reſurrection of Chriſt, was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the firſt day of the week, which in ſcripture is called the Lord's day, and is to be continued to the end of the world as the chriſtian ſabbath, the obſervation of the laſt day of the week being aboliſhed.</p>

This ſabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men after a due preparing of their hearts, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their common affairs beforehand, do not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an holy reſt all the day from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldy employments and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but alſo are taken up the whole time in the publick and private exerciſes of his worſhip, and in the duties of neceſſity and mercy.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXIII. Of Lawful Oaths and Vows.</head>
                  <p>A Lawful oath is a part of religious worſhip, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the perſon ſwearing in truth, righteouſneſs and judgment, ſolemnly calleth God to witneſs what he aſſerteth or promiſeth, and to judge him according to the truth and falſhood of what he ſweareth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The name of God only is that by which men ought to ſwear, and therein it is to be uſed with all holy fear and reverence: Therefore to ſwear vainly or raſhly by that glorious and dreadful name, or to ſwear at all by any other thing, is ſinful, and to be abhorred: Yet as in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of weight and moment an oath is warranted by the word of God, under the new teſtament, as well as under the old; ſo a lawful oath, being impoſed by lawful autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in ſuch matters, ought to be taken.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whoſoever taketh an oath warranted by the word of God, ought duly to conſider the weightineſs of ſo ſolemn an act, and therein to avouch nothing but what he is fully perſwaded is the truth: Neither may any man bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by oath to any thing, but what is good &amp; juſt, and what he believeth ſo to be, and what he is able and reſolved to perform. Yet it is a ſin to refuſe an oath touching any thing that is good and juſt, being lawfully impoſed by authority.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. An oath is to be taken in the plain and common ſenſe of the words, without equivocation, or mental reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It cannot oblige to ſin, but in any thing not ſinful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, it binds to performance, although to a mans own hurt; nor is it to be violated, although made to Hereticks or Infidels.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. Popiſh monaſtical vows of perpetual ſingle life, profeſſed poverty, and regular obedience, are ſo far from being degrees of higher perfection, that they are ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and ſinful ſnares, in which no chriſtian may intangle himſelf.</p>

It is the duty of people to pray for magiſtrates, to honor their perſons, to pay them tribute and other dues, to obey their lawful commands, and to be ſubject to their authority for conſcience ſake. Infidelity, or difference in religion doth not make void the magiſtrates juſt and legal authority, nor free the people from their due obedience to him: From which eccleſiaſtical perſons are not exempted, much leſs hath the Pope any power or juriſdiction over them in their dominions, or over any of their people, and leaſt of all to deprive them of their dominions or lives, if he ſhall judge them to be hereticks, or upon any orher pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatſoever.</p>

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="3">3. Dipping of the perſon into the water is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but baptiſm is rightly adminiſtered by pouring or ſprinkling water upon the perſon.</p>

Although it be a great ſin to contemn or neglect this ordinance, yet grace and ſalvation are not ſo inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annexed to it, as that no perſon can be regenerated or ſaved without it; or that all that are baptized are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly regenerated.</p>

                  <p>OUR Lord Jeſus in the night wherein he was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inſtituted the ſacrament of his body and blood, called the Lord's ſupper, to be obſerved in his chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the end of the world, for the perpetual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and ſhewing forth of the ſacrifice of himſelf in his death, the ſealing of all benefits thereof unto true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, their ſpiritual nouriſhment and growth in him, their further engagement in and to all duties which they owe unto him, and to be a bond and pledge of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, and with each other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this ſacrament Chriſt is not offered up to his Father, nor any real ſacrifice made at all for remiſſion of ſin of the quick or dead, but only a memorial of that one offering up of himſelf upon the croſs once for all, and a ſpiritual oblation of all poſſible praiſe unto God for the ſame; ſo that the popiſh ſacrifice of the maſs (as they call it) is moſt abominable injurious to Chriſt's own only ſacrifice, the alone propitiation for all the ſins of the elect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord Jeſus hath in this ordinance appointed his miniſters to declare his word of inſtitution to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to pray and bleſs the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to ſet them apart from a common to an holy uſe, and to take and brake the bread, to take the cup, and (they communicating alſo themſelves) to give both to the communicants, but to none who are not then preſent in the congregation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Private maſſes, or receiving the ſacrament by a prieſt, or any other alone, as likewiſe the denial of the cup to the people, worſhipping the elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them for any pretended religious uſe, are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of this ſacrament, and to the inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The outward elements in this ſacrament duly ſet apart for the uſes ordained by Chriſt, have ſuch relation to him crucified, as that truly, yet ſacramentally only, they are ſometimes called by the name of the things they repreſent, to wit, the body and blood of Chriſt; albeit in ſubſtance and nature they ſtill remain truly and only bread and wine as they were before.</p>

                     <pb n="270" facs="unknown:012626_0267_0F8B936C6B4729A0"/>6. That doctrine which maintains a change of the ſubſtance of bread and wine, into the ſubſtance of Chriſt's body and blood (commonly called tranſubſtantiation) by conſecration of a prieſt, or any other way, is repugnant not to the ſcripture alone, but even to common ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, overthroweth the nature of the ſacrament, and hath been, and is the cauſe of manifold ſuperſtitions, yea, of groſs idolatries.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Worthy receivers outwardly partaking of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible elements in this ſacrament, do then alſo inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but ſpiritully, receive and feed upon Chriſt crucified, and all benefits of his death; the body &amp; blood of Chriſt being then not corporally or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
