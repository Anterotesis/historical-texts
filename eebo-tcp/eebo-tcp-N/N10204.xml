            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOUR illuſtrious Performance exhibited to the Public on that moſt important queſtion, whether <hi>A—a</hi> was known to the A—s, reflects the higheſt honor not only to you but to your ancient, worthy, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Predeceſſors, and may well be tacked as an appendix to the wondrous Magnalia: Herein is verified that ſaying, Every genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grows wiſer and wiſer. It muſt afford am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſatisfaction not only to the inquiſitive Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman you mean to gratify, but fill the whole world with wonder and amazement at the groſs ſtupidity and indolence of many centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries paſt. Worthy and great Writers have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had envious opponents, and in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their great and ſerviceable diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and endeavors for the welfare of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity expect their attacks: But what ſhall we ſay of ſuch men who are continually emitting their contagious poiſon? You doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs remember the ſaying of the Poet,
<q>
                  <l>—Jam ſaevus apertam,</l>

away a man's good name was puniſhed with death. By this means the honor of families are ruined, and higheſt poſts and greateſt titles are rendered cheap and vile in the ſight of the people, the nobleſt virtues and moſt exalted parts expoſed to the contempt of the vicious and ignorant. And as this cruel prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice tends to the utter ſubverſion of all truth and humanity among us, it deſerves the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deteſtation, abhorrence and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all who have either the love of their country or the honor of their religion at heart.
<q>
                  <l>He who filches from me my good name,</l>

Theſe men together with their adherents who take pleaſure in reading them, may be juſtly ranked with the murderer and aſſaſſin. Every good man ſets as high a value on his name as on his life, and thoſe who privily aſſault the one would deſtroy the other, could they do it with the ſame ſecrecy and impunity. How many there are of this character among us public pamphets and news-papers mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly evince. <hi>O tempora! O mores!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not here remind you of the vaſt diſproportion between a libel againſt gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a private member of community. That you may be armed againſt an aſſault of this nature, remember that a private deſire of reſentment ſubdued denominates a man great, And that if you are led away with the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures or applauſes of men, when wiſdom ſhall be juſtified of her children you will be found deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of thoſe graces which adorn human nature.</p>
            <p>Having had an opportunity of knowing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012965_0005_0F9040FCC06A0C70"/>
the ſentiments, with regard to your motives, of a number of perſons of the above deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed character, I ſhall here preſent you a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of a few of them for your animadverſion.</p>
            <p>Some ſay you have catched an epidemical diſtemper called by <hi>Juvenal</hi> an itch of writing.</p>
            <p>Some ſay you have long in vain been in purſuit of a Diploma from <hi>North-Britain,</hi> but deſpiſing the modern method of obtaining it, continue impatiently ſeeking it through the channel of merit.</p>
            <p>Some ſay you expreſſed a huge fancy to be choſe Preſident of <hi>Harvard</hi>-College, and that you are now endeavoring to convince the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Electors of their egregious miſtake in not calling you to that important truſt.</p>
            <p>Some ſay you are encouraged from the effects of a former harangue on Liberty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of a boon.</p>
            <p>Others that one of the BEST of men is the intended object of your keen reſentment.</p>
            <p>Others that you are employed as a Popiſh Incendiary to foment ſtrife.</p>
            <p>Others are ſo ill natured as to ſay you are influenced by the fair Daughters of Liberty, on whoſe account you have already ſuffered a dire flogging at an eccleſiaſtical council.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cum multis aliis quae nunc preſcribere</hi> won't do.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the ſurmiſes of this rude herd with regard to your motives: Nor do I find their ſentiments with regard to your moſt excellent Performance more favorable; for in general they ſay, their expectations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed to the higheſt pitch (from the name of the Author and grandeur of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject)
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012965_0006_0F9040FF80564208"/>
they are as greatly diſappointed as at the production of <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s teaming mountain.</p>
            <p>You'll need abundance of grace and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience while I tranſcribe their arguments againſt you. The learned <hi>Keckerman,</hi> you ſay, judges that <hi>A—a</hi> was known to the A—ts. They ſay you begin well; but you ſhould have let them known he was infallible. You go on and ſay, if the matter be examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with judgment and proper care and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy, we ſhall find reaſon to believe that this large part of the world was <hi>really</hi> known to the A—ts.</p>
            <p>How honeſt <hi>Madoc</hi> came to take it into his head to viſit <hi>A—a</hi> you don't know, nor how he got out of it you can't tell; but he left monuments of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> language and cuſtoms. What of the language found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Indians</hi> you do not ſay; nor cuſtoms, whether eating when hungry, or Prieſts ſporting with their female pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But they aſk, upon ſuppoſition it were true that <hi>Madoc</hi> was in <hi>A—a,</hi> does that prove your point?</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Eſlotiland,</hi> it being agreed by all to be part of <hi>A</hi>—, as you ſay, the point muſt be given up, as it was diſcovered by the <hi>Frizeland</hi> Fiſhermen and the <hi>Polonian,</hi> ever ſince the year 1456: But they ſay you beg the queſtion, and it ſeems they had ſuch a knowledge of it, that they nor their neighbors ever troubled their heads any further with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>L. Anneus Seneca,</hi> you ſay, foretold that another world ſhould be found out, and in one of his dramatic pieces, ſays, <hi>Thyphis</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:012965_0007_0F9041009232EB98"/>
ſhould diſcover new worlds; but what that can be to your purpoſe they can't tell, unleſs he did diſcover new Worlds and <hi>A—a</hi> was included in the number.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Metellius Celer,</hi> Proconſul of <hi>Gaul</hi> having a number of <hi>Indians</hi> preſented him by the <hi>Suevian</hi> King, you imagine them waf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by violent gales of long continuance (they ſuppoſe in <hi>Indian</hi> canoes with large ſtores of proviſions) from <hi>Labrador</hi> or <hi>Newfoundland</hi> to the <hi>German</hi> ſhore. This ſeems to appear very ſtrange to 'em<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fancy they muſt have had wet hides now and then: But they ſeem inclined to think you are not well ſkill'd in the geography of this part of the globe, or with the turbulence of the atlantic ocean, and rather think they came from <hi>Lunar Heſperia,</hi> as frogs are ſaid to deſcend <hi>ex nubibus</hi> in a ſhower of rain. But ſuppoſe it true, what kind or degree of knowledge could the <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi> have had from thoſe rude ſavages?</p>
            <p>Mention, you ſay, has been made repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly of two iſlands called <hi>Atlantides,</hi> ten thouſand ſtadia diſtant from <hi>Lybia,</hi> and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Pliny, Heſperides,</hi> which the learned <hi>Ortellius</hi> ſuppoſes to be the iſlands of <hi>Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola</hi> and <hi>Cuba,</hi> and <hi>Diadorus Siculus</hi> tells us that the people of thoſe iſlands in habit places near the ocean, and therefore they muſt be the inhabitants of <hi>Cuba</hi> becauſe ſurrounded by the ocean.

               <hi>Plato</hi> has given particular account, you ſay, of the <hi>Atlantic Iſland,</hi> as publiſhed by <hi>Serranus,</hi> and of its being peopled by <hi>Neptune</hi> with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren begot of a mortal woman. They ſay one would think you were in one of your youthful freaks, and imagined the gods were ſubject to like paſſions with yourſelf. They ſay if they underſtand you right the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtands thus: <hi>Neptune</hi> was an ancient god, from his nature muſt have known the extent of his juriſdiction, the atlantic ocean being bound weſt on the <hi>A—an</hi> ſhore, of conſequence he muſt have known it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>A—a</hi> was known to the A—ts. That it received its name from King <hi>Atlas,</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> pillars was
<q>its eaſtern bounds; that it was a moſt broad iſland, had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful kings, and what elſe they cannot tell, except they had grievous wars, in which the <hi>Athenians</hi> oppos'd themſelves and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came conquerors. <hi>Plato,</hi> you ſay, is not ſingular herein, but <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it.</q>
They ſay you do them great honor. <hi>Plato</hi> ſays further, the greateſt iſland of the weſtern ocean was loſt, ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Azores</hi> and <hi>Canaries,</hi> and that there were

               <q>
                  <hi>Hoffman</hi> and <hi>Bochart</hi> are of opinion that <hi>Plato</hi>'s atlantis is to many <hi>A—a</hi>: And indeed, you ſay, if it was larger than <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> it looks as if it were really <hi>A—.</hi>
               </q>
Thus you are endeavoring to prove, that what is now and ever was unknown to

us a ſunken iſland was known, in order to prove that the terra firma on which we now dwell was known to the A.....ts.</p>
            <p>The probability ariſing from the accounts of paſſages of veſſels through the atlantic one way and the other muſt be barely probable, and of <hi>Endoxus</hi>'s voyage in the days of our Grandfathers to <hi>Cales</hi> muſt have been round by the edges as St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s voyages were, or by lucky chance.</p>
            <p>But now you call, they ſay, to a reſpectful notice of <hi>Hanno,</hi> the famous <hi>Carthagenian,</hi> who wrote Periplum, which has not been your lot to ſee, and therefore can make no obſervations. 'Tis a pity! But you ſay he gives an account of a voyage proſecuted around the coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> and found lands in the atlantic ocean. Surely it was a ſpae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical round, if he found any of the main of <hi>A.....a.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we muſt not omit to take notice, that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> muſt have had the knowledge of it, for <hi>Diadorus Siculus</hi> beforementioned in his De fabuloſis antiquorum geſtis) ſays, that certain <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were caſt on a moſt fertile iſland oppoſite to <hi>Africa,</hi> and you, to accommodate yourſelf, note that if it was oppoſite to <hi>Africa</hi> it muſt have been an <hi>A.....n</hi> iſland: But pray, Reverend Sir, with profound ſubmiſſion, why not one of the <hi>Azores,</hi> or even St. <hi>Helen'</hi>s? And if ſo, no wonder the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> did not divulge <hi>A.....a</hi> to the <hi>Europeans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon ſuppoſition that <hi>Silenas</hi> gave <hi>Midas</hi> information, as you ſay, that <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:012965_0010_0F904102CBAAFFE0"/>
and <hi>Africa</hi> were iſlands, and of the exiſtence of another world whoſe magnitude was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe and infinite, will it follow from thence that <hi>A.....a</hi> was known to the A.....ts? Do not you Prieſts preach up unknown worlds, and ſome of you live as though you were not willing to part with a certainty for an uncertainty?</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Hanuo</hi>'s voyage beforerementioned, when you leave the <hi>Herculian</hi> pillars, the <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> you find about ten thouſand ſtadia from <hi>Lybia</hi> the large iſlands of <hi>Atlantides</hi>; but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again to reconnoitre them, on your return, ſay you can't find 'em, to your great diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and conclude they are deſtroyed by a flood or earthquake: Surely, they ſay, it muſt have been <hi>Cape Flyaway,</hi> frequently ſeen by mariners in the atlantic ocean. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this voyage has miſled you a thouſand ſtadia from your point, and no wonder, ſince they muſt have been deſtitute of a compaſs: For leaving <hi>Lybia</hi> on the left (the coaſt lying nearly north and ſouth) and ſailing thirty days (meet with impediments, and no doubt it was very lucky if they ever found their way back, though you don't ſay they ever did; but you might have made the ſtory for them as you did for <hi>Madoc</hi>) ſteer ſouth. If <hi>Lybia</hi> was on the left their courſe muſt have been nearly ſouth, notwithſtanding which, you imagine it probable that they muſt have found ſome of the <hi>A—an</hi> iſlands, or ſome part of the weſtern continent itſelf, which they ſay must be as impoſſible as for deſigning Prieſts to receive the rewards of the faithful.</p>

            <p>They readily allow that <hi>A—a</hi> was well peopled four or five thouſand years ago, and that when <hi>Columbus</hi> arrived here he found multitudes of inhabitants: But what is that to your purpoſe?

But, pray Sir, how came the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants yellow?
