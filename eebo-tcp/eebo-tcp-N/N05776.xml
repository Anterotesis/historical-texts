            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE MONSTER OF MONSTERS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is hoped that the common idle Stories about <hi>Mon≈øters</hi> and <hi>Prodigies,</hi> which amu≈øe and plea≈øe the Vulgar, while they di≈øgu≈øt ≈øober and rea≈øonable Men, will be no in≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable Objection again≈øt the en≈øuing Narrative: Tho' the Author is aware, that the Frequency of ≈øuch Tales, which are ≈øoon found to be de≈øtitute of all Truth and Reality, will be a con≈øiderable Prejudice to it. But let its Reception be what it will, he thinks the Subject of it too ≈øingular and remarkable, to have no publick Notice taken of it. And in full Confidence, that the Truth will, at length, ≈øurmount all Ob≈øtacles, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the mo≈øt determin'd Infidelity, he can chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ri≈øque all the Credit he has in the World, whether more or le≈øs, upon the Verity of what follows.</p>
            <p>THERE lately appeared, in this <hi>Metropolis,</hi> a MON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STER of the mo≈øt hideous Form, and terrible A≈øpect; ≈øuch an one as was never before ≈øeen in <hi>America</hi> by any Man's Eyes; and, I believe, no where el≈øe; to be ≈øure not in the <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> Dominions. There was indeed one
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007332_0003_102B5A1DD6C6A870"/>
formerly a little like him in <hi>Turkey:</hi> another in <hi>Italy</hi>; and, as ≈øome ≈øay, there is one in <hi>France</hi> at this Day. He had more Heads and Horns than any Bea≈øt de≈øcribed in the <hi>Apocalyp≈øe</hi>; and pu≈øhed more furiou≈øly than the He-Goat in <hi>Daniel.</hi> His Teeth re≈øembled tho≈øe of an overgrown Lion: His Trunk was like that of an Elephant; the Protuberance on his Back, like that of a Camel; his Eye (for he had only one with all his Heads) was like that of <hi>Polyphemus</hi>; his Ears were of a much greater Longitude than tho≈øe of good <hi>St. Francis's traying Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory</hi>: The Wings which came out of his Sides, were like tho≈øe of an Eagle: his Hair (or rather Feathers) was like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's,</hi> after he was driven from among Men; his Claws, like tho≈øe of a Bear, only much bigger; and for a Tail, <hi>Gulliver's</hi> Monkey was a Fool to him.</p>
            <p>FROM what Parts he was brought, I do not certainly know; and would not deceive the Reader by pretending to an Acquaintance with ≈øuch Circum≈øtances as I am ignorant of. Some a≈ø≈øert that he came from the South; others, from the We≈øt; and ≈øome, from the Ea≈øt: But I rather think (if he were not brought forth among≈øt us) that he came out of the <hi>North</hi>; con≈øidering the Evils and the De≈øtruction which his Appearance portended.</p>
            <p>HE was fir≈øt ≈øeen here in a large A≈ø≈øembly of <hi>Matrons</hi>; who, one would have thought, from their natural Timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, mu≈øt have been univer≈øally ≈øhocked at ≈øo tremend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Sight. But (<hi>wonderful to relate!</hi>) they were, almo≈øt to a Woman, greatly plea≈øed with the Creature: And though many of them were not pa≈øt the Age of Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy; yet I have not heard of a ≈øingle one that mi≈øcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; nor indeed of more than about half a Score that were even thrown into <hi>Hy≈øterick Fits.</hi> The far greater Part were ≈øo ≈øtrangely captivated with this Mon≈øter, that they fondled and play'd with him: and would even have
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007332_0004_102B5A20A68294E0"/>
taken him into their Laps and Bo≈øoms, had he not been of too unweildy a Size. "What a pretty Lap-Dog, ≈øaid one and another, would this Creature make, if he was not of ≈øuch an enormous Bulk!" And a third even call'd him <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>k,</hi> as ≈øhe lean'd again≈øt his <hi>Probo≈øcis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOSE few Ladies of better Ta≈øte, who ≈øpake of him as an ugly, deformed, over grown Bea≈øt of Prey; and would have had him immediately turn'd out of the Hou≈øe, were cried out upon as having no Ta≈øte at all; and even threatned, that they ≈øhould never come there again, to drink Tea and Coffee in ≈øuch polite Company. It is thought that two Attornies Wives, be≈øides ≈øeveral other Ladies of le≈øs Di≈øtinction, would have admitted him, had he been of an amorous Turn, like <hi>Fa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>s</hi> and the <hi>Satyrs,</hi> to ≈øome Familiarities not ≈øo fit to be mention'd. <hi>Europa</hi> was never more enamour'd of a Bull; nor <hi>Leda,</hi> of a Swan: and both of them had certainly a far ju≈øter Ta≈øte than the≈øe modern Ladies. He was even voted, in Form, by them, who ought to be the be≈øt Judges of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be the prettie≈øt, hand≈øome≈øt Creature, they had ever laid their Eyes upon, in all their Lives.</p>
            <p>THIS A≈ø≈øembly of Matrons, not content with admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mon≈øter them≈øelves, took great Pains, both by Care≈ø≈øes, and Threats, to gain others over to their odd Opinion. They decorated him with Ribbands and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, like an ancient Victim, or rather like an <hi>Egyptian</hi> God, by the A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of a Prie≈øte≈øs to be mention'd hereafter: and having fir≈øt done Homage to him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves on bended Knees; ≈øent him in that Dre≈øs, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Company of Ladies, who u≈øed to meet to dance, and to regale them≈øelves, at no great Di≈øtance from their own A≈ø≈øembly-Room.</p>
            <p>THOSE of the Club, who were ordered to e≈øcort him thither, came and ≈øaid; "Behold here, Ladies, one of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007332_0005_102B5A2353713FC8"/>
the mo≈øt lovely, charming, adorable Creatures, that ever your Eyes were laid upon! Pray, good Ladies, join with us in our Admiration, and ≈øhare our Plea≈øure. O! the Beauty of the dear Creature! See how he looks! View him all over critically and exactly! Who ever ≈øaw the like!‚ÄîFor the Entertainment and Delight of the Publick, (and in order to put Money into our own Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, to game with &amp;c. when our Hu≈øbands are out of Humour) we have re≈øolv'd to hire a great Number of Per≈øons to carry him thro' the Country for a <hi>Sight.</hi> So good a Show will certainly give infinite Plea≈øure to People of every Rank; at the ≈øame Time that it will bring in Ca≈øh enough to find us all, in Tea, and Coffee, in Equipages and fine Clothes, in Citron Water and gaming Money, as long as we live. Come, dear Ladies, ca≈øt in your Lot among us, and let us go Snacks! We ≈øhall all find our <hi>Profit</hi> in it; and others, their <hi>Plea≈øure</hi> and <hi>Amu≈øement.</hi>"</p>
            <p>MANY of this latter A≈ø≈øembly were as marvellou≈øly plea≈øed with the <hi>Mon≈øter,</hi> as tho≈øe of the former; and ≈øoon expre≈ø≈øed their Readine≈øs to concur the Motion, for carrying him about for a Show. But a middle-aged Gentlewoman of a more refined Ta≈øte, and who was both in Stature and Judgment, Superiour to mo≈øt, even of the other Sex, ≈øtood up; and ≈øpake to this Purpo≈øe. "What <hi>Demon</hi> has gotten Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of you, my dear Ladies! and deprives you of your Sen≈øes to ≈øuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to make you take this filthy Mon≈øter for a Beauty! I am afraid to come near him, lea≈øt he ≈øhould hook up my Petticoats, and rip up my Stays, if nothing wor≈øe! And how he whi≈øks his na≈øty Tail in your Faces, at many Yards di≈øtance! Mercy on us! This a Beauty! Look on tho≈øe Ears! See that plaguy hump Back! View that bloody, ferocious Eye; if you can look ≈øteadily upon it! See tho≈øe diabolical Horns! Look on that triple Row of <hi>Ivory,</hi> in each of his enormous Jaws! And how he "Grins horribly, a gha≈øtly Smile!" Ob≈øerve

his Feet, how they are Cloven; branching out into five or ≈øix Claws, of huge Length and Thickne≈øs! A pretty Creature, upon my Con≈øcience, for Women to be taken with! How much better you like <hi>Horns,</hi> than your Spou≈øes do? This a Creature, to be carried about the Country for an agreable Spectacle! And becau≈øe you are run mad, for≈øooth! we mu≈øt run mad to keep you Company; or el≈øe fall under your Di≈øplea≈øure! No truly! I like not your fancy; nor this ≈øtrange Propo≈øal! If you ≈øhould ≈øend this more than <hi>Cerberian-mouth'd</hi> Mon≈øter through all the Towns in the Province, take my Word for it, you would rather fright the Inhabitants out of them, than draw Spectators about him. And tho' you expect to get ≈øo much Money by this Show, I am much mi≈øtaken if you would get enough to defray the Charges of carting it about. People will rather conclude you ≈øend a Mon≈øter to devour and de≈øtroy, than a Spectacle to entertain and delight, them! Fye upon it, Ladies! What evil Spirit put this Notion into your Heads; and deludes you at ≈øuch a Rate! To be plain with you, you had far better hire a Score or two of the ≈øturdie≈øt Butchers in the Town, to kill this horrible Creature out-right, before he does any Mi≈øchief; and to throw him, Piece-meal, into the Dock, than run the Ri≈øque of keeping him alive a ≈øingle Day. What would become of us all, if he ≈øhould break his Chain, get out of his Cage, and range about at large, ≈øeeking whom to devour! Doors and Locks, and Bolts, and Bars, would be no Security again≈øt him. He (having a Faculty of contracting and enlarging him≈øelf at Plea≈øure) would ea≈øily climb into our Bed Chambers; and tho' we ≈øhould hide our≈øeves down in our <hi>Wine Cellars</hi> among the <hi>Ca≈øks</hi>; he would find us out even there; drag us into Day Light, and gorge him≈øelf with our mangled Carca≈øes! A pretty Creature to be kept for a Show, truly! Thus ≈øpake Mrs. GRACCHA; for that was the Name of this accompli≈øh'd Lady.</p>

I wonder you can imagine that ≈øuch a Spectacle as you propo≈øe, can be reli≈øhed by the People of this Country; or that any good can come of this Project. Are you really in earne≈øt, Ladies! Why! Do you not remember, when a <hi>Leopard</hi> only was carried about for a Show, a few Years ≈øince, what Confu≈øion and Terror People were thrown into! Not only tho≈øe of our own Sex; but the Men al≈øo; even ≈øome of the <hi>Military</hi> Order! Was not the Con≈øternation ≈øtill greater, and more univer≈øal, when the <hi>Lion</hi> was carted about, ≈øome Time before? What terrible Apprehen≈øions had People of his breaking from his Durance, and eating them half up! And more lately, when there was only a <hi>Wild-Cat</hi> of uncommon Size and fiercene≈øs, and longer Fangs than u≈øual, carried from Place to Place; you have not, ≈øurely, forgot how precipitately even ≈øuch brave, valiant Men as C‚Äîpt‚Äîins and C‚Äîll‚Äîn‚Äîls fled before it; leaving the Towns where they re≈øpectively lived, upon the fir≈øt News of its approach! The Courage of ≈øuch Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, was never doubted by any one; And it is certain they would have ≈øingly encountered the whole Rebel Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the <hi>Pretender</hi> at its Head! But the People of this Country, I ≈øay, cannot endure <hi>wild Bea≈øts,</hi> and <hi>Lawle≈øs Devourers!</hi> How then, Ladies, in the Name of Amazement, can it enter into your Thoughts, that they will be delighted with a Mon≈øter! e≈øpecially ≈øuch an huge, dreadful one as this; which might devour half a Country Village for a Breakfa≈øt; and be hungry ≈øtill! Will they give their Money freely, do you think, for ≈øuch a Show! When you reflect, Ladies, upon the Abborrence and Dread which they have of all <hi>wild Creatures</hi>; of all <hi>Bea≈øts of Prey</hi>; when you con≈øi≈øter how contrary ≈øuch

Shews are to their natural Ta≈øte, Genius and Manners; when you con≈øider farther, what Mi≈øchiefs may be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done by this dreadful Creature; I ≈øhall think you ought to drink no Tea, except ≈øuch as is made of <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore,</hi> if you per≈øi≈øt in the project of carrying about this Creature; a Mon≈øter, as much more formidable than a <hi>Lion,</hi> as a <hi>Lion,</hi> than a common <hi>Puppy-Dog</hi>!"</p>
            <p>THESE two Speeches, together with ≈øome others, were very attentively heard by the Club: And, in ≈øhort, made ≈øo good an Impre≈ø≈øion, that the major Part adopted the Sentiments of them; and rejected the Motion of the other Club, after due Deliberation. Whereupon tho≈øe who pre≈øented the Mon≈øter to them for their Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, returned with him to their own Si≈øterhood, in great Wrath and Indignation for this imaginary Affront; and endeavoured, <hi>Thale≈øtris-like,</hi> to inflame the Pa≈ø≈øions of the A≈ø≈øembly; which they found no very hard Ta≈øk to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. The greater Part being now well heated with Anger; ≈øome with laced Tea, others with Gin, and ≈øome with Citron Water; they came to a Re≈øolution to ≈øend the Mon≈øter immediately back again, with another Me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage; giving out their Menaces, concerning what they would do to any Lady of the other Si≈øterhood, who ≈øhould be ≈øo hardy as to reject their Propo≈øal a ≈øecond Time. "My Word for it, ≈øays one, that Lady that ≈øhall dare to open her Lips in di≈øparagement of this rare, curious, lovely Animal, ≈øhall have her Pinners torn off her Head; and her Sack ≈øtripped over her Ears!" "And my Word for it, ≈øays another, although they pretend to be at lea≈øt our Equals, if not our Superiours; and to have as good a Right as we, to enjoy their own Opinion about the Beauty and Deformity of any Creature living; yet we will make them know the Difference, I warrant you! We are the mo≈øt numerous Club; and will ≈øoon cau≈øe them to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to our Determination; or pull all their Caps and Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles off! Do they call this, a Mon≈øter? a dangerous Mon≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

nor fit to be kept alive! I ≈øay again, we will have him carried about for a Show, let them ≈øay what they will: And they ≈øhall join with us too in this Project, or we'll know why; and that's more!"</p>
            <p>THE Mon≈øter's greate≈øt Admirers in this A≈ø≈øembly, were (1) Madam RIXA; formerly a lean, poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, thought to be in a Con≈øumption; and who u≈øed to go very meanly clad: But of late Years, plump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to a con≈øiderable Magnitude; and become a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Belle,</hi> with her rich Lace and Ruffles; and almo≈øt every Female Ornament, excepting that of a meek and quiet Heart. Some idle People in≈øinuate, that ≈øhe got her Money by Gaming; and that ≈øhe never u≈øed to play fairly: but I do not concern my≈øelf about ≈øuch Matters.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) MADAM PROTEA; a Gentlewoman that was lately ≈øeen in Publick with a remarkable <hi>Head Dre≈øs.</hi> This Lady has many good Qualities: but is very variable and incon≈øtant in every Thing; ≈øo that it was expected her Pa≈ø≈øion for the Mon≈øter, would have been but ≈øhort-lived. However, to the Surprize of every one, She, who never u≈øed to be of the ≈øame Mind two Days together, has, in <hi>this</hi> Re≈øpect, ≈øhown all the Steadine≈øs and Per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of a <hi>Saint</hi>; continues to extol the Beauty of the Mon≈øter, and ≈øeems determin'd to live and dye in the Faith of his Charms.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) ANOTHER of his great Admirers was Madam RUTI<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>A, the Wife of a very fine, hand≈øome Gentleman: to find whom making Panegyricks, with ≈øo much Zeal upon ≈øuch an ugly Creature, was a Surprize to all: e≈øpecially when this Zeal carried her to ≈øpeak even of her own aged Mother, with le≈øs Decorum and Re≈øpect than became her. For the good old Lady happening to be her Tenant, ≈øhe threatned that ≈øhe would turn her out, if ≈øhe did not approve her Pa≈ø≈øion. The Gentlewoman of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007332_0010_102B5A2D6640FBE8"/>
whom I am now ≈øpeaking, is ≈øingularly plain and mode≈øt in her Dre≈øs; commonly appearing abroad in a dark Ru≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel Gown. She is a Lady of real and great Worth; but ought certainly to have been a better Judge of Propriety and Decency, as well as of Beauty and Deformity, than to have ≈øpake and acted in the Manner ≈øhe did.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) Mrs. AQUATICA (a jolly-looking, pur≈øy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman; and a little a≈øthmatical) was al≈øo a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of the Mon≈øter; nur≈øing it with much Tenderne≈øs, and a peculiar Fondne≈øs. Nor is this ≈øtrange, if, as ≈øome have hinted, ≈øhe was the real <hi>Mother</hi> of it; though by Means of an unlawful Commerce. But whether this be Fact, or not; and if it is, whether the Mon≈øter i≈ø≈øued from her Head, as <hi>Pallas</hi> did from the <hi>Thunderer's,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Mythology, or whether it dropped from her Belly, as the unformed <hi>Cub</hi> falls from the prowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ravenous Bear's; I confe≈øs my≈øelf unable to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Nor is it very material, ≈øuppo≈øing it to be her Offspring, whether the Foetus was originally conceived in her Brain, or Belly; ≈øince a le≈øs mon≈øtrous Production could not have been rationally expected from either; nor a more perfect from the one than from the other. This Matron was the Wife of a certain great <hi>Farmer</hi> living out of the Town; who had many Tenants under him; and it is ≈øaid, he was wont to treat them with ≈øuch Severity, Haughtine≈øs and In≈øolence, e≈øpecially in gathering in his Rents, that he has often been in Jeopardy of a broken Pate. But it is not the Hu≈øband, but the Wife, gentle Reader, that we have now to do with. She, as was hinted before, was at lea≈øt the Nur≈øe, if not the Mother of the Mon≈øter. And though ≈øhe has ≈øo liberally given Food and Nutriment to it, yet ≈øhe expects, in her Turn, to receive Nouri≈øhment from it. For although I ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ≈øpeak of this Creature, as being of the <hi>Male</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I would now acquaint the Reader, that it is really an <hi>Hermaphrodite</hi>; and has a Multitude of large Teats;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007332_0011_102B5A2F13CE3890"/>
at which many hope to hang in Rows, like ≈øo many ≈øuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pigs, or rather like Imps at the Teats of Witches. Nor need I ob≈øerve here, what every one knows already, That though Mon≈øters are ≈øaid not to breed; yet they frequently <hi>give Milk</hi> in prodigious Quantities. But then it takes the Produce of a whole Country to feed one. And indeed, if this ≈øhould live, I fear we ≈øhall find the old Proverb concerning the <hi>Sterility</hi> of Mon≈øters, erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) ANOTHER of the≈øe Mon≈øter-loving-Matrons, was Madam CAPILLA; a very ≈øleek, ≈øoft-≈øpoken, double-tongu'd, ro≈øey Gentlewoman; though, I think, ≈øomewhat older than either of the other. She was formerly the Wife of a Prie≈øt of <hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and her≈øelf a Prie≈øte≈øs. For which Rea≈øon, as ≈øome ≈øay, ≈øhe was employed to u≈øher this Mon≈øter into the World, with all the Pomp and Ceremonial, practis'd by the Pagan Hierarchy: Tho' ≈øhe had not, for many Years pa≈øt, concerned her≈øelf much about Religion in any Shape; but given her≈øelf up to Matters meerly worldly and ≈øecular, <hi>at the be≈øt.</hi> However, ≈øince the Sacerdotal Character is indelible, (although the Office is pro≈øtituted ever ≈øo much, or even wholly renounced) a more proper Per≈øon, certainly, could not have been pitched upon to perform the ≈øaid Rites, con≈øidering for what Creature they were to be performed!</p>
            <p n="6">(6) A <hi>younger</hi> Lady than either of the former, was a con≈øiderable Admirer of, and a warm Advocate for, the Mon≈øter. She is remarkable for a Chin, ≈øomewhat immoderate in Length; and wears both <hi>Night</hi> and <hi>Day</hi> a very large <hi>Beauty Spot</hi> upon her right Cheek: In which there is this farther ob≈øervable, that it is very difficult to take it off, without taking the <hi>Skin</hi> away with it! This Lady was very lately in high E≈øteem in the Town: And although her Conduct with Relation to the Mon≈øter, has been exceptionable; yet it is not doubted but that Time,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007332_0012_102B5A31CC226E18"/>
and a circum≈øpect Behaviour, will re≈øtore a Lady of ≈øo many laudable Qualities, to her former Reputation.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) Mrs. BIDDY brings up the Rear of all the≈øe Ladies; and Claims a very particular Notice. She is the Wife of a certain valiant C‚Äîll‚Äîn‚Äîl; and, in Imitation of him, wears a great Tuft of Feathers on the top of her Head; ≈øo weighty, that it is thought to have over≈øtrain'd, and weaken'd, that tender Part; and made her a little giddy. She pretends to a great deal of Religion; tho' but few think ≈øhe has more Virtue than her Neighbours. She has the Misfortune to have a very ≈øly, cunning, <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> Look; and not being of the faire≈øt Complexion, nor able to look a good Chri≈øtian in the Face; ≈øome have ≈øu≈øpected her to be of <hi>that Religion</hi>; and hinted, that the only Rea≈øon why ≈øhe is not conformed to 'its whole Ritual, is her <hi>Sex.</hi> Yea, many are very confident, that ≈øhe is an I≈ør...I...te.. ind...d..... bating this ≈øingle Branch of the Character, that in ≈øuch Per≈øons there is <hi>no Guile.</hi> I mu≈øt confe≈øs that I could not help entertaining ≈øome Su≈øpicions of this Sort, my≈øelf, upon a certain Occa≈øion; tho' I would not be uncharitable. For happening to dine with her ≈øome Time ago, at a Country-Inn, where we had nothing ≈øerved up, but one Di≈øh of roa≈øted Pork and Partridge together; I ob≈øerved, Mrs <hi>Biddy</hi> ≈øeemed to love Partridge very well; but would not touch a Mor≈øell of the Pork: tho' ≈øhe greedily took a large Sop made of the Dripping. And what ≈øeemed to enter into her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, I chu≈øe not to ≈øay!</p>
            <p>THERE are others who have ≈øu≈øpected Mrs. <hi>Biddy</hi> of being a follower of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> in≈øtead of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi>: But, in my Opinion, with far le≈øs Rea≈øon. For whereas the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion forbids its Votaries to u≈øe the Fruit of the Vine, ≈øhe is a great Admirer of it: And is known to have ≈øpent the the <hi>whole Afternoon</hi> of the Chri≈øtian <hi>Sabbath,</hi> over her Bottle. But whether this is a <hi>conclu≈øive</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:007332_0013_102B5A34A539A9C0"/>
Argument, or not, that ≈øhe is no Di≈øciple of the <hi>Arabian Impo≈øtor,</hi> I think it is at lea≈øt a <hi>fair</hi> one, that ≈øhe is <hi>no Chri≈øtian.</hi> If ≈øhe is really a <hi>Jewe≈øs,</hi> as I am rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think, it is to be hoped, that, ≈øince her <hi>Sex</hi> will not allow of the mo≈øt di≈øtingu≈øhing <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri≈øtick</hi> of that Per≈øwa≈øion, ≈øhe will not always want another, which is very compatible thereto; I mean that ≈øhe will not be long <hi>unc...re...m<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Nor is this a nece≈ø≈øary Omi≈ø≈øion; ≈øince we know that this Rite was no peculiar Part of their <hi>ancient Temple-Service:</hi> And indeed Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has ≈øhown the great Need and Advantage of it; and the good that is done by it, to this People, even in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where not ≈øo much as <hi>Synagogues</hi> are allow'd of. But this is a Digre≈ø≈øion: and having thus paid my <hi>Devoirs</hi> to the≈øe Female Worthies, I now return to the Mon≈øter, and my Narrative.</p>
            <p>THE Mon≈øter was ≈øent back almo≈øt In≈øtantaneou≈øly, as it had been determin'd. Many Ladies of fine Ta≈øte and great Merit, belonging to that Club which rejected the Motion of the other, (and which I call the Club ≈øuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for di≈øtinction ≈øake) had been ab≈øent from it for ≈øeveral Days. The good Lady al≈øo, who had lately ≈øaid ≈øo much in derogation from the Glory of the Mon≈øter, had by this Time left the Company, to look after her Hou≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Affairs. Some others, of her Opinion, had al≈øo done the ≈øame; and ≈øome had ab≈øented them≈øelves through Cowardice. Some of <hi>this Si≈øterhood</hi> who were pre≈øent, were intimidated by the Threats of the <hi>other</hi>: And ≈øome, it is ≈øaid, were turned from their former Opinion, chiefly by the Efficacy of <hi>laced Tea,</hi> and <hi>Citron Water</hi>; with which they were plentifully regaled, at the Co≈øt of tho≈øe who labour'd their Conver≈øion. So that, in ≈øhort, when this grave Si≈øterhood came to Vote a ≈øecond Time, it was
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007332_0014_102B5A36EBA60E98"/>
carried in favour of the Mon≈øter by a ≈ømall Majority; to the great Joy and Triumph of all that w-r≈øh-ped the Bea≈øt.</p>
            <p>IN that which I call the Club ≈øuperiour, (tho' the lea≈øt in Number) ≈øeveral Ladies ≈øignalized them≈øelves in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Mon≈øter, ≈øome by their Craft and Subtlety, others by their Weakne≈øs and Simplicity.</p>
            <p>Madam MARINA (a tall Lady) who had often cro≈øs'd the Ocean, and who was even when pa≈øt her <hi>grand Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macteri,</hi> in <hi>an hone≈øt Way,</hi> a true Votary to the Godde≈øs which ≈øprang from the <hi>Briny Element</hi>; Madam MARINA I ≈øay, declared ≈øhe would not have been for keeping this Mon≈øter alive, and exhibiting him as a publick Spectacle, had ≈øhe thought <hi>her</hi> Vote would have contributed to it, or been of any Efficacy towards getting a Majority of Voices on that Side. For ≈øhe knew there were enough without it.‚Äî</p>
            <p>Madam CHEMIA, (a very philo≈øophical Lady) who ≈øome Years ≈øince (as is well known) di≈øcover'd that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stone,</hi> of which the Royal Society has been in que≈øt a long Time, to no Purpo≈øe; Madam CHEMIA, I ≈øay, argued in Favour of the Mon≈øter, only becau≈øe ≈øhe tho't that the Publick would be hugely delighted and edified with ≈øo curious a Show.</p>
            <p>SHE ≈øaid there was not a real <hi>Virtuo≈øo,</hi> a true <hi>Adept,</hi> in all <hi>North America,</hi> but what would come to ≈øee it; "and the Populace, you know, ≈øaid ≈øhe, are always fond of Novelties and ≈øtrange Sights." This was <hi>her</hi> Motive. So that it is very malicious in any to in≈øinuate, as ≈øome have done, that Madam CHEMIA was on that Side of the Que≈øtion, for fear of being turn'd out of the Club. And indeed every one knows, that this good Lady never baulk'd or wrong'd her Judgment, to curry Favour either with Great or Small, Male or Female.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:007332_0015_102B5A387B5DA990"/>ONE Mi≈øs POLLY, was al≈øo a Favourer of the Mon≈øter; ≈øo far, I mean, as to give her Voice on that Side: Tho' I am credibly inform'd, that ≈øhe now fully vindicates her Ta≈øte and Conduct, by ≈øolemnly averring, that ≈øhe held up her Hand quite contrary to her own <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience.</hi> And for how many others in both Clubs, the ≈øame convincing and ≈øatisfactory Plea might ≈øerve, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to know! This Mi≈øs POLLY is a young, dap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ≈øpruce, coquetti≈øh Lady, and trips along the Streets like any Thing! But as young and airy as ≈øhe is her≈øelf, ≈øhe has of late Years affected to keep very <hi>≈øedate</hi> Company: and ≈øhe was actually at con≈øiderable Expence to get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a Member of this grave Club; wherein every one is now ≈øurpriz'd to ≈øee ≈øuch a blooming La≈øs, and in which there are ≈øundry Matrons that are <hi>very old.</hi>

            <p>THE Ladies who idoliz'd the Bea≈øt, and had already receiv'd his Mark in their tender, impre≈ø≈øive Foreheads, now thought their Point gained; and di≈øcover'd their Joy in a Way ≈øomewhat too boi≈øterous, perhaps, to be very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming that ≈øoft and delicate Sex. However, there was one Ob≈øtacle yet in their Way. The large Hou≈øe, where they u≈øed to hold their Club, belonged to a Gentleman, <hi>without</hi> who≈øe <hi>Approbation</hi> they did not <hi>incline</hi> to do any Thing of Con≈øequence. Nor were they out of the Way, in paying ≈øo great a Deference to his <hi>Opinion.</hi> For tho' he was only a <hi>private</hi> Gentleman (≈øu≈øtaining no <hi>Office</hi> in

the Government, whether Civil or Military) he was a mo≈øt accompli≈øh'd Per≈øon; a Gentleman of a good De≈øcent, and of a fine, as well as learned Education. He had travelled through many Countries in <hi>Europe</hi>; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him≈øelf in them all. His Genius was ≈øtrong; his Knowledge of Men and Things exten≈øive; his Ta≈øte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, his Addre≈øs winning; his Conver≈øation equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and entertaining. With the≈øe Qualities, it is not ≈øtrange that he was acceptable to the Ladies, as well as to the Gentlemen; e≈øpecially con≈øidering he excell'd in <hi>dancing</hi>; tho' this I reckon among≈øt the lea≈øt con≈øiderable of his Accomplishments. This Gentleman, though he was always backward to contradict the Ladies in any Thing, had dropped a Word or two, intimating his Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of what had been propo≈øed; and what was indeed now re≈øolved upon. This came to the Ears of the Ladies, who could hardly believe it. It was therefore unanimou≈øly determin'd, to refer the Matter, in a formal Manner, to Him: And they <hi>obliged them≈øelves</hi> beforehand, tho' they were very much ≈øet upon the Thing, to <hi>≈øubmit</hi> entirely to his Judgment; and follow his Advice.</p>
            <p>THEY accordingly laid the Ca≈øe before him, in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of the <hi>Mon≈øter</hi>; with many Encomiums on his Beauty, &amp;c. The Gentleman (tho' he was naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with great Magnanimity) did not chu≈øe to venture into the Hall, where the Bea≈øt was, without taking a large Spear in his Hand.

They cannot endure the Thoughts of a total <hi>Exci≈øion,</hi> by the voracious Jaws of this <hi>Dragon,</hi> this <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>! this....... what ≈øhall I call him? I can ≈øcarce for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear plunging this Spear into his Heart, this very In≈øtant, without farther Ceremony; But Ceremony is what the Ladies always expect; and Men of Honour always u≈øe towards them. Nor will I tell you, that you have forgot the natural Softne≈øs and Delicacy of your Sex and <hi>Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> and are turn'd <hi>Amanons</hi> and <hi>Termagants,</hi> or el≈øe you could not be plea≈øed with ≈øuch a Spectacle. No! But I a≈ø≈øure you Ladies, that you will neither oblige the People, nor get much Money, by exhibiting ≈øuch a Show! My Advice is, that you get the ingenious Mr. <hi>Hurd</hi> to engrave the Mon≈øter on a Copper Plate; and di≈øper≈øe the Prints of him about the Country. If the Image and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øcription <hi>plea≈øes,</hi> it will be Time enough then, to ≈øend about the Original. Should you immediately ≈øend about the Mon≈øter, in <hi>propria per≈øona,</hi> (excu≈øe a Latin Word or two Ladies, though you ≈øhould not under≈øtand it) you would rai≈øe a Su≈øpicion in People, that you had ≈øome bad De≈øign not only upon their <hi>Pockets</hi>; but upon their <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Lives.</hi> You would certainly ≈øet them all to <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> except <hi>Mini≈øters,</hi> and a few other very grave, ≈øolid Folks: And Ladies always abhor Oaths! Be≈øides, if the People once get to SWEARING, it is odds but they will al≈øo get to <hi>Lying,</hi> and <hi>perjuring</hi> them≈øelves! You are plea≈øed in ≈øhort to refer it to me, Ladies, whether you and they ≈øhall be Happy or Mi≈øerable. I therefore re≈øolve, as
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007332_0018_102B5A3FC1542A08"/>
far as in me lyes, that both ≈øhall be <hi>happy</hi>; and think my≈øelf <hi>≈øo,</hi> in having a Thing of this Nature ≈øubmitted to my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. You will excu≈øe my Freedom, Ladies; and do me the Ju≈øtice to believe, that I would gladly oblige you in <hi>every Way,</hi> except that of <hi>contributing to your Mi≈øery.</hi> This I can never con≈øent to, even tho' I ≈øhould be ≈øo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to incur your Di≈øplea≈øure!"</p>
            <p>THUS ≈øpake the Friend of the Ladies, the Friend of all. It is impo≈ø≈øible to de≈øcribe their Looks during the Time of his Speaking; and after he had done; ‚Äî the Joy that appeared in the Countenances of ≈øome, the Shame, Di≈øappointment, and Anger, that were vi≈øible in the Faces of others. But the Rejoicing was univer≈øal through the Town, among≈øt People of all Ranks, when they found them≈øelves deliver'd from their former Fears. It was ≈øurprizing to ≈øee, and is impo≈ø≈øible to expre≈øs, the ≈øudden Change that was produced in every Face: "Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from all terrible Sights; a quiet Enjoyment of what we have, and NO MONSTERS!" was the univer≈øal Cry; and ≈øtill continues the mo≈øt common Health that goes round.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus fini≈øhed my <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> Narrative of the mo≈øt formidable Mon≈øter, that was ever ≈øeen in this Land; I now beg leave to Congratulate my dear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, that we are not without an HERCULES! This Mon≈øter is not indeed yet actually killed; but only bound in ≈øtrong Chains. Whether he ≈øhall be quite demoli≈øhed, and ≈øent to his own proper Place, or whether he ≈øhall be permitted to live, to cram his mercile≈øs and in≈øatiable Maw with our very Blood, and Bones, and Vitals; depends upon my good Country Men them≈øelves. He now only lives till they ≈øhall plea≈øe to pa≈øs Sentence of Death upon him. And after what has been ≈øaid, it would be an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to their Under≈øtandings and Sen≈øes, ≈øhould I go about, in a formal Manner to convince them, that it is not fitting and ≈øafe that he ≈øhould live, and be carried about from Place to Place, as the Women have propo≈øed. You will all quickly ≈øee the ugly Portrait, the dreadful Picture, of this Animal. And when it is pre≈øented to you, take
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007332_0019_102B5A414AE2D998"/>
particular Notice of his <hi>Horns,</hi> his <hi>Teeth,</hi> and his terrible <hi>Claws</hi>: tho' even his Tail (as incon≈øiderable a Member as that is generally accounted in Animals) might prove a Be≈øom of De≈øtruction. A ≈øingle Bru≈øh or Flap of it would ≈øweep us away Dozens and Scores!</p>
            <p>YOU will at once conclude, that this Dog of H‚Äîll, ought not only to have his enormous Length of Ears and Tail dimini≈øhed; his Teeth pulled out, and his Claws paired, but that his very Head (or Heads rather; for they are many!) ought to be excis'd; I mean <hi>cut off.</hi> Or if that cannot be done, you will think he ≈øhould be bound, at lea≈øt for one thou≈øand <hi>prophetick Years</hi>; and ca≈øt into the bottomle≈øs Aby≈øs; not to be ≈øeen again above Ground, till that term is expir'd, or till <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ≈øhall make their Appearance, ≈øpringing ≈øpontaneou≈øly from the Slime and Filth of the Earth; according to a certain Learned <hi>Expo≈øitor!</hi> This Creature may indeed make a tolerable Show, in the nether Regions, among≈øt his Black cloven footed Brethren: (tho' I believe he would at fir≈øt ≈øtartle even them) But certainly he ought not to be ≈øeen by any, that are yet out of the Place of <hi>Dragons!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT when the true <hi>Effigies</hi> of this dreadful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comes out; you will then be able, my loving Countrymen, to form an exact Idea of him. And after ≈øeeing this Print, he that can de≈øire to ≈øee the <hi>Original</hi>; or would willingly ≈øuffer the Creature to be kept alive for a Show, would de≈øerve no better a Fate in my Opinion, than to become Food and Su≈øtenance for him; ju≈øt as Cats and Dogs and Monkeys and other inferiour Animals, are thrown to Lions to prey upon: Tho' it would of the two, be more honourable to Share the Fate of the≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Animals, in falling a Sacrifice to the noble, renowned, <hi>hereditary Monarch</hi> of the <hi>Fore≈øt</hi>; than to be devoured by ≈øuch an unheard of, up≈øtart, unlicked, mi≈øcreated Mon≈øter! It is to be hoped that what has been ≈øaid will have no Tendency to excite any undue Re≈øentment again≈øt the Ladies I have had Occa≈øion to ≈øpeak of in this Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. Many if not all of tho≈øe Women, who were for
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007332_0020_102B5A4431B24658"/>
keeping this Creature for a Show, had doubtle≈øs a kind and generous Intention to gratify Peoples Curio≈øity; not being aware of the Danger attending their Project, and of the fatal Evils that might follow from it. They were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly out in their <hi>own Ta≈øte</hi>; and under a great Mi≈øtake about <hi>ours.</hi> But Errors of this Nature ≈øhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked and forgiven: E≈øpecially if they are not ob≈øtinately <hi>per≈øi≈øted</hi> in, but ≈øea≈øonably <hi>recanted.</hi> I would therefore, my dear Countrymen, conclude by earne≈øtly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the≈øe Ladies to your <hi>be≈øt Affections</hi> (at lea≈øt tho≈øe of them that are either Widows or Maidens) and this I do the rather, becau≈øe it is impo≈ø≈øible for tho≈øe who <hi>Love</hi> ≈øuch pretty, well-proprtion'd, charming Creatures as WOMEN, not to hate MONSTERS.</p>

            <p>THE Author of the preceeding Narrative, having hitherto been ≈øpeaking in <hi>Je≈øt,</hi> thinks its now Time to ≈øpeak in <hi>Earne≈øt.</hi> Having a lei≈øure Hour or two, I tho't to amu≈øe my ≈øelf by writing ≈øomething in the fabulous, romantick, <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous</hi> Way; in Imitation of many Per≈øons both ancient and modern. And from the Reception which many Things of this ≈øort meet with from the greater Part of Readers, I did not know but I might innocently divert ≈øome others, as well as my ≈øelf.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Romance was fini≈øhed, I ≈øhow'd it to a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who is my very good Friend; (a better Friend to me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, than I ≈øhall prove to him in the End) and a Per≈øon who≈øe Judgment I highly value. He frankly told me that he <hi>approved</hi> of it, and tho't it would <hi>take;</hi> adding that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd he could get a Penny by it the≈øe hard Times; at lea≈øt enough to pay him for his <hi>Labour, Paper,</hi> and the <hi>Wear</hi> of his <hi>Pre≈øs</hi> and <hi>Types;</hi> which he look'd upon as no incon≈øiderable Matter for a Printer at this Day! I accordingly gave him a Copy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:007332_0021_102B5A46E2E7F190"/>BUT when the Piece was almo≈øt out of the Pre≈øs, I reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what a ≈øad Propen≈øity there is in many Readers, to make <hi>invidious</hi> Applications; to wre≈øt an Author's Sen≈øe; and to con≈øtrue the mo≈øt harmle≈øs Romances into Satyre, Scandal and Invective, even again≈øt the greate≈øt and worthie≈øt Per≈øonages: I con≈øidered, that while ≈øome might make ≈øuch Applications thro' <hi>Malice,</hi> others might do it thro' <hi>Ignorance;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho't I could not, with a <hi>≈øafe</hi> Con≈øcience, let the <hi>innocent</hi> Piece ≈øee the Light, without ≈øaying ≈øomething by Way of Caution.</p>
            <p>WHAT happen'd at the Printing-Hou≈øe about an Hour ago, determin'd me to take this Cour≈øe. The Printer a≈ø≈øur'd me, he had found out my whole Meaning, as plainly as if I had told him my ≈øelf. <q>Yes, ≈øaid he, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a very ≈øad Church indeed! and well de≈øerves to be expos'd for her Idolatries, and for per≈øecuting the poor <hi>Prote≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</hi> Why! ≈øhe is called the <hi>Bea≈øt</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> in the <hi>Bible</hi>! The <hi>Pope,</hi> or the <hi>INQUISITION,</hi> is the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter. I dont love to judge Folks, but I am afraid the <hi>Pope</hi> is a very bad Man. I hope you'll write again≈øt him again; and defend <hi>Liberty of Con≈øcience.</hi> O! that <hi>INQUISI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION</hi> is a ≈øad, ≈øad Thing! What! may we not enjoy our own <hi>private</hi> Opinion in religious Matters! Would they make <hi>Slaves</hi> and <hi>Bea≈øts</hi> of us all!</q>
            </p>
            <p>ONE of his Journey-men, who a≈ø≈øi≈øted in correcting the Pre≈øs, ≈øoon put in his Oar: but rowed another Way. <q>Well! <hi>for my Part,</hi> ≈øaid he, I don't believe it is aim'd again≈øt the <hi>Pope;</hi> but again≈øt the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Ea≈øtward Indians;</hi> them <hi>Dogs</hi> that are not willing we ≈øhould enjoy our <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties;</hi> but would eat us all up alive. Well, the G-v-r‚Äîr is <hi>gone down;</hi> and I don't que≈øtion he'll give 'em a <hi>Bone to pick,</hi> that will make their <hi>Teeth</hi> crack again! I knew, before I had compos'd five Pages, that you intended the <hi>French King,</hi> by the Mon≈øter which had ≈øo many Heads and Horns, and ≈øuch plaguy long Claws!</q>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER of the Workmen gave it as his <hi>≈øolid Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that it was de≈øign'd as a Satyre upon the Women. <q>For Women, ≈øaid he, are ≈øet in a ridiculous Light, from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007332_0022_102B5A4886FC1218"/>
of it to the End.</q>
From which Imputation I clear'd my ≈øelf with ≈øome Degree of Warmth; thinking it equally a Reflection on my Breeding, Ta≈øte and Judgment. Nor could ≈øuch a Thought have enter'd into his Noddle had he known how happy I am, in the <hi>be≈øt of Wives;</hi> and in two fine Daughters, tho' I ≈øay it, new marriageable; waiting (O ye dilatory, frozen <hi>Batchelors!</hi>) for ≈øutable Propo≈øals to be made to them.</p>
            <p>AS my Back was turn'd, I overheard an unlucky Jackanaps of a Boy, that ≈øtood by, talking to his Fellow-Prentice: <q>Witches for a Gue≈øs! ≈øaid he: and Ma≈øter always was! I don't believe e'er a one of 'em is in the right: I'll wage it relates to****&amp;c.</q>
And ≈øo the Ra≈øcal went on to make the mo≈øt groundle≈øs, ≈øaucy Application of ≈øeveral Parts of it, that could be. I ≈øtamp'd, and gave the <hi>Urchin</hi> a ≈øevere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke for his Pertne≈øs, and Impudence; charging him never to li≈øp ≈øuch a Word again (e≈øpecially when he <hi>hawked it about</hi>) as he valued his two Ears! and ≈øo came away.</p>
            <p>AS I was going home, tho't I, if People go on gue≈ø≈øing and gue≈ø≈øing, applying and applying, at this Rate; and <hi>making</hi> Sen≈øes, where there was none <hi>before;</hi> what may they not come to at la≈øt! The wild, extravagant Fancies of ≈øome, may carry them to fix ≈øuch an arbitrary Meaning to this idle Tale, as I almo≈øt ≈øhudder to think of! and as would leave a Sting in the <hi>End</hi> of it!</p>
            <p>NOW to prevent every Thing of this Sort, I think my ≈øelf bound in Duty to declare, that my Narrative (like mo≈øt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers Stories) has not one Word of Truth in it. There has not, to my Knowledge, been any <hi>Mon≈øter</hi> in the Town; nor any Thing like a Mon≈øter. There has nothing happened lately which could naturally give Occa≈øion to ≈øuch a Fiction; nor any Thing to which it can be ju≈øtly apply'd, in the Way of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical</hi> Interpretation. And the Per≈øons who ≈øhall attempt this, mu≈øt be very ≈øimple, or ill-natur'd; for it is merely a Work of Fancy and Imagination; of which there is neither <hi>Type</hi> nor <hi>Antitype.</hi> And having declar'd this, I think I may <hi>innocently</hi> let it ≈øee the Light, as a very <hi>harmle≈øs, toothle≈øs</hi> Production; wi≈øhing that all other Romancers and Story Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007332_0023_102B5A4AA3F304A8"/>
had been as fair and ingenuous, to undeceive their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as ≈øoon as they had fini≈øh'd their <hi>Lies!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT if I mu≈øt open my whole Heart, as to my Views in writing this, (which I have not yet done) I ≈øhall certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a little vain. For Ambition had ≈øome Share in this Production, as mean as it is. To tell the Truth, I have long de≈øign'd to write the <hi>KNAVE's PROGRESS,</hi> in Imitation of the <hi>PILGRIM</hi>'s, by the excellent Mr. <hi>John Bunyan;</hi> And I tho't, that by exerci≈øing my ≈øelf a little in this fanciful, my≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Way of writing, I might execute that <hi>great</hi> Work the better when I ≈øet my ≈øelf about it. And you mu≈øt excu≈øe my Vanity, gentle Reader, if I tell you, that I am not without ≈øome Hopes of performing the Task in ≈øuch a Manner, as may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me not wholly unde≈øerving the Title of <hi>his Succe≈ø≈øor</hi> 
               <note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">If this little Attempt in the <hi>Romantick</hi> Way, meets with due Encouragement from the Publick; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to ≈øet about that <hi>large, voluminous</hi> Work alluded to, as ≈øoon as Lei≈øure will permit.</note>. <hi>Homer</hi> wrote of <hi>Frogs,</hi> (an ugly Sort of Creature) before he wrote of Kings and the <hi>Trojan</hi> War. Even <hi>Gnats</hi> employ'd the Pen of <hi>Maro,</hi> before it immortaliz'd <hi>Mezentius</hi> and other <hi>Heroes. Milton</hi> wrote of the <hi>Wizzard-like, mon≈øtrous Comus,</hi> before he wrote of <hi>fallen</hi> Men, and <hi>apo≈øtate</hi> Angels. Nor do I doubt but that the great <hi>Bunyan</hi> him≈øelf, wrote the <hi>Progre≈øs</hi> of ≈øome other Animals, perhaps of <hi>Mon≈øters,</hi> before he wrote that of the <hi>Pilgrim.</hi> Tho' I acknowledge, that there are no Creatures in the World, ≈øo di≈ø≈øimilar as <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Mon≈øters</hi>; ≈øince the former <hi>hurt</hi> and <hi>devour Nothing</hi>; the latter, <hi>EVERY THING</hi>!</p>
