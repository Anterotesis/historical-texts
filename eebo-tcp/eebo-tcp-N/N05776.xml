            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE MONSTER OF MONSTERS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is hoped that the common idle Stories about <hi>Monſters</hi> and <hi>Prodigies,</hi> which amuſe and pleaſe the Vulgar, while they diſguſt ſober and reaſonable Men, will be no inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable Objection againſt the enſuing Narrative: Tho' the Author is aware, that the Frequency of ſuch Tales, which are ſoon found to be deſtitute of all Truth and Reality, will be a conſiderable Prejudice to it. But let its Reception be what it will, he thinks the Subject of it too ſingular and remarkable, to have no publick Notice taken of it. And in full Confidence, that the Truth will, at length, ſurmount all Obſtacles, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the moſt determin'd Infidelity, he can chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully riſque all the Credit he has in the World, whether more or leſs, upon the Verity of what follows.</p>
            <p>THERE lately appeared, in this <hi>Metropolis,</hi> a MON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STER of the moſt hideous Form, and terrible Aſpect; ſuch an one as was never before ſeen in <hi>America</hi> by any Man's Eyes; and, I believe, no where elſe; to be ſure not in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions. There was indeed one
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007332_0003_102B5A1DD6C6A870"/>
formerly a little like him in <hi>Turkey:</hi> another in <hi>Italy</hi>; and, as ſome ſay, there is one in <hi>France</hi> at this Day. He had more Heads and Horns than any Beaſt deſcribed in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi>; and puſhed more furiouſly than the He-Goat in <hi>Daniel.</hi> His Teeth reſembled thoſe of an overgrown Lion: His Trunk was like that of an Elephant; the Protuberance on his Back, like that of a Camel; his Eye (for he had only one with all his Heads) was like that of <hi>Polyphemus</hi>; his Ears were of a much greater Longitude than thoſe of good <hi>St. Francis's traying Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory</hi>: The Wings which came out of his Sides, were like thoſe of an Eagle: his Hair (or rather Feathers) was like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's,</hi> after he was driven from among Men; his Claws, like thoſe of a Bear, only much bigger; and for a Tail, <hi>Gulliver's</hi> Monkey was a Fool to him.</p>
            <p>FROM what Parts he was brought, I do not certainly know; and would not deceive the Reader by pretending to an Acquaintance with ſuch Circumſtances as I am ignorant of. Some aſſert that he came from the South; others, from the Weſt; and ſome, from the Eaſt: But I rather think (if he were not brought forth amongſt us) that he came out of the <hi>North</hi>; conſidering the Evils and the Deſtruction which his Appearance portended.</p>
            <p>HE was firſt ſeen here in a large Aſſembly of <hi>Matrons</hi>; who, one would have thought, from their natural Timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, muſt have been univerſally ſhocked at ſo tremend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Sight. But (<hi>wonderful to relate!</hi>) they were, almoſt to a Woman, greatly pleaſed with the Creature: And though many of them were not paſt the Age of Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy; yet I have not heard of a ſingle one that miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; nor indeed of more than about half a Score that were even thrown into <hi>Hyſterick Fits.</hi> The far greater Part were ſo ſtrangely captivated with this Monſter, that they fondled and play'd with him: and would even have
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007332_0004_102B5A20A68294E0"/>
taken him into their Laps and Boſoms, had he not been of too unweildy a Size. "What a pretty Lap-Dog, ſaid one and another, would this Creature make, if he was not of ſuch an enormous Bulk!" And a third even call'd him <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>k,</hi> as ſhe lean'd againſt his <hi>Proboſcis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOSE few Ladies of better Taſte, who ſpake of him as an ugly, deformed, over grown Beaſt of Prey; and would have had him immediately turn'd out of the Houſe, were cried out upon as having no Taſte at all; and even threatned, that they ſhould never come there again, to drink Tea and Coffee in ſuch polite Company. It is thought that two Attornies Wives, beſides ſeveral other Ladies of leſs Diſtinction, would have admitted him, had he been of an amorous Turn, like <hi>Fa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> and the <hi>Satyrs,</hi> to ſome Familiarities not ſo fit to be mention'd. <hi>Europa</hi> was never more enamour'd of a Bull; nor <hi>Leda,</hi> of a Swan: and both of them had certainly a far juſter Taſte than theſe modern Ladies. He was even voted, in Form, by them, who ought to be the beſt Judges of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be the prettieſt, handſomeſt Creature, they had ever laid their Eyes upon, in all their Lives.</p>
            <p>THIS Aſſembly of Matrons, not content with admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Monſter themſelves, took great Pains, both by Careſſes, and Threats, to gain others over to their odd Opinion. They decorated him with Ribbands and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, like an ancient Victim, or rather like an <hi>Egyptian</hi> God, by the Aſſiſtance of a Prieſteſs to be mention'd hereafter: and having firſt done Homage to him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on bended Knees; ſent him in that Dreſs, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Company of Ladies, who uſed to meet to dance, and to regale themſelves, at no great Diſtance from their own Aſſembly-Room.</p>
            <p>THOSE of the Club, who were ordered to eſcort him thither, came and ſaid; "Behold here, Ladies, one of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007332_0005_102B5A2353713FC8"/>
the moſt lovely, charming, adorable Creatures, that ever your Eyes were laid upon! Pray, good Ladies, join with us in our Admiration, and ſhare our Pleaſure. O! the Beauty of the dear Creature! See how he looks! View him all over critically and exactly! Who ever ſaw the like!—For the Entertainment and Delight of the Publick, (and in order to put Money into our own Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, to game with &amp;c. when our Huſbands are out of Humour) we have reſolv'd to hire a great Number of Perſons to carry him thro' the Country for a <hi>Sight.</hi> So good a Show will certainly give infinite Pleaſure to People of every Rank; at the ſame Time that it will bring in Caſh enough to find us all, in Tea, and Coffee, in Equipages and fine Clothes, in Citron Water and gaming Money, as long as we live. Come, dear Ladies, caſt in your Lot among us, and let us go Snacks! We ſhall all find our <hi>Profit</hi> in it; and others, their <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Amuſement.</hi>"</p>
            <p>MANY of this latter Aſſembly were as marvellouſly pleaſed with the <hi>Monſter,</hi> as thoſe of the former; and ſoon expreſſed their Readineſs to concur the Motion, for carrying him about for a Show. But a middle-aged Gentlewoman of a more refined Taſte, and who was both in Stature and Judgment, Superiour to moſt, even of the other Sex, ſtood up; and ſpake to this Purpoſe. "What <hi>Demon</hi> has gotten Poſſeſſion of you, my dear Ladies! and deprives you of your Senſes to ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to make you take this filthy Monſter for a Beauty! I am afraid to come near him, leaſt he ſhould hook up my Petticoats, and rip up my Stays, if nothing worſe! And how he whiſks his naſty Tail in your Faces, at many Yards diſtance! Mercy on us! This a Beauty! Look on thoſe Ears! See that plaguy hump Back! View that bloody, ferocious Eye; if you can look ſteadily upon it! See thoſe diabolical Horns! Look on that triple Row of <hi>Ivory,</hi> in each of his enormous Jaws! And how he "Grins horribly, a ghaſtly Smile!" Obſerve
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007332_0006_102B5A24D7442D40"/>
his Feet, how they are Cloven; branching out into five or ſix Claws, of huge Length and Thickneſs! A pretty Creature, upon my Conſcience, for Women to be taken with! How much better you like <hi>Horns,</hi> than your Spouſes do? This a Creature, to be carried about the Country for an agreable Spectacle! And becauſe you are run mad, forſooth! we muſt run mad to keep you Company; or elſe fall under your Diſpleaſure! No truly! I like not your fancy; nor this ſtrange Propoſal! If you ſhould ſend this more than <hi>Cerberian-mouth'd</hi> Monſter through all the Towns in the Province, take my Word for it, you would rather fright the Inhabitants out of them, than draw Spectators about him. And tho' you expect to get ſo much Money by this Show, I am much miſtaken if you would get enough to defray the Charges of carting it about. People will rather conclude you ſend a Monſter to devour and deſtroy, than a Spectacle to entertain and delight, them! Fye upon it, Ladies! What evil Spirit put this Notion into your Heads; and deludes you at ſuch a Rate! To be plain with you, you had far better hire a Score or two of the ſturdieſt Butchers in the Town, to kill this horrible Creature out-right, before he does any Miſchief; and to throw him, Piece-meal, into the Dock, than run the Riſque of keeping him alive a ſingle Day. What would become of us all, if he ſhould break his Chain, get out of his Cage, and range about at large, ſeeking whom to devour! Doors and Locks, and Bolts, and Bars, would be no Security againſt him. He (having a Faculty of contracting and enlarging himſelf at Pleaſure) would eaſily climb into our Bed Chambers; and tho' we ſhould hide ourſeves down in our <hi>Wine Cellars</hi> among the <hi>Caſks</hi>; he would find us out even there; drag us into Day Light, and gorge himſelf with our mangled Carcaſes! A pretty Creature to be kept for a Show, truly! Thus ſpake Mrs. GRACCHA; for that was the Name of this accompliſh'd Lady.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:007332_0007_102B5A26683B60A0"/>THIS Speech was ſoon ſeconded and thirded by other Ladies of great Merit Madam CORNELIA in particular, (an open, plain-hearted Lady; and in high Eſteem, tho' <hi>low of Stature</hi>) amongſt other Things very pertinent to the Occaſion ſaid; "Well! I am equally ſurprized, Ladies, at your Taſte and at your Judgement. I wonder you can imagine that ſuch a Spectacle as you propoſe, can be reliſhed by the People of this Country; or that any good can come of this Project. Are you really in earneſt, Ladies! Why! Do you not remember, when a <hi>Leopard</hi> only was carried about for a Show, a few Years ſince, what Confuſion and Terror People were thrown into! Not only thoſe of our own Sex; but the Men alſo; even ſome of the <hi>Military</hi> Order! Was not the Conſternation ſtill greater, and more univerſal, when the <hi>Lion</hi> was carted about, ſome Time before? What terrible Apprehenſions had People of his breaking from his Durance, and eating them half up! And more lately, when there was only a <hi>Wild-Cat</hi> of uncommon Size and fierceneſs, and longer Fangs than uſual, carried from Place to Place; you have not, ſurely, forgot how precipitately even ſuch brave, valiant Men as C—pt—ins and C—ll—n—ls fled before it; leaving the Towns where they reſpectively lived, upon the firſt News of its approach! The Courage of ſuch Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, was never doubted by any one; And it is certain they would have ſingly encountered the whole Rebel Army in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the <hi>Pretender</hi> at its Head! But the People of this Country, I ſay, cannot endure <hi>wild Beaſts,</hi> and <hi>Lawleſs Devourers!</hi> How then, Ladies, in the Name of Amazement, can it enter into your Thoughts, that they will be delighted with a Monſter! eſpecially ſuch an huge, dreadful one as this; which might devour half a Country Village for a Breakfaſt; and be hungry ſtill! Will they give their Money freely, do you think, for ſuch a Show! When you reflect, Ladies, upon the Abborrence and Dread which they have of all <hi>wild Creatures</hi>; of all <hi>Beaſts of Prey</hi>; when you conſiſter how contrary ſuch
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007332_0008_102B5A27ECB81308"/>
Shews are to their natural Taſte, Genius and Manners; when you conſider farther, what Miſchiefs may be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done by this dreadful Creature; I ſhall think you ought to drink no Tea, except ſuch as is made of <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore,</hi> if you perſiſt in the project of carrying about this Creature; a Monſter, as much more formidable than a <hi>Lion,</hi> as a <hi>Lion,</hi> than a common <hi>Puppy-Dog</hi>!"</p>
            <p>THESE two Speeches, together with ſome others, were very attentively heard by the Club: And, in ſhort, made ſo good an Impreſſion, that the major Part adopted the Sentiments of them; and rejected the Motion of the other Club, after due Deliberation. Whereupon thoſe who preſented the Monſter to them for their Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, returned with him to their own Siſterhood, in great Wrath and Indignation for this imaginary Affront; and endeavoured, <hi>Thaleſtris-like,</hi> to inflame the Paſſions of the Aſſembly; which they found no very hard Taſk to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. The greater Part being now well heated with Anger; ſome with laced Tea, others with Gin, and ſome with Citron Water; they came to a Reſolution to ſend the Monſter immediately back again, with another Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; giving out their Menaces, concerning what they would do to any Lady of the other Siſterhood, who ſhould be ſo hardy as to reject their Propoſal a ſecond Time. "My Word for it, ſays one, that Lady that ſhall dare to open her Lips in diſparagement of this rare, curious, lovely Animal, ſhall have her Pinners torn off her Head; and her Sack ſtripped over her Ears!" "And my Word for it, ſays another, although they pretend to be at leaſt our Equals, if not our Superiours; and to have as good a Right as we, to enjoy their own Opinion about the Beauty and Deformity of any Creature living; yet we will make them know the Difference, I warrant you! We are the moſt numerous Club; and will ſoon cauſe them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to our Determination; or pull all their Caps and Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles off! Do they call this, a Monſter? a dangerous Monſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007332_0009_102B5A2B3384EB48"/>
nor fit to be kept alive! I ſay again, we will have him carried about for a Show, let them ſay what they will: And they ſhall join with us too in this Project, or we'll know why; and that's more!"</p>
            <p>THE Monſter's greateſt Admirers in this Aſſembly, were (1) Madam RIXA; formerly a lean, poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, thought to be in a Conſumption; and who uſed to go very meanly clad: But of late Years, plump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to a conſiderable Magnitude; and become a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Belle,</hi> with her rich Lace and Ruffles; and almoſt every Female Ornament, excepting that of a meek and quiet Heart. Some idle People inſinuate, that ſhe got her Money by Gaming; and that ſhe never uſed to play fairly: but I do not concern myſelf about ſuch Matters.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) MADAM PROTEA; a Gentlewoman that was lately ſeen in Publick with a remarkable <hi>Head Dreſs.</hi> This Lady has many good Qualities: but is very variable and inconſtant in every Thing; ſo that it was expected her Paſſion for the Monſter, would have been but ſhort-lived. However, to the Surprize of every one, She, who never uſed to be of the ſame Mind two Days together, has, in <hi>this</hi> Reſpect, ſhown all the Steadineſs and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of a <hi>Saint</hi>; continues to extol the Beauty of the Monſter, and ſeems determin'd to live and dye in the Faith of his Charms.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) ANOTHER of his great Admirers was Madam RUTI<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>A, the Wife of a very fine, handſome Gentleman: to find whom making Panegyricks, with ſo much Zeal upon ſuch an ugly Creature, was a Surprize to all: eſpecially when this Zeal carried her to ſpeak even of her own aged Mother, with leſs Decorum and Reſpect than became her. For the good old Lady happening to be her Tenant, ſhe threatned that ſhe would turn her out, if ſhe did not approve her Paſſion. The Gentlewoman of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007332_0010_102B5A2D6640FBE8"/>
whom I am now ſpeaking, is ſingularly plain and modeſt in her Dreſs; commonly appearing abroad in a dark Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel Gown. She is a Lady of real and great Worth; but ought certainly to have been a better Judge of Propriety and Decency, as well as of Beauty and Deformity, than to have ſpake and acted in the Manner ſhe did.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) Mrs. AQUATICA (a jolly-looking, purſy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman; and a little aſthmatical) was alſo a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of the Monſter; nurſing it with much Tenderneſs, and a peculiar Fondneſs. Nor is this ſtrange, if, as ſome have hinted, ſhe was the real <hi>Mother</hi> of it; though by Means of an unlawful Commerce. But whether this be Fact, or not; and if it is, whether the Monſter iſſued from her Head, as <hi>Pallas</hi> did from the <hi>Thunderer's,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Mythology, or whether it dropped from her Belly, as the unformed <hi>Cub</hi> falls from the prowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ravenous Bear's; I confeſs myſelf unable to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Nor is it very material, ſuppoſing it to be her Offspring, whether the Foetus was originally conceived in her Brain, or Belly; ſince a leſs monſtrous Production could not have been rationally expected from either; nor a more perfect from the one than from the other. This Matron was the Wife of a certain great <hi>Farmer</hi> living out of the Town; who had many Tenants under him; and it is ſaid, he was wont to treat them with ſuch Severity, Haughtineſs and Inſolence, eſpecially in gathering in his Rents, that he has often been in Jeopardy of a broken Pate. But it is not the Huſband, but the Wife, gentle Reader, that we have now to do with. She, as was hinted before, was at leaſt the Nurſe, if not the Mother of the Monſter. And though ſhe has ſo liberally given Food and Nutriment to it, yet ſhe expects, in her Turn, to receive Nouriſhment from it. For although I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeak of this Creature, as being of the <hi>Male</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I would now acquaint the Reader, that it is really an <hi>Hermaphrodite</hi>; and has a Multitude of large Teats;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007332_0011_102B5A2F13CE3890"/>
at which many hope to hang in Rows, like ſo many ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pigs, or rather like Imps at the Teats of Witches. Nor need I obſerve here, what every one knows already, That though Monſters are ſaid not to breed; yet they frequently <hi>give Milk</hi> in prodigious Quantities. But then it takes the Produce of a whole Country to feed one. And indeed, if this ſhould live, I fear we ſhall find the old Proverb concerning the <hi>Sterility</hi> of Monſters, erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) ANOTHER of theſe Monſter-loving-Matrons, was Madam CAPILLA; a very ſleek, ſoft-ſpoken, double-tongu'd, roſey Gentlewoman; though, I think, ſomewhat older than either of the other. She was formerly the Wife of a Prieſt of <hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and herſelf a Prieſteſs. For which Reaſon, as ſome ſay, ſhe was employed to uſher this Monſter into the World, with all the Pomp and Ceremonial, practis'd by the Pagan Hierarchy: Tho' ſhe had not, for many Years paſt, concerned herſelf much about Religion in any Shape; but given herſelf up to Matters meerly worldly and ſecular, <hi>at the beſt.</hi> However, ſince the Sacerdotal Character is indelible, (although the Office is proſtituted ever ſo much, or even wholly renounced) a more proper Perſon, certainly, could not have been pitched upon to perform the ſaid Rites, conſidering for what Creature they were to be performed!</p>
            <p n="6">(6) A <hi>younger</hi> Lady than either of the former, was a conſiderable Admirer of, and a warm Advocate for, the Monſter. She is remarkable for a Chin, ſomewhat immoderate in Length; and wears both <hi>Night</hi> and <hi>Day</hi> a very large <hi>Beauty Spot</hi> upon her right Cheek: In which there is this farther obſervable, that it is very difficult to take it off, without taking the <hi>Skin</hi> away with it! This Lady was very lately in high Eſteem in the Town: And although her Conduct with Relation to the Monſter, has been exceptionable; yet it is not doubted but that Time,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007332_0012_102B5A31CC226E18"/>
and a circumſpect Behaviour, will reſtore a Lady of ſo many laudable Qualities, to her former Reputation.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) Mrs. BIDDY brings up the Rear of all theſe Ladies; and Claims a very particular Notice. She is the Wife of a certain valiant C—ll—n—l; and, in Imitation of him, wears a great Tuft of Feathers on the top of her Head; ſo weighty, that it is thought to have overſtrain'd, and weaken'd, that tender Part; and made her a little giddy. She pretends to a great deal of Religion; tho' but few think ſhe has more Virtue than her Neighbours. She has the Misfortune to have a very ſly, cunning, <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Look; and not being of the faireſt Complexion, nor able to look a good Chriſtian in the Face; ſome have ſuſpected her to be of <hi>that Religion</hi>; and hinted, that the only Reaſon why ſhe is not conformed to 'its whole Ritual, is her <hi>Sex.</hi> Yea, many are very confident, that ſhe is an Iſr...I...te.. ind...d..... bating this ſingle Branch of the Character, that in ſuch Perſons there is <hi>no Guile.</hi> I muſt confeſs that I could not help entertaining ſome Suſpicions of this Sort, myſelf, upon a certain Occaſion; tho' I would not be uncharitable. For happening to dine with her ſome Time ago, at a Country-Inn, where we had nothing ſerved up, but one Diſh of roaſted Pork and Partridge together; I obſerved, Mrs <hi>Biddy</hi> ſeemed to love Partridge very well; but would not touch a Morſell of the Pork: tho' ſhe greedily took a large Sop made of the Dripping. And what ſeemed to enter into her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, I chuſe not to ſay!</p>
            <p>THERE are others who have ſuſpected Mrs. <hi>Biddy</hi> of being a follower of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Moſes</hi>: But, in my Opinion, with far leſs Reaſon. For whereas the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion forbids its Votaries to uſe the Fruit of the Vine, ſhe is a great Admirer of it: And is known to have ſpent the the <hi>whole Afternoon</hi> of the Chriſtian <hi>Sabbath,</hi> over her Bottle. But whether this is a <hi>concluſive</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:007332_0013_102B5A34A539A9C0"/>
Argument, or not, that ſhe is no Diſciple of the <hi>Arabian Impoſtor,</hi> I think it is at leaſt a <hi>fair</hi> one, that ſhe is <hi>no Chriſtian.</hi> If ſhe is really a <hi>Jeweſs,</hi> as I am rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think, it is to be hoped, that, ſince her <hi>Sex</hi> will not allow of the moſt diſtinguſhing <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtick</hi> of that Perſwaſion, ſhe will not always want another, which is very compatible thereto; I mean that ſhe will not be long <hi>unc...re...m<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Nor is this a neceſſary Omiſſion; ſince we know that this Rite was no peculiar Part of their <hi>ancient Temple-Service:</hi> And indeed Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has ſhown the great Need and Advantage of it; and the good that is done by it, to this People, even in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where not ſo much as <hi>Synagogues</hi> are allow'd of. But this is a Digreſſion: and having thus paid my <hi>Devoirs</hi> to theſe Female Worthies, I now return to the Monſter, and my Narrative.</p>
            <p>THE Monſter was ſent back almoſt Inſtantaneouſly, as it had been determin'd. Many Ladies of fine Taſte and great Merit, belonging to that Club which rejected the Motion of the other, (and which I call the Club ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for diſtinction ſake) had been abſent from it for ſeveral Days. The good Lady alſo, who had lately ſaid ſo much in derogation from the Glory of the Monſter, had by this Time left the Company, to look after her Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Affairs. Some others, of her Opinion, had alſo done the ſame; and ſome had abſented themſelves through Cowardice. Some of <hi>this Siſterhood</hi> who were preſent, were intimidated by the Threats of the <hi>other</hi>: And ſome, it is ſaid, were turned from their former Opinion, chiefly by the Efficacy of <hi>laced Tea,</hi> and <hi>Citron Water</hi>; with which they were plentifully regaled, at the Coſt of thoſe who labour'd their Converſion. So that, in ſhort, when this grave Siſterhood came to Vote a ſecond Time, it was
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007332_0014_102B5A36EBA60E98"/>
carried in favour of the Monſter by a ſmall Majority; to the great Joy and Triumph of all that w-rſh-ped the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>IN that which I call the Club ſuperiour, (tho' the leaſt in Number) ſeveral Ladies ſignalized themſelves in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Monſter, ſome by their Craft and Subtlety, others by their Weakneſs and Simplicity.</p>
            <p>Madam MARINA (a tall Lady) who had often croſs'd the Ocean, and who was even when paſt her <hi>grand Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macteri,</hi> in <hi>an honeſt Way,</hi> a true Votary to the Goddeſs which ſprang from the <hi>Briny Element</hi>; Madam MARINA I ſay, declared ſhe would not have been for keeping this Monſter alive, and exhibiting him as a publick Spectacle, had ſhe thought <hi>her</hi> Vote would have contributed to it, or been of any Efficacy towards getting a Majority of Voices on that Side. For ſhe knew there were enough without it.—</p>
            <p>Madam CHEMIA, (a very philoſophical Lady) who ſome Years ſince (as is well known) diſcover'd that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stone,</hi> of which the Royal Society has been in queſt a long Time, to no Purpoſe; Madam CHEMIA, I ſay, argued in Favour of the Monſter, only becauſe ſhe tho't that the Publick would be hugely delighted and edified with ſo curious a Show.</p>
            <p>SHE ſaid there was not a real <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> a true <hi>Adept,</hi> in all <hi>North America,</hi> but what would come to ſee it; "and the Populace, you know, ſaid ſhe, are always fond of Novelties and ſtrange Sights." This was <hi>her</hi> Motive. So that it is very malicious in any to inſinuate, as ſome have done, that Madam CHEMIA was on that Side of the Queſtion, for fear of being turn'd out of the Club. And indeed every one knows, that this good Lady never baulk'd or wrong'd her Judgment, to curry Favour either with Great or Small, Male or Female.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:007332_0015_102B5A387B5DA990"/>ONE Miſs POLLY, was alſo a Favourer of the Monſter; ſo far, I mean, as to give her Voice on that Side: Tho' I am credibly inform'd, that ſhe now fully vindicates her Taſte and Conduct, by ſolemnly averring, that ſhe held up her Hand quite contrary to her own <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> And for how many others in both Clubs, the ſame convincing and ſatisfactory Plea might ſerve, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to know! This Miſs POLLY is a young, dap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſpruce, coquettiſh Lady, and trips along the Streets like any Thing! But as young and airy as ſhe is herſelf, ſhe has of late Years affected to keep very <hi>ſedate</hi> Company: and ſhe was actually at conſiderable Expence to get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a Member of this grave Club; wherein every one is now ſurpriz'd to ſee ſuch a blooming Laſs, and in which there are ſundry Matrons that are <hi>very old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT not to digreſs too far from my Monſter..... All the People in Town, excluſive of theſe two Female Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and the <hi>Blacks,</hi> ſtood aghaſt; and hourly expected when the terrible Creature would break looſe, and devour them. Great and Small, High and Low, Rich and Poor, turn'd pale and trembled. The <hi>Trojan Horſe,</hi> when armed <hi>Creeks</hi> burſt by Thouſands from his Belly, did not cauſe half ſo much Terror and Conſternation through the <hi>poor, devoted City</hi>!</p>
            <p>THE Ladies who idoliz'd the Beaſt, and had already receiv'd his Mark in their tender, impreſſive Foreheads, now thought their Point gained; and diſcover'd their Joy in a Way ſomewhat too boiſterous, perhaps, to be very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming that ſoft and delicate Sex. However, there was one Obſtacle yet in their Way. The large Houſe, where they uſed to hold their Club, belonged to a Gentleman, <hi>without</hi> whoſe <hi>Approbation</hi> they did not <hi>incline</hi> to do any Thing of Conſequence. Nor were they out of the Way, in paying ſo great a Deference to his <hi>Opinion.</hi> For tho' he was only a <hi>private</hi> Gentleman (ſuſtaining no <hi>Office</hi> in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007332_0016_102B5A3A0CD81600"/>
the Government, whether Civil or Military) he was a moſt accompliſh'd Perſon; a Gentleman of a good Deſcent, and of a fine, as well as learned Education. He had travelled through many Countries in <hi>Europe</hi>; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved himſelf in them all. His Genius was ſtrong; his Knowledge of Men and Things extenſive; his Taſte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, his Addreſs winning; his Converſation equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and entertaining. With theſe Qualities, it is not ſtrange that he was acceptable to the Ladies, as well as to the Gentlemen; eſpecially conſidering he excell'd in <hi>dancing</hi>; tho' this I reckon amongſt the leaſt conſiderable of his Accomplishments. This Gentleman, though he was always backward to contradict the Ladies in any Thing, had dropped a Word or two, intimating his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of what had been propoſed; and what was indeed now reſolved upon. This came to the Ears of the Ladies, who could hardly believe it. It was therefore unanimouſly determin'd, to refer the Matter, in a formal Manner, to Him: And they <hi>obliged themſelves</hi> beforehand, tho' they were very much ſet upon the Thing, to <hi>ſubmit</hi> entirely to his Judgment; and follow his Advice.</p>
            <p>THEY accordingly laid the Caſe before him, in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the <hi>Monſter</hi>; with many Encomiums on his Beauty, &amp;c. The Gentleman (tho' he was naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with great Magnanimity) did not chuſe to venture into the Hall, where the Beaſt was, without taking a large Spear in his Hand. And ſtanding in the midſt, he accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ladies thus <hi>verbatim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Ladies, ſaid he, I am extremely obliged to you for the <hi>Compliment</hi> you are pleaſed to pay to my Taſte and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; tho' I am not leſs aſtoniſhed at <hi>your own.</hi> I muſt confeſs that I have had ſome Knowledge both of Men, and of Beaſts. As you are pleaſed to demand my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I think I am obliged to tell you, that I wonder at the Oddity of your Fancy, and cannot approve your Project. This a lovely Creature! How can you beſtow your ſweet Careſſes and Endearments on him! how worſhip ſuch a Monſter? the <hi>Compendium</hi> of all Deformity! This Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007332_0017_102B5A3E007460F8"/>
will devour <hi>you,</hi> your <hi>Huſbands,</hi> your <hi>Children,</hi> and one half the Province; and the other half, he will keep in perpetual <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Slavery!</hi> Ah! ſweet Ladies all! you little think what you are doing! Are the good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Country to be kept in <hi>bodily Terror</hi> by a Brute? by the moſt deform'd of all Brutes! ſuch an one as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they, nor their Grandmothers, ever ſtar'd at! ſuch an one as the Monſter-breeding-<hi>Nile</hi> never produced! They had rather combat Tygers at <hi>Epheſus</hi>; or the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Monſter, that made ſuch Havock with <hi>Regulus</hi>'s Army! They cannot endure the Thoughts of a total <hi>Exciſion,</hi> by the voracious Jaws of this <hi>Dragon,</hi> this <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>! this....... what ſhall I call him? I can ſcarce for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear plunging this Spear into his Heart, this very Inſtant, without farther Ceremony; But Ceremony is what the Ladies always expect; and Men of Honour always uſe towards them. Nor will I tell you, that you have forgot the natural Softneſs and Delicacy of your Sex and <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> and are turn'd <hi>Amanons</hi> and <hi>Termagants,</hi> or elſe you could not be pleaſed with ſuch a Spectacle. No! But I aſſure you Ladies, that you will neither oblige the People, nor get much Money, by exhibiting ſuch a Show! My Advice is, that you get the ingenious Mr. <hi>Hurd</hi> to engrave the Monſter on a Copper Plate; and diſperſe the Prints of him about the Country. If the Image and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription <hi>pleaſes,</hi> it will be Time enough then, to ſend about the Original. Should you immediately ſend about the Monſter, in <hi>propria perſona,</hi> (excuſe a Latin Word or two Ladies, though you ſhould not underſtand it) you would raiſe a Suſpicion in People, that you had ſome bad Deſign not only upon their <hi>Pockets</hi>; but upon their <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Lives.</hi> You would certainly ſet them all to <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> except <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and a few other very grave, ſolid Folks: And Ladies always abhor Oaths! Beſides, if the People once get to SWEARING, it is odds but they will alſo get to <hi>Lying,</hi> and <hi>perjuring</hi> themſelves! You are pleaſed in ſhort to refer it to me, Ladies, whether you and they ſhall be Happy or Miſerable. I therefore reſolve, as
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007332_0018_102B5A3FC1542A08"/>
far as in me lyes, that both ſhall be <hi>happy</hi>; and think myſelf <hi>ſo,</hi> in having a Thing of this Nature ſubmitted to my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. You will excuſe my Freedom, Ladies; and do me the Juſtice to believe, that I would gladly oblige you in <hi>every Way,</hi> except that of <hi>contributing to your Miſery.</hi> This I can never conſent to, even tho' I ſhould be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to incur your Diſpleaſure!"</p>
            <p>THUS ſpake the Friend of the Ladies, the Friend of all. It is impoſſible to deſcribe their Looks during the Time of his Speaking; and after he had done; — the Joy that appeared in the Countenances of ſome, the Shame, Diſappointment, and Anger, that were viſible in the Faces of others. But the Rejoicing was univerſal through the Town, amongſt People of all Ranks, when they found themſelves deliver'd from their former Fears. It was ſurprizing to ſee, and is impoſſible to expreſs, the ſudden Change that was produced in every Face: "Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from all terrible Sights; a quiet Enjoyment of what we have, and NO MONSTERS!" was the univerſal Cry; and ſtill continues the moſt common Health that goes round.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus finiſhed my <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> Narrative of the moſt formidable Monſter, that was ever ſeen in this Land; I now beg leave to Congratulate my dear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, that we are not without an HERCULES! This Monſter is not indeed yet actually killed; but only bound in ſtrong Chains. Whether he ſhall be quite demoliſhed, and ſent to his own proper Place, or whether he ſhall be permitted to live, to cram his mercileſs and inſatiable Maw with our very Blood, and Bones, and Vitals; depends upon my good Country Men themſelves. He now only lives till they ſhall pleaſe to paſs Sentence of Death upon him. And after what has been ſaid, it would be an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to their Underſtandings and Senſes, ſhould I go about, in a formal Manner to convince them, that it is not fitting and ſafe that he ſhould live, and be carried about from Place to Place, as the Women have propoſed. You will all quickly ſee the ugly Portrait, the dreadful Picture, of this Animal. And when it is preſented to you, take

particular Notice of his <hi>Horns,</hi> his <hi>Teeth,</hi> and his terrible <hi>Claws</hi>: tho' even his Tail (as inconſiderable a Member as that is generally accounted in Animals) might prove a Beſom of Deſtruction. A ſingle Bruſh or Flap of it would ſweep us away Dozens and Scores!</p>
            <p>YOU will at once conclude, that this Dog of H—ll, ought not only to have his enormous Length of Ears and Tail diminiſhed; his Teeth pulled out, and his Claws paired, but that his very Head (or Heads rather; for they are many!) ought to be excis'd; I mean <hi>cut off.</hi> Or if that cannot be done, you will think he ſhould be bound, at leaſt for one thouſand <hi>prophetick Years</hi>; and caſt into the bottomleſs Abyſs; not to be ſeen again above Ground, till that term is expir'd, or till <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> ſhall make their Appearance, ſpringing ſpontaneouſly from the Slime and Filth of the Earth; according to a certain Learned <hi>Expoſitor!</hi> This Creature may indeed make a tolerable Show, in the nether Regions, amongſt his Black cloven footed Brethren: (tho' I believe he would at firſt ſtartle even them) But certainly he ought not to be ſeen by any, that are yet out of the Place of <hi>Dragons!</hi>

            <p>BUT when the true <hi>Effigies</hi> of this dreadful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comes out; you will then be able, my loving Countrymen, to form an exact Idea of him. And after ſeeing this Print, he that can deſire to ſee the <hi>Original</hi>; or would willingly ſuffer the Creature to be kept alive for a Show, would deſerve no better a Fate in my Opinion, than to become Food and Suſtenance for him; juſt as Cats and Dogs and Monkeys and other inferiour Animals, are thrown to Lions to prey upon: Tho' it would of the two, be more honourable to Share the Fate of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Animals, in falling a Sacrifice to the noble, renowned, <hi>hereditary Monarch</hi> of the <hi>Foreſt</hi>; than to be devoured by ſuch an unheard of, upſtart, unlicked, miſcreated Monſter! It is to be hoped that what has been ſaid will have no Tendency to excite any undue Reſentment againſt the Ladies I have had Occaſion to ſpeak of in this Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative. Many if not all of thoſe Women, who were for

keeping this Creature for a Show, had doubtleſs a kind and generous Intention to gratify Peoples Curioſity; not being aware of the Danger attending their Project, and of the fatal Evils that might follow from it. They were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly out in their <hi>own Taſte</hi>; and under a great Miſtake about <hi>ours.</hi> But Errors of this Nature ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked and forgiven: Eſpecially if they are not obſtinately <hi>perſiſted</hi> in, but ſeaſonably <hi>recanted.</hi> I would therefore, my dear Countrymen, conclude by earneſtly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Ladies to your <hi>beſt Affections</hi> (at leaſt thoſe of them that are either Widows or Maidens) and this I do the rather, becauſe it is impoſſible for thoſe who <hi>Love</hi> ſuch pretty, well-proprtion'd, charming Creatures as WOMEN, not to hate MONSTERS.</p>

            <head>An ADVERTISEMENT, That is too long by one half.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the preceeding Narrative, having hitherto been ſpeaking in <hi>Jeſt,</hi> thinks its now Time to ſpeak in <hi>Earneſt.</hi> Having a leiſure Hour or two, I tho't to amuſe my ſelf by writing ſomething in the fabulous, romantick, <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous</hi> Way; in Imitation of many Perſons both ancient and modern. And from the Reception which many Things of this ſort meet with from the greater Part of Readers, I did not know but I might innocently divert ſome others, as well as my ſelf.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Romance was finiſhed, I ſhow'd it to a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> who is my very good Friend; (a better Friend to me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, than I ſhall prove to him in the End) and a Perſon whoſe Judgment I highly value. He frankly told me that he <hi>approved</hi> of it, and tho't it would <hi>take;</hi> adding that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd he could get a Penny by it theſe hard Times; at leaſt enough to pay him for his <hi>Labour, Paper,</hi> and the <hi>Wear</hi> of his <hi>Preſs</hi> and <hi>Types;</hi> which he look'd upon as no inconſiderable Matter for a Printer at this Day! I accordingly gave him a Copy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:007332_0021_102B5A46E2E7F190"/>BUT when the Piece was almoſt out of the Preſs, I reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what a ſad Propenſity there is in many Readers, to make <hi>invidious</hi> Applications; to wreſt an Author's Senſe; and to conſtrue the moſt harmleſs Romances into Satyre, Scandal and Invective, even againſt the greateſt and worthieſt Perſonages: I conſidered, that while ſome might make ſuch Applications thro' <hi>Malice,</hi> others might do it thro' <hi>Ignorance;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho't I could not, with a <hi>ſafe</hi> Conſcience, let the <hi>innocent</hi> Piece ſee the Light, without ſaying ſomething by Way of Caution.</p>
            <p>WHAT happen'd at the Printing-Houſe about an Hour ago, determin'd me to take this Courſe. The Printer aſſur'd me, he had found out my whole Meaning, as plainly as if I had told him my ſelf. <q>Yes, ſaid he, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a very ſad Church indeed! and well deſerves to be expos'd for her Idolatries, and for perſecuting the poor <hi>Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</hi> Why! ſhe is called the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> in the <hi>Bible</hi>! The <hi>Pope,</hi> or the <hi>INQUISITION,</hi> is the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. I dont love to judge Folks, but I am afraid the <hi>Pope</hi> is a very bad Man. I hope you'll write againſt him again; and defend <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> O! that <hi>INQUISI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION</hi> is a ſad, ſad Thing! What! may we not enjoy our own <hi>private</hi> Opinion in religious Matters! Would they make <hi>Slaves</hi> and <hi>Beaſts</hi> of us all!</q>
            </p>
            <p>ONE of his Journey-men, who aſſiſted in correcting the Preſs, ſoon put in his Oar: but rowed another Way. <q>Well! <hi>for my Part,</hi> ſaid he, I don't believe it is aim'd againſt the <hi>Pope;</hi> but againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſtward Indians;</hi> them <hi>Dogs</hi> that are not willing we ſhould enjoy our <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties;</hi> but would eat us all up alive. Well, the G-v-r—r is <hi>gone down;</hi> and I don't queſtion he'll give 'em a <hi>Bone to pick,</hi> that will make their <hi>Teeth</hi> crack again! I knew, before I had compos'd five Pages, that you intended the <hi>French King,</hi> by the Monſter which had ſo many Heads and Horns, and ſuch plaguy long Claws!</q>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER of the Workmen gave it as his <hi>ſolid Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that it was deſign'd as a Satyre upon the Women. <q>For Women, ſaid he, are ſet in a ridiculous Light, from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007332_0022_102B5A4886FC1218"/>
of it to the End.</q>
From which Imputation I clear'd my ſelf with ſome Degree of Warmth; thinking it equally a Reflection on my Breeding, Taſte and Judgment. Nor could ſuch a Thought have enter'd into his Noddle had he known how happy I am, in the <hi>beſt of Wives;</hi> and in two fine Daughters, tho' I ſay it, new marriageable; waiting (O ye dilatory, frozen <hi>Batchelors!</hi>) for ſutable Propoſals to be made to them.</p>
            <p>AS my Back was turn'd, I overheard an unlucky Jackanaps of a Boy, that ſtood by, talking to his Fellow-Prentice: <q>Witches for a Gueſs! ſaid he: and Maſter always was! I don't believe e'er a one of 'em is in the right: I'll wage it relates to****&amp;c.</q>
And ſo the Raſcal went on to make the moſt groundleſs, ſaucy Application of ſeveral Parts of it, that could be. I ſtamp'd, and gave the <hi>Urchin</hi> a ſevere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke for his Pertneſs, and Impudence; charging him never to liſp ſuch a Word again (eſpecially when he <hi>hawked it about</hi>) as he valued his two Ears! and ſo came away.</p>
            <p>AS I was going home, tho't I, if People go on gueſſing and gueſſing, applying and applying, at this Rate; and <hi>making</hi> Senſes, where there was none <hi>before;</hi> what may they not come to at laſt! The wild, extravagant Fancies of ſome, may carry them to fix ſuch an arbitrary Meaning to this idle Tale, as I almoſt ſhudder to think of! and as would leave a Sting in the <hi>End</hi> of it!</p>
            <p>NOW to prevent every Thing of this Sort, I think my ſelf bound in Duty to declare, that my Narrative (like moſt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers Stories) has not one Word of Truth in it. There has not, to my Knowledge, been any <hi>Monſter</hi> in the Town; nor any Thing like a Monſter. There has nothing happened lately which could naturally give Occaſion to ſuch a Fiction; nor any Thing to which it can be juſtly apply'd, in the Way of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical</hi> Interpretation. And the Perſons who ſhall attempt this, muſt be very ſimple, or ill-natur'd; for it is merely a Work of Fancy and Imagination; of which there is neither <hi>Type</hi> nor <hi>Antitype.</hi> And having declar'd this, I think I may <hi>innocently</hi> let it ſee the Light, as a very <hi>harmleſs, toothleſs</hi> Production; wiſhing that all other Romancers and Story Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007332_0023_102B5A4AA3F304A8"/>
had been as fair and ingenuous, to undeceive their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as ſoon as they had finiſh'd their <hi>Lies!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT if I muſt open my whole Heart, as to my Views in writing this, (which I have not yet done) I ſhall certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a little vain. For Ambition had ſome Share in this Production, as mean as it is. To tell the Truth, I have long deſign'd to write the <hi>KNAVE's PROGRESS,</hi> in Imitation of the <hi>PILGRIM</hi>'s, by the excellent Mr. <hi>John Bunyan;</hi> And I tho't, that by exerciſing my ſelf a little in this fanciful, myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Way of writing, I might execute that <hi>great</hi> Work the better when I ſet my ſelf about it. And you muſt excuſe my Vanity, gentle Reader, if I tell you, that I am not without ſome Hopes of performing the Task in ſuch a Manner, as may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me not wholly undeſerving the Title of <hi>his Succeſſor</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">If this little Attempt in the <hi>Romantick</hi> Way, meets with due Encouragement from the Publick; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſet about that <hi>large, voluminous</hi> Work alluded to, as ſoon as Leiſure will permit.</note>. <hi>Homer</hi> wrote of <hi>Frogs,</hi> (an ugly Sort of Creature) before he wrote of Kings and the <hi>Trojan</hi> War. Even <hi>Gnats</hi> employ'd the Pen of <hi>Maro,</hi> before it immortaliz'd <hi>Mezentius</hi> and other <hi>Heroes. Milton</hi> wrote of the <hi>Wizzard-like, monſtrous Comus,</hi> before he wrote of <hi>fallen</hi> Men, and <hi>apoſtate</hi> Angels. Nor do I doubt but that the great <hi>Bunyan</hi> himſelf, wrote the <hi>Progreſs</hi> of ſome other Animals, perhaps of <hi>Monſters,</hi> before he wrote that of the <hi>Pilgrim.</hi> Tho' I acknowledge, that there are no Creatures in the World, ſo diſſimilar as <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Monſters</hi>; ſince the former <hi>hurt</hi> and <hi>devour Nothing</hi>; the latter, <hi>EVERY THING</hi>!</p>
