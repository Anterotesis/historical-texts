            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS ON Mr. GALLATIN's SPEECH, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHEN a Speech of a Repreſentative is publiſhed in a pamphlet, and tranſmitted by its author through the country, it becomes a fair ſubject for a free candid examination. It is addreſſed, not to the houſe, but to the people; to convince, not his fellow members, but his fellow citizens: and invites a diſcuſſion, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but without doors. In my opinion, no ſubject better deſerves diſcuſſion, than that which this Speech embraces. It ſupports a principle, which, as I view it, muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, or it will deſtroy the government: for, if my judgment be right, both cannot ſurvive. Yet the opinion which I am about to ſupport, is, by the author of the Speech, even while he profeſſes to diſclaim political infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, bluntly declared to be palpably abſurd, and as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel as it is abſurd. Many things in the Speech will ſatisfy us, that the victory of the Conſtitution over the Houſe of Repreſentatives, on the ſubject of the appropriations for the Britiſh Treaty, is affected to be conſidered by this
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:033268_0004_0FF6B296892FBAF8"/>ſpeaker, as but half won; and this Speech, on a more popular ſubject, is ſpread over the country, to prepare the minds of the people for a more popular, and perhaps more ſucceſsful oppoſition to Conſtitutional principles, on a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture occaſion. The paſt diſappointment, the time for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, the character of the ſpeaker, and the humility with which his colleagues in oppoſition compliment him with the palm, as the <hi>coryphaeus</hi> of the party; induce a belief, that his doctrine is now diſplayed in all its force, and to the utmoſt expectable advantage. If the oppoſite doctrine can be made to appear neither abſurd nor novel, it will be gaining a point; and if, on inveſtigation, it ſhall appear to be rational and conſtitutional, it will be gaining a <hi>great</hi> point, for the ſecurity of the Government, and the happineſs of the people of the United Sates.</p>
            <p>As the incidental topics of the Speech are leſs or not eſſential, I ſhall confine my obſervations to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional principle involved in the debate which occaſioned the Speech.</p>
            <p>The Conſtitution, which veſted the executive power in the Preſident of the United States, declared that he ſhall nominate, and, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, ſhall appoint, ambaſſadors, other public mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and conſuls.</p>
            <p>In July, 1790, Congreſs paſſed a law, authoriſing the Preſident to draw from the treaſury a ſum not exceeding forty thouſand dollars annually, for the ſupport of ſuch perſons as he ſhall commiſſion, to ſerve the United States in foreign parts; and providing, "that the Preſident ſhall not allow to any miniſter plenipotentiary a greater ſum, than at the rate of nine thouſand dollars <hi>per annum,</hi> as a compenſation for all his perſonal ſervices and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; nor a greater ſum for the ſame, than four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033268_0005_0FF6B29934AE6788"/>five hundred dollars <hi>per annum</hi> to a <hi>chargè des af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</hi>" This law, as is often done when power is wiſhed to be retained, Congreſs limited to a duration of two years and the end of the ſubſequent ſeſſion<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>1</hi> United States Laws, <hi>175.</hi>
               </note>. In February, 1793, it was continued for other two years<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>2</hi> U. S. L. <hi>151.</hi>
               </note>; and in May, 1796, it was continued for one year; ſtill with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubſequent ſeſſion of Congreſs<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>4</hi> U. S. Law <hi>115.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>Of the different grades of public miniſters known to the law of nations, theſe laws provided for the compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two; the grade of miniſter plenipotentiary, and that of <hi>chargè des affaires.</hi> Before May, 1796, the higher of theſe grades, a miniſter plenipotentiary, had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed only to Britain, to France, and to Spain; to any other court a miniſter of the inferior grade had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. In May, 1796, the Preſident thought proper to appoint a miniſter plenipotentiary to Liſbon; and, in 1797, to appoint a miniſter plenipotentiary to Berlin: and correſpondent appropriations were provided by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, in May, 1796, and July, 1797, for thoſe years<note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <hi>4</hi> U. S. L. <hi>116.—5</hi> U. S. L. <hi>41.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The limitation of the former laws rendered it neceſſary to bring the ſubject of foreign intercourſe again before Congreſs, in the preſent ſeſſion, and continue the law of 1790. In diſcuſſing this clauſe of the law, "That the Preſident ſhall not allow to a miniſter <hi>plenipotentiary</hi> a greater ſum than at the rate of nine thouſand dollars <hi>per annum,</hi> as a compenſation for all his perſonal ſervices and other expences; nor a greater ſum for the ſame than four thouſand five hundred dollars <hi>per annum</hi> to a <hi>chargè des affaires.</hi>" Mr. Nicholas, an oppoſition member, propoſed to depart from the manner of expreſſion uſed in the law
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033268_0006_0FF6B216EC6357A0"/>of 1790, and ever ſince; by ſtriking out the word <hi>"ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary,"</hi> and inſerting, in lieu thereof, the words "to Great Britain, France and Spain;" and ſtriking out the words <hi>"chargè des affaires,"</hi> and inſerting, in lieu thereof, the words "any miniſter to any other foreign nation."</p>
            <p>This was an artful way of keeping the conſtitutional queſtion out of view, by ſeeming only to fix ſalaries.— It ſeemed to ſay, that only miniſters to Britain, France, and Spain ſhould have a ſalary of nine thouſand dollars; and a miniſter to any other court, a ſalary of but four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred. But as it fixed the ſalaries, not as heretofore, according to the princiles of the law of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the grade of the miniſter, but by the court to which he is ſent; it really ſaid, that the Preſident ſhould not appoint a miniſter plenipotentiary to any other court than Britain, France, and Spain. It acknowledged the ſtated ſalaries to be juſtly proportioned to the grades, but reſtrained the grades. It limited the power of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent not only in compenſating but in appointing miniſters. This is admitted in this ſpeech of Mr. Gallatin, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Mr. Nicholas's amendment. He avows, "that the effect of the amendment will be to prevent an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our political connections with foreign nations; and though <hi>this</hi> amendment will not annihilate that eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will effectually check its extenſion." Limitation of compenſation will be a limitation of appointment; and though the Conſtitution has veſted the Preſident with the power of appointment, and the power of conducting fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign intercourſe; Mr. G. contents, that it has veſted Congreſs with a power to defeat this power. This is the great point of his Speech.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:033268_0007_0FF6B259C181AA78"/>
He premiſes a doubt, "whether, although the Preſident may appoint ambaſſadors, a law may not be neceſſary to create the office, before an appointment takes place." On the juſtice of this doubt he will not rely, and he diſcards it as uſeleſs. What more proper introduction to an argument, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to ſhew a doctrine <hi>inſupportable, novel, and abſurd,</hi> could a man uſe, who endeavoured to prove what he did not believe; than to begin with raiſing a doubt of a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, acknowledged to be neither improbable nor novel; and not venturing to deny the doctrine, nor aſſert the doubt?</p>
            <p>He thus ſtates and reaſons on it. "The ſection of the conſtitution empowering the Preſident to appoint miniſters, &amp;c. recogniſes only the poſſible exiſtence of miniſters, and does not create the office; the office to any foreign court, where we have not had any before, is created by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident's appointment. And it may even be doubtful, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a law be not neceſſary to create the office, before an appointment takes place. This clauſe recogniſes alſo the exiſtence of judges of the ſupreme court, and not only does it declare, that they, like foreign miniſters, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, but another declares, that they ſhall exiſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Art. iii. Sect. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note>; yet it has not been contended, that the office of judges of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme court was created by the Conſtitution, or could be created by the mere appointment of the Preſident, without the previous authorization of a law, or that he had diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to appoint an unlimited number, or that he can now appoint more than the number limited by law: yet, if the Conſtitution, in the caſe of judges, gave the power contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, in the caſe of miniſters, the law limiting the number of judges would be unconſtitutional; for Congreſs cannot
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033268_0008_0FF6B219206D8768"/>diveſt the Preſident of any of his conſtitutional power.— "Still" ſays he, "it is not my intention to lay any ſtreſs on this argument; a diſcrimination may be drawn between the offices, and a different conſtruction has prevailed;— and it is not neceſſary to prove the conſtitutionality of our doctrine."</p>
            <p>Nothing contributes more to error in reaſoning, than ambiguity of words, and the uſe of words, now in one ſenſe, now in another, or applying different words to the ſame thing. By this uſe of language, any falſehood may be made to appear like truth. I am miſtaken if the ſpeech be not throughout a remarkable inſtance of this. It is ſtated in the above reaſoning, that the office of a miniſter, or that of a judge of the ſupreme court, is not created by the Conſtitution; that the office of a miniſter, to any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign court, where we have not had any before, is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Preſident making the appointment; and that the office of a judge of the ſupreme court, is created by Congreſs.</p>
            <p>Why, but to bewilder the judgement, the words, "where we have not had any before," were added, unleſs it be meant to confound office with officer, I do not ſee. The appointment of a miniſter to a court, where we have not had any before, will, by this reaſoning, be creating an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; but, if it were to a court, where there ever was a miniſter before, it would not be creating an office; that is multiplying officers is creating offices. On the ſame principle, increaſing the number of judges of the ſupreme court, is making new offices; it would look too abſurd to ſay it was making a new judiciary, or a new ſupreme court; yet, the office and the authority is the ſame thing, and officer and the perſon who executes the authority is the ſame thing, but the perſon and the authority is not the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033268_0009_0FF6B21AD6E242D8"/>ſame thing. The office exiſts, when there is no officer, as in the interval between the death, reſignation, or diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſole officer, and the appointment of a ſucceſſor: the office is then ſaid to be vacant, not to ceaſe. The powers of a ſole officer may be exerciſed only occaſionally, as the office of lord high-conſtable, or lord high-ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of England, or a dictator in Rome; in the intervals between their exerciſe, the office is not aboliſhed, but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended; and the next appointment is not the creation of an office, but of an officer. The ſame may be the caſe with offices, whoſe powers are exerciſed not by one, but by ſeveral; and adding to the number is not multiplying offices, but officers. This is the caſe of the office of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign intercourſe, of agency, or commiſſion to ſerve the United States in foreign parts<note n="*" place="bottom">U. S. L. <hi>175.</hi>
               </note>. The foreign intercourſe, the Preſident's agency or commiſſion in foreign parts, is the office; the miniſters are the officers; and the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one or more, as occaſion requires, is not the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of an office, but of officers. The conſtitution of Pennſylvania authoriſes the Governor, to appoint a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of juſtices of the peace, in each diſtrict; if, where there is but one, he ſhould add another, is this creating a new office, or only a new officer?</p>
            <p>Before the Conſtitution or any law of the United States exiſted, there were miniſters, and there were judges.— There are many offices, as judges, ſheriffs, coroners, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the peace, and conſtables, whoſe authority is not ſpecially defined, only by a written Conſtitution or Law, but alſo by cuſtoms and eſtabliſhed opinions. When it is intended by a Conſtitution or a Law, to adopt any of theſe offices, the Conſtitution or Law does not go back to all the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033268_0010_0FF6B21D9CA81AF8"/>previous eſtabliſhed definitions or limitations of authority, but conceiving them to exiſt, unleſs reſtrained, modifies them to the ſituation of the country or the principles of the government. In all nations, there is a legiſlative authority, a judicial authority, an executive authority, and an authority of foreign intercourſe. Theſe offices reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their internal and relative circumſtances, are created in each, whenever the nation takes its ſovereign rank; and are exerciſed according to the ſeveral modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of their government. While theſe ſtates were in a ſubordinate condition, they had not office or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of foreign intercourſe, they had no right to foreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, for they were not ſovereign ſtates. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Independence, by ſeparating the United States from Britain, and eſtabliſhing them as a nation, created in the United States the office of foreign inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. The Confederation declared Congreſs the organ of this foreign intercourſe. The Conſtitution changed this modification, and declared the Preſident the organ of the United States in their foreign intercourſe; and, from this declaration of the Conſtitution, the management of foreign intercourſe became a part of the Preſident's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional authority. From the exerciſe of this authority and all agency in it, Congreſs was excluded; and miniſters to foreign nations were no longer the agents of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, but of the Preſident.</p>
            <p>The Conſtitution was a new modification of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Union; and a federal judiciary, acting upon individuals, was a new power introduced into it. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was given to it, was taken from the ſtate judiciary. It therefore became neceſſary "to fix its juriſdiction," to define what part of the ſtate judiciary was taken, and veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the federal judiciary. The Conſtitution only eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033268_0011_0FF6B21FD66F1678"/>a ſupreme court,—and a power in Congreſs to eſtabliſh inferior courts, and limited the extent of federal judiciary, which Congreſs could take from the ſupreme court, and veſt in the inferior courts. This laſt was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, leſt Congreſs, in the organization of inferior courts, ſhould affect that part of juriſdiction, which is attached to the Preſident, foreign intercourſe. The conſtitution therefore excludes the inferior courts to be eſtabliſhed by Congreſs from all juriſdiction "affecting ambaſſadors, other public miniſters, and conſuls<note n="*" place="bottom">Art. iii. Sect. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note>." The firſt limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was neceſſary, to prevent any federal court from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching on the ſtate judiciary.</p>
            <p>But none of theſe reaſons, and no reaſon exiſted, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the framers of the conſtitution, to define the limits of foreign intercourſe. It was not a new principle, in the government of the union, for it exiſted under the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. It could not incroach on any ſtate juriſdiction, for no ſtate ever had it. It reſulted from the nature of the caſe, and exiſted immediately after the declaration of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence made the thirteen ſtates, as to all others, one nation.</p>
            <p>I will go farther and ſay, that the framers of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution could not define or limit it. For it reſted on prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples over which the United States had no control; but in concurrence with other nations. The Conſtitution could dictate the relations of one ſtate to another, but it could not dictate the relations of the United States with other nations. Thoſe relations are defined by a power paramount, the law of nations—the conſtitution of the civilized world. This law of nations is to the Conſtitution of any nation, as the Conſtitution of the United States, to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033268_0012_0FF6B29F4A484B30"/>the Conſtitution of any ſtate of America. This law, therefore, cannot be altered by the act of any one nation, without the concurrence of the others. The Conſtitution, therefore, is not ſo abſurd as to meddle with fixing its juriſdiction, and contents itſelf with eſtabliſhing its organ. Inſtead of the Congreſs of the Confederation, the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution eſtabliſhes the Preſident, reſtrained only by the Senate, as its organ of foreign intercourſe, and to him, ſo reſtrained, leaves all the authority on this ſubject, which the Congreſs of the Confederation had, or the law of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons gives to the organ of foreign intercourſe in any other nation. Part of this the law of nations eſtabliſhes to be, a power to ſend miniſters of different grades according to the importance of the ſubject or the parties. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to theſe grades muſt be determined, by what is neceſſary to ſupport the views of the law of nations. And if any other branch of the federal government, in which the power of compenſation is veſted, in whole or in part, ſo far exerciſe this power, as to defeat the lawful diſcretion of the organ of foreign intercourſe, that branch uſurps a power not given it by the Conſtitution, exerciſes the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or, which is the fame thing, reſtrains the exerciſe of the power, of the organ of foreign intercourſe, and violates not only the Conſtitution of the United States, but the Conſtitution of the great Confederation of the civilized world.</p>
            <p>How far a law was neceſſary, to eſtabliſh a Supreme Court, may not be neceſſary in the preſent diſcuſſion. I have ſtated that, though the office of a judiciary had exiſted in all ſtates, a judiciary in the federal government over individuals was (let me adopt the word) "created" by the Conſtitution. That a law was neceſſary to <hi>create</hi> a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033268_0013_0FF6B221A52CF7C0"/>Supreme court, cannot be inferred from the words of the Conſtitution, that the Preſident ſhall appoint "Judges of the Supreme court, and all other officers of the United States, whoſe appointments are not herein otherwiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, and <hi>which ſhall be eſtabliſhed by law</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">U. S. Conſt. Art. <hi>2,</hi> ſect. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note>;" for theſe words expreſsly refer to other officers, than judges of the ſupreme court; nor from the words "The judicial power of the United States ſhall be veſted in one ſupreme court, and in ſuch inferior courts as the <hi>Congreſs may from time to time ordain and eſtabliſh</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Art. <hi>3,</hi> ſect. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note>;" for theſe words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly refer to other courts, than the ſupreme court.</p>
            <p>That where the Conſtitution does not, as in the caſe of the Preſident and the two Houſes of Congreſs, minutely deſcribe the organization, a law is neceſſary to organize, is an idea more favoured by many than by me. Suppoſe now, (ſince much of the oppoſition argument reſts on the ſuppoſition of the Preſident acting extravagantly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly) that Congreſs had acted ſo extravagantly and abſurdly, as not to have organized a ſupreme court; and ſuppoſe that I were to contend for more than was contended for in the debate on the foreign intercourſe bill; and to aſſert that the Preſident could, without a law, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſuch a number of judges of the ſupreme court, as in his diſcretion were competent for the duties preſcribed by the Conſtitution; I wiſh to know by what arguments from the Conſtitution my aſſertion could be oppoſed. I ſhould have on my ſide, the conſtitutional authority, as ſtated in the Speech, "that there <hi>ſhall</hi> be a ſupreme court" with a juriſdiction fixed by the Conſtitution; and the conſtitutional authority of the Preſident to "appoint judges of the ſupreme court." I might be anſwered, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033268_0014_0FF6B2A178286378"/>would furniſh no ſalary. I would reply that Congreſs will not aſſiſt, but they will defeat a conſtitutional autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>That when Congreſs organized the court, and fixed the number of judges, the Preſident in the exerciſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional authority of appointment, ſhould not exceed that number, is conſtitutional and proper, for their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is properly a matter of internal legiſlation.</p>
            <p>But "not to lay any ſtreſs on this argument;" for really the queſtion is not, how the office of foreign intercourſe was created, but to whoſe management the Conſtitution has committed it; I will ſtate what I conceive to be the true limits of the conſtitutional authority.—To Congreſs the Conſtitution has committed the management of internal relations; to the Preſident, checked only by the Senate, the management of external relations. The Preſident, ſo checked, is the conſtitutional organ of all intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and foreign nations. Congreſs, checked only by the qualified negative of the Preſident, is the organ of all federal authority operating only on ourſelves.</p>
            <p>On the ſubject of foreign intercourſe, the Preſident, checked only by the Senate, has <hi>all</hi> legiſlative powers, and Congreſs has only executive authority. Congreſs has power in its deſcretion to make ſuch laws, eſtabliſh ſuch offices, and appropriate ſuch ſalaries for their ſupport, as our internal circumſtances require; and the Preſident is poſitively <hi>bound</hi> to execute them, and appoint ſuitable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. The Preſident has power in his diſcretion to make ſuch treaties, and appoint miniſters of ſuch grades, as our circumſtances relative to foreign nations require; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is poſitively <hi>bound</hi> to make ſuitable proviſions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations for ſalaries, &amp;c. If either the Preſident or Congreſs fail in the execution of the authority thus given by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033268_0015_0FF6B2A42BEC9930"/>the Conſtitution to each, their is a failure in duty, and the Conſtitution is violated:—And the Preſident would not act more unconſtitutionally and abſurdly, in refuſing to appoint officers, or in appointing incompetent officers; than Congreſs, in refuſing to appropriate ſalaries, or in appropriating incompetent ſalaries.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould not the Conſtitution ſo diſtribute the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative authority, according to the ſubjects on which it is to operate? Is not the Conſtitution the expreſſion of the will of the people? Is not the Preſident the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the people. And if <hi>ſafety</hi> require, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of making <hi>laws</hi> over only ourſelves ſhould be given to <hi>many;</hi> may not <hi>wiſdom</hi> require, that the power of making <hi>contracts,</hi> the management of all agency with other nations, be given to <hi>one?</hi> What chance is there, that the beſt knowledge of our true intereſts ſhould be found in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, rather than in the Preſident? What nation would treat with us, if the Houſe of Repreſentatives were part of the organ of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign intercourſe? The Houſe of Repreſentatives, with all its popular paſſions, would ſpend more time and money in diſcuſſing any foreign tranſaction, and with a reſult leſs wiſe, than the Preſident with all his agents, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting and concluding it. I know not what others may think, and my opinion may be wrong, but I think, that communications of our proceedings, in our foreign inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, have been too freely made, and have opened diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions and excited paſſions, which have little favoured our peace and proſperity.</p>
            <p>I know, and could anſwer, what may be ſaid of other nations. No nation is like ours: and I reſt on conſtitutional prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. The Conſtitution is the ſtandard by which this queſtion muſt be tried, and to it, therefore, muſt we appeal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:033268_0016_0FF66B93A8D60E48"/>
I ſay, therefore, that the Conſtitution has veſted in the Preſident, checked only by the Senate, the ſole manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of foreign intercourſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Let me, to avoid frequent repetitions, once for all obſerve, that when I ſay this authority is veſted in the Preſident, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mean the Preſident checked, as the Conſtitution directs, by the Senate.</note>; and, I ſupport this opinion by the words of the Conſtitution. "The Preſident ſhall have power, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators preſent concur; and he ſhall nominate, and, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, ſhall appoint ambaſſadors, other public miniſters and conſuls; he ſhall receive ambaſſadors and other public miniſters. All trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties made, or which ſhall be made, under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land<note n="†" place="bottom">Art. <hi>2.</hi> Sect. <hi>2, 3.</hi>—Art. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note>." The Conſtitution having eſtabliſhed an organ of foreign intercourſe, and declared the efficacy of its acts, it was not neceſſary nor proper, that it ſhould go farther; the law of nations, a Conſtitution paramount, would regulate the reſt.</p>
            <p>I ſay, alſo, that it is a general rule, that wherever, in the conſtitutional exerciſe of this authority, of managing the intercourſe of the United States with foreign nations, there is a neceſſity for the Preſident to call on Congreſs for money, they are bound to grant ſuch a ſum, as is ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the purpoſes, which he, in ſuch exerciſe of his authority, thinks proper to adopt and execute. And I further ſay, that it is a general rule, that no department of the government can execute or defeat the conſtitutional acts of another; and that, when any department has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionally concluded an act, and the exerciſe of the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033268_0017_0FF6B2A65F579AF8"/>authority of any other department is neceſſary for its execution, every other department is bound to exert its law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful authority, ſo far as is neceſſary for a competent execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the act; and has no diſcretion to refuſe ſuch exertion of its authority. I ſupport this opinion on the principles of the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The ſovereignty of the United States is not veſted in one man, or in one body of men; to be exerciſed by that man or that body, or by the agents appointed and remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by either. The whole ſovereignty is broken into portions or ſhares, and each portion or ſhare is veſted in a certain department; that each department exerciſing the whole of its own ſhare of the ſovereignty, and no department exerciſing any of the ſhare of any other, the ſeveral departments may mutually check each other, and no department may engroſs the whole ſovereignty.— Thus we have a legiſlative department, a judicial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, an executive department. There is no ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority or control in any of thoſe departments or ſhares of ſovereignty, over the other; though one may appoint, and another pay, a third; all are equal and uncontrolled within the limits of their power. The executive may pardon or remit a ſentence of the judiciary, for that is within its ſhare of ſovereignty; but it has no power to reſtrain the judges from paſſing a ſimilar ſentence, when they next paſs ſentence on a ſimilar offence. The legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature may alter a law, for that is within its ſhare of ſovereignty, but it has no power without altering the law, to direct the judges to alter their conſtruction of it. When the legiſlature has enacted a law, it cannot alſo conſtrue it, or judge of any man's conduct or rights by it; but muſt leave that authority to the judiciary. When the judges have conſtrued a law, or judged of any man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033268_0018_0FF6B2260477B510"/>or rights by it, they cannot execute their judgement; but leave that authority to the executive. The executive cannot exerciſe any of the powers given to the legiſlature or to the judiciary; the judiciary cannot exerciſe any of the powers given to the executive or to the legiſlature; and the legiſlature cannot exerciſe any of the powers given to the executive or to the judiciary; except in ſo far as the Conſtitution may truſt either with a portion of anothers power, and then it becomes in that reſpect a part of that other. Thus the departments mutually check each other, and (while none can encroach on the authority of another) mutually reſtrain each other from engroſſing the whole of the ſovereignty, and exerciſing arbitrary power. And all the departments are checked by the Conſtitution, and by the removing power of the elective branch. If the legiſlature or the executive exceed their ſeveral juriſdiction, the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary will declare the act void. If the judiciary exceed its juriſdiction, the executive may refuſe its execution. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe checks of each department over the others, each department has checks within itſelf, over the exerciſe of its own power, to prevent its acts from being raſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive. Thus the Conſtitution of the United States gives the legiſlative power to a Congreſs, compoſed of a Senate and Houſe of Repreſentatives, and directs, that no bill or reſolution ſhall be conſidered as an act of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, unleſs it have obtained the aſſent of both Houſes, and alſo of the Preſident; or, if he refuſe his aſſent, it muſt again paſs through both Houſes with the aſſent of two-thirds of each. Until it be paſſed in this ſolemn manner, it is not an act of the department.</p>
            <p>The judicial power is veſted in a ſupreme court, eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Conſtitution, and circuit and diſtrict courts eſtabliſhed by law. The judiciary department has its
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033268_0019_0FF6B22AC4D98808"/>checks in courts and juries; courts determining law, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries determining facts. Courts cannot determine law, till juries have determined facts; and the verdict of a jury is of no avail, without the judgment of the court. Thus courts and juries mutually check each other, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior courts check the inferior. The judgment of any court, acquieſced in, is an act of the department; if carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ſuperior court it becomes not an act of the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till the judgment of the ſupreme court is given, or till a judgment of an inferior court is acquieſced in.</p>
            <p>The executive power is veſted in the Preſident, and in moſt caſes, in the Preſident and the Senate. In thoſe caſes in which the concurrence of the Senate is neceſſary, the act of the Preſident only is not an act of the department, till it acquires the ſanction of the Senate. The concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſanction of both makes an act of the department.</p>
            <p>To this department is intruſted the management of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign intercourſe; but, as it is variouſly modified, I ſhall take the liberty to make a ſubdiviſion of this department, under the name of <hi>the department of foreign intercourſe.</hi>— The management of this department of foreign intercourſe is intruſted to the Preſident. All who are employed in it, on the part of the United States, are his agents. He ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, but without any law to direct him, uſes the agency of the Secretary of ſtate, in his correſpondence with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign miniſters here, or our miniſters abroad: and all our miniſters abroad are his agents. He may receive ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors and other public miniſters from foreign ſtates. But he cannot appoint any ambaſſador, other public miniſter, or conſul, of the United States, without the advice and conſent of the Senate. And he cannot, even by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, make a treaty, unleſs
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033268_0020_0FF6B22CF3AA0748"/>two-thirds of the Senators preſent concur<note n="*" place="bottom">U. S. Conſt. Art. <hi>2,</hi> Sect. <hi>2, 3.</hi>
               </note>. Theſe are the conſtitutional checks within itſelf, on the department of foreign intercourſe. The Preſident may, by his own act, receive a miniſter from a foreign court, but he cannot appoint a miniſter to a foreign court, without the conſent of the Senate; nor make a treaty, though he have the conſent of a majority, without the conſent of two-thirds of the Senators preſent. In determining therefore, what is an act of the department of foreign intercourſe, we muſt conſider what is the ſubject of the act. If it be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of an ambaſſador, it is an act of the department, on the reception by the Preſident. If it be the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an ambaſſador, other public miniſter, or conſul, it is an act of the department, on the appointment of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate. If it be the making of a treaty, it is an act of the department, on the ratification by the Preſident, with the advice and conſent of the Senate, provided two-thirds of the Senators preſent concur.</p>
            <p>Such then are the checks provided by our Conſtitution; a power of ſome other department to prevent any act of any department from exceeding its conſtitutional juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and a power within every department to prevent any of it acts from being raſhly concluſive on any other department. Thus the whole ſovereignty is exerciſed by all; but the whole ſovereignty is not exerciſed by any; and ſo an arbitrary power is effectually prevented: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Conſtitution be equally reſpected by all, or the removing power of the elective department be faithfully exerted. The authority intruſted by the Conſtitution, to one department, muſt not be influenced, directed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033268_0021_0FF6B22F2879D4E8"/>or defeated by any other; or there will be an uſurpation of power, and the conſtitutional authority will not be exerciſed by the department, to which the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution intruſts it, but by it and ſome other, or by ſome other only, or by it under the control of ſome other.</p>
            <p>The check provided by our Conſtitution is not a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of any one department, to exerciſe any of the powers of another, or to reſtrain another in the execution of its powers, or to defeat their execution. One branch of a department may prevent the concluding of its own act; but one department cannot prevent or defeat the act of another. No department can either interrupt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of another to a conſtitutional act of this other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, nor, after this other department has concluded its act, defeat its execution, by refuſing the exertion of conſtitutional power neceſſary for its execution.</p>
            <p>What was the intention of the Conſtitution in diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the ſovereignty into portions or departments?— Was it that each or any ſhould have a communication with the others or any of them? Surely not: for then no ſeparation would have been made, and all the ſovereignty would have been left in one body, and thus an arbitrary power given to it. To prevent an arbitrary power the ſeparation was made, and the communication muſt lead to an arbitrary power; to proſtrate firſt one department, and then another, under the feet of the department acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a communication of the powers of any other. The idea of communication is inconſiſtent with the idea of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; ſeparation is neceſſary to prevent arbitrary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; communication tends to make the will of one depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment defeat that of all the others; and diſcretion in one, with communication with the others, is but another word for arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:033268_0022_0FF6B231E2FC96B8"/>
While the proper department was proceeding to its act, could any other have reſtrained the exertion of its conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional powers? Can Congreſs make a law, that the ſupreme court ſhall not give judgment in an action de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending therein? If any one department cannot prevent another to complete its act, after the act is complete, can it defeat it? All departments are the agents of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and the Conſtitution, which authorizes the act, certainly requires its execution; and its intruſting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to one, and the execution to another agent, cannot be ſuppoſed to have been intended, that the powers be ſet againſt each other, and ſo nothing be done. Does not the prohibition to prevent the act, neceſſarily preſume a prohibition to defeat its execution? Can it be a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional act, and yet an act not to be executed? Can the check of the one on the other, without this preſumption, be effectual? Without this, will not the department in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the act, poſſeſs merely a ſhadow without a ſubſtance, and be like thoſe philoſophers who ſuppoſe there is nothing in nature but ideas; and worſe than they, as wanting power even in imagination?</p>
            <p>I may be told, that there is a department, which poſſeſſes power to defeat the act of another: for the Preſident may, by a pardon, defeat the judgment of a criminal court. This power is expreſsly given by the Conſtitution. In England, the court of chancery can defeat the judgment of a civil court. The court of chancery is part of the judiciary department. There and here the ſupreme exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive can, by pardon, defeat the judgment of a criminal court. I conſider the power of pardon, in criminal caſes, as analogous to the chancery power in civil caſes; a power to mitigate the rigour of the law, and give relief, where law could not relieve. In this reſpect, I conſider the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033268_0023_0FF6B25BEC7AD740"/>as acting in a judicial capacity, and concluding the act of that department. And I conſider his diſcretion as a judicial diſcretion, and like the court of chancery, bound by rules drawn from experience, in the exerciſe of this diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As this idea has not perhaps been ſufficiently attended to, I will not undertake to lay down rules for the exerciſe of the diſcretionary power of pardoning. But ſomething like this may be ſuggeſted: that this power ought not to be exerted, where, according to the rules of law, a jury could have acquitted, or a court have diſcharged; but it may be exerted, where greater miſchief may accure to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from the execution, than from the pardon of the judgment. Such exerciſe of diſcretion will not interfere with the conſtitutional power of the ordinary judiciary; for it is bound by rules, and cannot regard conſequences. <hi>Fiat juſtitia ruat caelum.</hi>

            <p>My idea of true diſcretion is this: where the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or where a conſtitutional act of any other depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does not interfere, every department has a diſcretion to proceed or not to proceed, in a particular exertion of its authority. But where the Conſtitution, or a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional act of any department, requires an exertion of the authority of any other department, this other department has no diſcretion to proceed, or not to proceed, to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary exertion; has no authority to examine, whether the department whoſe act requires its exertion, has exerciſed its conſtitutional diſcretion right or not. Every act legally concluded by any department, muſt, by every other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, be conſidered as <hi>rightly</hi> concluded; and, like a mathematical maxim, be received without proof. And in this caſe, it is not one department that abridges the power of another; but as Mr. G. ſays, 'it is the Conſtitution,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033268_0024_0FF6B233CDA9D168"/>which abridges the powers of both:"—The firſt cannot proceed—the other cannot look back.</p>
            <p>Such are my ideas of the uncontrolled power of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, their mutual checks, and their ſeveral diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I hope it will appear to every candid, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and attentive reader, that this doctrine "will ſtand the teſt of inveſtigation, and leads to no palpable abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity;" and, ſo far from being "novel," will to every reader who has ſtudied the principles and modification of the Conſtitution of the United States, appear familiar and juſt; and as old as the Conſtitution itſelf.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to examine the reaſoning of Mr. G. on theſe principles; and I hope I ſhall ſhew, that it is founded on a miſapplication of words, and a miſconſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of principles.</p>
            <p>He founds his reaſoning on this poſition;—"The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution has expreſsly and excluſively veſted, in Congreſs, the power of raiſing, granting, and directing the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of money." For this he ſtates his authority in the Conſtitution. "The 8th ſection of the firſt article de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that Congreſs ſhall have power to levy and collect taxes, duties, impoſts, and exciſes, and to borrow money on the credit of the United States. The 1ſt ſection em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically ſtates, that <hi>all legiſlative powers</hi> herein granted ſhall be veſted in Congreſs; and the 9th ſection provides, that no money ſhall be drawn from the treaſury, but in conſequence of <hi>appropriations made by law.</hi>"</p>
            <p>From his poſition ſo ſupported, he draws this concluſion, "that Congreſs are judges of the propriety or impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of making a grant, and have a right to exerciſe their diſcretion therein."</p>
            <p>I would obſerve that his poſition is not ſtated in the words of the Conſtitution; and it is no uncommon thing,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033268_0025_0FF6B272B1C55158"/>by changing the words of the Conſtitution, into words conveying the ſame ſenſe, and ſomething more, to draw from them a concluſion which the words of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do not warrant. For inſtance, the 7th ſection of the 1ſt article of the Conſtitution ſays, that "All bills for raiſing a revenue ſhall originate in the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives." One would think in reaſoning on this ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there would be no harm in ſubſtituting the words <hi>money bills,</hi> inſtead of the words <hi>bills for raiſing a revenue.</hi> But beſides <hi>bills for raiſing a revenue,</hi> there are <hi>appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bills,</hi> which are bills fixing a ſum of money, and declaring an object to which it ſhall be applied, and a fund from which it ſhall be drawn. Theſe may alſo be called <hi>money bills.</hi> Now by ſubſtituting, in the 7th ſection, the words <hi>money bills,</hi> inſtead of the words <hi>bills for raiſing a revenue,</hi> the ſection, ſo read, will be conſidered as reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Senate from originating an <hi>appropriation bill;</hi>— though the Conſtitution reſtrains the Senate only from originating <hi>bills for raiſing a revenue.</hi> Yet an <hi>appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation law</hi> may be made, without a <hi>law for raiſing a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,</hi> or without occaſioning any ſuch law.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not diſpute, whether the words of his poſition, <hi>raiſing, granting, and directing the application of money,</hi> do not ſufficiently expreſs the powers of Congreſs, as ſtated in his quotations from the Conſtitution; but, in the courſe of theſe obſervations, I ſhall have occaſion to diſpute, whether Mr. G. does not uſe them, to expreſs thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſomething more, which the words of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution neither expreſs nor imply.</p>
            <p>Not content with the words of the Conſtitution, "All le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative powers herein granted, ſhall be veſted in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs;" Mr. G. ſays, that this is <hi>"emphatically"</hi> ſtated. Perhaps he inſerted the word <hi>emphatically,</hi> thence to ſupport
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033268_0026_0FF6B274ECEA3EC8"/>his doctrine, by a concluſion, that the Conſtitution gives no legiſlative power but to Congreſs, and excludes the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of foreign intercourſe from all legiſlative power.</p>
            <p>The Conſtitution does not veſt all legiſlative power in Congreſs; for it declares that the Preſident ſhall have power, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent concur<note n="*" place="bottom">Art. <hi>2.</hi> Sect. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note>; and it declares, that this Conſtitution, and the laws of the United States which ſhall be made in purſuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which ſhall be made, under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land; and the judges in every ſtate ſhall be bound thereby, any thing in the Conſtitution or laws of any ſtate to the contrary notwithſtanding<note n="†" place="bottom">Art. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>It has been admitted that the Houſe of Repreſentatives claims no agency in making treaties; and even Mr. G. has admitted, that where a treaty needs no law to carry it into effect, or is not contradicted by any previous law, no interference of the Houſe of Repreſentatives is neceſſary; the Conſtitution declares a treaty to be a law of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States; and the Houſe of Repreſentatives is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of Congreſs; there is therefore other legiſlative powers granted by the Conſtitution, than thoſe veſted in Congreſs.</p>
            <p>In laying down his poſition, having ſubſtituted words of his own, inſtead of the words of the Conſtitution, on which only his argument muſt reſt, he thus reaſons from it. "We ſay, that Congreſs, having the ſole power of granting money, are judges of the propriety or impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of making a grant, that they have a right to exerciſe their diſcretion therein, and that the power of granting
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033268_0027_0FF6B236878FE9C0"/>money, for any purpoſes whatever, belongs ſolely to the legiſlature, in which it is <hi>literally</hi> veſted by the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The power of determining the amount of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation is a legiſlative power, the power of doing what is within the province of law, the power of fixing the rule by which a certain act is to be executed. The Peſident may appoint as many miniſters as he thinks fit, and if Congreſs, without having any right to exerciſe diſcretion, be bound to make proviſion for them, the amount of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney neceſſary for their ſupport, would alſo depend upon him; and the power of granting money, in that inſtance, would be transferred from the legiſlature to the executive, and alſo the power of raiſing money; for it is immaterial to me, whether he does it directly, or whether the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are bound to do it, according to his diſcretion."</p>
            <p>In order to determine, whether his reaſoning be fair, and his concluſion juſt, we muſt examine the juſtice of his poſition, by comparing it with the ſections of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, by which he ſupports it. He ſupports it by his quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the 8th, the 1ſt, and the 9th ſections, of the 1ſt article of the Conſtitution. Taking it for granted (and I believe it is true) that theſe quotations are the only parts of the Conſtitution, on which he could found his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to draw his concluſion; if his poſition, taking the words of it in the ſenſe which his reaſoning puts on them, be not ſupported by his quotations from the Conſtitution; his reaſoning, and his concluſion muſt fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>Preſuming that he ſupports his power of raiſing money, by the 8th ſection; his power of granting, and directing the application of money, by the 9th; and the excluſive veſting of theſe powers in Congreſs, by the 1ſt; I ſhall take the liberty to ſubſtitute in his poſition, the words of the Conſtitution, inſtead of his words. The poſition and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033268_0028_0FF6B238344C3AB8"/>concluſion will then ſtand thus:—<hi>All legiſlative powers herein granted ſhall be veſted in a Congreſs; Congreſs ſhall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, and to borrow money, on the credit of the United States; and no money ſhall be drawn from the Treaſury, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of appropriations made by law; therefore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Congreſs are judges of the propriety or impropriety of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a grant, and have a right to exerciſe their diſcretion therein.</hi>—STRANGE LOGIC!</p>
            <p>In his ſhort quotation from the 8th ſection, he has omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome words, immediately after the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts, and exciſes, and before the power to borrow money. I ſhall reſtore them to their place. "Congreſs ſhall have power</p>
            <p>"To lay and collect taxes, duties, impoſts, and exciſes, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence, and general welfare of the United States:—</p>
            <p>"To borrow money, on the credit of the United States."</p>
            <p>From the manner in which this part (and the whole) of this ſection is printed, I conſider the word <hi>to</hi> before the words <hi>pay the debts,</hi> as ſynonymous with the words <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to,</hi> and the clauſes omitted by Mr. G. not as giving two new powers, but as pointing out the objects to which the money raiſed by taxes, &amp;c. ſhall be applied. So that Congreſs takes this power of raiſing money, coupled with the duty of applying it to theſe purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Let me obſerve alſo, that this ſection which defines the powers of Congreſs, gives to it a power "To make all laws, which ſhall be neceſſary and proper, for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers, veſted, by this Conſtitution, in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof." I ſay that Congreſs takes all its powers, coupled with the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033268_0029_0FF6B27722950318"/>duty of applying them to the purpoſes, for which they were given by the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>That the Conſtitution determines, that Congreſs has the excluſive "power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, and exciſes, and to borrow money"; and that "no money ſhall be drawn from the Treaſury, but in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of appropriations made by law," <hi>and by a law made by Congreſs;</hi> I admit. But before Mr. G. can draw a concluſion, that Congreſs may, in every caſe, determine, whether it be proper or improper, to lay taxes, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate money, he muſt eſtabliſh ſomething more: he muſt eſtabliſh, from the Conſtitution, that Congreſs has in every caſe, a power to refuſe to lay taxes, or to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate money. This he cannot eſtabliſh either from his quotations or any other part of the Conſtitution: for it may be the duty of Congreſs to lay taxes, in order to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral welfare of the United States.</p>
            <p>Taking his poſition in his own words, "the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has expreſsly and excluſively veſted in Congreſs, the power of raiſing, granting, and directing the application of money;" before he can draw his concluſion, "that Congreſs are judges of the propriety or impropriety of making a grant, and have a right to exerciſe their diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein;" he muſt eſtabliſh ſomething more: he muſt eſtabliſh, that in <hi>all</hi> caſes, the man who has the ſole power of granting money has a power to refuſe. This he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſtabliſh from any principles of reaſon; for a man may have the ſole power to do a thing coupled with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute obligation to do it; as the Preſident to appoint judges of the ſupreme court; and the ſupreme court to give judgment in a caſe before it affecting an ambaſſador; or a man to pay his debt. Mr. G. therefore draws a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033268_0030_0FF6B279E1C9D378"/>without the neceſſary premiſes; and his concluſion has not foundation to reſt on, and muſt fall to the ground,</p>
            <p>If, by laying emphaſis on the word <hi>all,</hi> he means to prove that <hi>no</hi> legiſlative power is veſted in any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of government, except Congreſs, the ordinary legiſlature; I have ſhown, that this is inconſiſtent with a fair conſtruction of the Conſtitution. To found any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning on one expreſſion of any inſtrument, when there are, in it, other expreſſions, which would deſtroy that reaſoning, is taking a contracted view, and making an unfair and imprudent uſe of that inſtrument. The whole muſt be taken together, and if there be any contradictory expreſſions, they muſt if poſſible be reconciled, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſeverally to the reſpective objects in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of its author.</p>
            <p>If Mr. G. conſiders diſcretion, as ſynonymous with legiſlative power, and aſſerts, that in every caſe, in which an act of the legiſlature is called for, they have a diſcretion to act or to refuſe, according to their diſcretion; his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning will ſtand thus:—The power of raiſing, granting, and directing the application of money, is a legiſlative power; but every legiſlative power is coupled with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in the legiſlature, to exerciſe or refuſe its power; therefore the legiſlature may, in every caſe, refuſe to raiſe, grant, or direct the application of money. I have ſaid in <hi>every</hi> caſe, not only becauſe the diſcretion, which Mr. G. contends for, is co-extenſive with the power, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to <hi>all</hi> caſes; but becauſe there are ſome caſes, in which I admit the diſcretion to refuſe. And I have uſed the words <hi>may refuſe to raiſe, grant,</hi> &amp;c. inſtead of his words, "Congreſs <hi>are judges of the propriety or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the grant, and have a right to exerciſe their diſcretion therein;</hi> becauſe I admit, and therefore we both agree,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033268_0031_0FF6B27BAC0F6758"/>that Congreſs has a right to refuſe in ſome caſes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the diſpute is ſtated, as I have ſtated it, there would be no diſpute; and becauſe a right to exerciſe <hi>diſcretion</hi> to grant, without a power to refuſe, is <hi>no</hi> right: there can be no diſcretion, where there is no power to refuſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. G. admits, that where the Conſtitution, as in the caſe of ſalaries to the Preſident, and the judges of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme court, declares, that Congreſs <hi>ſhall</hi> grant; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is bound not to refuſe. But he ſeems to hold this opinion, "that the diſcretionary power of the legiſlature, to grant money, is limited only by the Conſtitution, and is not transferred to any other department;" and ſtating that, "when the Conſtitution means to impoſe a duty, it poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively directs the act to be done," he ſays "we may ſafely conclude, that where it gives no ſuch direction, where it empowers, inſtead of commanding, the reaſon is, that it meant to leave a diſcretion."</p>
            <p>This concluſion he ſeems to ſupport, by diſtinguiſhing between the word <hi>ſhall,</hi> and the word <hi>may,</hi> and he ſeems to conſider this, as the diſtinction between legiſlative power, and executive power; conſidering legiſlative power as coupled with diſcretion, and executive power as coupled with obligation; and as the Conſtitution, in ſome caſes, poſitively directs, by the word <hi>ſhall,</hi> there is no obligation on the legiſlature but in thoſe; and that, in all other caſes where the Conſtitution uſes the word <hi>may,</hi> or the words <hi>ſhall have power,</hi> the legiſlature has diſcretion.</p>
            <p>It is well eſtabliſhed and underſtood, that <hi>may</hi> is often conſtrued <hi>ſhall,</hi> and that <hi>ſhall</hi> is often conſtrued <hi>may.</hi> No man converſant in the legal conſtruction of language, will require proof of this.</p>
            <p>The Conſtitution declares, that "the Preſident <hi>ſhall</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, and, by and with the advice and conſent of the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033268_0032_0FF6B27DE3A0BE28"/>Senate, <hi>ſhall</hi> appoint ambaſſadors, other public miniſters, and conſuls;" the Preſident has never appointed an <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador;</hi> will Mr. G. recommend an impeachment for this breach of duty? Or, if the Preſident ſhould think proper to decline to appoint any public miniſter, would Mr. G. recommend an impeachment? "The Preſident <hi>ſhall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ambaſſadors and other public miniſters:" if he have reaſon to reject, has he not diſcretion?" "The Preſident <hi>may,</hi> on extraordinary occaſions, convene both houſes, or either of them." Suppoſe an occaſion requiring him to convene either or both houſes, and he wilfully refuſe; is he not impeachable?</p>
            <p>It appears then, that a poſitive duty may, without any expreſs command, be impoſed by the nature of the caſe. In many caſes, the word <hi>may</hi> impoſes as ſtrong an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the word <hi>ſhall,</hi> and the word <hi>ſhall</hi> impoſes no ſtronger obligation than the word <hi>may.</hi> The Conſtitution of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania declares, "that the legiſlature <hi>ſhall,</hi> as ſoon as conveniently may be, provide by law, for the eſtabliſhment of ſchools throughout the ſtate." Do the words, <hi>as ſoon as conveniently may be,</hi> weaken the obligation; or ſuppoſe them ſtruck out, would the obligation be ſtrengthened? Or, is the eſtabliſhment of ſchools better provided for, by the word <hi>ſhall,</hi> than if the Conſtitution had uſed the word <hi>may?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. G. admitting, that where the Conſtitution declares, that Congreſs ſhall grant money, there is no diſcretion to refuſe; obſerves, that if "declares, that the Preſident and Judges ſhall have ſalaries, &amp;c. Had the framers of the Conſtitution alſo intended, that Congreſs ſhould be bound to make proviſion for miniſters, they would have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a ſimilar clauſe in reſpect to them. The Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is explicit in one caſe, and declares, that ſalaries
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033268_0033_0FF6B23A6ED67698"/>ſhall be given: it is ſilent in the other, and does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that ſalaries ſhall be given." He concludes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that "the objection, that Congreſs cannot, in every caſe, exerciſe the diſcretionary power to grant money, cannot reach farther than the ſpecific caſe on which it is grounded."</p>
            <p>I will obſerve, that the object of thoſe clauſes in the Conſtitution, is not ſo much to bind Congreſs to grant money, as to prevent them from altering their grant. Its object is, to make the executive and judiciary independent of the legiſlature, and to deprive Congreſs of a power of influencing thoſe departments to ſuccumbency to the will of the legiſlature, and thereby of acquiring all power, and becoming arbitrary. This is evident, from the difference of expreſſion in the two caſes. The compenſation of the Preſident "ſhall neither be increaſed nor diminiſhed, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the period for which he ſhall have been elected." The compenſation of the judges "ſhall not be diminiſhed dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their continuance in office." The judges continuing in office during life, it is evident, that from the gradual ſinking of the value of money, which accompanies the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, there might, during his continuance in office, be a neceſſity to increaſe the ſalary of a Judge: therefore, it is only ſaid, that the ſalary of a Judge ſhall not be diminiſhed. But the duration of the Preſident's authority being only four years, the neceſſity is not ſo great, as to induce the Conſtitution, to ſubmit the Preſident to the influence of hope from the legiſlature. Therefore, his ſalary can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be increaſed nor diminiſhed, during the period of his appointment. If Congreſs could diminiſh the ſalary of the other departments, or, as the Pennſylvania Aſſembly, in the year 1796, did, in the caſe of Judges, when there
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033268_0034_0FF6B280C4D4D100"/>was a neceſſity for an increaſe, limit the increaſe to a leſs time than their continuance in office; the Conſtitution would be violated, the other departments would be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced to a ſuccumbency to the legiſlature, and a ſeparation of power, the guard againſt deſpotiſm, would be removed. The other departments would become the mere puppets of the legiſlature, and be reduced to that ſtate of dependency, in which the Engliſh judges were, before continuance for life was attached to their office: for it is the ſame thing whether you take away the office, or take away the ſalary, or make it incompetent.</p>
            <p>It would have been extending but a little farther, the ſame principle of reaſoning, if Mr. G. had denied, that Congreſs is bound to grant money, even to the Preſident or Judges; for the Conſtitution does not expreſsly ſay, that Congreſs ſhall grant, but only that the Preſident and Judges ſhall receive: and the obligation to grant is only implied. Had it been expreſſed, Congreſs, without a ſenſe of duty, could eaſily have evaded the words, by making an incompetent grant, or eſtabliſhing it on incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent funds. The duty of granting ariſes out of the power to grant, and the obligation to promote the views of the Conſtitution. The Conſtitution lays down only the out lines of the government, and leaves to the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the power, with the obligation to finiſh the reſt.—The Conſtitution does not deſcend to little matters. The Conſtitution does not provide, that ſalaries ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all the officers of the government. But ſurely, if there be an officer neceſſary for the regular operation of the Conſtitution, and that officer cannot be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſalary, Congreſs are as much bound by the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, to grant a ſalary, as if the Conſtitution expreſsly required it to be done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:033268_0035_0FF6B28272E528D8"/>
Mr. G. will perhaps allow this, but contend that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is to judge of the neceſſity, and that the power of acting is accompanied with the power of refuſing. "Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is, upon all occaſions, under a moral obligation to act according to juſtice and propriety. We do not claim the abſurd privilege of acting without ſufficient motives, but we wiſh every proper motive to have its due weight. The opinion of the Executive, and where he has a partial power, the application of that power to a certain object, will ever operate as powerful motives upon our deliberations." Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to embarraſs the argument, or to give it a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearance, in the more harmleſs names of right of diſcretion, and giving every motive its due weight; he avoids expreſſing the power to refuſe; though that be the only power really to be contended for. That Congreſs alone has the power to grant, is clear. A power to judge, without a power to refuſe, is nothing. And to contend for ſuch power in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to tranſactions of the other departments, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for an idle and uſeleſs curioſity into tranſactions, which they have no authority to conduct or control. To contend for that, and the power to refuſe, is to give the Houſe of Repreſentatives a compleat control over all the other branches, and veſt all power in the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives. For, as Congreſs only can grant money, if, where money is neceſſary to execute the meaſures of the other departments, the Houſe of Repreſentatives may judge of the propriety or impropriety of making a grant, and have a right to exerciſe their diſcretion therein; though they may grant, if they approve, they may refuſe, if they diſlike. If the acts of other departments are to be weighed as a motive, not reſpected as an obligation, there will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be wanting pretences for conſidering the motive as
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033268_0036_0FF6B284B26DED68"/>light. They will never grant the money, unleſs they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the meaſure. A right to judge of the propriety of the grant, is a right to judge of the propriety of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And thus every department, to whom the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution has intruſted the management of power, muſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it according to the will of the Houſe of Repreſentatives; that is, the Houſe of Repreſentatives will have all power: all the barriers of ſeparation will be removed, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſovereignty lodged in one houſe.</p>
            <p>I ſay the Houſe of Repreſentatives, becauſe though Mr. G. in making this claim for the Houſe of Repreſentatives, affects to claim nothing more for them than for the Senate; yet, in fact, this claim increaſes only the power of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, and adds nothing to the power of the Senate: for the Senate, as part of the department of foreign intercourſe, has already all control over theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which the eſtabliſhment of this claim could give.</p>
            <p>The doctrine which I would eſtabliſh, is, that all powers of Congreſs are coupled with an obligation to exerciſe them; that having a power to make all laws neceſſary and proper for carrying into execution the powers of Congreſs, and all powers veſted by the Conſtitution in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof; Congreſs is <hi>bound</hi> to make all ſuch laws; that in all other caſes, Congreſs are judges of the neceſſity or propriety of ſuch law, and are bound to make it, only when they judge it neceſſary or proper; but that, where a law is neceſſary or proper, to carry into execution a conſtitutional act of any other department, this other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment is the ſole judge of the neceſſity and propriety of paſſing ſuch law; and that, when this department declares the neceſſity or propriety of paſſing ſuch law, Congreſs is <hi>bound</hi> to paſs it, and has no diſcretion, but in chooſing the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:033268_0037_0FF6B23CB4E15698"/>beſt law, to give effect to the act of the other department. That, where the Conſtitution expreſsly requires a law, Congreſs has a diſcretion to refuſe, Mr. G. will not aſſert. Every one knows, that an implied obligation impoſes a duty as ſtrong as an expreſs obligation; and, that, to obſtruct the authority derived from the Conſtitution, is, in effect, to obſtruct the Conſtitution itſelf; for the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was made, for the purpoſe that its ſeveral autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities ſhould be adminiſtered by the departments, to which they were ſeverally intruſted; and be carried into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the ſeveral departments, to which the means were intruſted. If the Houſe of Repreſentatives, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, refuſe to paſs a law, which the conſtitutional act of any department has rendered neceſſary; the Conſtitution is as effectually violated, as if they had refuſed to paſs a law, which the Conſtitution itſelf declared to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
            <p>Surely a claim which would defeat all the views of the Conſtitution, in eſtabliſhing a ſeparation of power, a claim, ſo abſurd as to counteract the Conſtitution, muſt have very expreſs words indeed to ſupport it. Mr. G. is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this, and, without proving, aſſerts, "that it is evident that <hi>where</hi> the Conſtitution has lodged the power, <hi>there</hi> exiſts the right of acting and the right of diſcretion." But, to ſupport his aſſertion, he cannot appeal to any expreſs words of the Conſtitution. There are none ſuch. He muſt reſt upon general principles of conſtruction. But I have already obſerved that general principles will not ſupport his doctrine; for there may be power coupled with obligation, or power without any diſcretion.</p>
            <p>It is not neceſſary for me, to diminiſh the force of the clauſe reſpecting appropriations, by conſidering it as a matter of form. It is ſubſtantial, that no money ſhall be
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033268_0038_0FF6B28761C74338"/>drawn from the treaſury but in conſequence of a law. But this does not eſtabliſh, that Congreſs is free to refuſe to paſs a law for that purpoſe; or has, in all caſes, a right to enquire into the propriety of the meaſures, which have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the neceſſity for raiſing money. The limitation, to two years, of appropriations for raiſing armies, is not impoſed as a reſtraint of Congreſs over the Executive, but as a reſtraint of one Congreſs over another. It may be obſerved, from this clauſe, that the power of appropriating money gives a control over the ſubject; and, if this power be coupled with diſcretion in all caſes, gives a control in all caſes. If there be no limitation to the exerciſe of this diſcretion, but the judgment of the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as there is no power to control their judgment, they only will judge of the weight of their motives, and will always think they judge right; and there will be no limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the power of the Houſe of Repreſentatives. Thus all ſeparation of power will be removed, and arbitrary power will be veſted in one branch of the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>Who gave the Houſe of Repreſentatives a right to ſet itſelf up as the ſole organ of ſovereignty, as the ſole judge of propriety; over its compeers in authority, "erecting itſelf into a high prieſt of the Conſtitution, aſſuming the keys of political ſalvation, and damning, without mercy, whoſoever differs with it in opinion?" Is <hi>it</hi> any thing more than a fellow-ſervant with the other departments, like them, by the Conſtitution, the lord of all, limited to its own portion of authority, and, by the Conſtitution, bound to lend its aſſiſtance to them, whenever their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional authority calls for it; as much as each of them is bound towards it? Whenever a law is made, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary is bound to carry into execution the view of the legiſlature; by lending their power to determine on it.—
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:033268_0039_0FF6B23EE7B6CB38"/>They have no diſcretion whether they will do ſo or not, for the Conſtitution, by giving them the ſole power of determining, poſitively binds them to determine, and the only diſcretion left with them is the chooſing of the beſt manner of determining, ſo as beſt to accompliſh the views of the legiſlature. When the judiciary have given judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the executive has no diſcretion, whether it will lend its power to execute the judgment; for the Conſtitution, by giving it the ſole power of executing judgments, has poſitively bound it to exert its power, for this purpoſe; and the only diſcretion left is the choice of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and lawful means for the execution. Whenever Congreſs eſtabliſhes an office, the Conſtitution, by giving the Preſident the power of appointing, binds him to appoint a competent officer, and he has no diſcretion but to judge of the moſt proper perſon. Whenever an act of any of the other departments requires a grant of money, in order to give it effect, the Conſtitution, by giving Congreſs the ſole power of granting money, has poſitively bound it to grant a ſum competent for the due execution of the act of the other department; and the only diſcretion left to it is a choice of the beſt means of raiſing the money, or the beſt fund whence to draw it. Suppoſe a judgment againſt the United States in any of its courts for a ſum of money; is not Congreſs bound by the duty ariſing out of their power, to provide funds for the payment of this judgment; or can it enter on the judiciary province, and enquire into the merits of the judgment? Juſt ſo, in any act of any other department creating, on the ſubject committed to it, a neceſſity for a grant of money, there ariſes, out of their power, a duty on Congreſs to make a competent grant. The competence of the grant is to be meaſured by the nature of the act, the execution of which is to be provided
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033268_0040_0FF6B241A073ADA0"/>for; and the means of raiſing the money are to be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the diſcretion of Congreſs; for the direction of the means of raiſing money is excluſively veſted in Congreſs. Whenever an act of another department interferes not, Congreſs may grant or refuſe, according to its diſcretion, reſtrained only by the Conſtitution: for the Conſtitution veſts in Congreſs the reſidue of all powers of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not diſtributed to other departments; ſubject, like every department, to the duty of exerting its powers for promoting the views of the Conſtitution, and giving effect to the meaſures of the other departments. Every depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe power is wanted in the execution of a meaſure, may judge of the authority of another, but not of its diſcretion; of its having acted within its conſtitutional limits, but not of its having <hi>well</hi> acted. The diſcretion, the power of determing the propriety or impropriety of any conſtitutional meaſure, is excluſively committed, by the Conſtitution, to the proper department. When it has determined, all other departments are bound by it. It is the Conſtitution which binds them all.</p>
            <p>The judiciary may judge of the conſtitutionality of a law; but not of its propriety: the legiſlature alone can determine this—The executive may judge of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionality of a judgment, of the juriſdiction of the court over the ſubject, but not of the merits of the judgment. So, reſpecting any act or meaſure of the department of foreign intercourſe, the Conſtitution gives Congreſs no power to judge of the propriety of the meaſure; if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge of the propriety of the meaſure, it cannot judge of the propriety of the grant, any farther than under a ſenſe of duty, to fix the amount, and chooſe the means of raiſing it. Even Mr. G. admits that Congreſs has no right to diveſt the Preſident of any of his conſtitutional
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033268_0041_0FF6B228E3A06450"/>powers. And he conſiders the limitation of appropriations for an army, by any one Congreſs, to a term equal to its own duration, as ſufficiently diveſting any one Congreſs of a power of raiſing an army, ſo as not to be under the control of another Congreſs. The power of withholding appropriations, for the acts of any department, is, on this principle, a power of reſtraining from acting, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting this department of its conſtitutional power. The Preſident has power to make treaties, and to appoint and receive ambaſſadors. To deprive him of the means of ſending public miniſters, is depriving him of the power of making treaties. On his own principles, Mr. G. muſt admit, that this power is coupled with a diſcretion of judging with what nation, or in what manner, to form a treaty, or carry on an intercourſe by means of ambaſſadors. Yet he avows it to be the object and effect of this claim of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, though not to annihilate the eſtabliſhment, "effectually to check its extenſion." The Houſe of Repreſentatives then ſay, "Though the Conſtitution has veſted the Preſident with a diſcretion, we will not permit him to execute it; but will diveſt him of his conſtitutional power. It is true, we do not now, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate the eſtabliſhment, we chooſe only to retrench it; but when we have ſucceeded in this, the ſame arguments will enable us to annihilate. Surely, if we may now tell the Preſident, he ſhall ſend but three plenipotentiaries, we may, next year, tell him, he ſhall ſend but one; and the year following, none: and we will manage the foreign intercourſe ourſelves as well as the powers of internal legiſlation. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has the ſole and excluſive command of the purſe, is the ſole maſter; and if we can caſt off the conſtitutional limitations of our power, we ſhall be ſole maſters. Are not we the Repreſentatives of the People?"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:033268_0042_0FF6B243D65306E0"/>
I conſider the People as the proprietor of a great eſtate, the different departments as his agents for the management of it; and the Conſtitution as the inſtructions given them for their conduct, and the limitations of their authority.— He gives no predominancy of one over another; nor the whole of his own power to any; but a part of it to each. To one he gives power to manage his buildings, gardens and fields; to another of managing his lawſuits, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about his boundaries, or any claims of neighbouring proprietors of rights on his eſtate; and to another he gives the power of collecting his rents and debts, and paying out his money. Now, if this money agent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has power to raiſe and pay money, has a right in all caſes, before he grant, to enquire into the propriety or impropriety of the grant; it is clear that he has the ſole management of the eſtate, and that nothing can be done reſpecting the buildings, gardens, fields, boundaries, of diſputes of the proprietor, without the approbation of the money agent; and that he will have all the power of the proprietor, and be ſole agent. The proprietor never meant this. He meant only, that this money agent ſhould take care, that his building agent ſhould not draw money, for conducting lawſuits; nor his law agent, for conducting the buildings, gardens or farms; but never meant, that when either of the other agents wanted money for the purpoſe of his agency, the money agent ſhould have power to refuſe; or, before he granted, enquire whether the other agent had conducted his own buſineſs right. Every agent, for the purpoſes of his own department, is to every other, as the proprietor; and for thoſe purpoſes, has the ſame right as the proprietor, to call on the money agent for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and a refuſal of the money agent, to furniſh any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agent with the neceſſary money to accompliſh his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033268_0043_0FF6B2458D2D7D48"/>is a refuſal to obey the inſtructions of the proprietor, and amounts to a refuſal to furniſh the proprietor himſelf with money: for this other agent has, for his purpoſes, all the authority of the proprietor. The Conſtitution is the will or inſtructions of the proprietor; the departments are the agents; Congreſs is the money agent. Every conſtitutional act of any of the departments, being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular exertion of the authority of the Conſtitution, has the ſame authority over the other departments, as the Conſtitution itſelf; and if it limit the power of the others, it is not this department, but the Conſtitution which limits the power of the others. An authoritized act of the agent is an act of the principal. Therefore, if the conſtitutional act of any department require money to give it effect, Congreſs is as much bound to grant it, as if the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution itſelf required the grant. Every act concluded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the authority of the Conſtitution, is as binding as the Conſtitution; and if an act of the legiſlature, of the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary, or of the department of foreign intercourſe, requires a grant of money, the Houſe of Repreſcutatives are as much bound to raiſe and grant it, as if the Conſtitution required it. They can no more examine the propriety of the act, than the propriety of the Conſtitution. They are but fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low agents with the department to whoſe diſcretion their common lord, the Conſtitution, has excluſively intruſted the judgment of the propriety or impropriety of the act, and have no power paramount over this department to judge of its diſcretion. If the other department has, according to its authority from the Conſtitution, regularly concluded an act, the Houſe of Repreſentatives has no diſcretion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not, to give it effect. What then is the diſcretion of the Houſe of Repreſentatives? A diſcretion to enquire, whether the act be within the juriſdiction of the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033268_0044_0FF6B247C9774F30"/>and how beſt to give it effect; a diſcretion, under a ſenſe of duty, to determine the ſum neceſſary to give it effect, and to deviſe the beſt ways and means to raiſe that ſum. Each department has diſcretion, within its own juriſdiction, of exerciſing its powers, as it pleaſes, agreeably to the Conſtitution; or, if the Conſtitution, or any other department, do not require it, under a ſenſe of duty, to decline the exerciſe of its powers; but no depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can, in the exerciſe of its own powers, defeat the conſtitutional authority of another. An act of the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of foreign intercourſe may be conſidered as a law or a contract, and as there is no power in the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives to annul, they muſt execute it, like any other law or contract.</p>
            <p>To ſhew, that this doctrine will not ſtand the teſt of inveſtigation, Mr. G. ſays, "Whenever the powers veſted in any one department are ſufficient to complete a certain act, it would be unconſtitutional in any of the others, to control it. But whenever the powers have been ſo diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted between two departments, in relation to another certain act, that neither of the two can complete the act, by its own power; each department is controlled by the other." This reaſoning ſeems to be founded on a miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of words; by not diſtinguiſhing between a right of determining on a meaſure, and the power of directing the means of giving it effect; calling the firſt an act, and the other a complete act. The firſt is ſurely, ſo far as the word <hi>act</hi> can be applied to it, a complete act; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of the means of giving it effect, is not a refuſal to complete, but a power to defeat or render uſeleſs; and the department which has completed the act, though it may not have the power itſelf to apply the means, may have a right to require the department, which has the means of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033268_0045_0FF6B28991E53510"/>giving it effect, to apply thoſe means for that purpoſe, and not, by denying the means, defeat the act. A judgment of a court is a compleat act; but the court has not the means of executing it; thoſe are intruſted to the proper officers, the ſheriff, &amp;c. but though the court itſelf cannot exert thoſe means; it has a right to require the officer to exert them, and it would be unconſtitutional in him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe. Suppoſe a bill ſhould paſs both Houſes of Congreſs, be approved by the Preſident, and become a law; it is a compleat act, yet it cannot be carried into execution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aid of the executive and the judiciary. They only have the conſtitutional power of executing it: have they alſo a conſtitutional diſcretion to refuſe? Suppoſe, in the adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, the Preſident perceives an emergency requiring a new miniſter to be inſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, without waiting for appropriations. The miniſter is diſpatched, and executes the commiſſion. Has the Houſe of Repreſentatives a diſcretion to refuſe a compenſation?</p>
            <p>The abſurdity which Mr. G. ſees, in the doctrine for which I contend, is an abſurdity of his own making, and ariſes from begging the queſtion, and ſuppoſing, that the department, which has the means of executing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat act of another department, has a right to refuſe thoſe means. I ſay it has no ſuch right; and it is only he who ſays it has, who occaſions the abſurdity.</p>
            <p>The novelty of this doctrine is no better proved than its abſurdity. I have ſhown how conſiſtent it is with the Conſtitution. If tradition has made void the law, if poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Scribes and Phariſees have introduced their gloſſes inſtead of the text; no wonder if, when the true goſpel ſhines out, it ſhould be received by thoſe blind guides as novelty. To compare it to the ſtate conſtitutions, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes no evidence, for either there will be no reſemblance,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033268_0046_0FF6B24A75F439B0"/>or the ſame diſpute will exiſt. To compare it with the government of Britain, gives no evidence; ſince it is not principles of a Conſtitution, but principles of corruption, which preſerve the form of that government, and ſupport the authority of the King againſt the authority of the Houſe of Commons. Aided by corruption, the King, who has the power of making treaties, may ſafely truſt to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the diſcretion of executing them; if as Mr. G. ſays, "a progreſſive patronage and a ſyſtematic corrupting influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have ſunk Parliament to a nominal repreſentation, a mere machine, the convenience uſed by government for the purpoſe of raiſing ſupplies; the medium through which the executive reach with eaſe the purſe of the people. And now when the farce of obtaining even the nominal conſent of Parliament is ſufficiently underſtood, the miniſtry diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the ceremony." The uſe of corruption proves, that, without it, the King could not preſerve his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives againſt the incroachments of the Houſe of Commons. But, armed with this corruption, the King has as little to fear from the diſcretion of the Parliament, as Robeſpierre or the French Directory, armed with terror, could have to fear from the legiſlative Councils. But ſurely either the one or the other model is unfit for our imitation. We want neither an Anglo-monarchico-ariſtocratic faction, nor a Gallo-demo-mobocratic faction, to deſtroy the ſtructure of the American Conſtitution. Nor ought we to derive its conſtruction, from the errors and corruptions of other governments, but from its own principles and organiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The great fallacy in the reaſoning of Mr. G. ariſes by ſubſtituting the words <hi>raiſing and granting</hi> money, inſtead of the words of the Conſtitution; and confounding the power of raiſing and granting money, with a power of creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:033268_0047_0FF6B28B43B4E9E0"/>a neceſſity for raiſing and granting, and determining the reality and extent of that neceſſity, and making the words <hi>raiſing and granting,</hi> mean creating a neceſſity or determining the reality and extent of a neceſſity for granting. Theſe are powers eſſentially different from the powers of raiſing and granting. They are not, and conſiſtently with the views of the Conſtitution, they could not be, veſted in Congreſs. To ſay, that they are implied in the powers of raiſing and granting, is reaſoning without premiſes, and therefore inconcluſively. They are not implied; and often exiſt ſeparate from each other. To ſay that they are given to Congreſs, is taking a very narrow and imperfect view of the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>They are alſo given in many inſtances to other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments. It cannot be inferted, from the power of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taxes, and appropriating money, that this power is always free from an obligation to exert it; or that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation cannot be impoſed, but by the diſcretion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. To judge of the propriety or impropriety of a grant for any object, in any other ſenſe, than as to judge of the proper amount of the grant, and the proper means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing and applying the money, is to judge of the propriety or impropriety of the object; and the management of this may, in many caſes, be committed to another department with diſcretion excluſive and equal, as derived from the ſame ſource, the Conſtitution. A man is only free to judge of the propriety or impropriety of the grant, in the ſenſe contended for, when he has an arbitrary power over the money. For, if he have it in truſt from the owner, to apply it, as not only he, but his fellow agents may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; he may often have no diſcretion to refuſe. Congreſs is but a fellow agent with the other departments, and like every other organ of power, takes all its powers couple
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033268_0048_0FF6B24CB43F3E80"/>with duties; its power to make, therefore, coupled with a duty to make all laws neceſſary and proper for carrying into execution the powers of the Conſtitution, and all other powers veſted in the government, or in any department or officer thereof. The diſcretion of Congreſs to judge of the neceſſity or propriety of any law, is bounded by the diſcretion of every other department, in the execution of their conſtitutional authority. Where either the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution itſelf dictates the neceſſity or propriety of a law, or gives to any other department, or officer, the diſcretion to judge of the neceſſity or propriety of a law, Congreſs has no diſcretion left to judge of the neceſſity or propriety of making the law, but only of chooſing the beſt law to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the object of the other department. Its power is abridged by the Conſtitution. A claim of Congreſs then, to a diſcretion to judge of the propriety of a law which the Conſtitution, or any department with authority derived from the Conſtitution, may have declared to be neceſſary, is a claim of all power in the government, or a power to refuſe what the Conſtitution, or the conſtituted authorities, may have declared neceſſary. When nature may create a neceſſity, or the Conſtitution or any department may make an engagement or legal declaration; a claim in Congreſs, to a right to judge of the propriety or impropriety of the grant, is not, and conſiſtently with the views of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, cannot be veſted in Congreſs, for it is a claim to aſſume univerſal power, or a claim to aſſume a power over the principles of the Conſtitution, a power over the principles of nature and morals, and therefore a power over God himſelf.</p>
            <p>I have now examined the reaſoning of Mr. G. on the conſtitutional principle; and as we know, that motives as pure as his, are no ſecurity againſt danger, I think it
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033268_0049_0FF6B24EA26269F8"/>will appear, that judgment, as clear as his, is no ſecurity againſt error.—The fact is, that it is not from a want of obligation on the Houſe of Repreſentatives to appropriate money, but from a want of power to compel compliance, if they chooſe to diſregard this obligation. Impunity is often confounded with diſcretion, Suppoſe the judiciary refuſe to decide on a law; how can they be compelled? They may be impeached and removed. But ſuppoſe the ſame obſtinacy ſhould exiſt in their ſucceſſors; the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment would be diſſolved: for no other department can exerciſe their authority. If an inferior court refuſe the exerciſe of its powers, a ſuperior court may compel it, by <hi>mandamus.</hi> No <hi>mandamus</hi> can go to the Houſe of Repreſentatives. We have no Pariſian mob to ſurround their hall with pikes and cannon. They cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached; for they have the ſole power of impeaching.— And the only compulſive force on them, is the removing power of the people, the elective branch. This is the tribunal before which they are tried; but, as ſaving mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is generally popular, and the people is often ill inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Repreſentatives take means to eſcape from judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by prejudicing the judges, by inceſſantly and widely ſpreading among them miſrepreſentations of all the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which they oppoſe, and of all the acts of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. Though there be therefore a poſitive obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there being no compulſive power to enforce it, impunity is conſtrued as diſcretion; and the "moral obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation" of a ſenſe of duty, can alone enforce the exertion of "the conſtitutional power." And this it ſeems is "a metaphyſical ſubtlety!"</p>
            <p>Of all public officers, we have the leaſt hold, by means of a ſenſe of duty, on repreſentatives accountable to none but to the people: eſpecially in granting money not to be
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033268_0050_0FF6B28D8B9339F0"/>expended by themſelves. The confederation directed that all charges of war, and all other expences that ſhall be incurred for the common defence or general welfare, and allowed by Congreſs, ſhall be defrayed out of a common treaſury, which ſhall be ſupplied by the ſeveral ſtates; and alſo directed that every ſtate ſhall abide by the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs on all queſtions ſubmitted to them; and ſhall inviolably obſerve the articles of Confederation<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Art.</hi> 8.1</note>.— Here was poſitive and moral duty united. Yet, when danger ceaſed, were both poſitive and moral duty ſufficient to perſuade the ſtate legiſlatures to comply with the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Congreſs?</p>
            <p>Preſuming the cordial concurrence of each department, to carry into effect the conſtitutional acts of any other; as Solon made no law againſt parricide, apprehending it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that any one ſhould be guilty of ſo unnatural a barbarity, the Conſtitution forbears to command any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment to abſtain from a reſiſtance to the authority of any other, which would deſtroy their common parent.</p>
            <p>To the policy of extending or abridging foreign inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I ſay nothing. Reſting on the conſtitutional prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, it is ſufficient for me, that the Conſtitution has excluded the Houſe of Repreſentatives from all manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of foreign intercourſe; and thought it ſafe, to truſt the whole diſcretion of managing it, to the Preſident, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the check of the Senate. The Conſtitution has conſidered the Preſident, as a ſafe depoſitary of this authority, and the Senate as a ſufficient check; and to the acts of this authority, as to the authority of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, it behoves the Houſe of Repreſentatives to bow! as it behoves the Preſident, in his turn, to bow to the authority of Congreſs as expreſſed by law.</p>

               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:033268_0051_0FF6B250DDC0F180"/>
Every act done under the authority of the Conſtitution is, till it be annulled by the department which gave it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, as binding on every department, as the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itſelf: thus not only the Conſtitution, but the laws and treaties of the United States are declared the ſupreme law. And the queſtion is not, whether any department may, in the exerciſe of its own authority, exerciſe diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but whether it may alſo exerciſe diſcretion over the authority of another department: whether the Houſe of Repreſentatives be free to do as it pleaſes, and, uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the conſtitutional acts of any other department, ſet itſelf up as paramount over all, and abſorb, in itſelf, the authority of all the departments. It is a queſtion of pride, of ambition in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, to poſſeſs a power to prevent any thing being done, by any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, without their approbation; that is, to acquire arbitrary power. And this they juſtify, under a pretence of preventing extravagance and abuſe of authority.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible to ſuppoſe caſes, of a nature ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as to juſtify one department, in aſſuming a power not given it, to defeat the acts of another. Perſonal liberty is a conſtitutional right; but if a man uſe it dangerouſly, it may be abridged. An emergency ſo critical may exiſt, that, to encounter it, a violation of the Conſtitution itſelf may become a duty. No argument can be drawn from this: for abuſe of power is a ſuppoſition which may be made in all departments, and is ſurely not leſs preſumable, in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, than in the Preſident and the Senate. So far as the Conſtitution intends, that the Houſe of Repreſentatives ſhould have this power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent extravagance, it is not diſputed with them. They have the diſcretion, controlled only by a ſenſe of duty, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt the amount of the grant to the nature of the object,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033268_0052_0FF6B28F436F6CD0"/>and to chooſe the means of raiſing and applying the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. To give them more, would be giving them all power: and if this be neceſſary, to preſerve us from abuſe in other departments; who, if they obtain this, ſhall preſerve us from abuſe in them? What ſecurity have we, that the Houſe of Repreſentatives may not act as extravagantly as the Preſident and Senate? Are large popular bodies leſs liable to extravagance, paſſion, partiality, and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than an individual, or a ſmall ſelect body, reſponſible for their conduct? Have they not their favourites? Have they not their maſters? Give them the power claimed, would the other departments have any chance of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhadowy fragment of remaining authority? Would not the Houſe of Repreſentatives ſoon render odious the other departments, and render it impoſſible for the people to know the truth? The Houſe of Repreſentatives would be erected into a national convention, the centre of all authority; its opinions, its agents, its influence would ſpread ramifications of its power, and receive nouriſhment, in every part of the nation; and all its power would cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre in a Mirabeau or a Robeſpierre.</p>
            <p>How tyranny or ruin may have come on other nations, unleſs in ſo far as their circumſtances reſemble ours, it is not material to enquire. Our Executive has not, and cannot have, an uncontrolled command of the purſe of the people. Nor is there any kind of reſemblance between the power of appointing miniſters, and the caſe of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money. That caſe was a claim of exerciſing, not only the power which the King had, but the power which he had not; a power of laying and collecting taxes, as well as declaring their neceſſity, a power to fix the ſum neceſſary, as well as to declare the object. And whatever deductions may be made from hiſtory, it will be found, that tyranny
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033268_0053_0FF6B291F3DE9850"/>has ariſen from the turbulence and refractory conduct of the people, or the other departments; from an abuſe of liberty or diſcretion; from contentions for power, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a pretence, and from the circumſtances of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive furniſhing the means, of acquiring a predominancy; and from the ſatisfaction ariſing, when <hi>any</hi> government has ſuperſeded the anxiety of diſtractions, juſtifying the ſucceſs, and favouring the eſtabliſhment, of this predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy.</p>
            <p>"The events of the reign of Charles the firſt" are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed "a proof of the danger to be apprehended from the incroachments of the legiſlature. They were the reſult of an unſettled Conſtitution. The preciſe boundaries of power were not aſcertained: Convulſions, a civil war, a revolution enſued." Very natural conſequences, from a caſe exactly like the preſent! Where is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between an unſettled conſtitution, and a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the conſtruction of which, by thoſe who adminiſter it, is unſettled? If the preciſe boundaries of power be aſcertained, what is the ground of diſpute between the department of foreign intercourſe, and the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives? The caſes are the ſame, let us take warning by the conſequences.</p>
            <p>In the contraſt, which Mr. G. draws, between the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident's ſpeech to Congreſs, and the late Preſident's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the people; he cites the following ſentence of the Preſident's ſpeech. "However we may conſider ourſelves, the maritime and commercial powers of the world will conſider the United States of America, as forming a <hi>weight in that balance of power in Europe, which never can be forgotten or neglected.</hi>" Mr. G. recites the laſt clauſe of this ſentence thus, <hi>"As to that balance of power in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident's meaning plainly is that the maritime and commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial powers of the world will never forget or neglect the <hi>weight,</hi> which the United States of America form, in the balance of power in Europe. Mr. G. ſeems to cite this, as if the Preſident thought, that the United States ought never to forget or neglect the balance of power in Europe, but "involve itſelf in the deſtinies and wars of Europe."</p>
            <p>I ſhould not have made this obſervation, had it been altogether unconnected with the principles and conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the point in diſpute.
