            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By the Interpreter's Advice, they were firſt ſpoke to in their own Way, with three ſmall Strings of <hi>Wampum</hi> in Hand, one of which was delivered on each of the following Articles.</p>

               <hi>Our Friends and Brethren,</hi>

            <p n="1">I. <hi>You are come a great way, and have doubtleſs ſuffered many Hardſhips in ſo long a Journey; but now you are with your Brethren and true Friends, who have long been in Friendſhip and Alliance with your Nations; you muſt therefore put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all Grief and Uneaſineſs, and brighten your Eyes, that we may ſee and be chearful with each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>We deſire that as we are now met as Brethren and Friends, you will open your Hearts, as we ſhall open our Hearts, that we may ſpeak with Freedom and Openneſs to each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>You are come to us as your true Friends, we receive you with Gladneſs, you ſhall ſhelter yourſelves under our Covering, and be entertained by us as ourſelves, for you are our Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Indians hereupon expreſſed their Satisfaction with Sounds peculiar to themſelves on ſuch Occaſions; and then their Speaker with three like Strings in his Hand, repeated all thoſe three ſeveral Articles more at large, returning their Thanks for each, delivering a String as each Article was ſpoke to, and giving Aſſurances of their Freedom and Openneſs, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that we would uſe the ſame; but on the 3d they ſaid, <hi>They could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and treat us as we did them, they are now with us, they give themſelves up to us, and depend on our Protection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then with five more very ſhort Strings in his Hand, the Speaker pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to ſay on the firſt, <hi>That they had received on the Road a Meſſage from as delivered by</hi> Conrad Wyſer, <hi>welcoming them into the Country.</hi> On the 2d, <hi>That they had at the ſame time received from us an Account of our late Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Death, but that this would not occaſion any Alteration, becauſe</hi> W. PENN'S <hi>own Son is here, and alſo</hi> James Logan, <hi>with the Council.</hi> On the 3d They returned their Thanks, and with the other two confirm'd the whole.</p>
            <p>They ſaid, <hi>They were now come, after a full Conſultation with all their Chiefs at their great Fire or Place of Counſel, to return an Anſwer to the Treaty, that ſome of them had held with us four Years ſince, at</hi> Philadelphia: <hi>That they intended to ſtay with their Friend</hi> James Logan <hi>two Nights to reſt themſelves, and then proceed to the Fire kept for them at</hi> Philadelphia; <hi>where after two Nights more, they would at that Fire give their full Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>

The Diſtemper is as yet but young and juſt begun in the Place; that it is only in the Heart or near the Middle of the Town; that they will be accommodated at the Edge or Out-Skirts of the Town, where if they take Care, they may for a few Days be in but very little or no Danger.</hi>

            <p>The Preſident, before proceeding to hear them, thought proper to inform the Audience, that in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1732, a great Treaty having been held in this Place with ſeveral Chiefs of the Six Nations, they had made report thereof on their Return to their Great Council, where the ſeveral Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that had been made to them on the Part of this Government, had been fully conſidered; and that theſe Chiefs now preſent, of whom there never at any time before had been ſo great a Number met in this Province, were now come to return their Anſwer.</p>

               <p>WE are now come down from the Towns of our ſeveral Nations, to give our Anſwer to the great Treaty, which we and you held together, at this Place, about four Years ſince: This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer has been agreed and concluded upon by our great Council, who have carefully conſidered all that paſſed between you and us, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their great Satisfaction in the friendly and good Diſpoſitions of you our Brethren, towards all the <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Six Nations;</hi> and as you received us kindly, and at that Treaty undertook to provide and keep for us a Fire in this great City, we are now come to warm ourſelves thereat, and we deſire and hope it will ever continue bright and burning to the End of the World.</p>

               <p>SOON after our Brother <hi>ONAS,</hi> who is now here, came into this Country, he and we treated together; he opened and cleared the Road between this Place and our Nations, which was very much to our good Liking, and it gave us great Pleaſure. We now deſire that this Road, for the mutual Accommodation and Conveniency of you and us who Travel therein to ſee each other, may be kept clear and open, free from all Stops or Incumbrances, and if, ſince the time that we laſt cleared it with you, any Tree has fallen acroſs it, or if it is any way ſtopt up, of which however we know nothing, we are now willing to open and clear the ſame from every Interruption; and it is our hearty Deſire that it may ſo continue, while the Earth endureth.</p>

               <p>ONE of the chief Articles of our late Treaty together, was the brightning of the Chain of Friendſhip between us, and the preſerving it free from all Ruſt and Spots; and that this Chain was not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Government and us, but between all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and all the <hi>Indians.</hi> We now aſſure you our Brethren, that it is our earneſt Deſire this Chain ſhould continue, and be ſtrengthned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and all our Nations, and likewiſe the <hi>Delawares, Canays,</hi> and the <hi>Indians</hi> living on <hi>Saſquehannah,</hi> and all the other <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> who now are in League and Friendſhip with the <hi>Six Nations;</hi> in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all whom, and as a laſting Confirmation of this great Article, to endure until this Earth paſſeth away and is no more ſeen, we now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you this Beaver Coat.</p>

               <p>We who are now here, are old Men, who have the Direction of Affairs in our own Nations; and as we are old, it may be thought that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of theſe things may be loſt with us, who have not, like you, the Art of preſerving it by committing all Tranſactions to Writing: We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs have Methods of tranſmitting from Father to Son, an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all theſe Things, whereby you will find the Remembrance of them is faithfully preſerved, and our ſucceeding Generations are made acquainted with what has paſſed, that it may not be forgot as long as the Earth remains.</p>

               <p>;WE deſire that this brightning of the Chain, and eſtabliſhing a ſtrong and firm League of Friendſhip, may be underſtood by you, as we underſtand it to be, not only between the Chiefs of our Nations, and the Chiefs or Principal Men of this Government, but likewiſe between all our People, and all your People, and between you and all our <hi>Warriours</hi> who go abroad and ſometimes paſs near this Government, to all of whom we have given the ſtricteſt Charge to behave themſelves agreeable to the

               <p>At the laſt Treaty you adviſed us to ſtrengthen ourſelves by entring into firm Leagues of Friendſhip and Alliance with ſeveral other Nations of <hi>Indians</hi> around us; this Advice was truly good, and we thank our Brethren for it; we have accordingly treated with theſe Six following Nations, <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Onichkaryagoes, Siſſaghces, Tioumitihagas, Attawanten's, Twechtweſe,</hi> and <hi>Oachtamaghs,</hi> and have engaged them ſo heartily in our Intereſt, that they acknowledge us for their Elder Brethren, and have promiſed to join with us as one People, and to act altogether in Concert with us.</p>
               <p>You likewiſe then adviſed us to call home all thoſe of our Nations who are at <hi>Canada,</hi> or live amongſt the <hi>French,</hi> leſt if any Occaſion of Difference ſhould ariſe, they might then be prevented from returning. We eſteem this likewiſe as ſound good Advice, and we thank our Brethren for it; the <hi>French</hi> were formerly our cruel Enemies, and we are taking ſuch Meaſures as we hope will be effectual to bring back our People, if any new Breach ſhould happen.</p>

               <p>To confirm all that we have now ſaid, we would be glad if we had a large Preſent of Skins to deliver, in Return to the conſiderable one in Goods which we had of you; but we muſt own to you that we are at preſent but very ill provided and poor, and have only a very ſmall Quantity of Skins, which nevertheleſs we hope our Brethren will accept.</p>

            <p>The Preſident likewiſe acquainting the Board, that the <hi>Indians,</hi> at a Meeting with the Proprietor and him, had taken Notice that <hi>Conrad Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,</hi> and <hi>Shekallamy,</hi> were by the Treaty of 1732, appointed as fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Perſons to go between the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and this Government, and to be employed in all Tranſactions with one another, whoſe Bodies the <hi>Indians</hi> ſaid were to be equally divided between them and us, we to have one half, and they the other; that they had found <hi>Conrad</hi> faithful and honeſt, that he is a true good Man, and had ſpoke their Words, and our Words, and not his own; and the <hi>Indians</hi> having preſented him with a dreſt Skin to make him Shoes, and two Deer Skins, to keep him warm, they ſaid, as they had thus taken Care of our Friend, they muſt recommend their's <hi>(Shekallamy)</hi> to our Notice; and the Board judging it neceſſary that a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004146_0009_1003DC5CF683C3C8"/>Notice ſhould be taken of him, acccordingly, it is, <hi>Ordered,</hi> That <hi>Six Pounds</hi> be laid out for him in ſuch things as he may moſt want.</p>
            <p>It was then recommended to the Preſident, and he undertook, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Draught of what might be proper to be ſaid to theſe <hi>Indians</hi> at giving the Preſent from this Government, and to lay the ſame before the Board to morrow Morning, at Ten a Clock, to which time the Council adjourned.</p>

            <p>The Preſident laid before the Board a draught of a concluding Speech to the Indians, which being read and approved, they were ſent for, who being come and ſeated, the ſaid Speech was delivered to them by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>OUR BRETHREN,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>FOUR Years ſince at a great Treaty held here with your Chiefs, we confirmed all our former Treaties with you, we brightned the Chain, kindled our Fire to be kept always burning here for you, opened and cleared the Path between your Country and Ours, and made our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and you one Body and one People.</p>
               <p>The Chiefs of all your Nations, being met at your great Fire or Council in the Country of the <hi>Onondagoes,</hi> having heard of and conſidered that Treaty, were ſo well pleaſed with it, that it was agreed, as you have told us, that you, who are the principal of all your Chiefs, ſhould come down and viſit us, and more fully and abſolutely confirm that Treaty, which you accordingly did a few Days ſince at our great Houſe in Town, in the preſence and hearing of ſome Thouſands of our People, and it was done not only in Behalf of us ourſelves and yourſelves, but for our Children and Children's Children, to all Generations, as long as the Sun, Moon, and Earth, endure.</p>
               <p>Thus this Treaty, by which we are to become as one People, and one Body, is in the ſtrongeſt Terms confirmed, never to be changed, but to ;be kept in everlaſting Remembrance.</p>
               <p>But, beſides what we have already concluded, we ſhall now for the further brightning the ſame Chain, and that no Spot or Blemiſh may be fixt on it, ſpeak to ſome Particulars for your more full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:004146_0010_1003DC66CB969550"/>
It has been agreed between us, that we ſhould ſuffer no Injury to be done to one of your People more than to our own, nor without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Offender in the ſame manner as if it had been done to one of our People; and you alſo engaged on your parts that you would give us the like Satisfaction for every Injury done by your People to any of ours, and whatever ſhould happen of this kind, it ſhould make no other Difference, than as if the Injury were done by one <hi>Engliſh</hi> or White Man to another, and ſo in the Caſe of an <hi>Indian.</hi> Now ſince you came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we have heard that a White Man one of our People, and one of yours, being both in Liquor, quarrelled at <hi>Allegheny,</hi> that the <hi>Indian</hi> ſtruck at the White Man with a Knife, and the white Man gave the <hi>Indian</hi> ſome Blows on the Head, of which he died in four or five Days after; that the White Man got out of the way, and hid, and when he heard the Man was dead, he ran away to the <hi>Southward</hi> of <hi>Virginia:</hi> Who was firſt in the Fault in this matter we know not, but we have now iſſued a Proclamation for apprehending the White Man, and propoſed a Reward of <hi>Ten Pounds,</hi> to any one who will ſeize and deliver him to ſome Magiſtrate or Officer, that he may be put in Priſon and tried for his Life; if then it appears that he willfully kill'd the Man, he will be hanged by our Law; if it was in Defence of his own Life, he is not to die for it, but after he is tried we ſhall acquaint you how the matter appeared. The firſt Account we had of it was in a Letter, which the Interpreter ſhall read and acquaint you with it; but that Story being told only on one ſide, we do not depend on it for the Truth; and thus we ſhall act in all ſuch Caſes, as Brethren always ought whenever they unfortunately happen.</p>
               <p>We are very ſenſible Rum is the principal occaſion of theſe Diſorders, and we heartily wiſh any means could be poſſibly found to prevent the Abuſe of it: You have deſired us in your Diſcourſe with the Proprietor to recall all our Traders from <hi>Ohio</hi> or <hi>Allegheny</hi> and the Branches of <hi>Saſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannah;</hi> We deſired at our Treaty four Years ago that all our <hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>Delawares, Shawaneſe,</hi> and others, ſhould be recalled from <hi>Ohio,</hi> for we knew not then but there might be War with the <hi>French,</hi> and you know the Strength of a People conſiſts in their being drawn cloſe together as into one Body, and not to be ſcattered; but we know not what you mean by recalling our Traders; for you are ſenſible the <hi>Indians</hi> cannot live without being ſupplied with our Goods: They muſt have Powder and Lead to hunt, and Cloaths to keep them warm; and if our People do not carry them, others will, from <hi>Maryland, Virginia, Jerſeys,</hi> or other Places; and we are ſure you do not deſire that <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould trade with thoſe People rather than with ours. The Traders of all Nations find the <hi>Indians</hi> are ſo univerſally fond of Rum, that they will not deal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: We have made many Laws againſt carrying it; we have ordered the <hi>Indians</hi> to ſtave the Caggs of all that is brought amongſt them; but the Woods have not Streets like <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> the Paths in them are endleſs, and they cannot be ſtopt, ſo that it will be carried either from one Country or another; and on the other hand the <hi>Indians</hi> are ſo very fond of the Liquor, even the beſt of them, that inſtead of taking it from thoſe who bring it, and ſtaving it, they take and drink it, which is both unjuſt in it ſelf, and does more Miſchief; for the Traders, if they kept
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004146_0011_1003DE63C3FC7A30"/>it, would hand it out by ſtealth in ſmall Quantities, but the <hi>Indians</hi> when they take it, drink it off by great Quantities; ſo that no Method we can find will prevent the <hi>Indians</hi> having it, till they are ſo wiſe as to refrain it of themſelves; and, Why are they not ſo wiſe? they ſhew very good ſtrong Senſe in other things, and why cannot they act like us? All of us here, and all you ſee of any Credit in the Place, can every Day have as much Rum of their own to drink as they pleaſe, and yet ſcarce one of us will take a Dram, at leaſt not one Man will on any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be drunk, no not if he were hired to it with great Sums of Money.</p>
               <p>And now to bind and confirm all theſe our Words, we have provided for you the following Goods, which will be delivered to you to morrow at the Preſident's Lodgings, <hi>to wit.</hi>

            <p>The Council riſing, and the Preſident with the Proprietor ſtaying, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> entered into further Diſcourſe, and ſaid, <hi>They had received a Meſſage with ſome</hi> Wampum <hi>from the Governor of</hi> Maryland, <hi>informing them, he had received a Letter from the King of</hi> England, <hi>ordering him to ſee that they ſhould not be wronged of their Lands; that he had underſtood this Government had wronged them, and if they would ſend ſome of their People to him, he would take care they ſhould be righted, he would write to the great King, who would give ſuch Orders as that they ſhould have Juſtice done them. Being asked how they received that Meſſage, they ſaid, the Man who brought it was here now with them, they had the</hi> Wampum <hi>and would ſhew it to us; and they earneſtly preſſed that we would write to the Governors of</hi> Maryland <hi>and</hi> Virginia <hi>to make them Satisfaction for the Lands belonging to them (the Indians) which the People of thoſe Governments were poſſeſſed of, that had never been purchaſed of them; that all the Lands on</hi> Saſquehannah <hi>and at</hi> Chanandowa <hi>were theirs, and they muſt be ſatisfied for them; that they had agreed with us for the Lands they now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed to us, but they had never received any thing from the other Governments to the Southward, for theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were told, That on their receiving the Preſent to morrow, they ſhould be anſwered on theſe Heads; and after being entertained by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, they withdrew.</p>

            <p>The Honourable the Proprietor, the Preſident, with ſome of the Council met this Forenoon, and the <hi>Indian</hi> Chiefs being come and ſeated.</p>
            <p>Their Speaker, having ſome Parcels of Skins laid before him, roſe; and by the Interpreter ſaid;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004146_0012_1003DC70F28570F0"/>
That they were now to ſpeak to the Proprietor and our People for the laſt time this Viſit; that we had ſpoke to them laſt night, and recapitulated the Heads of all that had been agreed between them and us, as the Fire, the Path, the Chain; that we are now become one People; with every other Article that had been mentioned between us: This they will remember on their Parts through all Generations, and they deſire that we may remember the ſame as long as the Earth endures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That having now brightened the Chain, and confirmed all the Articles neceſſary for eſtabliſhing perfect Friendſhip between them and us, and being thus become one People, they muſt deſire that we would be more reaſonable in the Sale of our Goods, which are much dearer (they ſay) from our Traders than from thoſe of</hi> New-York; <hi>that the Powder ſold by the Traders of</hi> New-York, <hi>is generally found to be mixed with black Duſt, ſo that the Bullet falls often ſhort of the Mark thro' the Badneſs of the Powder; that if we would ſell cheap, we might thereby draw a great Trade to this Province, far beyond that of any others, which would be to our Advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hereupon he laid down a Bundle of Skins, and ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That amongſt them there is never any Victuals ſold, the Indians give to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther freely what they can ſpare; but if they come amongſt our People, they can have none without paying; they admire we ſhould take Money on this Score.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That having now finiſhed, and preparing to return home, as ſeveral of them are old Men, they requeſt that we would help them on their Journey, by aſſiſting them with Horſes and ſome Carriages for their Goods; that as we have many Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Carriages, they deſire we would ſpare them ſome for their Uſe, who are our Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hereupon he laid down two Bundles of Skins;</p>
            <p>Then proceeding, he ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they muſt deſire us to write to the Governors of</hi> Virginia <hi>and</hi> Maryland, <hi>who are poſſeſſed of their Lands, without ever conſidering the Indians for them, and requeſt that we would take the Anſwers of thoſe Governors, which next Spring ſome of their Nations will come to receive at the Fire kept for them in this Place; That they intend to apply to the great King on the other Side of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and let him know what they expect on this Head from his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That if</hi> Civility <hi>at</hi> Coneſtogoe, <hi>ſhould attempt to make a Sale of any Lands to us or any of our Neighbours, they muſt let us know, that he both no Power to do ſo; and if he does any thing of the kind, they the Indians will utterly diſown him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That laſt night we told them the Woods were very dark, and that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to prevent Rum being carried to</hi> Allegheny; <hi>that if the Caſe be thus, we had better hinder any Perſons from going thither at all, and confine our Traders to the River</hi> Saſquehannah <hi>and its Branches; for as ſeveral Indian</hi> Warriours <hi>paſs by</hi> Allegheny, <hi>where ſo much Rum is conſtantly to be had, they cannot but be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apprehenſive that ſome Miſchief may happen; this Conſideration often troubles them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to all which, the <hi>Indians</hi> were thus told by the Interpreter.</p>
            <q>
               <p>THAT as to all that had paſſed relating to the Chain, Road and Fire, we have now firmly and fully eſtabliſhed and confirmed all theſe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004146_0013_1003B93E2C26D370"/>Articles, to be kept in perpetual Remembrance by them and us, and by our Children and their Children to all Generations.</p>
               <p>That as to the Deameſs of Goods carried amongſt them, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here has no Concern in the Trade, it is entirely carried on by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate People; thoſe that go amongſt the <hi>Indians</hi> purchaſe the Goods they carry with them at the eaſieſt Rate, and we are told, that conſidering the Length of Way they carry them, they are ſold ſo cheap, that theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders can be but ſmall Gainers; but the Prices of Goods are not under any Regulation, they get for them what they can.</p>
               <p>That all the white People, tho' they live together as Brethren, have each nevertheleſs diſtinct Properties and Intereſts, and none of us can demand from another Victuals or any thing of the Kind without Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. One Man raiſes Corn and ſells it, another raiſes Horſes and he ſells them, and thus every Man lives by his own Labour and Induſtry, and no one has a Right to take away from another what he thus earns for himſelf; and all Victuals coſt Money.</p>
               <p>That proper Care will be taken, as has formerly been done, to ſupply them with Horſes and Carriages to make their Journey home as eaſy as poſſible.</p>
               <p>That we would be glad to do them any Service with the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Governments, but we do not clearly underſtand this Matter: As to what is ſaid of a Letter from the King of <hi>England,</hi> we do not believe there is any Truth in that Report; we have indeed heard of a Letter ſent up to <hi>Saſquehannah</hi> from the Governor of <hi>Maryland;</hi> if he mentions any thing in it of Orders from the King of <hi>England,</hi> they ſhould ſend ſome Perſons to that Government to enquire into the Matter. As to the Claim they make on the Lands of <hi>Maryland</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> we know not how this is ſupported; the Lands on <hi>Saſquehannah,</hi> we believe, belong to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> by the Conqueſt of the <hi>Indians</hi> of that River; but how their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are made good to the Lands to the Southward, we know not; and we ought to be better informed before we can write on this Head.</p>
               <p>That we cannot prevent our Traders from going where they may beſt diſpoſe of their Goods; we ſhall take the moſt proper Meaſures in our Power to hinder their carrying Rum in ſuch Quantities, and we hope the <hi>Indians</hi> will give ſtrict Charge to the Warriours to be cautious and prudent, that all Kind of Miſchief may be prevented.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> appearing ſatisfied with what had been ſpoke to them, ſaid they had nothing further to offer. The Preſent was then delivered to them, which they received with great Thankfulneſs, thoſe of each Nation alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately by themſelves, and then all of them together, joining in their uſual ſolemn Sound, when they expreſs their Satisfaction. Having afterwards drank a friendly Glaſs, and taking Leave of the Proprietor, Preſident and Court they departed; and thus the Treaty ended.</p>
