            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Declaration <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>INaſmuch as the killing thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Coneſtogo Mannor</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> has been, and may be the Subject of much Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by invidious Repreſentations of it, which ſome, we doubt not, will induſtriouſly ſpread, many, unacquainted with the true State of Affairs, may be led to paſs a ſeverer Cenſure on the Authors of thoſe Facts, and any others of thoſe like Nature, which may hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happen, than we are perſuaded they would if matters were duly underſtood and deliberated: We think it therefore proper thus openly to declare ourſelves, and render ſome brief Hints of the Reaſons of our Conduct; which we muſt, and frankly do confeſs nothing but Neceſſity itſelf could induce us to, or juſtify us in; as it bears an Appearance of flying in the Face of Authority, and is attended with much Labour, Fatigue and Expence.</p>
            <p>OURSELVES then, to a Man, we profeſs loyal Subjects to the beſt of Kings, our rightful Sovereign GEORGE the THIRD, firmly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to his Royal Perſon, Intereſt and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: And of Conſequence equally oppoſite to the Enemies of his Throne and Dignity,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009630_0003_0F77385045A841E8"/>whether openly avowed or more dangerouſly concealed under a Mask of falſly pretended Friendſhip, and chearfully willing to offer our Subſtance and Lives in his Cauſe.</p>
            <p>THESE <hi>Indians</hi> known to be firmly connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Friendſhip with our openly avowed imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Enemies; and ſome of whom have, by ſeveral Oaths, been proved to be Murderers; and, who, by their better Acquaintance with the Situation and State of our Frontiers, were more capable of doing us Miſchief, we ſaw with Indignation cheriſhed and careſſed as dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Friends — But this alas! is but a Part, a ſmall Part of that exceſſive Regard manifeſted to <hi>Indians</hi> beyond his Majeſty's loyal Subjects, whereof we complain: And which together with various other Greivances have not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with Reſentment the Breaſts of a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and urged them to the diſagreable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, they have been conſtrained to give, but have heavily diſpleaſed, by far, the greateſt part of the good Inhabitants of this Province.</p>
            <p>SHOULD we here reflect to former Treaties, the exorbitant Preſents, and great Servility therein paid to <hi>Indians,</hi> have long been oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Grievances we have groaned under. And when at the laſt <hi>Indian</hi> Treaty held at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> not only was the Blood of our many murdered Brethren tamely covered, but our poor unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py captivated Friends abandoned to Slavery among the Savages, by concluding a Friendſhip
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009630_0004_0F773852C1F75390"/>with the <hi>Indians</hi> and allowing them a plenteous Trade of all kinds of Commodities, without thoſe being reſtored, altho' a ſpirited Requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made of them; how general Diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thoſe Meaſures gave, the Murmers of all good People (loud as they dare to utter them) to this Day declare: And had here, infatuated Steps of Conduct and a manifeſt Partialtity in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Indians</hi> made a final Pauſe, happy had it been; we perhaps had grieved in ſilence for our abandoned, enſlaved Brethren among the Heathens. But matters of a later Date are ſtill more flagrant Reaſons of Complaint. When laſt Summer his Majeſty's Forces under the Command of Col. BOUQUET marched through this Province and a Demand was made by His Excellency Gen. AMHERST of Aſſiſtance to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cort Proviſions &amp;c. to relieve that important Poſt, Fort <hi>Pitt,</hi> yet not one Man was granted, altho' never any Thing appeared more reaſonable or neceſſary, as the Intereſt of the Province lay ſo much at ſtake and the Standing of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Settlements in any manner, evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, under God, on the almoſt deſpaired of Succeſs of his Majeſty's little Army, whoſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour the whole Frontiers with Gratitude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as the happy Means of having ſaved from ruin great part of the Province. But when a Number of <hi>Indians</hi> falſly pretended Friends, and having among them, ſome proved on Oath to have been guilty of Murder, ſince this War
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009630_0005_0F7738537A156A50"/>begun, when they together with others known to be his Majeſty's Enemies and who had been in the Battle againſt Col. BOUQUET, reduced to Diſtreſs by the Deſtruction of their Corn at the <hi>Great Iſland,</hi> and up the Eaſt Branch of <hi>Suſquehanna,</hi> pretend themſelves Friends, and deſire a Subſiſtance they are openly careſſed, and the Publick, that could not be indulged the Liberty of contributing to his Majeſty's Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, obliged, as Tributaries to Savages, to ſupport thoſe Villains, thoſe Enemies to our King and our Country. Nor only ſo, but the Hands that were cloſely ſhut, nor would grant his Majeſty's General one ſingle Farthing againſt a Savage Foe, have been liberally open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the publick Money laviſhly proſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hire, at an exorbitant Rate, a mercenary Guard, to protect his Majeſty's worſt of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, thoſe falſly pretended <hi>Indian</hi> Friends, while at the ſame Time hundreds of poor diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Families of his Majeſty's Subjects, obliged to abandon their Poſſeſſions, and flee for their Lives at leaſt, except a ſmall Relief, at firſt, in the moſt diſtreſſing Circumſtances, were left to ſtarve neglected, ſave what the friendly Hand of private Donations has contributed to their Support; wherein they, who are moſt profuſe towards Savages, have carefully avoided hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Part. When laſt Summer the Troops raiſed for Defence of the Province, were limited to certain Bounds, nor ſuffered to attempt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noying
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009630_0006_0F7738540874DB20"/>our Enemies in their Habitations, and a Number of brave Voluntiers, equipped at their own Expence, marched in <hi>September</hi> up the <hi>Suſquehanna,</hi> met and defeated their Enemy with the loſs of ſome of their Number, and having others dangerouſly wounded, not the leaſt Thanks or Acknowledgment was made them from the Legiſlature for the confeſſed Service they had done, nor any the leaſt Notice or Care taken of their wounded. Whereas, when a <hi>Seneca</hi> Indian, who, by the information of many, as well as by his own Confeſſion, had been through the laſt War an inveterate Enemy had got a Cut in his Head laſt Summer, in a Quarrel he had with his own Couſin, and it was reported in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> that his Wound was dangerous; a Doctor was immediately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and ſent to Fort <hi>Auguſta</hi> to take care of him and cure him if poſſible. To theſe may be added, that though it was impoſſible to obtain thro' the Summer or even yet any Premium for <hi>Indian</hi> Scalps or Encouragement to excite Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers to go forth againſt them, yet when a few of them known to be the faſt Friends of our Enemies, and ſome of them Murderers themſelves; when theſe have been ſtruck by a diſtreſſed, bereft, injured Frontier, a liberal Reward is offered for apprehending the Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators of that horrible Crime of killing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's cloaked Enemies: And their Conduct painted in the moſt atrocious Colours, while the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009630_0007_0F773854C6504988"/>horrid Ravages, cruel Murders and moſt ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Barbarities committed by <hi>Indians</hi> on His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Subjects are covered over and excuſed under the charitable Term of this being their Method of making War.</p>
            <p>BUT to recount the many repeated Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances whereof we might juſtly complain, and Inſtances of a moſt violent Attachment to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> were tedious beyond the Patience of a Job to endure. Nor can better be expected nor need we be ſurprized at <hi>Indian</hi> Inſolence and Villainy when it is conſidered, and which can be proved from the publick Records in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain County, That ſome time before <hi>Conrad Weiſer</hi> died, ſome <hi>Indians</hi> belonging to the <hi>Great Iſland</hi> or <hi>Wyalooſing</hi> aſſured him that—(an ancient Leader of that Faction, which for ſo long a Time have found Means to enſlave the Province to <hi>Indians</hi>) together with others of the Friends, had given them a Rod to ſcourge the white People that were ſettled on the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed Lands; for that ONAS had cheated them out of a great deal of Land, or had not given near ſufficient price for what he had bought. And that the Traders ought alſo to be ſcourged; for that they defrauded the <hi>Indians</hi> by ſelling Goods to them at too dear a Rate, and that this Relation is matter of fact, can eaſily be proved in the County of <hi>Berks.</hi> Such is our unhappy Situation, under the Villany, Infatuation and Influence of a certain Faction that have got the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009630_0008_0F7738559266B568"/>political Reigns in their Hand and tamely ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over the other good Subjects of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince! And can it be thought ſtrange, that a Scene of ſuch Treatment as this, and the now adding in this critical Juncture to all our former Diſtreſſes, that diſagreeable Burden of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the very Heart of the Province, at ſo great an Expence, between One and Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Savages, to the great Diſquietude of the Majority of the good Inhabitants of this Province, ſhould awaken the Reſentment of a People groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſed, unrighteouſly burdened, and made Dupes and Slaves to Indians? And muſt not all well diſpoſed People entertain a charitable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of thoſe, who at their own great Expence and Trouble, have attempted, or ſhall attempt reſcuing a labouring Land from a Weight ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, unreaſonable and unjuſt? It is this we Deſign, it is this we are reſolved to proſecute, tho' it is with great Reluctance we are obliged to adopt a Meaſure, not ſo agreeable as could be deſired, and to which Extremity alone compels.</p>

WE underſtand that a Bill is now before the Houſe of Aſſembly, wherein it is Provided, that ſuch Perſons as ſhall be charged with killing any <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>Lancaſter</hi> County, ſhall not be tried in the County where the Fact was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but in the Counties of <hi>Philadelphia, Cheſter,</hi> or <hi>Bucks.</hi> This is manifeſtly to deprive <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects of their known Privileges, to caſt an eternal Reproach upon whole Counties, as if they were unfit to ſerve their Country in the Quality of Jury-Men, and to contradict the well known Laws of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation; in a point whereon Life, Liberty, and Security eſſentially depend: Namely, that of being tried by their Equals in the Neighbourhood where their own, their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, and the Witneſſes Character and Credit, with the Circumſtances of the Fact are beſt known, and inſtead thereof, putting their Lives in the Hands of Strangers, who may as juſtly be ſuſpected of Partiality to, as the Frontier Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties can be of Prejudices againſt Indians; and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009630_0011_0F773859CC2B72B0"/>this too in favour of Indians only, againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's faithful and loyal Subjects. Beſides it is well known that the Deſign of it is to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend a Fact committed before ſuch a Law was thought of. And if ſuch Practices were tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, no man could be ſecure in his moſt invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Intereſts. We are alſo informed to our great Surprize, that this Bill has actually received the Aſſent of a Majority of the Houſe, which we are perſwaded could not have been the Caſe, had our Frontier Counties been equally repreſented in Aſſembly: However, we hope, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator of this Province will never enact a Law of ſo dangerous a tendency, or take away from his Majeſty's good Subjects, a Privilege ſo long eſteemed ſacred by <hi>Engliſh Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. DURING the late and preſent <hi>Indian</hi> Wars, the Frontiers of this Province have been repeatedly attacked and ravaged by Skulking parties of the Indians, who have with the moſt ſavage Cruelty, murdered Men, Women and Children, without diſtinction; and have reduced near a Thouſand Families to the moſt extream Diſtreſs. It grieves us to the very Heart, to ſee ſuch of our Frontier Inhabitants as have eſcaped from ſavage Fury, with the loſs of their Parents, their Children, their Husbands, Wives, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, left deſtitute by the Public, and expoſed to the moſt cruel Poverty and Wretchedneſs; while upwards of One Hundred and Twenty of the Savages, who are with great Reaſon ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009630_0012_0F77385A209844D0"/>of being guilty of theſe horrid Barbarities, under the Mask of Friendſhip, have procured themſelves to be taken under the Protection of the Government, with a view to elude the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the brave Relatives of the Murdered; and are now maintained at the public Expence: Some of theſe Indians now in the Barracks of <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> are confeſſedly a part of the <hi>Wyaluſing Indians,</hi> which Tribe is now at War with us; and the others are the <hi>Moravian Indians,</hi> who living amongſt us under the Cloak of Friendſhip, carried on a Correſpondence with our known Enemies on the <hi>Great-Iſland.</hi> We cannot but obſerve with Sorrow and Indignation, that ſome Perſons in this Province are at pains to extenuate the barbarous Cruelties practiſed by theſe ſavages on our Murdered Brethren and Relatives, which are ſhocking to human Nature, and muſt pierce every Heart but thoſe of the hardened Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators or their Abettors. Nor is it leſs Diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear others pleading, that altho' the <hi>Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aluſing</hi> Tribe is at War with us, yet that part of it which is under the Protection of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may be friendly to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and Innocent. In what Nation under the Sun was it ever the Cuſtom, that when a neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion took up Arms, not an individual of the Nation ſhould be touched, but only the Perſons that offered Hoſtilities? Who ever proclaimed War with a part of a Nation, and not with the Whole? Had theſe Indians diſapproved of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009630_0013_0F77385AC9E29808"/>Perfidy of their Tribe, and been willing to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate and preſerve Friendſhip with us, why did they not give Notice of the War before it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, as it is known to be the Reſult of long Deliberations, and a preconcerted Combination amongſt them? Why did they not leave their Tribe immediately, and come amongſt us before there was ground to ſuſpect them, or War was actually waged with the Tribe? No, they ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them, were privy to their Murders and Ravages, untill we had deſtroyed their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and when they could no longer ſubſiſt at Home, they came, not as Deſerters, but as Friends, to be maintained thro' the Winter, that they may be able to ſcalp and butcher us in the Spring.</p>
            <p>AND as to the <hi>Moravian Indians,</hi> there are ſtrong grounds, at leaſt to ſuſpect their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as it is known that they carried on a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with our Enemies, on the <hi>Great Iſland.</hi> We killed three <hi>Indians</hi> going from <hi>Bethelem</hi> to the <hi>Great-Iſland,</hi> with Blankets, Ammunition and Proviſions; which is an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Proof, that, the <hi>Moravian Indians</hi> were in confederacy with our open Enemies. And we cannot but be filled with Indignation, to hear this Action of ours, painted in the moſt odious and deteſtable Colours, as if we had inhumanly murdered our Guides, who preſerved us from periſhing in the Woods; when we only killed three of our known Enemies, who attempted
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009630_0014_0F77385C5C2761D8"/>to ſhoot us when we ſurprized them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, we underſtand that one of theſe very <hi>Indians</hi> is proved by the Oath of <hi>Stenton</hi>'s Widow to be the very Perſon that murdered her Husband. How then comes it to paſs, that he alone of all the <hi>Moravian Indians</hi> ſhould join with the Enemy to murder that Family? Or can it be ſuppoſed that any Enemy Indians contrary to their known Cuſtom of making War, ſhould penetrate into the Heart of a ſettled Country, to burn, plunder and murder the Inhabitants, and not moleſt any Houſes on their Return, or ever be ſeen or heard of? Or how can we account for it that no Ravages have been committed in <hi>Northampton</hi> County ſince the Removal of the <hi>Moravian Indians,</hi> when the <hi>Great Cove</hi> has been ſtruck ſince? Theſe things put it beyond doubt with us, that the <hi>Indians</hi> now at <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> are His Majeſty's perfidious Enemies, and therefore to protect and maintain them at the public Expence, while our ſuffering Brethren on the Frontiers are almoſt deſtitute of the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of Life and are neglected by the Public, is ſufficient to make us mad with Rage, and tempt us to do what nothing but the moſt violent Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity can vindicate. We humbly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly pray therefore that theſe Enemies of his Majeſty may be removed as ſoon as poſſible out of the Province.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. WE humbly conceive that it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Maxims of good Policy and extreamly
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009630_0015_0F77385DAE2245B0"/>dangerous to our Frontiers, to ſuffer any <hi>Indians</hi> of what Tribe ſoever, to live within the inhabited Parts of this Province, while we are engaged in an <hi>Indian</hi> War; as Experience has taught us that they are all Perfidious, and their Claim to Freedom and Independency puts it in their Power to act as Spies, to entertain and give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence to our Enemies, and to furniſh them with Proviſions and warlike Stores. To this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Intercourſe between our pretended Friends and open Enemies we muſt aſcribe the greateſt Part of the Ravages and Murders that have been committed in the Courſe of this and the laſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> War. We therefore pray that this Greiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be taken under conſideration and remedied.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. WE cannot help lamenting that no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion has been hitherto made, that ſuch of our Frontier Inhabitants as have been wounded in defence of the Province, their Lives and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, may be taken care of and cured of their Wounds at the public Expence. We therefore pray that this Grievance may be redreſſed.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. IN the late <hi>Indian</hi> War this Province, with others of his Majeſty's Colonies gave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for <hi>Indian</hi> Scalps, to encourage the ſeeking them in their own Country, as the moſt likely Means of deſtroying or reducing them to reaſon. But no ſuch Encouragement has been given in this War, which has damped the Spirits of many brave Men, who are willing to venture their Lives in Parties againſt the Enemy. We
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009630_0016_0F77385E185A2568"/>therefore pray that public Rewards may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for <hi>Indian</hi> Scalps, which may be ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the Dangers attending Enterpriſes of this Nature.</p>
            <p n="7">7th. WE daily lament that Numbers of our neareſt and deareſt Relatives are ſtill in Captivity amongſt the ſavage Heathen, to be trained up in all their Ignorance and Barbarity, or be tortured to death with all the Contrivances of <hi>Indian</hi> cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for attempting to make their Eſcape from Bondage. We ſee they pay no regard to the many ſolemn Promiſes which they have made to reſtore our Friends, who are in Bondage amongſt them; we therefore earneſtly pray that no Trade may hereafter be permitted to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with them, untill our Brethren and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives are brought home to us.</p>
            <p n="8">8thly. WE complain that a certain Society of People in this Province in the late <hi>Indian</hi> War and at ſeveral Treaties held by the Kings Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, openly loaded the <hi>Indians</hi> with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and that — a Leader of the ſaid Society, in defiance of all Government not only abetted our <hi>Indian</hi> Enemies, but kept up a private Intelligence with them, and publickly received from them a Belt of Wampum, as if he had been our Governor or authorized by the King to treat with his Enemies. By this Means the <hi>Indians</hi> have been taught to diſpiſe us as a weak and diſunited People and from this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Source have aroſe many of our Calamities
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009630_0017_0F77385E85CED4E8"/>under which we groan. We humbly pray therefore this Grievance may be redreſſed and that no private Subject be hereafter permitted to treat with or carry on a Correſpondence with our Enemies.</p>
            <p n="9">9thly. WE cannot but obſerve with ſorrrow that Fort <hi>Auguſta</hi> which has been very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive to this Province, has afforded us but little aſſiſtance, during this or the laſt War. The Men that were ſtationed at that Place neither helped our diſtreſſed Inhabitants to ſave their Crops, nor did they attack our Enemies in their Towns, or patrole on our Frontiers. We hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly requeſt, that proper Meaſures may be taken to make that Garriſon more ſerviceable to us in our Diſtreſs, if it can be done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> WE are far from intending any Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Commanding Officer ſtationed at <hi>Auguſta,</hi> as we preſume his Conduct was always directed by thoſe from whom he received his Orders.</p>
