            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>John 6.37. —And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</head>
            <p>IN this Chapter we have the sacred Story of Christ's feeding five Thousand men with five Loaves and two Fishes, together with the Consequents of that Miracle. One Effect of it was, that many followed Christ, hoping that He would have fed them again in a way <hi>extraordinary.</hi> The Lord Christ did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them for their vanity, in desiring to live an idle life, and then hoping that they should be fed by Miracle. He also took <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to exhort them to labour after meat for their souls: He does therefore set forth the excellency of spiritual bread, shewing how much it does transcend the Manna which the Children of Israel lived upon in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>Wilderness;
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000415_0007_0FA5B663B9F0D708"/>
thereupon the <hi>Iews</hi> desired that they might alwayes feed upon that bread <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>Then said they to Him, Lord evermore give us this bread.</hi> It is evident that they had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal imaginations in their minds still, dreaming of bread for their bodies, which might cause them to live a long time in this world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in answer to that request of theirs, the Lord Jesus Christ does both inform and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He informs them, What that Bread of life which He spake of, is, and what it is to eat thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> that He Himself is that Bread, and that to beleeve on Him, is to eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>ver.</hi> 35.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He reproveth them for their Unbelief, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. <hi>But I say unto you, that you also have seen me and beleeve no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> They had seen Christ with bodily eyes, and they had seen his <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> too, and yet they had not seen Him with an eye of Faith; they did not close with Him as the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> as the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World.</p>
            <p>In this verse there are two things asserted,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Reason why some that have the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of Faith, yet never beleeve. It is because they are not by the Father given to Christ. All <hi>such</hi> shall <hi>first</hi> or <hi>last</hi> believe on Him.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000415_0008_0FA5B663E9A51260"/>
But if men be not given to Christ, let them hear never such sermons preached, nay, tho never such Miracles should be wrought before their eyes, they will not beleeve.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing asserted in this verse, is, the great benefit which does follow upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ as in the words before us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on; the meaning of which may be spoken unto under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from them, which is,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That if any m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, whoever he be, shall indeed come unto Iesus Christ, He will in no wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> cast him out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the clearing of this Doctrine, three things may be enquired into,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who are Comers unto Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is imply'd in this expression, that <hi>Christ will in no wise cast him out that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Is not murder a crying sin? But to murder the Son of God! is a crime beyond parallel: Yet those very men that embrued their hands in the blood of Christ, when they came hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to him for mercy, beleeving on Him whom they had crucified, he received them &amp; obtain'd their peace with God. If thou dost come to him, Hee'll wash thy soul in his Blood.

them, or that their is not merit enough in the Blood of Christ to obtain forgiveness for so great a sin as that is, but because they have not an heart to come to Christ. The Unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Sin is alwaies attended with final Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, and everlasting Hardness of heart. And this Objection is a meer Temptation of Satan, who seeketh thereby to discourage souls from coming to Christ, He useth to tell those who never did nor ever shall commit <hi>the great Transgression,</hi> they have been guilty of it. Tell me, hast thou any desire to come to Christ? Dost thou prize his blood? then 'tis certain thou never wast guilty of the unpardonable sin, for <hi>such</hi> trample under foot the Son of God, and count his blood an unholy thing. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. Art thou a malicious persecutor of the <hi>wayes</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of God? if not, <hi>I</hi> dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce unto thee, that thou wast never guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost; for there never was any man guilty of that sin, but that he was given up to a spirit of persecution; He is filled with rage against the Servants of God, because they fear his Name, and dare not sin against him. Yet again, Didst thou ever mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously blaspheme or speak evil of that which thou knowest was the work of God's Spirit? If thou hast not done despite to the Spirit of Grace, thou hast not committed the sin against

the Holy Ghost. I must confess it is to be feared, that many of the malignant adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Truth in these late dayes, have bin judicially given up by God to commit that sin; yet I will say, I am perswaded there is not one soul in this Congregation this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ever was guilty of it. O yet let not this, nor any other Objection discourage any one among you from coming to Christ.</p>
            <p>For Direction here.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>See thy absolute need of Christ.</hi> Without this no one will come to him. For men are naturally averse to nothing so much as to this, so that they will not come to Christ, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept sense of extream necessity compel them to it. Will a man that thinks himself well, run to a Physician for help? The whole have no need of a Physician but the sick. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12. But if men see their absolute need of Christ, then they'll be willing to go to him. When the sons of <hi>Iacob</hi> saw themselves like to perish by the Famine, they would go to Joseph for bread, that they might live and not dye. An Israelite when he saw the Avenger of blood pursuing of him, was made willing to betake himself to the <hi>City of refuge.</hi> Behold sinner, the <hi>Avenger of bloud</hi> is at thy heels! if thou dost not make haste to the City of refuge, hee'll

overtake thee and slay thy soul. Know that without Christ, thou hast a soul within thee that must perish to Eternity. If thou hadst been guilty but of <hi>one</hi> sin in all thy life, thou must lye and dye for ever under the wrath of God, if Christ save thee not. But what wilt thou do then having been guilty of so many and great sins? thou canst not save thy self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all thy <hi>own</hi> Righteousness, all thy Prayers, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, Tears, if thou couldst weep Seas of blood cannot save thee.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Beware of those things which will keep thee from closing with the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection to the world, keeps many a man from Coming to Christ: So it was with the young man in the Gospel, his heart was so set upon the world that he neglected to close with Jesus Christ.

            <p>Propos. 3. <hi>Every sinner unto whom the Word of God comes, is bound to turn from his evil way.</hi> The first thing which God required of man was that he should not sin at all. The Law required that: nor does the Law speak any thing of Repentance, but the <hi>Gospel</hi> does. The Law requireth that men should not turn from God; The Gospel requireth that men having turned from God, should turn to him again. Faith and Repentance are the great duties required in the Gospel.

Hence it is sometimes called <hi>Conversion.</hi> When a man is gone out of the right way, and turns back again, <hi>that's</hi> Conversion. So tis with sinners: They are all gone astray; but God in the word of the Gospel calls aloud to them that they should turn back again. And that <hi>turning from sin</hi> which the Word of God requireth, is to be both <hi>External</hi> and <hi>Internal.</hi> It is necessary that a Sinner should lead a new life, that his outward Actions, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation should be Reformed. <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your waies and your doings,</hi> but thats not all which God requireth.

            <p>Propos. 4. <hi>Men ought not only to turn from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>very evil way but to doe it</hi> Now, <hi>and in no wise to delay that matter.</hi> Thus did the Prophets with one voice declare, as is in the Context intimated. And indeed this follows upon what has bin spoken. If God command men to turn, it is necessary that they should doe it <hi>now.</hi> For every Commandment of God ought to be immediately complyed with. There ought to be no delaying, or disputing whether what the great GOD requireth should be obeyed or no. When the Lord commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to circumcise his Family, it is noted that <hi>in the self same day</hi> he did as God said to him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.23. And when he was required to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his only son, its recorded of him, that <hi>he rose</hi> early <hi>in the morning,</hi> and went to the place

of which God had told him. <hi>Cap.</hi> 22.3. When the Lord Christ called his Disciples to follow him tis said, that <hi>straightway</hi> they did so. <hi>Mat,</hi> 4.20. And when <hi>Paul</hi> was called to the Apostleship, he did not consult with flesh and bloud, <hi>h. e.</hi> he did not ask counsil of any man whether he should do what God required of him, but immediately fell about the work, <hi>Gal,</hi> 1.16. Thus every divine precept ought <hi>present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to be complyed with. So should this of turning from every evil way. And there is Infinite Reason that men should turn <hi>now</hi>; as we cannot but see if we duly mind, either what they are commanded to turn <hi>from,</hi> or whom they are to turn <hi>unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What is it that sinners are to turn</hi> from? It is from <hi>Sin,</hi> which is an unprofitable thing. Men don't use to stand considering whether they shall retain a thing which they are sure they shall never gain any thing <hi>by:</hi> Now they may be sure they shall never gain any thing by sin. <hi>Rom,</hi> 6.21. <hi>What fruit had you of those things whereof ye are now ashamed?</hi> There is nothing but shame and Sorrow to be gained by sin. Yea, it is not only an <hi>unprofitable,</hi> but a <hi>hurtful</hi> thing. If a man were running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mouth of a bloudy serpent ready to devour him, would he stand pausing upon it whether he should turn back? No, he would

presently turn about. Sin is a cruel Serpent which devoureth immortal souls, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the greatest madness in the world for men to make a question whether he should not presently turn from such an evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Who is it that sinners are to turn</hi> unto? It is unto God in Jesus Christ. <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2.12 <hi>Turn you even to me with all your heart, saith the Lord.</hi> Even unto that God who is the Fountain of Living water. He in whose favour is Life, and whose Loving Kindness is better than <hi>life</hi> it self. He who will give Grace and Glory, and will with-hold no good thing from them that shall turn unto him.</p>

And there is no unconverted sinner in the world, but he will one day wish that he had turned from his evil wayes sooner. If e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Lord give him Repentance unto life, then will he be sorry in his heart, that he was so long before he had any saving acquaintance with God and with Jesus Christ. <hi>Paul</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sorrowfully of his late Conversion. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.8. <hi>And last of all he was seen of me, as of one born out of due time.</hi> He was troubled to think that he had lived so many years in the world before he knew Christ Or if a sinner shall be so unhappy as to dye in his evil way, he will for ever wish, when it is too late, that he had hearkened to the Call of the Gospel requiring him to turn Now. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Then shall they call upon me but I will not answer, they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.</hi> When the day of Grace is past, and when the day of life is spent and gone, Sinners will reflect upon themselves with infinite anguish, and say, What Fools were we that did not turn from sin in time, but now the sun is set, and the day

is become dark over us <hi>for ever.</hi> Had we sought after Reconciliation with God soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we might have obtained it: but Wo and Alas for us, now it will never be.</p>
            <p>Consider 3. <hi>In</hi> other <hi>matters men are unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either to delay, or to</hi> be <hi>delayed.</hi> There is many a poor foolish sinner, that if he does but hear of a <hi>Play</hi> to be acted, or any thing which is a matter of sport and pastime, he'll be early at it: He will not let slip the time, but rather be too soon than too late. But when he is called upon to look after the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his own soul, he puts that off from day to day, as if <hi>that</hi> could <hi>never</hi> be too late. In worldly matters, especially if they be of moment, men have so much wisdome as to dispatch them out of hand. It was said of <hi>Boaz</hi> when an affair that did greatly concern him was to be issued, <hi>The man will not be at rest until he hath finished the thing this day.</hi> Ruth. 3.18. And yet as to the work of Repentance, and making their peace with God, than which nothing can be of greater Concernment, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners can be at rest from day to day; nay, from <hi>year to year,</hi> tho that work be not finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor so much as begun: How sad is it to consider! You cannot bear Delayes from others, yet must the great God bear Delayes
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000415_0055_0FA5B69B56449F60"/>
from you? If any of you should command his servant to do such a work <hi>presently,</hi> but he sayes hee'l take his own time and not yours, how would you bear it! But when God commands you to turn <hi>now,</hi> will you take your own time and not God's to doe it? You cannot bear delayes from God himself: If men be in any distress, they are ready to say, Lord make hast to our help! Hear us <hi>speedily</hi>! Make no tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Why then when God calls to you to turn from your evil way, make hast and make no tarrying. If any amongst you should be in grievous tormenting pain, and should cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for help, but he should put you off, and say, Twenty or thirty years I'le consider about the matter; how impatient would you be! And will you then say to God, I'le turn from my evil wayes 20 or 30 years hence, whenas the Lord saith, Do it <hi>NOW.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Let Sinners sadly Consider <hi>Whom they Gratifie, and whom they grieve by delaying their Conversion.</hi> They please their greatest enemy, and displease their best Friend. You cannot gratifie your Adversary the Devil more: who is it that saith to you, Wilt thou think of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from thy sins? it will be soon enough for that hereafter. No one but the Devil or such as are stirred up by him, will suggest such a

thought unto thee. He knoweth that if he can but perswade thee to delay thy Conversion a while longer, he shall make sure of thy soul. He alwaies tells sinners either that it is too <hi>soon</hi> for them to turn unto God, or else that it is too <hi>late.</hi> If he should see thee in earnest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that matter, he would say it is too late now: But as long as thou art careless about it, he saies it is too <hi>soon</hi>; thereby hoping to perswade thee to delay until it be too late <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> and then he will deride thee for thy Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So that if a man would study to gratifie the Devil, he could not do it more than by <hi>Deferring his repentance.</hi> But then, whom doe you <hi>greive</hi> thereby? All the <hi>good</hi> men that know thee are grieved for thee: thy nearest Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are so if they fear God. It may be thou hast a Godly Father, or a godly Mother: They are grieved to see that thou dost continue still in thy natural unconverted estate. And the Angels of Heaven are grieved by thee. There is joy in the presence of the Angels of God over one sinner that repents, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.10. So that Sinners who delay their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hinder the joy of Angels. And that which is yet sader is, thou grievest the heart of <hi>God</hi> by thy delaying to turn again from thy evil way. The Lord (to speak of Him after the manner of men) thinks the time long, and
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:000415_0057_0FA5B69C3044F2E8"/>
is grieved that thou shouldst slight his Calls, and disregard his Commands for so long a time. He saith, <hi>Wash thine heart from wickedness,</hi> — how long <hi>shall vain thoughts lodge in thee?</hi> Jer. 4.14. And again <hi>wilt thou not be made clean?</hi> when <hi>shall it once be? Chapt.</hi> 13.27. Yet again, hear another Scripture, <hi>How long</hi> will it be, e're they attain to innocency? <hi>Hos.</hi> 8.5. <hi>How long! When? How long?</hi> The Spirit of God is grieved by thy long delayes. He looketh upon thy Delayes as Refusals and flat Denials. He saith thou art unwilling to return, and that, thats the reason of thy delaying so long. This must needs grieve and provoke Him. And why wilt thou displease that God who hath been so kind to thee?</p>
            <p>Consider 5. <hi>The Infinite danger which is in mens Delaying their Conversion.</hi> Every Sinner had need make haste about this matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a little Delay may cost him his <hi>Life.</hi> The Angel said to <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis a dangerous
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000415_0058_0FA5B69EA78EF7E8"/>
thing for a man to deferr his Repentance tho but for one day. One days delay may cost a man the Life of his soul. When <hi>Michal</hi> told <hi>David,</hi> saying, <hi>If thou save not thy life to night,</hi> to morrow <hi>thou shalt be slain,</hi> He went and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>led and escaped. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.11, 12. Thus O Sinner, If thou dost not turn from thine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities <hi>this day,</hi> it may be to morrow thou shalt be slain. So that it is a very dangerous thing for any man to put off his Repentance a <hi>day</hi> longer: because of the uncertainty of life it is so. When once Death has given the fatal Blow, it's too late for the Sinner to think of turning and making his peace with GOD. <hi>Isai.</hi> 38.18. <hi>They that go down into the</hi> pit <hi>cannot hope for thy truth.</hi> The Sinner whose Body is gone down into the pit of <hi>Death,</hi> and whose soul is gone down into the pit of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Darkness,</hi> cannot hope that he shall ever be Converted, or that ever his soul shall be saved. And who knoweth how soon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of Death may strike him! The Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt of Death may kill thee before another morning. Then turn from thy sins <hi>now.</hi> I have diverse times put you in mind of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of that famous Minister of Christ, Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> who would sometimes say, <hi>I would not be in my unconverted estate again one day, tho I might have all the world for it, lest happly death
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000415_0059_0FA5B6A05120CFB8"/>
should come upon me that day, and so my immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal soul be lost for ever.</hi> And it is a dangerous thing for men to delay their Conversion, because the longer they delay it, the more unlike are they ever to be converted. Sinner it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and most probable that <hi>now or never</hi> is thy time to repent in. The longer thou dost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, the more unwilling and the more unable to turn art thou like to be. For Satan will get faster hold on thy soul; and the longer he has held his Possession the more difficult will his Departure be. We read of one in the Gospel, that the Divel was cast out of him with exceeding Difficulty, and when it was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>how long is it ago since this came to him</hi>? Answer was made, <hi>of a</hi> child. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.21. Thus where the Divel has a long time held his possession of a soul, its a hard matter to get him out. And <hi>SIN</hi> as well as Sathan will have deeper rooting and stronger hold on the soul, if Conversion be delayed. The sins of men are like Bonds upon their souls, It was said to <hi>Simon Magus, Thou art in the</hi> bond <hi>of iniquity.</hi> Now the longer men continue in sin, the stronger do they make that woful bond: they will find their souls so fetter'd in the bloody chains of sin, as that it will be a wonder if ever they get loose <hi>Ier.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:000415_0060_0FA5B6A0C67A37E8"/>
spots? then may ye also do good that are accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to do evil.</hi> Can it be? it would be strange if it should: Such a thing will be a kind of a Miracle. The sinner is in a grave: Every Sin he doth commit is as it were another stone cast upon that grave which will make his Resurrection the more difficult. And there is infinite danger in mens delaying their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, lest God should say of them as He did of the old world of ungodly ones, who deferred their Repentance. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>My spirit shall not alw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but they have Convictions: They know they must repent of sin, but they purpose to do it <hi>hereafter</hi>; and so by deferring the matter, their souls are eternally ruin'd e're they are aware. Hell is full of <hi>delaying</hi> Sinners. The Devil has not a greater stratagem to ruin souls by than this. He that will never repent while <hi>to morrow,</hi> will <hi>never</hi> repent at all. Therefore the Devil's great Design is, to perswade the Sinner still to deferr his Repentance until <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow,</hi> that so it may <hi>never</hi> be.</p>
            <p>Let these Considerations awaken every one that is in a State of Sin, <hi>Now</hi> to turn and live. There are some of you that have continued a long time in a natural unregenerate estate: Perhaps you have lived in the world, 30, or 40, or it may be <hi>sixty</hi> years, and in an unconverted estate to this day. It is time to seek the Lord. 'Tis high time for you to consider your wayes and to look about you. Think not with thy self, I'le repent when I come to lye down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my sick bed. How dost thou know that thou shalt lie upon a sick bed at all? It may be some sudden Stroak will take thee out of the world, and where will thy soul be <hi>then</hi>? Or if thou shouldest be visited with Sickness, thats no sutable time to repent in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps thou wilt then <hi>lie unto God with thy mouth, and
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:000415_0063_0FA5B6A48E437570"/>
flatter him with thy lips.</hi> Sick-bed-Repentance is very seldome true. How often do we see, that Sinners on sick beds make fair promises, to God and man, but when they are recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they become as bad or worse than ever they were before. Yes, and it may be then thou wilt cry out, <hi>it is too late now.</hi> Did you never hear of a man who delaying his Repentance till he came to lie upon his sick bed, when he was told he must repent of sin, replyed, <hi>all too late</hi>: and when he was exhorted to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for pardon of his past transgressions, he made the same reply, <hi>All to late</hi>! If I had hearkned to this Counsil sooner, it had been happy for me, but <hi>all's too late now</hi>!

And remember also, that no man has any true joy or solid Comfort, in any thing until such time as he hath turned from his sins, and made his peace with God, through Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>To Direct and Help you here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Practice that great Duty of Self-Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Look into thy heart and way, and see if there be not some sin, which thou must of necessity turn <hi>from,</hi> or dye <hi>for</hi> it. Some, their Sins are so notorious that they ca'nt but know that they live in sin. Swearers, Sabbath-breakers, Drunkards, unclean persons and such like, they cannot but know that they must Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent or perish. But then there be others, who are of a civil, blameless Conversation before men, and these are more apt to be deceived. But search thy heart, and perhaps thou wilt find that Sin <hi>reigns</hi> there. It may be there is some sin of Commission which thou livest in, which thy heart delights in. Or some sin of <hi>Omission,</hi> perhaps thou dost live in the Neglect
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000415_0065_0FA5B6A621B7CA48"/>
of Prayer from day to day, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Let us search and try our waies, and turn again to the Lord.</hi> If men would search impartially, they would be more likely to turn. Alas many do not turn, because they think that work is done already; whenas they have turned only from <hi>some</hi> sins, and not from <hi>all.</hi> Take heed left some secret unknown sin which thou art unwilling to see prove the ruin of thy soul. O for the Lords sake be not deceived: And therefore examine your own hearts and estates before the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Set your selves to consider seriously of those things wherein your souls, and everlasting estates are concerned.</hi> Sinners are apt to put off all good Exhortations, by saying, <hi>they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert themselves.</hi> True, but you may use the meanes; of which Serious Consideration is none of the least.

            <p>IN this Chapter we have both the <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and the <hi>Instructions</hi> which the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les received from the Lord Jesus Christ, when they were first sent forth to preach the Gospel. The Lord instructed them unto whom they should first go and make a tender of the Gospel: Only to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and not to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> until such time as it would be seen whether the Jewes would accept thereof or no. In the preceding verse the Lord directs them how they should behave themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towards
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000415_0069_0FA5B6A927B57B48"/>
such as would reject them and their Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that they should shake off the dust of their feet against them; and we find that in after times the Apostles practised ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.51. Whereby they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they looked upon such Persons tho' <hi>Israelites,</hi> as prophane and as abominable as any Heathen, and therefore such as they would no more hold Communion with; but that they would go away from them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Gospel to others who would give it a better Reception. The Jewes looked upon the very earth or dust which was brought out of Heathen Lands to be impure, yea, as unclean as the Ashes of a dead Carcase which they might not touch. Hence by shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dust of their feet against them, they would signifie that they were such Sinners as did defile the very ground they trod upon, and so as abominable as any Heathen.</p>
            <p>In this verse there are Two Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Declaration of the grievous punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which shall come upon them that despise the Gospel. It shall be more tolerable for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Gomorrha than for such. <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> are instanc'd in, because they were made the most terible Example of Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Vengeance
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:000415_0070_0FA5B6A9D268D848"/>
that ever was in the world.</p>

            <p>DOCT. 1. <hi>That there shall be a day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That at the day of Iudgment all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners shall not suffer alike, but some will have a farr more intolerable Punishment than</hi> others <hi>shall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 3. <hi>That they who have despised the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of the Gospel shall at the Day of Iudgment fall under the heaviest CONDEMNATION.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At present only concerning the first of these Doctrines, Viz. <hi>That there shall be a day of Iudgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the clearing of this Doctrine, there are three things to be enquired into. 1. How it does appear that there shall be such a day. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What kind of day it will be. 3. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why there must be such a day.</p>
            <p>Quest. 1. <hi>How does it appear that there shall
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:000415_0071_0FA5B6AC198FA3E0"/>
be</hi> a Day of Judgement?</p>
            <p>ANSW. 1. <hi>The Scripture does abundantly bear witness to this truth.</hi> In the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there are many Testimonies concerning a Judgment <hi>to come.</hi> So in the Book of Psalms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.3, 4. and 96.13. not to mention other places. And the Prophets, in special <hi>Isaiah, Daniel, Malachi</hi> speak expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and distinctly of this Judgment. Hence the <hi>Iews</hi> themselves acknowledge that there will be a general Day of Judgement. But in the <hi>New Testament</hi> this (as well as many other great Truths) is more clearly and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made known. Yea, the <hi>Form</hi> of Judgment is there described, as in the Latter end of the twenty fifth Chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi> we may see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Light of Nature, and that Conscience which is in men, sheweth that there must needs be a Iudgement to come.</hi> Conscience is a mans judgment of himself, as subjected to the Judgment of God. The Apostle sheweth that the Gentiles doe by nature the things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Law; their Conscience bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and their thoughts accusing or excusing <hi>in the mean while</hi> h. e. until the day come that God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.16. Before the great day of Judgment come, they are judging and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000415_0072_0FA5B6ACA5A47D68"/>
impleading themselves, There is a day of judgement kept in the Conscience, which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that God will have a Day of Judgement for all men. If men were not to be judged by <hi>God,</hi> they would never enter into judgement with <hi>themselves.</hi> Hence there are secret, aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fears upon the spirits of Sinners with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto this Day: Yea sometimes in the <hi>worst</hi> of sinners. When <hi>Felix</hi> heard <hi>Paul</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>erning Righteousness and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and <hi>IVDGMENT to come,</hi> he tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25. Especially when Sinners ly upon sick-beds, and Death-beds, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells them they must appear before the Judgment seat of the GREAT GOD and answer for all the evils they have done. Or if men commit any great sin, conscience tells them they must to Judgment for that sin. He that shall tell a Lye against his Conscience, or commit any such grievous sin, has that in his own breast (a <hi>Conscience</hi>) which is a Preacher of Judgement to him, because of that Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Providence of God does so order matters in the World, as that we may from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there will be a Day of Iudgment.</hi> e. g. He permits <hi>wrong</hi> Judgment to pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men in the world. <hi>Guilty</hi> men are here <hi>acquitted,</hi> and innocent men are oftentimes

               <hi>condemned.</hi> Psal. 44.21. Solomon did from that Consideration conclude, that things will one day be called over again, and another Judgment be passed by Him who is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and righteous JUDGE of all the world. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3.16. Great and Heinous sinners do sometimes escape punishment, not only from men, but from the Hand of God in this world. Though some such are punished to shew there is a Providence, yet others escape to shew that there is a Judgment to come, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24.</p>
            <p>Quest. 2. <hi>What kind of day will the</hi> Day of Judgment <hi>be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Answ. 1. <hi>It will be a</hi> great <hi>Day. Iude</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of <hi>the Iudgment of the</hi> great <hi>day.</hi> ver. 6. Hence it is called <hi>that day.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. There never was such a day <hi>before,</hi> and there never shall be such a day <hi>after</hi> this. It is styled <hi>the day of God.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 12. Great &amp; emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent things are expressed by the Name of <hi>God</hi> in Scripture.</p>
            <p>It will be a great day, 1<hi>st.</hi> In respect of the great <hi>Multitude</hi> which then shall be judged; The whole world: <hi>God hath appointed a day wherein He will judge the</hi> world. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. Whole Nations, yea <hi>all</hi> Nations shall be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before His Judgement seat. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.32. Not only such as shall be found alive on the

earth, when the Judge shall come down from Heaven, but such as are <hi>dead,</hi> whose souls have been Thousands of years either in Heaven or Hell, must then to Judgement. 2. Tim. 4.1. What a great day will that be, when all the men that ever were in the world or that ever shall be, must every mothers Child of them appear before the Judgment Seat of the great GOD! All <hi>good</hi> men shall be <hi>judged</hi> tho' not condemned. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. And all <hi>wicked</hi> men, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. <hi>The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them, &amp; they were iudged every man according to their works.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Angels</hi> that have sinned shall then be judged. They are reserved for everlasting Chains unto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udgement of that great day. Therefore it is that the Apostate Angels tremble at the thought of this day: When they saw the Son of God they cryed and roared and said, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time? Mat.</hi> 8.29. They know that there are hotter chains reserved for them, than those which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent they are in; and the dismal thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of makes all the Devils in Hell to tremble. 2. The day of Judgement will be a day of great <hi>Discovery.</hi> Hence it is called a <hi>day.</hi> In the Night things ly hid, but in the day they are discovered: So in the dark night of this
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:000415_0075_0FA5B6B205E93AB8"/>
present world, many things are unseen and unknown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which then all the world shall see &amp; know. <hi>Lue.</hi> 12.2. It will be a day of great discovery in respect of the works and Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of God. Hence 'tis called a <hi>day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> Rom. 2.5. The Works of Creation and the Mystery of Redemption, and the strange Mysteries of Providence, and Wisdom, and Righteousness of God in all, will then be revealed to the Admiration of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for ever. There will also be a great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>men</hi> in that day. The Spiritual and Eternal estates of all (which are now known to God onely) will then be made manifest to the whole world. It will be seen who were sheep and who were goats: who were Wheat and who were Tares: who were wise and who were foolish Virgins. Many that hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> made a great Profession, that walked in Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with the people of God, that sate down with them at the Lord's Table, will then be found standing at the left hand of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and their Hypocrisie discovered. And it will be a Day of great Discovery, as to the <hi>Workes</hi> of men. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12.14. <hi>For God shall bring every work into Iudgement, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> Secret Thefts, secret Uuncleanesses, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Adultries, all will come out, and the whole

World shall hear of those things at the day of Judgment. Yea; the very <hi>thoughts</hi> of men will be discovered. The secrets of all hearts will be disclosed in that day 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. The good Designes and gracious purposes which have been in the hearts of holy men, the Lord Jesus will then reveal them and speak of them to their praise, before all the World. And the evil purposes, and wicked thoughts which have been in the hearts of ungodly men shall then be told of, to their everlasting shame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Day of Iudgement will be to the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving world a most</hi> terrible <hi>day.</hi> Hence it is expressed in the Scripture by that of <hi>the terrour of the Lord,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.

            <p>THese Words are part of a Sermon preached by our Lord Jesus Christ to His Disciples. He does therein compare Himself to a vine, and Believers on Him to vine branches; shewing that they can no more bring forth fruits of acceptable Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto God of themselves, than a branch that is separated from the Vine can bear grapes.</p>
            <p>In the preceding verse, our Lord exhorts His Disciples <hi>to abide in him,</hi> i. e. to continue constant and stedfast in the way of Faith and

And the Motive whereby he urgeth that Exhortation is, because then God will hear their prayers. <hi>If you abide on me, and my words in you, ask what you will, and it shall be done unto you.</hi> which is to be understood with this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, so farr as they should ask things agreable to the Will of God. The words now before us are a Confirmation of that Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If Christians that bring forth much fruit glorifie God, then we may be sure that he will hear their prayers, I shall not insist on any Observation from the Contextural Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words, but from them as in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves considered, the Doctrine is.</p>

            <p>ANSW. 1. It does imply <hi>a work of Grace in the soul.</hi> All those Graces which are wrought in the souls of believers are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to fruit in the Scripture: yea, unto <hi>pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

plants are an orchard of pomegranates with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant fruits. — let my beloved come into his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and eat his pleasant fruits.</hi> Faith is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to fruit. When the <hi>Colossians</hi> believed, tis said, <hi>the Gospel brought forth</hi> fruit <hi>amongst them. Chapt.</hi> 1.6. And all graces are called fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.9. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness.</hi> Thus <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</hi> Hence godly men are compared to good trees which bear good fruit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.33. They are called <hi>trees of righteousness,</hi> Isa. 61.3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As the Habit of grace, so all the Actions thereof are fruit.</hi> All Graces motions and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, whether internal in the heart, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally manifested, are Fruit. Where there is true grace, it will surely discover it self. Grace is compared to Life in the Scripture, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.9. <hi>You hath be quickened.</hi> Now Life discovers it self, at leastwise by breathings; So does grace in the soul alwaies discover it self by breathing after Christ, and after Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

is so. A godly desire and purpose in the heart is so. When a man is thinking and contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himself how he may promote the Glory of God and Good of men, those thoughts are fruit. As <hi>David</hi> when he was thinking to build an House for the Name of God, that godly intention was <hi>pleasant fruit</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> had many gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and designs working in his heart, which <hi>Timothy</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>When may Christians be said to bear much fruit?</hi> And the Answer to that is clear from what has been said in shewing what the <hi>fruit</hi> here spoken of is. In two words,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They that have much</hi> grace, <hi>bear much fruit.</hi> There is a marvellous difference among true Christians as to <hi>degrees of</hi> grace. Tho' every Believer hath every grace in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, yet it may be he has no grace in that eminent degree which some others have. Hence some Christians are compared unto <hi>Babes,</hi> others unto <hi>grown men.</hi> 1. Cor. 3.1. Some to <hi>children,</hi> others, to <hi>fathers</hi> 1. Joh. 2.13.
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:000415_0106_0FA5B61EEB58A248"/>
As there is a Difference in spiritual gifts, that one Saint does very much excel another; so there is in grace. The grace of one does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the grace of another, as much as the strength of a <hi>man</hi> is above the strength of a <hi>child.</hi> Now inasmuch as grace is <hi>fruit</hi> (as was shewed) the more grace any man hath, the more <hi>fruit</hi> does he bear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They that do most good are most fruitful.</hi> Grace will prompt a man to be doing good. Hence the more grace he hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more <hi>good</hi> will he desire and endeavour to do. The Lord Jesus Christ, who is in this Chapter compared to a vine, was the most fruitful vine that ever was. Like <hi>Iotham</hi>'s Vine, and like his Fig-tree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which had <hi>good fruit,</hi> whereby <hi>the heart of God and man was c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was alwayes doing good, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.24. <hi>I doe alwayes the things that please Him,</hi> Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pleaseth God but that which is good. When a Christian is in some measure like <hi>Christ,</hi> that all that have occasion to converse with him, <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>may be</hi> the better for him, then he is one that bears much fruit. As (I remember) <hi>Iunius</hi> saies concerning that Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and holy <hi>Vrsin,</hi> that <hi>He never went to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with him about any matter, but he was the better for it, he heard something from him that was for his edification.</hi> This is to <hi>bear much fruit.</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="unknown:000415_0107_0FA5B61FDBEFBBC0"/>
When a Christian shall be very instrumental for the good of others, he is abundantly fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. It was said of <hi>Iehojada,</hi> that he had <hi>done good in Israel both towards God, and towards his house.</hi> 2. Chron. 24.16. So they that have done much good in their Generation, have brought forth much fruit. And the truth is, A man cannot do greater good in this world, than to promote the good of the souls of men: Therefore to be <hi>abundantly</hi> instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in the Conversion, and Edification <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> souls, is to be <hi>very fruitful.</hi> That some take to be especially intended in the words of my Text, <hi>If you bear much fruit,</hi> h. e. by private and public endeavours for the good of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal souls, then God will be glorifyed. Hence in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not said to glorifie God, as though they made him more glorious than he was before, for that is impossible: Their goodness does not extend to Him: God's Essential Glory is infinite, and therefore its impossible that there should be any addition thereunto: But when Christians bear much fruit, they delare His glory before the world. They make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that the LORD is a Glorious GOD. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>That you should shew forth the</hi>

               </gap>raises <hi>of Him,</hi> or the <hi>vertues of Him.</hi> The <hi>Virtue,</hi> the Power of God is shewed forth, when his people are made fruitful. When grace is wrought in the soul, the mighty <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of God (which is his <hi>Glory</hi>) is exerted and manifested. And so it is when they <hi>act</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> grace. <hi>e. g.</hi> When a Christian does exercise much patience under affliction, the power of God is thereby magnified and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to the praise and glory of his Name. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Strengthned with all might accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his</hi> glorious <hi>power, unto all patience and long-suffering with Ioyfulness.</hi> Its wonderful to see with what patience some Christians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure their Temptations and Afflictions: but it is from the glorious power of God strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their hearts and spirits.

Only His <hi>love of delight</hi> in them, is more or less according to the measure of the fruit which they bring forth to his praise and glory. Men if they have Vines or Trees in their Orchards which are very fruitful, they take a peculiar delight in them.

fruitful man, and brought more glory to God than any one in the world in the Age wherein he lived, and God delighted in him: yea, he was so dear to God as that He could not bear to have any one speak an ill word of him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.7, 8, 9. But especially when <hi>Young</hi> men are abundantly fruitful, the Lord does <hi>exceedingly</hi> delight in them: As we see in that instance of the Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> of whom Ecclesiastical Story reports that he was the youngest of all the Disciples, but <hi>one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> years old when he began his public Ministry and Apostleship: and he was <hi>the disciple whom Iesus loved.</hi> To see a man so <hi>young</hi> so set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on glorifying God, was very pleasing. If a man has in his Orchard a <hi>young</hi> tree loaden with fruit, he takes delight in looking upon it: A young man that is alwayes doing good, the Great God never looketh upon him but with delight.</p>
            <p>Instr. 2. <hi>Hence it is a very great mercy to have an oportunity of being fruitful.</hi> there is no creature capable of a greater happiness than to be an active instrument of glorifying God. Therefore opportunities that way are singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mercies.

favour; and it is a very evil thing to decline all such advantages for Service to the Name of God. Not that a man is alwaies bound to make use of every opportunity: For God may be so gracious to him, as to put ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great opportunities into his hands, more than he can make use of. And then he must consider with himself, <hi>In which of these shall I be like to bring the greatest and most lasting glory to the Name of God?</hi> and let him be sure to doe that. But when men shall out of passion or discontent, or for any carnal ends, decline all publique Service for Christ and for his People, it is certain that their hearts are not set upon glorifying God as they ought to be, and that they don't act grace but corruption. Moreover, It is a great happiness to be call'd to Suffer for God's Name and Truth. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Vnto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but to</hi> s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And there are many true Believers, which tho' they bear fruit, yet but little fruit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively to what they should and might do.

Nay, it may be their Comunications such, as they would be ashamed to say what they had bin speaking, if the holy Lord Jesus should suddenly break in upon them and demand what their discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were about. As he did when his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were in a house at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> the Lord asked them, <hi>what was it that you disputed among your selvs by the way?

But <hi>Private</hi> Christians also, may bear much fruit: They may set such an Example as many others may be the better for: And by their prayers they may doe much good. A prayerful Christian is a fruitful Christian.

he cometh. He may doe good in whatever place he shall be. If he be in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with others, he may doe good with his Tongue. Some have said concerning Dr. <hi>Preston,</hi> that he was the most fruitful Christian in the world in that respect. He would upon all occasions set on foot Edifying Discourse, either something that should tend to promote Knowledge, or should be helpful as to the practical part of Christianity. Or, If a man be alone; he may do good with his head and heart, he may be contriving for God's glory. He may be often thinking with himself, <hi>What shall I doe for God?</hi> Is there nothing that I may yet doe for God and His people, more than I have hitherto done? Yea, a Christian should endeavour so to walk, as that all he does may be <hi>fruit unto God.</hi> Therefore holy Thoughts of GOD should be still running in his mind. I could name a man to you, that could say, <hi>For the space of these</hi> ten years, <hi>excepting when I have been asleep, Thoughts of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

all that we do become fruit, and then we shall bear <hi>much</hi> fruit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us set before us the most holy and fruitful Examples for our Imitation. Take, my brethren, the prophets for an Example</hi> Jam. 5.10. Such as we read of in the Scripture who were Eminent for God, we should consider their Example, and endeavour to become like them. Or such of the Saints as we our selves have known or heard of. And hence the reading of the Lives of holy &amp; eminent servants of Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s certainly a good, and profitable thing: It may (by the blessing of God) be a meanes to cause us to become like to them in Holiness and Fruitfulness. But above all let us set the Example of <hi>IESVS CHRIST</hi> before us, and learn of Him. The best of men have had their failings, and so are not a perfect Copy to write after: But Christ did all things well, and never did amiss in <hi>any</hi> thing. <hi>He went up and down doing good. Act.</hi> 10.3. He came no where, but He did some good, brought forth some fruit there. We should remember that example. And if a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an be exercised with any Temptation, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him to be persecuted, made the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the world, slandered, and his life fought after! let him think with himself,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:000415_0125_0FA5B632E2AC5BA8"/>
How did Christ carry it under such Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Let me demean my self as near as I can as He did. Or if he be put upon any Service, Let him consider, If Christ had been called to such a Service, how would <hi>He</hi> have manag'd that work to the glory of the Father? And as He was, so let me be in this world. Every one of us here, calls himself a Christian: He that saith he abideth in Him, ought himself also <hi>so</hi> to walk, even as He walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So shall we bear much fruit, and glorifie God.</p>

            <p>THere are two great Truths asserted in this <hi>Psalm,</hi> from both of which these words are an Inference.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God is good to his Servants, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the evils which may befal them in the world. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.</hi> Tho' such may meet with many afflictions, yet God is good, yea and good to <hi>them</hi> in all.

<pb n="124" facs="unknown:000415_0127_0FA5B6342E167258"/>
People, it must needs be good, and the best Course they can take to draw near to Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing asserted in this Psalm, is, That tho' wicked men who are strangers to God may be in present prosperity, yet it will not be long before they utterly perish, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>For lo, they that are far from thee shall perish, thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</hi> And therefore he concludes that it is good to draw near to God. If they perish that are <hi>far off,</hi> the Best and safest course is to get and keep <hi>near.</hi> Inasmuch as it cannot be <hi>ill</hi> with those that are <hi>with</hi> Him, nor <hi>well</hi> with those that are <hi>without</hi> Him, its a Rational and a necessary conclusion that <hi>it is good to draw near.</hi> And whereas the <hi>Psalmist</hi> sayes, It is good for <hi>me,</hi> Two Things are implyed,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That for his own part he was resolv'd to practise according to what he here makes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of. 2. That tho the generality of men did not draw near to God, yet it would be good for them so to doe. He does not intend that it would be good for <hi>himself only,</hi> but it is equally true of all other men, and so they should find it, would they be perswaded to make the Experiment.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine then is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is good for</hi> every <hi>man to draw near to God</hi>

               <pb n="125" facs="unknown:000415_0128_0FA5B6349543C960"/>Drawing nigh to God is not not only in it self a good thing, but its good for them that sincerely do so.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>two</hi> Things are to be enquired into. 1. When a man may be said to draw near to God. 2. How it does appear that it is good so to do.</p>
            <p>QUEST. 1. <hi>When may a man be said to draw near to God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANSW. 1. <hi>When he is brought out of a state of Nature into a state of Grace, he is brought near to God.</hi> There is a drawing nigh to God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of a man's state, as well as an actual draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nigh to Him. A Sinner is in a state of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from God. Therefore men in a state of sin are described to be <hi>a farr off. Eph.</hi> 2.13. It is said of the Prodigal, that <hi>he was a great way off.</hi> Luk. 15.20. Sin has made a vast and woful distance between the blessed God and the souls of men: it hath set their souls at an infinite distance from Him: But by true Conversion they are brought near to Him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The Prodigal Son, when he came to himself, said, <hi>I will arise and</hi> go <hi>to my father.</hi> A repenting sinner <hi>goeth</hi> to God. Hence Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is sometimes call'd a <hi>drawing nigh to Him.</hi> Jam. 4.8. <hi>Draw nigh to God, &amp; he will draw nigh to you, cleanse your hands you sinners &amp; purify your hearts you double minded.</hi> The Apostle having
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:000415_0129_0FA5B6355AB61AB0"/>
shew'd the evil of several vices, he prescribes one <hi>Catholic</hi> Remedy for them all, viz. <hi>Repentance,</hi> which he calleth a Drawing nigh to God, a Cleansing the hands, a Purifying the heart, an Humbling of themselves &amp;c. There must be Union and Reconciliation before there can be Communion. <hi>Amos.</hi> 3.33. <hi>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> You and I (says God) are not agreed, and therefore how can we hold Communion? A sinner is an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r to God through Jesus Christ, they ever after <hi>draw</hi> near to Him. This layeth the Foundation of all that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which we have with God. It neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily implyes Union and Reconciliation with Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When men enter into Covenant with God, they draw near to Him.</hi> Such are said to <hi>joyn themselves to the Lord.</hi> Jer. 50.5. <hi>Isai.</hi> 56.6. As they that are wholly strangers to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are said to be <hi>without God</hi> Eph. 2.12. &amp; to be <hi>far off</hi> Act. 2.39. So the Lord's Covenant people are said to be <hi>near</hi> to Him <hi>Isa.</hi> 57, 19. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace, to him that is

far off</hi> &amp; <hi>to him that is near.</hi> That is, to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> and to the <hi>Iew. Paul</hi> hath respect to that Scripture in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> when he says, <hi>Christ came</hi> &amp; <hi>preached peace to you that were a far off</hi>; h. e. to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were strangers to the covenant: <hi>and to them that were nigh,</hi> i. e. to the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were nigh to God in respect of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17. On this account the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were nearer to God than any other Nation in the world. <hi>Psal.</hi> 148.14. <hi>The Children of Israel, a people</hi> near <hi>unto Him.</hi> There is an <hi>external Covenanting</hi> with God, such may be <hi>really</hi> farr from God, yet they are as to their visible state near to Him. <hi>Ier.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Thou art near in their</hi> mouth, <hi>and far from their</hi> reins. And there is an Internal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with God, when men give not their names only, but their <hi>hearts</hi> to God, devoting themselves entirely to His fear, and renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all other Lords and Lovers in Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Him,</hi> and for <hi>His</hi> sake. They draw near to God, who can truly say as His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do <hi>Isai.</hi> 26.13. <hi>O Lord our God, other lords have had dominion over us, but by Thee only will we make mention of Thy Name.</hi>

They come into his <hi>House,</hi> &amp; approach into his <hi>solemn Presence.</hi> In <hi>Prayer</hi> also, men draw <hi>near</hi> to God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Having such an high p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iest, let us draw</hi> near <hi>with a true heart in full assurance of faith.</hi> The Apostle's meaning is, let us in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of heart pray unto God, being fully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that He will accept of us for the sake of Jesus Christ. Prayer is call'd a <hi>visiting of God,</hi> Isai. 26.16. A knocking at His door, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Knock and it shall be opened to you.</hi> By Prayer men knock at heavens door. Prayer is nothing else but the souls Going up to God. Psal. 25.1. <hi>Vnto thee O Lord do I lift up my soul.</hi> When the Psalmist sayes it is good for me to draw near to God, Part of his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, it is good for me, that I should hear the Word of God, and that I should pray to Him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>When men joyn themselves to the Church and and People of God, they draw neer to him.</hi> For there is a special presence of God in His Church.

is a Sanctury. Therefore God dwells therein <hi>Psal.</hi> 26.8. <hi>I have loved the habitation of thine house, and the place where thine</hi> honour <hi>dwells.</hi> His <hi>Honour</hi> i. e. GOD Himself, (Who is expressed by the Name of <hi>Honour,</hi> as also by the Name of <hi>Majesty</hi> &amp; of <hi>glory</hi>) dwells in His Sanctuary. He is to be seen there. <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>One thing have I desired,</hi> (h. e. one thing in a more peculiar manner) <hi>that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in His holy Temple.</hi> So that the Lord appears in His Beauty to those that are in His House, and there make enquiry after him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.2. <hi>To see thy Power and glory, as I have seen Thee in the Sanctuary.</hi> Every true and pure Church is Sanctuary, where much of God is to be seen.

It is in a very peculiar manner true with respect to
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:000415_0134_0FA5B63C098F99F0"/>
that Ordinance of the Lords Supper, which is not regularly Administred but in a Church Assembly, Believers draw near to God therein, as near as is possible for men to do in this world. There the Lord is wont to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self after a gracious manner to the souls of his people, who do by Faith attend upon Him. When <hi>Ioseph</hi> and his Brethren did eat &amp; drink together in the same room, there was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy of Communion between them, so there is between Christ and Believers in that Ordinance of the Lord's Supper.

<pb n="132" facs="unknown:000415_0135_0FA5B63D3873EB68"/>
internal Communion with God, consists in those inward actings of Grace whereby the soul is carried out towards God. As now, When the Affections which are as it were the the <hi>feet</hi> and <hi>wings</hi> of the soul, are earnestly carried out after God. The soul that does indeed pant and breathe after Communion with God draweth near to him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 42:1, 2. <hi>As the hart panteth after the water brooks; so panteth my soul after Thee O God: My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God, when shall I come and appear before God?</hi> The soul which loveth and longeth to be where God is, hath Communion with him. <hi>Isai.</hi> 26.9. <hi>With my souul have I desired thee in the night, yea with my spirit within me will I seek Thee early.</hi> When there are actings of love and delight in God, the soul draweh near to Him Love is a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous uniting affection. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.16. <hi>He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> Therefore the more a Christian does exercise that grace of Love to God, the nearer will his Communion with God be. So when a man does renew and exercise Repentance towards God, he draweth near to him. Wherefore the <hi>Psalmist</hi> says, <hi>The Lord nigh unto them is that are of a broken heart. Psal.</hi> 34.18. He that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth sin, with a broken heart for it, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh unto God, and God draweth nigh to

Him. The like is to be said concerning the Actings of Faith: As the wotkings of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the heart, are a soul-departure from <hi>God,</hi> Zeph. 3.2. <hi>She trusted not in the Lord, she drew not near to her God.</hi> So when the soul does indeed act faith upon Jesus Christ, when there is not only prayer but <hi>Faith</hi> in prayer, then there is a drawing near to God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>This drawing near to God, implies constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the way of Obedience.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word [<hi>Kirbath</hi>] which is here used, signifyeth to <hi>cleave unto.</hi> Some read the words, <hi>Bonum est mihi</hi> adhaerere <hi>Deo,</hi> It is good for me that I should <hi>cleave unto</hi> God.

Depart <hi>from me ye cursed into everlasting fire.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> and <hi>sadest</hi> word in that dreadful Sentence is, <hi>DEPART from ME.</hi> There is more of Terrour in <hi>that,</hi> than in all the Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of hell. In God's Favour is Life, and His loving kindness is <hi>better</hi> than life: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be cast out of his Favour is <hi>worse</hi> than any Death. And if so, To have Communion with <hi>Him</hi> is the greatest happiness. For,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God is the Chief Good.</hi> There have
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:000415_0138_0FA5B64016DD7460"/>
been great disputes among those whom the world has accounted wise men, about the <hi>Chief Good. Austin</hi> observes that there were no less than <hi>two hundred eighty eight</hi> Opinions amongst the old Philosophers about the <hi>Chief Good.</hi> But <hi>we</hi> are are sure, that there is no Chief Good but God only. The young Noble-man in the Gospel did not know that Christ was God, and therefore when he called Him good, the Lord said to him, <hi>Why callest thou me good? there is none good but One, that is God.</hi> Matth. 19.17. There is no Chief Good but God. He is <hi>infinitly</hi> good: He is an <hi>alsufficient</hi> good. His Name is <hi>El-Shaddai:</hi> h. e. the God who is <hi>sufficiency.</hi> He has enough in Himself to satisfie his own infinite Self: And therefore more than enough to satisfie all creatures, whatever the wants, whatever the desires of of the souls of men may be; there's enough in God to satisfie them all. God is a <hi>Vniversal Good</hi>; so that it is impossible for a man to be miserable, if he hath God. This, doubtless was the reason why Jacob said, <hi>I have all. Gen.</hi> 33.9. It is translated, <hi>I have enough,</hi> but that was no more than <hi>Esau</hi> said: The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Expression is, <hi>Ieshli-Col,</hi> h. e. <hi>To me there's all.</hi> viz. because of his interest in God. Though a soul should have nothing else, If he hath God, he hath enough, he has <hi>all.</hi> All
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:000415_0139_0FA5B640C3BA3D28"/>
outward losses are easily made up in God. Hence our Lord said, There is no man that hath left house, or Brethren, or Sisters, or Father or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands for My sake &amp; the Gospel's, <hi>but he shall recieve an hundred fold now in this time.</hi> Mar. 10.30. Why! he shall have that Comfort in GOD which all these Creatures could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and <hi>a hundred times more.</hi> The Cheif good is eminently <hi>all</hi> good. So that tho a man should loose all his worldly possessions, if he has drawn near to God, he may truly say, I have lost nothing: he may stand upon the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins of the whole world, and say I have lost nothing. And therefore may rejoice in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive Changes and Bereavements. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17.18. <hi>Although the fig tree shall not blossome neither shall fruit be in the vine, the labour of the Olive shall fail, and the field shall yeild no meat, the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls, yet I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation.</hi> Observe how full and particular the Prophet's Expressions are: here is the Fig tree, and the Olive tree, and the Vine, and the Field, and the Flock, and the herd, if one of these should fail, relief might be hoped for from another of them; nay, Nay but, saith he, though they should <hi>all</hi>

fail, though all creatures in the world should fail, God will never fail, and there's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort enough in that: happiness is in the Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>HIM.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To draw near to god, is the way to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from evil.</hi> The NAME of the LORD is a strong Tower which the Righteous run into and are safe. In evil Times <hi>God is good to Israel.</hi> Let what will happen in the world, they that draw near to him are safe. The Wiseman saith, <hi>surely I know that it shall go well with them that fear God.</hi> Eccles. 8.12. Such as are very careful to walk with God, do sometimes experience wonderful Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Preservations: As we see in <hi>Noah,</hi> unto whom God said, <hi>Come thou and all thine house into the Ark, for thee have I seen righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me in this generation.</hi> And in the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> whose very life was struck <hi>at</hi> &amp; sought <hi>after,</hi> and that by the great Ones of the world, but <hi>God hid him</hi>: he appeared for <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> appeared for him. So He does often for his servants that keep in with Him. He is to them a very present Help in the time of Trouble. He shall hide them in the secret of his Presence from the pride of men, and keep them secretly in a Pavillion from the strife of tongues. However they shall have <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiritual</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="unknown:000415_0141_0FA5B6420B8DE6A8"/>
Preservations: The Lord will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from every evil work, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them to his heavenly Kingdom. And if a Christian be grieved with inward, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing Thoughts, by drawing near to <hi>God,</hi> he may obtain help against them. This was the case of the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Context shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: he was <hi>almost gone</hi>: his unbelieving thoughts had like to have been too hard for him: but he went into the Sanctuary, and there by drawing nigh to God in prayer, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of His Word, he got the victory over his Temptations, and a further Establishment in the wayes of God. All his Temptations issued in this, that he was made more sensible of his own infirmity, and had a more clear Discovery of Divine grace. This did he get by drawing near to <hi>GOD.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Communion with God, is a most sweet and comfortable thing to a gracious soul.</hi> Indeed Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men do not think so, because they never had Experience of it, but they that know what comunion with God meanes, have found Sweetness and Delight therein which cannot be expressed. Hence <hi>David</hi> could say, <hi>One day in Thy</hi> Courts, <hi>is better than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand else-where. Psal.</hi> 84.10.

More Holiness is the fruit of sincere approaches unto God. Never any man did draw nigh to God after a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner but he was the more holy for it. The more Communion men have with GOD, the less Communion they will have with Sin. Every Act of real Communion with God tends to mortification of sin. This is one reason why the Saints in glory become <hi>impeccable.</hi> The <hi>Beatifical Vision</hi> makes them that they cannot sin. The more intimacy of Communion with God any soul shall attain unto, the more like will he be to God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, he that shall converse much with another, will be apt to be like to him, and to drink in something of his spirit with whom he holds a free and familiar Conversation; So they that converse much with God, will sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become more like to him than what can be said of any other men. When <hi>Moses</hi> had near and intimate Communion with God in the mount, Divine Impressions were left upon his face: So are there upon the face of that

related concerning that eminent Saint Mr. <hi>Brewer,</hi> that not long before his death, he had such enlargements in his Closet-Duty as made him wholly regardless of this lower world. Once when his near Relation told him she feared he had injured himself by his rising so early, he replyed,
<q>If you had seen such glorious things as I saw this morning in private praer with God, you would not have said so; for they were so wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unspeakable, that whether I was in the body, or out of the body with <hi>Paul</hi> I cannot tell.</q>
This indeed was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: But where is there a godly man, but he can truly say, he hath found that of God in Secret Prayer which he would not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out for all this world? And if we could speak with the Saints in glory, They would every one of them say <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God.</hi> As <hi>Peter</hi> said when he saw Christ transfigured on the holy Mount, <hi>It is good for us to be here.</hi> So do the Saints in heaven say, Here we have our fill of Communion with God, It is good for us to be here.

They are Aliens to the Life of God, yea to a life of Communion wirh Him. The natural man knoweth not what it is to have Communion with God: All our Communion with God in this World is in some Ordinance or other, either Prayer, or Meditation, or Hearing the Word, or Reading, or in some other Ordinance, but are not these neglected? Church-Fellowship and the Lord's Supper are Divine institutions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is lamentable to consider that so many of the rising Generation, do neither prize nor prepare themselvs for such enjoyments, they sin griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously against the hope of their Fathers.

build a Sanctuary for the Name of God, and enjoy Communion with Him therein. Now that their Children after them should so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them be careless about things of this Nature, is a Lamentation and shall be for a Lamentation. And are there not more than a few, that live in the neglect of prayer? Ah ungodly souls! The Scripture saith, <hi>every one that is godly shall pray.</hi> Psal. 32.6. He then that liveth without prayer, has no godliness, no grace in his soul. Are there not some that don't so much as pray in their Families? Men may make excuses for such neglects if they will, but there is a Scripture which falls upon them like a Thunderbolt of Death, and they cannot escape it, I mean that in <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon — the Families which call not on Thy Name.</hi> If there be a prayerless Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in <hi>Boston,</hi> if there be a prayerless Family in <hi>New-England</hi> (as alas there are many) let them look to it, for the Fury of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is ready to be poured out upon them. Others there are who neglect Closet Prayer. Verily, I cannot see how such a man can have the true fear of God in his heart, that does in his ordinary Course live a whole day together without secret Communion with God.</p>

            <p>For Direction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed of sin.</hi> A great Sin is like a violent blast which bloweth the soul far from God suddenly. Sin and guilt upon the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence makes a man affraid to look God in the face. When <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to run away from God, and to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himself
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:000415_0149_0FA5B64C955B3D48"/>
(had it bin possible) from His holy presence. Therefore watch against sin. Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially against such sins as will break peace with God, &amp; interrupt Communion with Him. All scandalous Sins will do so; yea, and sins of Infirmity, if they be not mourned for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In all our approaches unto the holy God, <hi>Let us be sure to bring</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>with us.</hi> Let every soul make sure of an Interest in Him, without Whom there is no drawing near to God. When the Law was given at Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> the people stood <hi>afarr off</hi>: So Christless Sinners who are only concerned in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, are <hi>afarr off.</hi> The Lord saith to them as sometimes <hi>Ioseph</hi> to his Brethren, Except you bring Christ with you, you shall not see my face. And Beleevers must depend upon Christ for all acceptance with God, and that as to <hi>every</hi> Duty. The Apostle speakes of <hi>a better hope by which are draw nigh to God, Heb.</hi> 7.19. what is that <hi>Better Hope</hi> but the priestly Office, the Merit &amp; Mediation of Jesus Christ? were it not for that we should have no hope. How should Sinners come near that God who is a consuming fire, without a Mediator? Christ is is the way, and none can come to the Faher but by Him.</p>
