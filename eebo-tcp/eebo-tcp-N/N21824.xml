            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASTLE OF TRUTH, A MORAL TALE.</head>
            <p>THE beautiful Queen Altemira married Phanor, the moſt amiable and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Genii.—She was very importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with the Genius to conduct her to his Caſtle the evening they were married. Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſighed, and looking tenderly on the Queen, replied, I for ever forſake it on your account. It is not in my power to conduct you to my palace; but as you cannot live there, I for ever abandon it. Reign as ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of my heart, and your own faithful ſubjects: be ſatisfied with that empire, and queſtion me no farther?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028733_0003_0FDBE7091D51A550"/>And ſhall I never ſee your caſtle, my Lord?</p>
            <p>I really hope, ſaid Phanor, the day will come when you may ſee it with ſafety.</p>
            <p>O! when! replied Altemira, keenly.</p>
            <p>You may, in ſixteen years, if you are then anxious.</p>
            <p>Sixteen years! O heavens!</p>
            <p>Let me beg of you, both for your quiet and mine, to think no more of it till that time.</p>
            <p>Altemira was very anxious, reflected, complained and wept, but Phanor would not yeild—They loved each other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and all the unhappineſs Altemira knew was a <hi>prudent huſband;</hi> indeed had it not been for her perpetual queſtioning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Caſtle, they would have lived very comfortably.</p>
            <p>The Queen was happily delivered of a Princeſs, who was endowed with every qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification poſſible, by her father the Genius, and named Zeolide. She was uncommon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lovely, and was ſcarcely fourteen years of age when her parents choſe her a future huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who ſhould be worthy of ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed a Princeſs, the Prince Philamir, who adored her.—They conſulted Zeolide, who
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028733_0004_0FDBE70E5614FC10"/>
declared ſhe loved the Prince, above all who had ever ſought her.</p>
            <p>The time was now at hand, when Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira was to have her curoſity indulged, to which ſhe looked forward with much impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and reſolved her daughter ſhould not be married till her return from the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>They had been ſixteen years married, and ſhe entreated her huſband to ſet off imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. —You ſhall this evening hear my ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and if you then continue in the ſame mind, to-morrow you ſhall be tranſported thither. Altemira wiſhed her daughter to be preſent, and Phanor, though unwilling, conſented, and being ſat between the two Princeſſes in Altemira's apartment, he thus began.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF PHANOR THE GENIUS.</head>
            <p>HOWEVER ſuperior to mortals our art may render us, it can make no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the heart; I was born with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly ſtrong paſſions, and my father ſaw, with regret, that I would never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> nor happy, without ſome centuries ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <p>Mean time I fell in love with a fairy called Prudina, who was highly eſteemed for her prudence, virtue and circumſpection; ſhe was by much my elder; and was valued more for her knowledge than beauty; this attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028733_0006_0FDBE713C083B6C0"/>
did me honour: ſhe diſcovered it firſt herſelf, and told me of it; I could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and was preparing to deny it, when obſerving ſhe ſeemed certain, I thought it beſt to delay and examine myſelf.</p>
            <p>Prudina then began to chide me for a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which ſhe termed childiſh and fooliſh, but did it with ſo much tenderneſs, that ſhe only ſhewed me by her lectures, there was a poſſibility of gaining a place in her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and thus the love ſhe anticipated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came real. I declared my feelings, and my love was returned. Animated by this, I hinted marriage, which ſhe declined till ſhe had proved me; engaging at the ſame time not to tattle, and requiring a like promiſe of me; thus we loved and no-body knew.</p>
            <p>As I one night was travelling through the Air to Prudina's Caſtle, cries of a very pitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſort reached my ears, and made me ſtop; when looking around, I obſerved a youth, ſurrounded by his Slaves bearing torches, who ſeemed racked with dreadful agonies; his attendants were numerous in carriages and on horſeback; and they re-echoed his complainings, which heightened the terror of the ſcene. I approached them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a wiſh to be made acquainted with
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028733_0007_0FDBE71527C68690"/>
the cauſe of their diſtreſs. You behold, ſaid the young man, the Prince Zimis, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated for his love to the Princeſs Eliana; with whom I would have been married, had not Phormidas, that cruel Genius, become deeply enamoured of Eliana. She hated him, and he began to deſpair. Seizing this favourable opportunity, I ſet out with my Princeſs and their attendants for my own kingdom to celebrate our nuptials.</p>
            <p>Juſt as we had entered a diſmal foreſt, Phormidas attacked us, and tore my charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eliana from my arms.</p>
            <p>Theſe three days paſt I have been in vain endeavouring to trace the Raviſher, and here I ſtop, overcome with fatigue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, waiting the end of my unhappy days.</p>
            <p>Diſtreſſed with the miſeries of this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Prince, I did all in my power to comfort him. I told him how much I was intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his diſtreſſes; that my power was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to that of Phormidas; I entreated him to retire to his own kingdom, where he ſhould be again happy with Eliana before break of day. So ſaying, I left Zimis and his Train, and ruſhed into the air, to ſpend the night in avenging the oppreſſed, which I had dedicated to love. I darted with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amazing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028733_0008_0FDBE719DDECD3E0"/>
velocity to the Royal Palace of the king of the Genii, acquainted him with the melancholy ſtory, and begged his aſſiſtance to reſtore Eliana to the arms of her lover.</p>
            <p>Our Sovereign took me by the hand, and told me, he would give to me the honour of this adventure, and for that purpoſe would inform me of other particulars. Then lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a ſuperb ſaloon, ornamented with an infinitude of glaſſes, we muſt enquire, ſaid he, into her preſent ſituation, that we may adapt our aſſiſtance to the emergency of the caſe: then touching one of the glaſſes with a golden wand, a Lady of perfect beauty appeared: notice, ſaid he, in what ſituation ſhe is. Preſently the picture was completed, and I obſerved Eliana in a garden alone, overcome with grief, ſitting in a ſwing, which at times reached almoſt to the clouds. Her condition diſtreſſed me. The Genius ſmiled; then myſteriouſly ſhaking his head, you will ſee what will afflict you more. He then gave me a Taliſman, by means of which I might tranſport myſelf into the preſence of Eliana whenever I pleaſed; but ſaid he, be prudent, cool and courageous, and if you complete this perilous undertaking glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, you ſhall name your own reward.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028733_0009_0FDBE71BE24FD040"/>
When he had ſo ſaid he left me with my Taliſman, and I inſtantly wiſhed myſelf with Eliana; immediately I was in a garden, heard voices, looked about, and by the light of the moon, which ſhone uncommonly bright, I ſaw at ſome diſtance the ſame Eliana I had ſeen in the glaſs; and what aſtoniſhed me much, ſhe was in the very ſame poſture, ſwinging with the utmoſt force.</p>
            <p>A little ſylph who ſtood by her thus addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her. It does well enough to ſwing a little now and then, but to be ſwinging, ſwinging, ſwinging conſtantly thus, is harſh, I think. How happy are you Zumio, replied the Princeſs, that can thus ſupport your ſpirits, you are alſo a ſlave as well as me, but not treated with half the barbarity—Oh to what a ridiculous puniſhment am I condemned— Barbarous Genius—more barbarous Fairy —Here ſhe was obliged to ſtop, for now, her ſwinging was increaſed to ſuch a pitch, that ſhe could not fetch her breath.</p>
            <p>I now underſtood, the unhappy Eliana was enchanted in this diſtreſſing ſwing. I approached her, proffered my ſervices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with the ſituation of her lover, engaged to reſtore her to her freedom; and begged ſhe would freely communicate all
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028733_0010_0FDBE72284E94748"/>
that had happened her. Alas! Alas! ſaid ſhe, my Lord, Revenge and Jealouſy have invented an enchantment, which I fear you will not be able to break; ſo cruel, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing are the terms which muſt firſt be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>My Story, continued ſhe, is ſhortly this; having been ſeparated from my huſband, by the cruel Phormidas, I was inſtantly carried to his Caſtle. I endeavoured to put an end to my wretched exiſtence, and would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have done ſomething fatal to my life had not the Caſtle opened at the roof, and a Lady, or rather Fairy, made her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, riding in an ebony car drawn by four dreadful bats.—Phormidas was juſt then proſtrate before me; but immediately roſe in great confuſion: The Furious Fairy, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming a moſt imperious and terrible voice, ſpoke in the following manner:</p>
            <p>And do you thus betray me, perfidious wretch? Do you thus, vile ingrate, prefer a mortal to <hi>Me,</hi> who, on thy account have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the moſt handſome of all the Genii? But, you ſhall not deceive me, and if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect forgiveneſs, ſurrender to me the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, whom I will puniſh, and at the ſame time preſerve her life. Keep in mind, if you
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028733_0011_0FDBE723642C0280"/>
refuſe, that I am capable of much indeed to be <hi>revenged;</hi> I adore, while ſhe abhors thee.</p>
            <p>The affrighted Genius, kiſſed his chains, and ſubmiſſively ſurrendered me to the Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. She took me into her car, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending through the clouds in leſs than three minutes brought us here. I then proſtrated myſelf before her, intreated her compaſſion, begged ſhe would reſtore me to Zimis, and uſed every argument in my power to aſſwage her fury. She heſitated a little, then raiſed me, with theſe words, I am not, princeſs, revengeful, but whimſical; and if you will indulge me in a certain humour, which I have juſt taken into my head, all that has paſſed will be forgiven. I have a ſingular predilection for ſwinging, ſit down in this ſwing—The thought appeared to me ridiculous, but ſtill it was an eaſy atonement, and I ſat down very well pleaſed; but I was no ſooner ſeated, than the Fairy, with a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible voice, thus addreſſed me:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Swing here without ceaſing for thirty years, unleſs one of my lovers ſhall within that time prove fickle without my knowing it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that moment the Swing began to ſwing ſo violently that I inſtantly ſwooned away; Zumio, the little ſylph you juſt now ſpoke
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028733_0012_0FDBE724EC421400"/>
with, run to my aſſiſtance and with trouble recovered me; at firſt I gave up myſelf to deſpair, but I ſoon became calm, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, that from what ſhe ſaid, it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhe had lovers, and it would be ſtrange indeed, if none of them deceived her.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt, replied Zumio, were it not for that valuable turquoiſe ring ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes, which, ſo ſoon as any of her lovers ceaſe to admire her, or are in any degree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, turns as yellow as gold. By day, the Fairy conſtantly wears this ring; and leſt it ſhould be ſtolen while ſhe ſleeps, it is encloſed in a caſket of braſs, every night, and is depoſited in a grot dug in her garden, the gate of which is guarded by twelve terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crocodiles, ſix Baſiliſks and four Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, who emit large ſtones of fire and ſpue out ſcorching flames from their terrible jaws. If you then, my lord, continued Zumio, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the glorious enterprize, conſider what dangers await you: but if you prove victorious, how glorious the atchievement? how important in its conſequences? when you are informed that all theſe ſurrounding gardens are filled with beautiful princeſſes and ladies, who are here enchanted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dreadful and tormenting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028733_0013_0FDBE729A01610C8"/>
by the Jealous Fairy. For her barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity has not been confined to rivals only, but all who have given her umbrage have ſhared the ſame fate; and ſhe is the enemy of all, who are remarkable for beauty, wit, virtue and other valuable accompliſhments. For my own part, I was once her moſt admired page; I carried her moſt private letters and billets-doux; unluckily I became the object of her ſuſpicion, and am now her priſoner.</p>
            <p>Heavens! cried I, interrupting Zumio, what is her infamous name; tell me, O tell me, the name of ſuch a monſter.</p>
            <p>Alas, my lord, replied Zumio, her hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy is as remarkable as her wickedneſs. She is adored by the Genii, and ſuppoſed to be the moſt virtuous of her tribe—How will you be aſtoniſhed to hear—her name is— <hi>Prudina.</hi> Amazed, I left them precipitately, and by means of my Taliſman, was inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the gate of this well defended cavern. It would be tireſome to you to repeat the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles I ſurmounted, ſuffice it, that prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every noble, every animating princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and incited by rage, malice and hatred, I overcame, and that only becauſe being a Genius I was immortal. The monſters I vanquiſhed; I tore down the gates and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028733_0014_0FDBE72BD347AB40"/>
them to powder; and then ſnatched the caſket, with its precious contents. The ring was a beautiful citron-colour; ſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it on my finger, I ſwore it ſhould never be removed.</p>
            <p>The inſtant I had done ſo, the garden re-echoed from a thouſand voices, the joyful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of <hi>Liberty! Liberty! grateful thanks to Phanor! Freedom! Liberty!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediately I left the Grotto, and found the garden filled with young and beautiful ladies, differently dreſt, who were running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout embracing and congratulating one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, while they repeated with loud voices, <hi>Thanks to the Genius Phanor! Liberty! Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!</hi> As the day began to break, I ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, leaning on the arm of the little Sylph, the incomparable Eliana. Obſerving me, ſhe run towards me, exclaiming, ſee, ſee, our brave deliverer! immediately her companions followed her example, ſome madly kiſſing me, ſome hugging me in their arms, ſome claſping my knees, and others ſeizing me by the hands and arms. One more frantic than the reſt, leapt upon my back, and with a ſhrill voice ſounded in my ear the words of Liberty, Liberty. This diſturbing exclamation, was continued ſo
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028733_0015_0FDBE72DA50802D0"/>
long and ſo violently, that I was almoſt ſtun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the noiſe, when the Sovereign of the Genii himſelf approached, mounted on a white Elephant; he inſtantly ordered the noiſy company to be ſilent, and addreſſed me thus. It belongs to you, Phanor, to give ſentence on Prudina, as the Sole Ruler of her fate.</p>
            <p>Her character, Gracious Sire, replied I, is unveiled; which is ſufficient Revenge, but I intreat in behalf of theſe her unfortunate victims, whom I recommend to your pity; command them to be tranſported each to their native country, their friends, their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or where their hearts wiſh.</p>
            <p>Immediately, the Genius raiſed his ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre and they all vaniſhed; now ſaid he, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, I engaged to perform whatever you wiſhed as a reward, and I will fulfil; but let me adviſe you to conſider well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you determine, and when you have done ſo, come to me.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſaid, he left me; I accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly reſolved immediately to quit a place, which only furniſhed me with gloomy reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when I accidently obſerved the little ſylph, Zumio, converſing at the back of a tree, with one of the moſt beautiful women
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028733_0016_0FDBE731D4CB3248"/>
I had ever ſeen. I was greatly aſtoniſhed; when he came up to me and told me, he was determined to cleave to me at all haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and therefore had not left the Garden. This beautiful Lady, ſaid he, will tell you her own hiſtory, if you incline. Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, replied I.</p>
            <p>She ſmiled aſſent; and ſitting down by her, I entreated her to communicate freely, what had determined her to remain there.</p>
            <p>My Lord, ſaid ſhe, the other Ladies have all Lovers or huſbands; I neither. Their fidelity, I approve, but cannot follow. But as you wiſh to hear an account of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, I ſhall certainly attempt it.</p>

                        <head>THE HISTORY OF AGELIA.</head>
                        <p>MY heart is uncommonly tender, and my imagination lively; I have a great ſhare of ſenſibility and delicacy, ſo I am eaſily captivated, but hard to fix. When I am firſt enraptured, I view every thing in the favourable way, and not only adore my
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028733_0017_0FDBE733202CBD78"/>
lover, but deify him; when accident or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar circumſtances expoſe the reality, I find I have been carried away by deluſion; and appear as one ariſing from a pleaſant dream, which vaniſheth, leaving nothing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. This effort of reaſon mankind call in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, yet with me it is the effect of deception, not ſatiety or whim.</p>
                        <p>It was my misfortune, about two years ſince, to become the rival of Prudina; I had been for three months the favourite of a youth, to whom ſhe took a fancy; this end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my confinement; I was tranſported hither, and while ſhe led me by the hand acroſs the garden, I gave place to the keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt anguiſh. Agelia, ſaid ſhe, be not ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, I will not be harſh; your appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance pleaſes, and were it not for that air of inconſtancy, and fickleneſs, you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light me: I will therefore make it more my ſtudy to amend than chaſtiſe you, for you have intereſted me much in your behalf. I was not however impoſed on by her preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. We walked on, from garden to bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and from bower to grove, till at length not a tree was to be ſeen; we were in a wide extended plain, bounded by the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing horizon. The proſpect was ſomething
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028733_0018_0FDBE7356024B6C8"/>
like a ſea ſcene, were it not, that the noiſe of the waves, the motion of the ſhip, and the reflection of the ſun beams on the water, animate this picture; while where we were, there was nothing to relieve the mind under the aſtoniſhing uniformity of the plain round us. No ſhrub, flower, nor herb was to be ſeen, but a beautiful ſhort graſs, all of one ſpecies. An univerſal calm and profound ſilence reigned throughout this vaſt ſolitude; and not an inſect or bird was to be ſeen, nay not a cloud to vary ever ſo little the uniform blueneſs of the ſky. At firſt this view rather produced an agreeable feeling; I was tranſported with admiration and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It delights me, ſaid Prudina, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſcene pleaſes you; it is calculated to ſoften the vigorous ſallies of your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, though time and reflection will be neceſſary to complete it, I therefore propoſe that you ſhould remain here, where no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation will diſturb you; the ſky will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſerene, never cloudy, no alteration of day and night, no inclemency of ſeaſons, perpetual day will ever charm you.</p>
                        <p>When ſhe had thus ſpoken, ſhe ordained me to walk with a ſtately noble ſtep, around this lawn, for thirty years, unleſs, ſaid ſhe,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028733_0019_0FDBE7805BF42890"/>
one of my lovers ſhall within that time prove fickle without my knowing it. Having thus ſaid, ſhe vaniſhed: and I found myſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to walk at a ſlow ſteady pace, not having it in my power to turn to the one hand or the other, of ſtopping or ſitting down to reſt.</p>
                        <p>At firſt the idea of this conſtant walk at the ſame pace I found very diſagreeable, but I did not then know the extent of my puniſhment. I beheld the inconceivably rich and extenſive carpet, ſurrounded by a clear and pleaſant horizon, with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>pture. Can it be, ſaid I, that graſs and ſky, green and blue, can furniſh ſo remarkable and ſtriking a proſpect! Thus it is that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime is formed by grandeur and ſimplicity.</p>
                        <p>The freſh idea of my lover, the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the fairy might be impoſed upon without her knowledge, and ſuch like phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic raptures as the the above, ſolaced me for a few hours. But this rapture ſoon cooled, diſguſt took place of extaſies, the boundleſs extent of never ceaſing verdure, which raviſhed me ſo much, ſoon became tireſome, loathſome and inſipid; no variety, nothing to attract my attention, the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unfortunate love was all the object of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028733_0020_0FDBE7395D2E5258"/>
my thoughts; and even this by degrees was effaced.</p>
                        <p>Fatigued fancy ſoon loſt all its ſtrength, my wandering ideas became undetermined; my fanciful hopes forſook me; even my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion itſelf took the flight, and thus was I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in this almoſt incomprehenſible expanſe. When a dangerous miſtake is rectified by reaſon, to ſubdue it brings comfort and we are happy. But however noble and praiſe-worthy it may be to ſubdue our paſſions, there is ſomething truly diſheartening in them quitting us; the imagination is in ſome degree annihilated, and the heart faded. Paſſions muſt either be conquered by reaſon or vanquiſhed by time.</p>
                        <p>Thus painfully ſituated I traverſed my end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs road. My tears forſook me, I had not even ſtrength enough of mind to be afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but I became diſpirited, ſo gaping about I gave place to unbearable wearineſs; the only real object of deſire which I felt in my mind was once more to have a proſpect of animated nature; a ſhrub, a hill or a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling would have raviſhed me; thundering, rain, ſtorms, wind, nay a cloud, would have afforded an agreeable ſenſation. The very abſence of night, the moon and ſtars, were
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028733_0021_0FDBE7858F225420"/>
grating to me; in ſhort, any change of any ſort was at this time my idea of happineſs. Now it was that I experienced that Prudina could not have taken a more effectual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to puniſh my levity and inconſtancy, than this ingenious device.</p>
                        <p>You will therefore eaſily conceive, my lord, that ſummit of joy to which I was raiſed, when I, thanks to your valour, found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf enabled to walk faſt or ſlow, to ſit down or riſe up, and in the midſt of this garden. My lover has ſurely now forgotten me, by eighteen months abſence; and if he has not, how can I poſſibly endure his never ceaſing complaints; all countries and climes are therefore equal to me, for I wiſh not to return to my own: and I care not where I ſpend my days if I am not doomed to vaſt plains or boundleſs lawns.</p>

            <p>Agelia having thus finiſhed her hiſtory, I aroſe, and with my wand, deſcribing a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in the air, transformed the palace and gardens of the fairy, into a ſuperb palace, ſituated on the top of a hill, and found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtanding on the terrace, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a moſt delightful proſpect. The view of rocks, water-falls, precipices, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, flocks and herds, and the ſea, quite
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028733_0022_0FDBE73AA689B900"/>
tranſported the happy Agelia; for all the pleaſing and majeſtic objects of nature were united, but no plains. There, ſaid I to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelia, you are Queen; and if you wiſh me gone, ſpeak the word, and however great the ſacrifice, you ſhall be obeyed; for my happineſs is to ſee you ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Her reply at firſt was tender and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but ſhe ſoon reſumed her accuſtomed ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety and was uncommonly pleaſant through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the day: towards night, ſhe fell into a kind of languid melancholy, which added to her charms, and made her ſo beautiful that I loſt my heart irrecoverably.</p>
            <p>I conducted her to the terrace after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, where the proſpect of the ſtar-bediz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened ſky amazed her; ſhe trembled, and gaped up in rapture. Oh, cried ſhe, what an amazing ſpectacle!</p>
            <p>Falling at her knees, I ventured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my admiration and love. She heard me attentively, and was affected, ſhe wept, I preſſed her for an anſwer. Having pauſed a little and wiped off her tears, Phanor, ſaid ſhe, I ſenſibly feel your kindneſs, and your tender behaviour, but give me time to look into mine own heart, and to know more of yours. And then left me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:028733_0023_0FDBE786C5F40470"/>I inſtantly examined my turquoiſe ring, and to my great joy found that ſhe loved me. The day following I preſſed ſtill more urgent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for an anſwer. I dread, ſays ſhe, leſt I ſhould impoſe both on you and myſelf.</p>
            <p>Fear not, my beauteous Agelia, ſaid I in a rapture, and proſtrating myſelf before her, I know I am beloved; I cannot doubt my happineſs—at theſe words I ceaſed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in Agelia's looks, that ſhe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my certainty as preſumptuous; and in truth, it had a vain appearance. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared reſerved, and treated me ſomewhat diſdainfully. I found it neceſſary to be more prudent, and aſſumed a tone of deſpair. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelia ſoftened, and in a little time acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged I had gained her heart; the day, the happy day was fixed, when two hearts ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cemented by love were to be ſtill more cloſely united at the altar of Hymen.</p>
            <p>I was walking on the terrace with Agelia on the evening preceding the wiſhed-for day; ſhe fixed her eyes on the ocean which waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the palace walls. I had remarked that for two days paſt ſhe had appeared more abſent and much leſs enraptured than formerly, yet my ring retained its uſual colour, and her appearance of conſequence diſtreſſed me the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028733_0024_0FDBE740094E56E8"/>
leſs. Pauſing a little, ſhe turns to me. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not you, ſaid ſhe, with whom almoſt every thing is poſſible, make theſe rocks and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains diſappear; for the proſpect is quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded, and the eye has no relief; you have too much water; thoſe dreadful rocks terrify the mind, and it is painful to hear the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſea.</p>
            <p>And have theſe Landſcapes, in which you ſo much delighted formerly, wearied you, my Agelia, ſaid I; ſince that is your will then, they alſo ſhall diſappear, however highly I value them, and they are dear to me indeed, ſince it was here, you firſt promiſed to be mine.</p>
            <p>She made me no anſwer, but gave me her hand with a look of mildneſs and love: I kiſſed it with rapture. She at this moment, caſt her eye upon my ring, and with a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly careleſs air, pulled it off my finger. This rather ſtartled me, however, fearful to raiſe her ſuſpicion, I ſuffered her to examine it more cloſely.</p>
            <p>This ring is of a beautiful colour, ſaid ſhe, but I hate turquoiſe; Oh fie! it is badly mounted; I diſlike it much; and with theſe words, ſhe raiſed her arm and caſt it into the ſea, without allowing me time to ſuſpect
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028733_0025_0FDBE78BC8CB7ED0"/>
her intention, much leſs to preſerve what I conſidered as a moſt valuable treaſure.</p>
            <p>I ſtood fixed with ſurpriſe; and Agelia looked at me with a certain ſort of miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous delight which provoked me;—I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained myſelf a little, but ſoon gave vent to every reproach which could be incited by the moſt violent rage and paſſion. She looked at me with great compoſure. Having heard me to an end, I acknowledge ſaid ſhe, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret qualities of your ring I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of. A ſuſpicion of it has hung about me ſome days, and Zumio ſatisfied me. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Zumio, I exclaimed!</p>
            <p>I made him believe I was in the ſecret, and led him on to betray you; he has been prudent enough; but like many others out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted by a woman; for human wiſdom, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration, nor philoſophy have not yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered an antidote for female powers, and this, even Genii themſelves have experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But, my Lord, if your diſtreſs at loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this turquoiſe is on my account, it is vain, for I am not in the leaſt degree diſpoſed to deceive you.</p>
            <p>But why, cruel woman, have you depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me of this valuable ring; which would
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028733_0026_0FDBE74169E4DA80"/>
have prevented all doubts, and rendered pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations uſeleſs?</p>
            <p>But, my lord, I delight in talking, now the ring left me nothing to chatter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; and you yourſelf muſt acknowledge that ſuch a bond, was not paying me a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment. How generous, noble and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate would it have been, after I had been pouring out my love-ſick effuſions into your boſom, for you to ſneak into a corner and demand confirmation from your ring? You ſay you love me; I believe you, without a ring. I will explain love to you. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I confeſſed my love to you, you ſhould have taken this villainous Taliſman, this high-prized treaſure, and caſt it for ever from you, ſaying, <hi>This is now uſeleſs, ſince I am ſo well aſſured of her love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I heard her out with amazement; then falling on my knees, I entreated her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and pardon.</p>
            <p>Forbearance! exclaimed ſhe, you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of its worth; the injuries you have juſt mentioned, did I not forgive? and when I caſt your ring into the ſea, could you not recollect, that it had not changed its colour; but your rage, that unworthy paſſion you juſt now vented—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:028733_0027_0FDBE78DEF01F750"/>O my Agelia, have patience, you har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row up my ſoul. You cannot now, my lord, dive into my heart as before, but I will not even now deceive you; my word is far more to be depended on than any ring —Hear me then, and believe me—<hi>I love you not, nor ever ſhall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words ſhe pronounced ſo ſteadily and coolly, that they left me no room to queſtion their reality. My love for her was of the moſt fervent kind; this misfortune I could not ſupport, I gave place to deſpair. Falling at her feet, I bedewed them with my tears, and beſought her, to leave me only a gleam of hope.</p>
            <p>Let this teach you, ſaid ſhe, the value of your ring, you cannot bear the truth, and therefore intreat me to deceive you—It is very proper to endeavor to remove fantaſies which diſturb or diſtreſs us, but why ſhould we thoſe that amuſe and comfort us? Take an advice from me, my lord; and by all means be on your guard in future, never to apply your attention in conſtructing a Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man like that from which I have relieved you; for when you do, depend upon it, you are but conſtructing freſh torments. Be on your guard againſt men, and be jealous
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028733_0028_0FDBE742F599AA18"/>
of them, but never let your friend or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs be ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>Her advice was a good one, but as my misfortunes were not yet at an end, I diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded it. Nothing would have effect on Agelia, ſhe continued unmoved; and I found it neceſſary to leave her, overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with deſpair, and ſpent ſome months at a diſtance from her, where I gave full vent to my grief. I was attended here, by Zumio, who was ſo much attached to me, ſo chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and gentle, that I forgot he was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſigned ſource of my miſery, and made him my conſtant companion; beſides I could talk to him of Agelia.</p>
            <p>Zumio entertained me from time to time with accounts of his travels, for he had ſeen much of the world, and told his ſtory grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Among other things he frequently talked to me of a Princeſs, he named Arpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſa, of whom he ſaid ſo many fine things, that he raiſed my curioſity about her—Is ſhe as handſome as Agelia, ſaid I?</p>
            <p>As handſome as Agelia! replied Zumio, in deriſion; You had never fallen in love with her, had you ſeen Arpaliſa; Agelia is pleaſant and agreeable enough, with a little daſh of wit at times; but at beſt ſhe is whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028733_0029_0FDBE78F5E847C18"/>
to an extreme, wild and uncommonly thoughtleſs; it is fooliſh to compare her with Arpaliſa, who is a moſt complete mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of perfection; her beauty dazzling; the depth of her underſtanding aſtoniſhing; her accompliſhments, virtues, greatneſs of ſoul, ſenſibility and extent of knowledge would enchant you—Oh, did you hear her diſcourſe on friendſhip.</p>
            <p>There was no ſtopping of Zumio, when he began to talk of Arpaliſa; till at length the daily hearing ſo much of her, gave a great inclination to ſee this wonderful Princeſs.</p>
            <p>In ſpite of all Agelia had ſaid, I could not help regretting the want of the ring: I had ſtill my reward to aſk from the ſovereign of the Genii; ſo after much uncertainty and many reſolutions I at length went to him, and aſked him to conſtruct me a caſtle, into which whoever entered, ſhould be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a ſecret charm, to ſpeak whatever were their ſecret thoughts; while, I myſelf only, as poſſeſſor of the caſtle, ſhould have an exemption from the general law: for, Diſcretion, ſaid I, is neceſſary for a lover, and I would not wiſh to expoſe myſelf to act improperly. I beſought the ſovereign, that in the Caſtle, I might hear the language of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028733_0030_0FDBE7446CF70C20"/>
ſincerity; ſee things as they really are: and thoſe who ſpeak ſhould ſpeak their real thoughts; I intreated, that thoſe who wiſhed to deceive, might not be ſenſible of their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very contrary of their meaning; that they ſhould not hear themſelves, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they really expreſſed that flattery with which they meant to impoſe on others—This double charm was abſolutely neceſſary, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe many would keep ſilence.</p>
            <p>Raſh thoughtleſs Phanor, replied the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, what an imprudent requeſt?—My oath is however ſacred; therefore go to your own place, and in place of the houſe you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly poſſeſſed, that which you have deſired will be in its room. I have here a box for you, which will preſerve you from its dangerous laws; preſerve it, and you will ſpeak only what you wiſh; or any perſon in whoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion it may be; but be careful to preſerve it, as I cannot make another of the kind. I took the box from the monarch of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii, and departed with many expreſſions of gratitude.</p>
            <p>I now found a Caſtle, in the ſpot where the former ſtood, the dazzling appearance of which charmed me: It was built of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which had all the ſplendor, ſtrength
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028733_0031_0FDBE793D57DADB0"/>
and tranſparency of the moſt reſplendent Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond; the workmanſhip noble, yet light; and ornamented with various precious ſtones; on the Golden Doors, was the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, '<hi>The Caſtle of Truth.</hi>'</p>
            <p>I touched the gates with my wand, as I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, pronounced theſe words, <hi>whoſoever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the gates of this Caſtle muſt remain three months; and I ſwear by my Art, that unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able oath, I never will cancel this law.</hi> Then opening the gates I commanded free acceſs to all who inclined.</p>
            <p>I ſoon experienced the danger attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Caſtle of Truth.</hi> My ſlaves and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants now anſwered me with the utmoſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and honeſty, every queſtion I aſked them; and very ſoon ſo provoked my rage, that I ſpeedily cloſed the doors on them all; and indeed, their fidelity and attachment have never been replaced to me. I even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be diſpleaſed with Zumio; I ſaw into his real character, and found he was both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in diſcernment and underſtanding; that multiplicity of unmeaning words to which he gave free ſcope diſguſted me, and I was aſtoniſhed they had ever entertained me. I found a great many faults in him, I did not know of before; he was very obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028733_0032_0FDBE74C4335BF30"/>
contradicted me at every word; in ſhort, I was diſguſted with his want of polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>As he ſtill ſaid, however, he had a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for me, I did not come to an abſolute rupture with him; but I ſcolded or ſnapped at him continually, and he inſolently replied my pride was inſupportable. I commanded him to be ſilent; he would ſhrug his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, mock me, alternately ſhew anger or vexation, and thus we paſſed our time, either ſullenly, or wrangling with each other.</p>
            <p>Quite tired of his tete-a-tete, I continually hoped ſome travellers, invited by the brilliant aſpect of my Palace, would wiſh to enter; but paſſengers contented themſelves with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring it; they approached it eagerly, but as ſoon as they read the inſcription, as eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left it, and purſued their way.</p>
            <p>One day as I ſtood with Zumio, on a balcony, we ſaw a magnificent Chariot at a diſtance, driving towards the Palace. I knew by my Art this Chariot belonged to a King, accompanied with ſeven or eight Courtiers. As it approached, Zumio ſaid, at laſt I hope we ſhall have a viſitor, for which I ſhall be very glad, for I have been moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dull ever ſince I have been here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:028733_0033_0FDBE7949E6E92B8"/>As Zumio ſpoke, the Chariot advanced to the gates; the King read the inſcription, and his firſt movement was to enter; but the courtiers grew pale, ſhuddered, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him. The King perſiſted for ſome time; at laſt he ſuffered himſelf to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, and withdrew; the Courtiers once more recovered their breath, turned the Chariot precipitately away, and ſoon were out of ſight.</p>
            <p>So they are gone, cried Zumio, with chagrin; but while you will perſiſt to leave that curſed inſcription over the gate, we ſhall never ſee a ſoul. You are ſo wilful! —I really never met with a Genius ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and ſtupid.</p>
            <p>Your inſolence is beyond all bounds, Zumio.</p>
            <p>Oh! what you want truth and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both at once; your folly is really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, and at ſome moments you are as inconſiſtent and fooliſh as you are proud.</p>
            <p>Shocked at his exceſſive impertinence, I was going to drive him from me, when I perceived a figure that fixed my whole at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. A venerable old man, with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic preſence that inſpired reſpect, and a
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028733_0034_0FDBE74D6450A950"/>
mild placidity in his countenance, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted the heart in ſpite of itſelf, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a book in his hand, reading, and walking ſlowly.</p>
            <p>When he came oppoſite the Caſtle gates, he lifted up his eyes, and read the inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Oh, thou, ſaid he, whom for theſe forty years I have ſought! O! celeſtial Truth, am I then in my latter days permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee thee unclouded, and as thou art?</p>
            <p>So ſaying, the old man entered the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
            <p>So here is one at laſt, ſaid Zumio, and inſtantly left me to go and meet the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. I followed my little hair-brained Sylph, and we ſoon met the old man. Zumio flew; come in, come good man, ſaid he, you are very welcome, eſpecially if you can rid us of our horrid dulneſs. You are old, have been in various ſcenes of life, and can tell us a good many ſtories; but firſt, pray what is your name?</p>
            <p>Gelanor, replied the old man; in my youth I lived among men; I have been a great traveller, and for theſe laſt twenty years have devoted my days to ſolitude.</p>
            <p>Ah! I perceive, interrupted Zumio, you are a Philoſopher; we ſhall not be much
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028733_0035_0FDBE796FA961F88"/>
the merrier for you.—Nor will you find much entertainment here, for Philoſophers are curious; you, no doubt, imagine you may ſtudy mankind in this place, but that is your miſtake; you will find no body here but this Genius, my Maſter, and me: he, as you perceive, is not very communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; beſides, there is nothing original in his character. As for me, it is true, I have a deal of wit, many virtues and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and it will take you ſome time to know me.</p>
            <p>I know you better at preſent, replied Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanor, ſmiling, than you ſeem to know yourſelf.</p>
            <p>I now ſpoke in turn, and aſked him what was his opinion of himſelf?</p>
            <p>I am good, ſaid he, but imperfect; yet cannot conceive, after having led a life of reflection, and of endeavours to know my own heart, how I can ſtill have ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and foibles. This idea, however, is ſo often preſent to my mind, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves me from pride, and makes me indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. My public and private actions are irreproachable; but I often experience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior ſenſations which are humiliating; and were I to render an exact and circumſtantial
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028733_0036_0FDBE752B53AC138"/>
account of all the ideas which preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to my imagination, I am afraid I ſhould not be found much wiſer than others.</p>
            <p>When he had ſaid thus, I approached Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanor, and embraced him with moſt reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affection. Oh, my father! ſaid I, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expreſs my admiration; you are a true philoſopher, and I ſhall ever honour, ſhall eternally reſpect all thoſe who reſemble you.</p>
            <p>Some days after this converſation, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to obliterate the inſcription from the gates of my Palace. I then quitted Gelanor and Zumio, and, without telling them my project, guided by that curioſity which Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio had inſpired, departed for the kingdom of the Princeſs Arpaliſa. Fearing Zumio's indiſcretion, I would neither take him with me, nor impart my deſign.</p>
            <p>I ſoon came to this celebrated Princeſs, who would not receive me till evening, and I was then introduced into a ſuperb ſaloon, lighted in a moſt agreeable manner, the wax lights were all within cryſtal, covered with white gauze, or ſet in vaſes of alabaſter; which artifice produced a ſoftneſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like clear moon-light. The Princeſs was ſeated on a Throne of gold, over which was a pavilion, decorated with drapery of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028733_0037_0FDBE7986716C278"/>
ſilver gauze; garlands of roſes formed ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant feſtoons, and crowns were ſuſpended over her head.</p>
            <p>Arpaliſa was clothed in magnificent robes, garniſhed with precious ſtones. Her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was dazzling, and her beauty ſeemed to me regular and majeſtic; though the was not very young, I admired her ſhape; her noble air, the ſurpriſing fairneſs of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and was charmed with her conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
            <p>The next day my admiration was more increaſed, when, by the orders of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, I was conducted into a gallery full of paintings, and informed they were all the performances of Arpaliſa; they were on the moſt intereſting ſubjects; Temples to Friendſhip, ſacrifices to Friendſhip, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip triumphing over love: Time crowning and embeliſhing friendſhip: or Altars to Benevolence, Benevolence enlightened by Virtue, Compaſſion exciting Benevolence, &amp;c. &amp;c. In fine, it was not poſſible to leave this gallery, without a full perſuaſion that Arpaliſa was the moſt gentle and virtuous Princeſs in the univerſe.</p>
            <p>From thence I was led to the Laboratory, and, returning, my Conductor told me, in
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028733_0038_0FDBE75428E1F140"/>
confidence, that the Princeſs employed her time, with equal advantage, in Aſtronomy and Mathematics. As I had a particular love for thoſe ſciences, I was enchanted at the diſcovery: though the high opinion I had before conceived of the Princeſs was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incapable of increaſe.</p>
            <p>There was a Concert in the evening, and a Symphony of Arpaliſa's compoſition was performed. The Princeſs then ſat down to the harpſichord, and ſang; her voice did not appear very remarkable, but, in fact, it was almoſt entirely drowned by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyments; but an excellent muſician who ſat by my ſide, aſſured me, ſhe ſung in a ſuperior ſtyle; and I found he had reaſon to ſay ſo, for every body was in raptures.</p>
            <p>After ſupper, they made extempore Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Enigmas, which gave the Princeſs an opportunity of ſhewing her wit. I could not recover from my amazement; what I heard was incredible, and I found it would not be poſſible long to preſerve my liberty in the preſence of ſo accompliſhed a Princeſs.</p>
            <p>Every body retired at midnight, and I remained alone with Arpaliſa, and her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom friend Telira. The two friends were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined on a couch, and tenderly folded in
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028733_0039_0FDBE79F042C2550"/>
each other's arms; the picture was delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; I contemplated it in ſilence, and liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while they ſaid every thing the ſublimeſt friendſhip could dictate. Arpaliſa gave me ſo lively, and ſo affecting an impreſſion of her love for Telira, that I was moved even to tears.</p>
            <p>I could not forbear to teſtify, in part, the admiration ſhe inſpired; I praiſed her ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, her knowledge, and introduced the ſubjects of Aſtronomy and Mathematics; but Arpaliſa, with a tone of the utmoſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, ſtopt me, by ſaying, I am exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexed, my Lord, you have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded I employ my leiſure hours on ſubjects ſo little proper for a woman; and were it true I had a taſte for ſuch ſciences, I would make it a law with myſelf never to own it. Pedantry and affectation are utter ſtrangers to my heart—And my pretenſions really are very few.</p>
            <p>This uncommon modeſty finiſhed her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. I was in tranſports, and returned to my chamber only to think of Arpaliſa. I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a part of the night in writing to her and making verſes upon her. I invented the moſt ingenious and brilliant feaſts; ſhe ſeemed ſenſible of my attention; I declared
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028733_0040_0FDBE756157BE890"/>
my paſſion, and ſhe owned that, my power and rank out of the queſtion, ſhe partook my paſſion; but by an inſurmountable deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, ſhe never could reſolve to marry a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius; for, after a while, added ſhe, you might attribute that to ambition, which was the pure effect of love. Oh, that you had been born leſs illuſtrious!</p>
            <p>Such ſentiments enchanted, yet drove me to deſpair.</p>
            <p>At other moments, Arpaliſa would vaunt the mild content of her preſent ſituation. I have no ambition, ſaid ſhe, Friendſhip is the charm of my life; Love I have never known, and dread to know; for I have a heart too fond, a ſenſibility too delicate; I am happy and peaceable, and muſt not flatter you; I cannot reſolve to ſacrifice ſuch pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect content. No, my Lord, incapable of feigning, incapable of the leaſt coquetry, I would not give you deceitful hopes. Quit this Palace, fly me for your own repoſe— and for mine.</p>
            <p>Love at laſt, however, was triumphant, and Arpaliſa conſented to give me her hand.</p>
            <p>Prudina had rendered me ſo ſuſpicious, I was determined not to wed even the divine Arpaliſa, till I had firſt heard her in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028733_0041_0FDBE79FE6F2F280"/>
of Truth. I doubted not her ſincerity, yet it was impoſſible I could ſacrifice to her the proof of my Palace. I told her I could wed only in my territories, but took care not to mention a word of the charm. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to accompany me, and only required Telira ſhould go with her; for, ſaid ſhe, I could not endure ſeparation from ſo dear a friend. We departed, and ſoon found our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the avenues to my Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The aſpect of this redoubted place, gave the moſt lively emotions. I am going, ſaid I, to diſcover the true ſtate of the heart of her I love; if ſhe be ſuch as I imagine, how much I ſhall reproach myſelf for having thought the proof of this Caſtle neceſſary; and if ſhe be not, what an angelic illuſion ſhall I loſe!</p>
            <p>At laſt we entered the Caſtle, and I caſt a trembling eye on my Princeſs; but what was my ſurprize, when I diſcovered the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial, the ſeraphic Arpaliſa, was forty-eight years old; was loaded with paint, had pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilled eye-brows, falſe hair, and a made up form; in fine, that ſhe was bald, red-haired, old, and crooked.</p>
            <p>Zumio, who had come to meet me, did not know her in the Caſtle of Truth; and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028733_0042_0FDBE756B4F0DF28"/>
burſt out a laughing, as ſoon as he beheld a figure ſo ridiculous, leaning familiarly and triumphantly on my arm. I was ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted that I haſtily quitted the Princeſs, without troubling myſelf about what ſhe might think of my behaviour.</p>
            <p>Zumio followed me; I give you joy of your good fortune, my Lord, ſaid he; you have, indeed, found a moſt rare beauty. I really wonder how you could make ſuch a conqueſt; your choice, however, proves how ſubſtantial your taſte is, and you never need fear a rival, or the torments of jealouſy.</p>
            <p>A ſingle word deprived Zumio of all his pleaſantry; I only named Arpaliſa, and he ſtood confounded and aghaſt.</p>
            <p>After a moment's ſilence, my Lord, ſaid he, I eaſily conceive your chagrin and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt: but though the beauty of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs be borrowed, though her complexion, ſhape, and flowing hair, are all artificial, I yet flatter myſelf we have not been deceived in her ſoul, her underſtanding, and talents; and as ſhe has ſaid ſhe loves you, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded you will find ſhe ſpoke truth.</p>
            <p>If ſo, ſaid I, Zumio, If I have had the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to make ſuch a woman love me,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028733_0043_0FDBE7A22E12D490"/>
what will become of me? My only conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my only hope, is to find her perfidious.</p>
            <p>An attendant now came, to tell me the Princeſs was inquiring for me, and decorum obliged me to go.</p>
            <p>I found her alone in a chamber, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on a couch, ſhe had a handkerchief and a ſmelling-bottle, and, as ſoon as ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me, began to make the moſt ſtrange contortions.</p>
            <p>What ails you, madam! ſaid I; are you not well?</p>
            <p>She made no reply, but continued her contortions, and I repeated my queſtion. She then caſt a languiſhing look at me, and ſaid, I am pretending to be in a fit.</p>
            <p>I ſee you are, replied I.</p>
            <p>Well, and are not you affected?</p>
            <p>How can I avoid it? But why are you in a fit?</p>
            <p>Becauſe you left me ſo coldly, when I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Palace; and I want to perſuade you my ſenſibily is exceſſive, and that I paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately love you.</p>
            <p>And do you really love me?</p>
            <p>I! not the leaſt in the world. I love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>Here the Princeſs thinking ſhe had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028733_0044_0FDBE75C0FD11668"/>
the moſt tender things poſſible, pretend-to weep and dry her eyes, and I recovered. Freed from all inquietude, I now thought proper to prolong a converſation which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted me; and taking Arpaliſa by the hand, You quite melt me, ſaid I; who can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to ſo many charms, and ſo much love?—But how your hand ſhakes!</p>
            <p>Yes, ſaid ſhe, I do that on purpoſe, to make you believe I have convulſive motions.</p>
            <p>But it muſt be very fatiguing.</p>
            <p>Not in the leaſt, habit has made me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert.—But you ſhall preſently ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more; I have not played half my tricks yet; before we have done you ſhall ſee me faint.</p>
            <p>Pray, tell me what is become of Telira.</p>
            <p>Oh, we have quarrelled.</p>
            <p>What, already?</p>
            <p>Yes, and I mean to perſuade you, that Telira is in part the cauſe of the ſituation in which you now ſee me.</p>
            <p>Why, what has paſſed between you?</p>
            <p>Oh! you never heard ſuch inſolence; ſhe told me I was deceitful, vain, envious, inſenſible; that my pride was unmeaſured, my ambition inſatiable. I replied, I had never really loved her; that it was all affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028733_0045_0FDBE7A39CD0A5E0"/>
and that had ſhe been handſomer and more amiable, ſhe would have given me offence; that I had not the leaſt regard for her, nor would make the leaſt ſacrifice to ſerve her.</p>
            <p>It is inconceivable that this ſhould vex her.</p>
            <p>Oh! ſhe left the room in a fury.</p>
            <p>Did you ever repoſe confidence in her?</p>
            <p>I never had confidence in any perſon. I deſire no friends but dupes and ſlaves; not but I have often confided my ſecrets, but then it was merely through vanity; and I always diſguiſed or altered facts, and added circumſtances, for lies coſt me nothing when they would give me conſequence.</p>
            <p>You are quite adorable, and ſo benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent!</p>
            <p>Yes, I love pomp and ſhew exceſſively.</p>
            <p>When we are united, you ſhall diſpoſe of all my treaſures. How many wretches will you relieve with my wealth?</p>
            <p>Oh! I will certainly keep it all myſelf.</p>
            <p>Divine Arpaliſa, how you enchant me! What an aſtoniſhing union of Virtue, Wit, and Knowledge; for it is in vain you would deny you are as learned as beautiful? Your Courtiers told me all; they aſſured me the evening before we departed, there was not
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028733_0046_0FDBE75D2834E478"/>
in the whole nation ſo profound a mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician as yourſelf.</p>
            <p>They are paid to ſay ſo, and are diſgraced if they do not. I am exceedingly ignorant, though I wiſh to be thought otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>How modeſt!—and then your paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings—</p>
            <p>Are every one done by Zolphir.</p>
            <p>And the charming Symphonies—</p>
            <p>Are all compoſed by Geraſtus.</p>
            <p>You are really unique in this world.</p>
            <p>It is certain no perſon ever had more art, or carried diſſimulation farther; for I have impoſed upon the moſt knowing and clear-ſighted people.</p>
            <p>Arpaliſa in pronouncing this phraſe, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly intended a moſt modeſt anſwer; for ſhe took ſo humble an air, with down-caſt eyes, and made ſuch comic and ridiculous grimaces, that I could with difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain myſelf from laughter. Her tone of voice, and the faces ſhe made, agreed ſo ill with what ſhe uttered, and formed a contraſt ſo ſingular and pleaſant, that I found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſuſtain the converſation any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I roſe to leave her; ſhe called me with a feeble voice, telling me, at the ſame time, ſhe was going to cloſe her eyes, and to fall
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028733_0047_0FDBE7A7DD458BA8"/>
into dreadful convulſions. I got away, and went to relate my adventure to the Sylph and the Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>You pretend, ſaid I to Gelanor, this Caſtle can only give me pain, and that it can never be of uſe to me while I am attatched to the world; that, in a word, it is only fit for one who is already undeceived by reaſon, and freed from the power of the paſſions; but do you not now ſee its uſe? For had not I brought Arpaliſa hither, I ſhould have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a woman at once old, ugly, deceitful, ambitious, and wicked.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, replied Gelanor, you might, without ſetting foot in this Caſtle, have eaſily ſeen this woman nearly as ſhe is, had you been leſs ſubject to take things on truſt, and had you leſs vanity. Learn to ſee with your own eyes, to judge from facts, and not from the opinions of others; do not ſo eaſily believe it is impoſſible when you think proper to act the lover, you ſhould not be beloved; and I may aſſure you, that you will in no part of the world become the dupe of ſuch women as Arpaliſa.</p>
            <p>Do you think it no advantage, ſaid I, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle touched, to hear a Philoſopher ſpeak to me with ſo much freedom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:028733_0048_0FDBE7639BF74D40"/>When you do not reject truth, replied Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanor, ſhe will always approach you; ſhe is not ſhut up within theſe Caſtle walls, but is omnipreſent upon earth, and is ſeen more or leſs diſguiſed, according to the weakneſs, pride or ſincerity with which ſhe is ſought; mortal eyes could not ſupport her preſence in every incident of life, and thus it is ſhe is ſeen in this Caſtle, where ſhe deſtroys all ſweet and innocent illuſions, as well as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous errors; ſhe here wears ſo ſavage a form, ſo pitileſs, ſo hard, ſo rude, that ſhe wounds and diſguſts even when ſhe might be uſeful.</p>
            <p>Theſe reflections did not make me change my opinion; experience only could make me wiſe.</p>
            <p>I queſtioned Zumio what had paſſed in the Caſtle during my abſence. Ever ſince your inſcription has been eraſed, anſwered Zumio, we have had plenty of viſitors; and the crowd is now great; the company is nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but the bands of ſociety are broken; diſpute's, endleſs quarrels, and groſs rudeneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are continually heard. Politeneſs is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely baniſhed; they rail at each other without art or indulgence; they cannot ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate, but the moſt biting rancour makes
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028733_0049_0FDBE7A8DD83F820"/>
them amends; they hate openly, exclaim, ſcold, and continue an eternal uproar, of which you can form no idea.</p>
            <p>And how do the women behave?</p>
            <p>More ridiculous in general than the men; the ſlighteſt ſubject engenders mortal hatred, and they diſcover falſehood ſo meditated, and artifices, often ſo puerile, as ſcarcely to be credited. One tells us, ſhe hopes we ſhall believe the ſight of a Spider makes her ill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> another, that ſhe is going to make us imagine ſhe ſhall fall into hyſterics at the ſight of a Cat; and even when they have no particular views to anſwer, ſome will practiſe deceit, for ſo they think they do, merely for amuſement: but, continued Zumio, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettes are moſt of all diſguſting, for they diſcover ſo much effrontery, ſentiments ſo perverſe, tricks ſo abſurd, ſo—</p>
            <p>What, interrupted I, has not one virtuous woman entered the Caſtle!</p>
            <p>Pardon me, my Lord, there is one.</p>
            <p>Zumio ſtopped, and ſeemed embarraſſed. What is the matter, Zumio, ſaid I, what ails you? Speak, I inſiſt upon it.</p>
            <p>I am in love, and am mortally afraid you ſhould become my Rival.</p>
            <p>And would you not ſacrifice your Love to me?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:028733_0050_0FDBE7649EC1A458"/>No, indeed.</p>
            <p>No! You, who have aſſured me there is no ſacrifice you would not make to ſecure my happineſs!</p>
            <p>I exaggerred greatly. I am much attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, but I ſhould heſitate to deceive you for Roſamond.</p>
            <p>The confeſſion is expreſſive and paſſionate. —And Roſamond is very charming.</p>
            <p>There is not her equal in the univerſe; her heart is honeſt and unpolluted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the love of a Sylph.</p>
            <p>And you love her?</p>
            <p>The purity of her ſentiments pleaſe me, and ſhe has told me ſhe has an inclination for me.</p>
            <p>If you are beloved, what have you to fear? For ſhould ambition ſeduce her, ſhe will be obliged to ſpeak truth, and cannot therefore perſuade me I have the preference.</p>
            <p>Oh! I am certain of her heart; I am on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fearful ſhe ſhould turn your head, and that you then might trouble our repoſe.</p>
            <p>Oh! fear nothing, Zumio, I am no ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; beſides, I do not wiſh to become your rival; and I proteſt I can converſe without trouble or danger, however charming ſhe may be, ſo long as you ſhall have her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:028733_0051_0FDBE7AD8931D9F0"/>Since you are reſolved to ſee her, let me go firſt and ſpeak to her</p>
            <p>Why ſo?</p>
            <p>Becauſe—</p>
            <p>Nay, anſwer.</p>
            <p>Becauſe I wiſh to prejudice her againſt you by telling her your faults.</p>
            <p>You are very obliging, but I will not give you that trouble; tell me only if ſhe knows the effect of this Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly; ſhe has been here theſe ſix weeks, and it is ſcarcely poſſible to live in it two days without finding that out.</p>
            <p>Followed by the ſorrowful and zealous Zumio, I went to find Roſamond, but met Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paliſa. As ſoon as ſhe ſaw me, my Lord, cried ſhe, what kind of a place is this you have brought me to? What ſtrange people are aſſembled in this Caſtle? I went into the Saloon for a moment, and there I found the very worſt kind of company; women ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, men ſo coxcomical.—Such rudeneſs! —I never beheld ſuch manners; if you knew the inſolence I have been offered— I was in deſpair to ſee every body admiring a young Lady they call Roſamond. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſſemble my vexation, but could not; and ſo I called aloud, Gentlemen,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028733_0052_0FDBE7693988C668"/>
come here, look at me, think of me, pay your addreſſes to me, and leave that young beauty, whom I deteſt, ſince ſhe pleaſes and attracks all the men.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had I addreſſed them thus, than they all burſt out a laughing, and hooted, and mocked, as if I had ſaid the moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous thing in the world; I then told them I was the Queen of the Caſtle, and that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow I ſhould be your Bride; on which their hue and cry began again, and they were even inſolent enough to call me old mad-woman.—Give me vengeance, my Lord, and drive this Roſamond from the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Then ſhe has particularly offended you?</p>
            <p>She is the only one who offered me no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, but my hatred is not the leſs ſtrong; ſhe obtained new praiſes of her mildneſs and modeſty, and beſides ſhe is ſo beautiful.— I have endeavoured to defame her as much as poſſible before you; therefore tell me, my Lord, whether what I have ſaid to you, has made any impreſſion upon you.</p>
            <p>A very ſtrong one I aſſure you; and I will go and ſeek Roſamond immediately, to tell what I think of your juſtice and moderation.</p>
            <p>Go not near her, my Lord, ſhe will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:028733_0053_0FDBE7B05C42ECA0"/>Pray be calm. Zumio, conduct the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to her apartment.</p>
            <p>So ſaying, I waited not for an anſwer, but flew to find Roſamond, who was in fact what love and envy painted her; her beauty was angelic, her modeſty and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonderful. I looked, liſtened, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied the happineſs of Zumio; but as, thanks to the Box which the King of the Genii had given me, I could diſſemble my thoughts, I did not inform Roſamond of the ſtrong impreſſion ſhe made upon my heart; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented myſelf with only reading her's; ſhe told me ſhe was neither coquetiſh nor incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; that Zumio was the firſt object ſhe had loved; that ſhe had not any violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for him at preſent, but that ſhe felt her love would ſoon equal Zumio's.</p>
            <p>I quitted Roſamond, enchanted by her beauty, wit, and character. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was out of temper, and eſpecially with Zumio; he complained; I became more vexed, and drove him from my preſence, but called him back a moment after, not to do him juſtice, but to prevent his being with Roſamond; I felt my own tyranny, which love would not of itſelf have produced; but
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028733_0054_0FDBE76AA6560A88"/>
Zumio enraged me, by the rudeneſs and ſeverity of his expreſſions and reproaches.</p>
            <p>The ſage Gelanor in vain endeavoured to make peace between us; alas, ſaid he, were you not in this Caſtle, and otherwiſe in the ſame ſituation, Zumio would diſguiſe his injurious fears, and exceſſive reſentment, and appear mild and moderate, and you would then be equitable and generous. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, my Lord, he is forced to ſpeak what he thinks; remember he is under the dominion of love and anger, and that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow he will not think as he does to-day.</p>
            <p>Do you not ſee, exclaimed Zumio, that Phanor only wants a pretext to baniſh me the Caſtle, that he may drive me from Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond; for do not ſuppoſe, that he, like us, is obliged to ſpeak what he thinks; his art preſerves him from any ſuch neceſſity: he will not own it, becauſe he is naturally ſuſpicious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I have found him out in more than twenty falſehoods: thus while he reads our ſecrets, in ſpite of ourſelves, his own are locked up. What cowardice! what unworthy meanneſs!</p>
            <p>This reproach, which I but too much merited, drove me ſo furious, that had it not been for Gelanor, I ſhould certainly
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028733_0055_0FDBE7B26B752AF8"/>
have committed ſome fatal crime. Stop, madman, cried the Philoſopher, ſtop, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete not your diſhonour by avenging your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on a defenceleſs Rival.</p>
            <p>The authoritative voice of virtue brought me to myſelf; but Gelanor could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of my error without vexing me; I left him haſtily, and went and ſhut myſelf in my own apartment, that I might indulge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſtraint, my chagrin and ill-humour.</p>
            <p>I became gloomy, impatient, moroſe, fled ſociety, wandered mournfully in my Caſtle, and ſought for Roſamond againſt my will; ſhe avoided me when I endeavoured to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach her; I ſaw ſo much perplexity and diſdain in her countenance that I durſt not ſpeak.</p>
            <p>I found her one evening alone in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſitting in a bower, plunged in a deep reverie. I advanced, and perceiving ſhe had been weeping, I aſked her the cauſe of her inquietude? She ſighed, Zumio, replied ſhe, has juſt left me; I ſaw he was diſſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me, and that afflicts me.</p>
            <p>Diſſatisfied! ſaid I, with extreme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, why?</p>
            <p>Roſamond made me no anſwer, except by a look of indignation. In vain did I preſs
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028733_0056_0FDBE770634BB4A0"/>
and queſtion her; ſhe was obſtinately ſilent; hope entered my heart. Zumio was diſſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—Roſamond durſt not ſpeak; I imagined ſhe read my heart and was affected: all my reſolutions, all the obligations I had to Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio's attachment were forgotten. I fell at her feet, and declared my love in the moſt paſſionate terms. I could obtain no anſwer, but neither could I obſerve the colouring of anger on the beauteous cheeks of Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond; on the contrary, I thought her eyes ſpoke ſatisfaction. I again ſolicited an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with freſh ardour; Roſamond, ſtill mute, made a motion as if to riſe and fly me. I fearing to diſpleaſe, would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, and therefore left her.</p>
            <p>Full of hope, or rather not doubting my happineſs, I ſought for ſolitude to think on Roſamond. I had walked thus two hours, when Zumio ſuddenly appeared, animated by the moſt violent rage. So, perfidious Spirit, cried he, you have ſeduced Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond. I have obſerved for ſome days paſt her ſilence and thoughtfulneſs, and at laſt the Die is caſt; ſhe has declared ſhe loves me no longer, but that ſhe adores you.</p>
            <p>Zumio! What is it you tell me! Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Zumio! I am ſorry for you—But oh!
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028733_0057_0FDBE7B369F38468"/>
be generous enough to ſacrifice your love.</p>
            <p>I am obliged to ſacrifice it, but at the ſame time my friendſhip for you is gone.</p>
            <p>Nay, Zumio—</p>
            <p>You merit not a friend; nor will I ever forget or forgive treachery ſo black.</p>
            <p>Accuſe me not of treachery, Zumio, for you never confided in me. You ſuſpected me before I thought of Roſamond; had it not been for your unjuſt jealouſy, your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious reproaches and paſſions, Phanor had never been your rival; but you inſulted, vexed, aggravated me, and ſo highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended me, that for a moment I forgot our friendſhip. I have been weak, but not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious; beſides, in robbing you of Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's heart, I have broken no ſacred en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements; ſhe had not promiſed to give you her hand. Hope was all ſhe had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Triumph then, dear Zumio, over your reſentment, and make not my wrongs great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than they are. Roſamond is altered, think not of her, and torment me not with ſuch diſtreſſing complaints.</p>
            <p>When I had ſaid this, I drew near to take Zumio in my arms; but he immediately drew back; and run off, ſaying, <hi>I deteſt you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:028733_0058_0FDBE7715D4506D8"/>I was aſtoniſhed, yet happy, and forgave him his anger, and without troubling my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more about it, flew to find Roſamond. She received me at firſt with great perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; but how exceſſive was my joy, when ſhe bluſhing owned ſhe loved me, and me only; that ſhe had never felt for Zumio more than an emotion of preference, but her love for me was real.</p>
            <p>Do you indeed love me for myſelf, cried I, has ambition no—Here Roſamond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted me;—dare you preſume to think it; baniſh ſuch ſuſpicions, my Lord, they are inſults. I never had other ambition than that of pleaſing you; and if you had no Caſtle but a cottage to offer me, all the Kings and Genii of the world would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed for you.</p>
            <p>You may more eaſily imagine, than I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, the motions I felt at hearing an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer like this in the Caſtle of Truth. How much did I congratulate myſelf on the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this Caſtle, which procured me happineſs ſo pure; for, ſaid I, could I have perſuaded myſelf any where elſe, that in this anſwer there was no exaggeration.</p>
            <p>To expedite our nuptials I left her, and gave orders for their being ſolemnized next
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028733_0059_0FDBE7B7C58452B0"/>
day. The news ſoon reſounded through the Caſtle. As for Arpaliſa, ſhe had known the Charm above a fortnight, and had ſhut her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in her apartment there, to hide from all eyes her fury and her ſhame; and there to wait, as ſhe did with inexpreſſible impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, the expiration of the three months, which ſhe was obliged to remain in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Caſtle. Zumio, become my enemy, was with her; for my own part, being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally occupied about Roſamond, I neither felt the happineſs of being juſtly deſpiſed, nor was I in a condition to think of the wrong I had done.</p>
            <p>It was a long and weariſome night! Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's torch was not to be lighted till day, and then I was to wed the moſt beautiful and lovely lady upon earth. Certain of her virtue, the goodneſs of her diſpoſition, the purity of her mind, ſure of being paſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely beloved. I again found that bliſs which, for a moment, Agelia taught me to taſte. Roſamond, leſs lively, leſs poignant than Agelia, had neither her caprices nor ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, but the happineſs I anticipated with her, promiſed to be more permanent and ſubſtantial, as I thought.</p>
            <p>Aurora no ſooner begun to ſend her
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028733_0060_0FDBE77302518950"/>
beams into my chamber, than I, unable to reſtrain my impatience, roſe and flew to Roſamond's apartment. I took a baſket, garniſhed with flowers and precious ſtones, into which I put a billet, which I was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſhe ſhould receive when ſhe awaked; and I entered her chamber, without either being ſeen or heard; Roſamond was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep; and, after having placed the baſket at her feet, I heſitated a little, her beauties aſtoniſhing me.</p>
            <p>The mereſt accident cauſed me to caſt my eye on her table, juſt as I was about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; but what was my ſtupefaction, when I beheld, upon that table the Box, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſman, which the Sovereign of the Genii had given me, that I myſelf ſhould not be ſubjected to the charm of the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſed I had been miſtaken by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental reſemblance; for ſearching in my pocket, I there found a box: I again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered my breath, took confidence, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined carefully, and thought that that I found in my pocket was the true one. Tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the other, however, which lay on the table, for farther conviction, I could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger doubt my misfortune. I perfectly ſaw by comparing them together, that Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028733_0061_0FDBE7B89E645D70"/>
was the Taliſman, and that which I had was a counterfeit.</p>
            <p>Amazed and perplexed, I could form no probable conjecture concerning this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but took the Taliſman, put the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit on the table, again ſnatched up my baſket, in order to retire haſtily, leſt I ſhould be ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>My vexation and paſſion I cannot deſcribe. I knew not how or when Roſamond had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured my Taliſman, but it was evident there was treachery at the bottom. So then! cried I, all the power of magic is unable to cope with the perfidy of women; even here in this Caſtle, they fall upon ſchemes to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on us.</p>
            <p>Whenever Roſamond aroſe, I waited on her; I was in great agitation, which ſhe ſoon perceived, and enquired the cauſe.</p>
            <p>I have had ſome diſagreeable thoughts, I replied, and ſomehow I dread that Zumio ſhares your affections.</p>
            <p>You wrong me much indeed then.</p>
            <p>I was tranſported at hearing this, and was reſtored almoſt to my former Paradiſe, when ſhe ſaid,</p>
            <p>My conſtancy is unſhaken; my virtue is real and not to be ſhaken; you are going
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028733_0062_0FDBE777F7B92AD0"/>
to become my ſhuſband, and I would prefer death to the infamy of betraying you, I made no promiſe to Zumio, commit no crime in renouncing him, and my pride is gratified by ſacrificing my Love.</p>
            <p>What ſay you, replied I, in aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>Why are you ſo much ſurpriſed, ſaid Roſamond? are you not convinced of my Love?</p>
            <p>Do you think I ſhould?</p>
            <p>Indeed I muſt confeſs it is Zumio I love; but my virtue might eaſily triumph over that inclination, for I will ſee Zumio no more, but attach myſelf to you; gratitude and duty are all powerful over my heart; you are vain, I am virtuous, and I can eaſily make you believe I love you above all men.</p>
            <p>I now found it impoſſible to keep within bounds; my paſſion overcame me, and Roſamond ſoon perceived I had found out the deception of the Taliſman.</p>
            <p>Alas! exclaimed ſhe, now will Zumio have ample vengeance on his ambitious miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and perfidious friend, and heaven is juſt. Yes, my Lord, ambition ſeduced my ſoul; informed of your paſſion by Zumio, I regretted the rank and power which ſuch a marriage would confer on your conſort;
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028733_0063_0FDBE7BF9FD903E0"/>
Zumio enraged, overwhelmed me with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and irritated me; I commanded him to leave me; you ſoon after appeared, and unwilling you ſhould know my thoughts, I determined to to be ſilent; ſcarce had you quitted me, ere I ſaw ſhining among the green herbs, the fatal Taliſman, which in all likelihood, had fallen out of your pocket when you ſo paſſionately threw yourſelf at my feet; by a very ſingular chance, I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to poſſeſs a box of rock cryſtal, very like your Taliſman, and at firſt I thought it was my own box: but examining fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I diſcovered the myſtic characters which are engraved upon the lid, I then no longer doubted it was a Taliſman. Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio had told me the enchantment of the Caſtle had no effect on you; and I gueſſed that this box was the preſervative which might, perhaps, guard you from the effects of this dangerous charm; I immediately ran to my chamber, ſought for, and found my own box, and with a diamond's point, traced, and perfectly imitated the myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cyphers. This operation over, Zumio came, and on him I firſt tried the virtue of your Taliſman; I told him I did not love him, and found the box gave me the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pability
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028733_0064_0FDBE778E15F0F70"/>
of diſguiſing my thoughts. Zumio left me in deſpair; I went to find and meet you. I had but one fear, which was, that you had diſcovered my theft, though ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two hours had paſſed ſince it had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; but ſoon found you had not. While you expreſſed your tranſports, I adroitly ſlipt my cryſtal box into your pocket, and kept yours. I knew the cheat muſt in time be diſcovered, if we remained here, but I flattered myſelf I ſhould eaſily prevail on you quickly to quit this Caſtle. I had been tempted by opportunity, ſpurred on by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, I had not leiſure to weigh coolly the dangers of an undertaking at once ſo fooliſh and improper.</p>
            <p>My Lord, you are now acquainted with every thing concerning this affair; and I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely regret having deceived you; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach myſelf more for having ſacrificed Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio; but I have diſcovered no malice, have not debaſed myſelf; and though deprived of the Taliſman, and obliged to ſpeak truth, I ſtill can ſay I love virtue; and that I never ſhould have violated its ſacred duties, had I become your wife, in conſequence of my plan.</p>
            <p>I was now compelled to love Roſamond
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028733_0065_0FDBE7C0E7857268"/>
with all her ambition; penetrated with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, overwhelmed with deſpair, and more in love than ever, I caſt myſelf at her feet. Oh, Roſamond! cried I, it is impoſſible for me to vanquiſh the paſſion you cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate; I am not beloved; but deign, at leaſt, to give me the right ever to love you; deign ſtill to reign in this Caſtle; let Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for ever unite your deſtiny to mine. Come, I am ready to attend you to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</p>
            <p>I am neither bold, my Lord, nor mean; had I married you, I doubt not you ſhould have been happy; but now when even that hope is fled, I never will be yours.</p>
            <p>This uncommon delicacy delighted me, and I vainly eſſayed to vanquiſh it; ſhe perſiſted in her refuſal; I again ſaw Zumio; told him all that had paſſed. She took the reſolution, the ſame day, to quit the Caſtle of Truth, and Zumio declared he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to follow her. I flatter myſelf, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, that when we have left this accurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Caſtle, Roſamond may perſuade me ſhe has only been guilty of a ſlight wrong to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, the remembrance of which I ought to loſe. Farewell, my Lord, and as I
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028733_0066_0FDBE77F005E15F0"/>
engage I never ſhall again enter theſe walls, if you abide here; farewell, for ever.</p>
            <p>And will you, Zumio, abandon me?</p>
            <p>As Roſamond loves you not, I no longer hate you; but my reſentment againſt you is ſtill ſtrong; were I able to conceal it, as I have ſtill much attachment for you in my heart, and likewiſe much compaſſion, I might be capable to conſole you, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite your gratitude and admiration, by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing a woman, who, it muſt be owned, would have ſacrificed me; but you rend my heart, I can diſguiſe nothing; it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſhew myſelf more generous, or leſs vindictive than I really am; beſides, ſhould I hereafter repent the having made ſuch a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, you would inſtantly know it, and I ſhould loſe its fruits; therefore, adieu, my Lord; and if you wiſh to preſerve friends, follow my counſel, and take another dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>To add to my grief, Zumio left me and followed Roſamond; thus, in one unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day, my friend and miſtreſs forſook me.</p>
            <p>The Philoſopher remained; prompted by his curioſity, he continued in a place, which furniſhed a Philoſopher with many ſubjects for reflection. Touched to ſee my profound
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028733_0067_0FDBE7C3420234B8"/>
grief, he preſſed me to abandon my Caſtle. No, Gelanor, ſaid I, no; here will I ſtay till I have found an amiable woman of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſenſibility who may yet make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for all the calamities my unhappy love has produced.</p>
            <p>As I was walking one day through a bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of myrtles and orange trees, Gelanor came to ſeek me. Here are two gueſts, ſaid he, a man and a woman of a delightful form, who have unthinkingly entered the Caſtle, and are exceedingly afflicted to learn they are obliged to remain here three months; they are conſulting together, and I believe, mean to aſk your permiſſion to be married here; but, in all likelihood, a quarter of an hour's converſation will rob them of that wiſh, for no more time is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite here to make a breach between the happieſt of lovers.</p>
            <p>While Gelanor was thus ſpeaking, the youth approached: I adviſed him, enquiring if he yet continued firmly reſolved to marry his miſtreſs?</p>
            <p>I am indeed, my Lord, ſaid he, and as my reſolution is not occaſioned by Love, there is the leſs fear of a relapſe.</p>
            <p>And are you not in love?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:028733_0068_0FDBE80A16B533B0"/>I am not; formerly I loved this lady per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, as ſhe did me, but an extraordinary accident tore my miſtreſs from me, only to perſecute her; this I knew, but knew not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what part of the world ſhe was carried. Love obliged me to go in ſearch of her; and I left my country, vowing never to return till I had found her whom I adored. My tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels laſted three years; Love followed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guided my path, for the firſt year; but the way at length became too weariſome for him, and he left me; I however, did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, and continued my route; but I ſoon travelled ſlower, and ſtopped oftener, till my fidelity vaniſhed, for I ſtopped too long.</p>
            <p>But friendſhip and honour made me again recollect my engagements; I continued my travels, and found the woman I had ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately loved, but who now was no more than a dear and intereſting friend. She was deeply affected by all I had done for her; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of deceiving me, ſhe confeſſed ſhe no longer had the power of participating that love ſhe ſuppoſed we inſpired; for that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo long an abſence, another object had touched her heart. At preſent, added ſhe, I am free, and I am never more liable to the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028733_0069_0FDBE812C02A4838"/>
ſeductions of love; let ſincerity, Oh Nadir! be thought the beſt proof of my gratitude; and if, after this confeſſion, you love me ſtill, to you I am ready to devote my life; you have loſt an ardent lover, and in her room have got a ſteady friend and conſtant and affectionate wife.</p>
            <p>Her honeſty delighted me, and in return I ceaſed to diſſemble; I opened my heart to this generous, amiable friend, preſſed her to unite her deſtiny to mine, and obtained the promiſe of her hand, when we got home again.</p>
            <p>In about a month after our departure, we approached the loved land that gave us birth, when happening to ſee this magnificent Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, curioſity invited us to enter; but ſince we are obliged to paſs three months here, let me conjure you, my Lord, to allow us to defer our union no longer.</p>
            <p>If your miſtreſs agrees, I ſaid, I had no objection.</p>
            <p>Be pleaſed to aſk her, my Lord, ſhe comes.</p>
            <p>I looked about, and beheld her coming— I trembled; my heart beat violently, I ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meet her—Heavens! cried I, it is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelia—I was not deceived, it was ſhe
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028733_0070_0FDBE7C863D49F68"/>
herſelf; ſurprise, confuſion, feelings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable, mixed with grief, vexation and joy; emotions all violent and diverſe, rendered me unmoveable. Agelia was ſilent for a moment, then laughed aloud, and ſo, my Lord, ſaid ſhe, you are incorrigible— For I now know the virtue of your Caſtle— And has all my admonitions and advices pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this effect?</p>
            <p>Her raillery I could not bear, the rather as ſhe ſpoke moſt chearfully and without concern; diſtracted, deſpairing, I made no reply, but precipitately retired, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal feelings which it was impoſſible to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble. I never, hitherto, had really lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any but Agelia; and this paſſion, which was ſo true and ſtrong, was inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled; I ſaw her again, found her more amiable, more charming than ever; her manners were ſo natural, and her mind ſo candid, that even in the Caſtle of Truth her accompliſhments ſhone with undiminiſhed luſtre.</p>
            <p>Love no longer influenced Nadir; Agelia felt only friendſhip for him; hope again ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me; I ſpoke to, conjured Agelia to prefer me to the indifferent Nadir: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſaid I, that I love you to exceſs, while he does not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:028733_0071_0FDBE816DD315BB0"/>Love, my Lord, ſaid Agelia, evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, but the remembrance of generous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions remains, and this it is which makes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments durable. I might forget the love of Nadir, but never that he has travelled almoſt through the world for theſe three years, in hopes of ſerving me.</p>
            <p>Alas! replied I, and muſt I ſee you in the poſſeſſion of Nadir, and be driven to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity?</p>
            <p>Such extremity is the whim of an hour. Can you ſeriouſly aſk me to ſacrifice ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſo generous a friend?—You who had not the trifling merit (trifling, becauſe it is involuntary) to regret for any reaſonable ſpace of time, the miſtreſs whom you had loſt by your own fault; the inhabitants of this Caſtle are not remarkable for their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citurnity; I have queſtioned them, and, you may well ſuppoſe, know the Anecdotes of Arpaliſa and Roſamond: ſpeak not then to me of a paſſion I no longer feel. Open your eyes, my lord? you are born virtuous and amiable; but while you preſerve this injurious ſuſpicion and imprudent curioſity, which characteriſe you at preſent, you nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can know repoſe nor happineſs. Think what this fatal infatuation of wiſhing to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028733_0072_0FDBE7CAA0A9B990"/>
the ſecret foldings of the heart you love has already coſt you: without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning myſelf; remember Roſamond, who was charming, ſincere, virtuous, ſenſible of benefits, capable of gratitude, and, in any other place but this, of making you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy. Remember the amiable little Zumio, who ſo ſincerly loved you, and whom you drove from you. Oh ceaſe, my Lord, to wiſh to deſtroy neceſſary illuſions; abandon this fatal Caſtle, or for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce friendſhip, love, ſociety, and, in fact, all thoſe connections and enjoyments which render life comfortable.</p>
            <p>What ſhe ſaid, ſtruck me the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Agelia, with firmly not to be ſhaken, perſiſted in her reſolution to wed Nadir. Unable to ſupport the cruel ſight, I came at length to a determination; and wiſhing, at leaſt to gain the eſteem of Agelia, heaped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits on Nadir; left the Caſtle, engaging myſelf never to enter theſe gates if impelled by jealouſy or ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>I think, replied Agelia, your engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be more to the purpoſe, were you never to come here again on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whatever.</p>
            <p>It is not in my power to engage for that,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028733_0073_0FDBE81ABA2F7260"/>
anſwered I, but to prove to you I do not intend to come often, or ſtay long, I here give you, deareſt Agelia, the Taliſman, which the ambitious Roſamond once pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loined; this box, as you know; is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain preſervative againſt the enchantment of the Caſtle; you are obliged to ſtay here three months, and in that time it may be of ſome ſervice to you. Farewell for ever.</p>
            <p>If you allow me to give it to Nadir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Agelia, I will accept it; deceit is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways painful, but to be deceived is often the greateſt of pleaſures. If he ſhould dive into my thoughts; ſo therefore allow me to put your Taliſman into his hands.</p>
            <p>The Taliſman is yours, do with it what you think proper, to your happineſs I ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it; but now, obliged as I am to ſpeak what I think, deign, for the laſt time, to hear a faithful avowal of the paſſion you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire. Never, Agelia, have I loved any as I have loved you; never ſhall I forget you. Adieu! pity the unhappy Phanor; for your compaſſion and regard is the only mitigations my grief permits.</p>
            <p>While I thus ſpoke, I obſerved the tears of the lovely feeling Agelia begin to flow; too much affected to reply, ſhe gave me her
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028733_0074_0FDBE7CAA4A74530"/>
hand, which I bathed with my tears.—At length I tore myſelf from her, quitted her for ever, left the Caſtle of Truth, and I have never ſince returned to it.</p>
            <p>Phanor having thus finiſhed his ſtory, thus addreſſed Altemira.—This is the ſecret I have had the fortitude, for ſixteen years, to conceal. Never, dear Altemira, have I doubted your virtue or affection: the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Truth cannot add to the eſteem I have for you; it might enfeeble, or at leaſt diſturb, for a moment, that ſincere attachment by which we are at preſent united; and, if you take my advice you will never attempt a journey of ſuch riſque.</p>
            <p>My dear Phanor, replied Altemira, I am anxious to have an opportunity of repeating, in the Caſtle of Truth, that I never loved any but Phanor.</p>
            <p>Such a declaration was in in ſome degree agreeable to the Genius, eſpecially that the Queen was ſo firmly reſolved, ſince it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo well her virtue; he only required ſhe ſhould ſeriouſly reflect for ſix months; and if, ſaid he, you are then of that mind, we will immediately proſecute the journey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:028733_0075_0FDBE81C5CBFAE20"/>The time being elapſed, Altemira was anxious to depart, and take with her her daughter, and Prince Philamir, who was to eſpouſe Zeolide. My daughter, ſaid ſhe, is certain of the heart of Philamir; but ſhe deſires he ſhould read hers likewiſe, and, ere he receives her hand be aſſured of her faith. The Prince knows the effects of the Caſtle, yet ardently wiſhes to go with us; Zeolide wiſhes to take her dear and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friend, Palmis, ſo beloved by her and us, and whom I propoſe acquainting what is the charm of the Caſtle this evening.</p>
            <p>I have a plan alſo, replied Phanor, to take thither three or four Courtiers, whom I ſhould not be ſorry to know, and whom I ſhall not inform of the ſecret of the much to be dreaded place whither they are going; for were I ſo to do, I imagine they would find ſome pretext to be excuſed taking ſuch a journey: on which account, Philamir and Zeolide, muſt be enjoined in ſecrecy.</p>
            <p>Altemira and Zeolide, that night, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided the ſecret to their friend, and Palmis at firſt ſhewed more ſurprize than eagerneſs to take this journey. However, after ſome reflection, Palmis ſaid, I have nothing eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028733_0076_0FDBE7CF24E6BB48"/>
to reproach myſelf of; my attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you is genuine, not feigned, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſh to attend you.</p>
            <p>Palmis acknowledged at ſame time ſhe loved a young Courtier, named Chriſel, whoſe natural levity ſhe feared. Chriſel was a man of faſhion, and ſuch a quality does not inſpire love with confidence. Palmis wiſhed her lover might go with them, to which Phanor conſented.</p>
            <p>The hour of departure arrived, Altemira, Zeolide, Philamir, and Palmis, were the only perſons who knew the ſecret of the Caſtle of Truth; and, in proportion as they approached it, their gaiety decreaſed; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and inquietude invaded their hearts; Zeolide was the moſt tranquil, but Philamir became thoughtful and abſent; the gloom of Palmis was viſible, and the Queen was alarmed at remarking the trouble of Phanor. The Courtiers, who knew not the cauſe, vainly endeavoured to enliven the loſt gaiety of the Genius: the Queen and Zeolide, the Lover of Palmis, the amiable and brilliant Chriſel, never diſcovered more grace or greater deſire to pleaſe; and when conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with Palmis in ſecret, he painted his
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028733_0077_0FDBE820CAF8F9A8"/>
paſſion with ſo much feeling and heat, that her ſuſpicions vexed her.</p>
            <p>One of theſe Courtiers who attended Phanor, was a man of an odd character, ſeldom met with in Courts. Ariſteus (ſo he was called) had done the State great ſervice, arrived at the higheſt honours by merit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; he did not come to court till his youth was paſt, and he brought thither a blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and moroſeneſs in his manner, that gave him an air of originality, which had the greateſt effect, becauſe it formed ſo ſtrong a contraſt to the manners uſually ſeen in ſuch places. A rigid and ſatiric Courtier is not very likely to become a favourite; but his ſucceſs for that very reaſon was at firſt as great as his ſingularity amuſing; but finding afterwards his underſtanding equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his ill-humour, they endeavoured too late to get him driven out; ſo he was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled at Court, as both Altemira and Phanor valued him.</p>
            <p>But what is moſt remarkable when eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed there, he did not alter his behaviour; for he not only forbore falſe panegyric, but he was never even heard to praiſe; and though very capable of zealouſly ſerving his friends, he never ſaid an agreeable or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028733_0078_0FDBE7D15692A7F0"/>
thing, nor was a friendly offer known to eſcape him.</p>
            <p>The Caſtle of Truth was now at hand, and Phanor had a private converſation with the Queen. I confeſs to you, ſaid he, I cannot enter this Caſtle, which has been ſo fatal to me, without chagrin, nor can I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble. I ſtand greatly in need of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, What huſband, who has been married ſeventeen years, can ſay he never has been chargeable with a fault—Too minute inveſtigation will rather vex you.</p>
            <p>I ſhall aſk you no queſtions then, my Lord, replied the Queen in a pet.</p>
            <p>Nor will I you, ſaid Phanor.</p>
            <p>I am under no apprehenſions from yours, my Lord, therefore do not fear to meet them.</p>
            <p>I candidly confeſs to you, that as the moſt ſcruplous candour will be neceſſary I have ſome dread, replied Phanor.</p>
            <p>Acknowledge then, ſaid Altemira, you at preſent deeply regret you ſacrificed your precious Taliſman, which gave you the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py power to conceal your thoughts in the Caſtle of Truth from Agelia, that beautiful fair one.</p>
            <p>The Genius gave no anſwer but a ſigh;
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028733_0079_0FDBE821A0A92CF0"/>
and the Queen gave place to a fit of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
            <p>The ſhining walls of the Caſtle now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, more than one heart was agitated, but they felt too late all the conſequences of ſo dangerous a voyage. They deſcend, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and enter the fatal gates.</p>
            <p>On entering the Caſtle, the firſt object that caught the attention of the Genius was the venerable Gelanor, the virtuous Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, whom he had left above eighteen years before in the Caſtle of Truth. Phanor haſtily left the Queen, glad of a pretext to be at ſome diſtance from her; and ran to ſalute Gelanor, with whom he retired into the Gardens.</p>
            <p>My Lord, ſaid the Philoſopher, who is this you have brought with you?</p>
            <p>A wife I have married.</p>
            <p>A wife! Strange! Did you reflect well?</p>
            <p>Her virtue is undoubted.</p>
            <p>Many huſbands, my Lord, within theſe nineteen years, have I known enter this Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with the ſame ſecurity, and leave it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their miſtake.</p>
            <p>Such doubts diſtreſs not me; Altemira knows the effects of this Caſtle, yet would come hither. I have little uneaſineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what I may know of her, but much
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028733_0080_0FDBE7D63A9B5F48"/>
for what ſhe may learn of me. —But tell me, venerable Sage, ſatisfy my curioſity.— Time has not yet effaced Agelia from my memory; and every thing here recalls her rememerance—Did ſhe marry Nadir, when I left you?</p>
            <p>She did, my Lord, and that very hour, gave him the Taliſman ſhe had of you. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dir, touched by ſo delicate and generous a procedure, determined never to queſtion her, and thus they paſſed three months in the moſt perfect underſtanding.—My Lord, take a leſſon from them.</p>
            <p>If the Queen inclines, I agree.</p>
            <p>As Gelanor and the Genius were thus converſing, Zeolide was walking with the Queen, and the reſt of the newly arrived travellers. The young Princeſs and Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir were a little before. After a moment's ſilence, Philamir ſaid, Ever ſince I have been in this place, I have found an inſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able embarrſsment. I dare not ſpeak my thoughts; I tremble leſt what I ſay here ſhould not ſeem ſufficiently warm.</p>
            <p>So then heretofore you flattered.</p>
            <p>Perhaps I did.</p>
            <p>Baſe man! half my feelings were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:028733_0081_0FDBE82580618CA8"/>What an enchanting ſpeech! adorable Zeolide?</p>
            <p>But, ſay, did you ever love me?</p>
            <p>You alone I have loved: on you depends my happineſs.</p>
            <p>Enough, enough, replied the Princeſs. —Yes, dear Philamir, we will prove, that even this Caſtle cannot be fatal to true Lovers; and that far from deſtroying it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes affection, by diſſipating all the doubts which is too often felt by a lively paſſion.</p>
            <p>While ſhe thus ſpoke, Altemira and Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is came up; Philamir left them, and the princeſſes ſeparated themſelves from the groupe of Courtiers that followed them in the gardens; and Philamir and Chriſel went into a thicket, at the entrance of which they ſaw a young woman ſitting on a bank. She was handſome, and Chriſel would go and ſpeak to her. The Prince ſoon found ſhe was but juſt arrived, and that ſhe no more than Chriſel knew how impoſſible it was to conceal her thoughts. He enquired her name; Aſema, ſhe replied.</p>
            <p>Your manner is whimſical and flirting, which is agreeable enough, ſaid Chriſel, thinking he had praiſed her extravagantly, and aſtoniſhed to ſee with what an air of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028733_0082_0FDBE7D81EBD6280"/>
and diſdain ſhe received his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—And ſo, ſaid he, you are a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and is not flattery agreeable.</p>
            <p>Is that your flattery: you think me ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, perhaps?</p>
            <p>Ugly! I juſt now ſaid you are the moſt delightful creature I ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>You are fantaſticle indeed, Sir, but it matters not; for, I value Simple Honeſty.</p>
            <p>You have a deal of penetration indeed, Sir,</p>
            <p>I am ſure at leaſt you have plenty of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity.</p>
            <p>Lord, Sir, ſincerity, I never ſpeak truth; it is all an air I aſſume to impoſe upon you.</p>
            <p>Chriſel could not ſtifle a laugh, and Aſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma turning towards Philamir, ſaid, Why are you ſo very ſilent, my Lord?</p>
            <p>Why do you aſk?</p>
            <p>As I would wiſh to make a conqueſt of you.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſay I ever met a lady ſo ſingular.</p>
            <p>And you delight me exceedingly; I dare ſay you have ſtrong paſſions, and are eaſily impoſed on.</p>
            <p>I have been in love.</p>
            <p>Very childiſhly I doubt not. Are you deeply ſmitten?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:028733_0083_0FDBE826E533A6B0"/>Deeply, and on my ſucceſs my happineſs depends.</p>
            <p>No doubt—and it makes me happy.</p>
            <p>Why ſo?</p>
            <p>I like vaſtly to ſet lovers at variance. Is your miſtreſs here?</p>
            <p>Yes.</p>
            <p>I'll ſeek her out, and if ſhe is handſome enough to pique my vanity, will render you faithleſs. I ſhall walk this evening in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range-Grove; and I tell you ſo expreſsly, that you may come and meet me there. So ſaying, ſhe roſe, and Philamir going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her, ſaid, Do not you ſee by my air of affectation, I want to make you believe I think you a dangerous man, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhun you?</p>
            <p>She then very modeſtly retired.</p>
            <p>This lady, ſaid Chriſel, is really the moſt extraordinary and odd kind of perſon I ever met. Women are all coquettes and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but ſhe is the only one I have ever ſeen who was indiſcreet enough to own it; her wiſh to ſeduce, and her exceſſive impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, make her truly whimſical and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. Were I in your place, my Lord, I would not neglect to meet her.</p>
            <p>Is that your real opinion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:028733_0084_0FDBE7D9A48B6478"/>Certainly—would you be ſo ſcrupulous becauſe you are in love with Zeolide?— Childiſh-folly!</p>
            <p>What, replied Philamir, would it be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical to turn the brain of ſuch a coquetiſh girl as her?</p>
            <p>I doubt not, if you manage prudently.</p>
            <p>I have no ſuch plan—Yet I have a wiſh to attend the appointment.</p>
            <p>The ſudden appearance of Palmis inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the converſation; ſhe had not yet an opportunity of ſpeaking alone with Chriſel, therefore, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and the Prince left them together. Palmis was agitated; ſhe dreaded to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her lover; and Chriſel, thinking about ſomething elſe, did not remark her perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. At laſt Palmis, fetching a deep ſigh, ſaid, Why are you ſilent, Chriſel? Are you thinking of me?</p>
            <p>No ſooner did he hear the queſtion, than aſſuming the moſt paſſionate manner poſſible, and tenderly kiſſing the hand of Palmis, Chriſel replied, Oh! no, I never think or trouble myſelf about you, I proteſt I do not.</p>
            <p>How! Faithleſs man, cried Palmis.</p>
            <p>Do you doubt my truth? Ah, Palmis, how unjuſt you are. Yes, ſaid he, falling
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028733_0085_0FDBE82861D4A118"/>
on his knees, it has been my ſtudy to deceive you. Ambition and vanity alone have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached me to you. Do juſtice, Palmis, to your Lover, for he is incapable of affection; be comforted, be ſecure, and let theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere proteſtations drive all doubts from your mind.—But why is anger ſo viſible in your looks?—How have I offended you? And wherefore to-day will you not believe me? —Do you wiſh me to ſwear?—Oaths coſt me nothing.</p>
            <p>Wretch, cried Palmis, I can liſten no longer.</p>
            <p>Tears impeded ſpeech, and overwhelmed with exceſſive grief, ſhe ſunk on a garden-ſeat; Chriſel ſtill kneeling, feigned to weep. Do not you ſee, ſaid he, how I pretend to ſhed tears: really, beauteous Palmis, you quite weary me, and though you are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as unreaſonable as inſipid, I never before ſaw you ſo intolerably tireſome.</p>
            <p>Begone, ſaid Palmis, repelling Chriſel with indignation, you give me horror.</p>
            <p>There is, certainly, ſaid Chriſel, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I cannot underſtand in all this: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſaid he, with an air of freedom, you wiſh to break with me; if ſo, ſpeak; there is no neceſſity for all theſe tears, this tragic
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028733_0086_0FDBE7DE049DB788"/>
tone; let us remain friends at leaſt; and this I wiſh becauſe your credit and favour may yet be uſeful to make my fortune.</p>
            <p>Palmis made no other anſwer, than by riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with impetuoſity; and as ſhe flew from him, darted a look of contemptuous rage at Chriſel.</p>
            <p>The Courtier ſtood confounded, and as he reflected on this ſtrange adventure, heard a tumult of voices. He walked towards the noiſe, and entered into a verdant Amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre full of paſſengers newly arrived, to the number of about thirty, ſitting on the graſs-banks, and forming a circle round Gelanor. Chriſel, as he entered, aſked why they were all aſſembled;</p>
            <p>My Lord, ſaid Gelanor, for theſe nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years I have done the honours of this Caſtle; have neglected nothing to make it agreeable to ſtrangers, and have only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired one thing in return, which is, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to this place, and anſwer a ſingle queſtion which I put to each perſon.</p>
            <p>And what queſtion is that, pray?</p>
            <p>I only deſire to know if they are happy.</p>
            <p>Well, and have you found many people ſatisfied with their condition?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:028733_0087_0FDBE82E71187F28"/>Their names are all written in a book, and I am ſtill at the firſt page; but alas! we ought not to wonder at this, ſince virtue and reaſon alone can give happineſs.</p>
            <p>Have you begun your Catechiſm of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day?</p>
            <p>Yes; I have queſtioned nearly half this aſſembly. Will you, Sir, be kind enough to anſwer me?</p>
            <p>Oh, willing. I have been very ſucceſsful at Court, made a great fortune, ruined half a ſcore women, who all before they knew me had excellent reputations; and yet I am not happy, am weary of myſelf, enjoy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but wiſh for what I do not poſſeſs, with an ardour that conſumes me.</p>
            <p>Let us paſs on to another, ſaid Gelanor. What ſay you, grave ſtranger? addreſſing himſelf to a little olive-coloured man with a diſdainful air.</p>
            <p>I am called a Philoſopher, ſaid the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in an imperious and dogmatic tone.</p>
            <p>Then, comrade, anſwered Gelanor, ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you are happy.</p>
            <p>I happy! no indeed.</p>
            <p>And what prevents you?</p>
            <p>Pride. I aſſociate myſelf with ſome others like myſelf, and among us we have formed
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028733_0088_0FDBE7E0AB470290"/>
a vaſt and hardy project. We wiſhed to reign and domineer over the minds of men; and we had a celebrated Magician for a Chief, who gave us a Taliſman, on which were engraven theſe three words, <hi>Benevolence Tolerance, Philoſophy.</hi> My friend, ſaid the Magician, the virtue of theſe three words is ſuch, that to obtain your end, you have only inceſſantly to repeat them, and reſt faithfully attached and ſubmiſſive to your chief. With this Taliſman and my protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you will want neither knowledge nor genius; you may daringly ſay, and write all the extravagancies which ſhall enter your imagination, you ſhall have an excluſive au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to reaſon wrong; be inconſiſtent, trouble eſtabliſhed order, overturn moral principles and corrupt manners, without loſing your conſequence; if you are attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed make no reply, beware of diſcuſſion. I permit inſults only, and declamations void of meaning, but no reaſoning; keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly repeating the ſame thing, <hi>Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Tolerance Philoſophy.</hi> Should it be proved you are neither benevolent, tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, nor a Philoſopher, be not frightened, only repeat and cry with more force and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy than ever, theſe three ſacred and
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028733_0089_0FDBE82FDAEF66A8"/>
magic words, <hi>Benevolence, Tolerance, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,</hi> and you ſhall triumph over all your enemies, at leaſt as long as I ſhall live. So ſpoke this great enchanter, and his promiſes had their full effect; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alas! we have had the misfortune to loſe a chief ſo worthy of our regret; and ſince his death, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſman has loſt its virtue, and our empire is no more. Uſurpers as we are, our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans are vanquiſhed, we can excite no more confuſions and are now forgotten.</p>
            <p>This ſpeech the aſſumed Philoſopher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a ſigh.</p>
            <p>Zoram, one of Phanor's Courtiers, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the company: hold, cried Chriſel, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to Gelanor, if you want to find a happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man interrogate this, whoſe mirth is ſo great it approaches folly, amuſing himſelf with every thing, enthuſiaſtic, and whimſical—Is it not ſo?</p>
            <p>Such are my pretenſions, he replied.</p>
            <p>Pretenſions! Are you not diſtractedly fond of hunting, painting, muſic,—</p>
            <p>I am fatigued with hunting; the beſt mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic in the world to me is only noiſe, and I have no taſte for painting; but I keep hounds, hire muſicians, and buy pictures;
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028733_0090_0FDBE7E226111E00"/>
that is, I ruin myſelf, to make the world ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I am entertained and pleaſed.</p>
            <p>But come, no joaking, ſay ſeriouſly.</p>
            <p>This ſatisfies me, replied Gelanor; and now let me queſtion this Lady, who is ſitting in the midſt of that agreeable group of children and young Ladies. You are the mother of a family, madam, ſaid Gelanor.</p>
            <p>My children are theſe around.</p>
            <p>And are you happy?</p>
            <p>Say, my children, the queſtion is for you.</p>
            <p>When ſhe had ſpoken, her two eldeſt daughters, with tears of joy in their eyes, ran to her arms with the moſt tender ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſions of gratitude; and crying, with all our hearts we love her.</p>
            <p>And have I this day beheld a happy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;—Say Madam, your name?</p>
            <p>Eudemonia.</p>
            <p>Pray favour me with anſwers to a few queſtions. How long have you enjoyed the pure and affecting happineſs, of which you now preſent ſo enchanting a picture?</p>
            <p>Since I have been a mother.</p>
            <p>How do you live?</p>
            <p>Very retired; my children occupy my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention one half of the day; friendſhip and ſtudy the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:028733_0091_0FDBE8345DC9EA60"/>Are your friends numerous?</p>
            <p>They are not; but they are faithful.</p>
            <p>Are you poſſeſſed of great riches?</p>
            <p>I am not; nor ever ſhall.</p>
            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>I have no taſte for pomp; and know no other uſe for money, but to diſtribute.</p>
            <p>Are you very ambitious?</p>
            <p>No, indeed; not even for my children; for reaſon and experience have taught me, honours and wealth are not the ſource of happineſs.</p>
            <p>The Philoſopher took his book from his pocket, and with inexpreſſible joy in his countenance, inſcribed Eudemonia's name.</p>
            <p>Zoram and Chriſel quitted the garden, and went towards the Caſtle; the little Court of the Genius aſſembled in the Saloon; Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus the ſatiric and ſurly Courtier, already mentioned was ſpeaking to the Queen, who was ſurpriſed to find that he had loſt ſo much of his moroſeneſs; that his manners were more mild, and that he could ſay obliging things. Zoram and Chriſel entered the Saloon; the Princeſs was going to her muſic, and turning her harp, Philamir ſat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide her, and the ſorrowful unhappy Palmis leaned languiſhingly againſt a pillar, thought
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028733_0092_0FDBE7E5640F79D0"/>
of the perfidious Chriſel, and was mournful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilent. Chriſel approached Phanor, who was thoughtfully walking. Being deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of ſaying ſomething civil of the Queen, he followed the Genius, and as ſoon as he was near enough Altemira to be heard, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and with a look of great complaiſance, addreſſing himſelf to the Genius, ſaid, how much the Queen ſhews her age to-day; it is not poſſible to think that ſhe is leſs than thirty-eight at leaſt.</p>
            <p>The Queen, though ſtill beautiful, was no longer vain of her perſon, but ſmiled. You flatter ſometimes Chriſel.</p>
            <p>That was my inclination at preſent, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</p>
            <p>Does my dreſs pleaſe you?</p>
            <p>I diſlike it much; it does not ſuit your age.</p>
            <p>Then with a moſt obliging and gentle tone and manner, Chriſel, quite ſatisfied with himſelf, and with what he had ſaid, made his obeiſance and returned to the Genius.</p>
            <p>Zoram went up to Palmis, and, deſirous of awakening her from her reverie, by incit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreeable ideas in her mind, ſaid, Good God! madam, your eyes are ſunk in your head, and how red your noſe is; you do not
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028733_0093_0FDBE835DEA65428"/>
look handſome to-day at all. Nay, do not affect that diſdainful air, nor think what I ſay is flattery to deceive; believe me, it is the truth.</p>
            <p>Zeolide was ſitting, and preluding on her inſtrument; Zoram, in order to maintain his reputation for a connoiſſeur paſſionately fond of muſic, haſtily approached, with every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of gladneſs. The Princeſs ſang, and accompanied herſelf; Zoram liſtened, and beat out of time, clapping as if he had been mad. Before the air was half over, he exclaimed, ſtill continuing his hand applauſe, How weariſome, and tireſome it is!</p>
            <p>The Princeſs was a little diſconcerted and ſtopped; I am quite delighted, madam, ſaid he to ſee you the dupe of theſe affected tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; it was to act tranſport, that I made this buſtle.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the courtiers were aſtoniſhed to hear him, and abſolutely ſuppoſed poor Zoram was mad. Chriſel, who was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly intimate with him, wiſhing to appear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for his misfortune, put on an air of tender amazement, and exclaimed, Poor Zoram how happy I am to ſee him thus! I ſhall gain by it; I will this very evening ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit Phanor for his place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="unknown:028733_0094_0FDBE7E65E2E1EB8"/>And ſo, taking Zoram by the arm, he left the Saloon, dragging him away.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs then aſked her lover, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he, like Zoram, thought the air ſhe had been playing, inſipid?</p>
            <p>I was not attending, replied Philamir, ſomething elſe took up my thoughts.</p>
            <p>Zeolide bluſhed with vexation, and Ariſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ſaid, I, madam, have not loſt a bar of it, and I think the air a very good one, and I am in raptures with your voice.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible, Ariſteus, interrupted the Genius, what are you becoming a gallant flatterer?</p>
            <p>That I do not propoſe, he replied, but I am neither ſo frigid nor unfeeling as I appear; I am ſomewhat croſs and wiſh to be thought ſingular, for which reaſon I paſs my life in ſnarling and finding fault, entirely from a ſpirit of contradiction; beſides, I have made it a law with myſelf, never openly to praiſe nor flatter, but on important matters, and not directly.</p>
            <p>How now;—I conceive your meaning; Pray, did you never flatter me?</p>
            <p>I poſſeſs your eſteem, becauſe you believe I have not; yet love me, becauſe I really have; you believe, ſimply enough, that a
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028733_0095_0FDBE8375B96B2C8"/>
man with a gruff tone and blunt manners, cannot flatter; you are ſuſpicious of other Courtiers, but in full ſecurity with me; but flattery can take various forms, nor is there more than one way to eſcape its ſeductions, and that is to be inſenſible to them. You love flattery, and I give it you; I naturally hate it, and had you deſpiſed it, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have had this meanneſs to reproach my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with; but thus only could I obtain your confidence; if I deceive ſometimes, you force me to it; and had not you corrupted me, I never ſhould have uſed artifice; I feel how much I am debaſed, remember it, am enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at you, and regard you not, although your ſervant.</p>
            <p>Get out of my ſight, inſolent! cried Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, with his eyes inflamed with fury, let me never behold you again.</p>
            <p>Zeolide was ſadly affrighted at theſe words, ſhe haſtily roſe, and followed by Palmis, went into the gardens. Alas! ſaid Zeolide, I begin to find how fatal this Caſtle is; this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Ariſteus, who has done the State ſo many ſervices, is diſgraced and ruined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> —And have I any reaſon to be better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied? How did Philamir anſwer me? It was for him I ſang, yet he deigned not to liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028733_0096_0FDBE7ED59C8D868"/>
What then did he think of? Ah! had I only enquired—I ſay no more.— Oh, Palmis, judge what I feel.</p>
            <p>I ſee nothing you have to complain of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Palmis, coldly.</p>
            <p>What! the indifference, the cruel diſdain of Philamir.</p>
            <p>You are ridiculouſly ſuceptible.</p>
            <p>This is a ſtrange expreſſion.</p>
            <p>Alas! I have not the power to chuſe.— Pardon me, madam.</p>
            <p>You are not affected by my grief; I ſee you do not love me—Ah! no doubt, it is impoſſible for perſons of my rank to be beloved for themſelves. How unhappy am I!</p>
            <p>The Princeſs could not retain her tears as ſhe ſpoke.—You are unjuſt, replied Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is; do not calumniate human nature thus; if a Prince wiſhes to know whether the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes given him are ſincere, and whether he be really beloved, let him aſk his own heart; let him judge himſelf; if he diſdains flattery, and is capable of friendſhip, he may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he has tender and faithful friends.</p>
            <p>Well, Palmis, I deteſt flattery, and love you.</p>
            <p>And I, madam, have no friend in the world ſo dear to me as you are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:028733_0097_0FDBE83B48EF6250"/>Zeolide anſwered Palmis by kiſſing her with tranſport. Be certain, henceforth, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Palmis, your rank cannot injure the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents you are born to inſpire. In our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret converſations, your friendſhip and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence eſtabliſhes a perfect equality between us; you are amiable, and have a feeling heart; I daily receive new benefits from you, and inclination and gratitude are the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ties by which we are for ever united.</p>
            <p>Oh, my dear Palmis, cried Zeolide, how happy do you make me?</p>
            <p>You cannot now doubt of my attachment, replied Palmis, and yet I fear this Caſtle; remember, madam, that without condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, without thoſe delicacies and attentions which come from the heart, friendſhip could not ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>Zeolide aſſured Palmis, that nothing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after could ever deprive her of friendſhip and love.</p>
            <p>While the two friends were thus conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Philamir did not forget, that the coquette Azema had given him a rendezvous in the Orange-grove; and it ſeemed ſo curious and amazing to read the heart of a woman of that character, that he had not the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to reſiſt the opportunity; beſides, I am
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028733_0098_0FDBE7EF5B2D8500"/>
certain, ſaid he, Azema cannot ſeduce me; Zeolide will know nothing of the affair, and conſequently will aſk no queſtions. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reflection determined the Prince, and he immediately went towards the grove. Here he found Azema negligently extended on the graſs, and in ſuch a manner, as to leave a pretty foot, and the half of a pretty leg expoſed. Her eyes were down-caſt; ſhe ſeemed loſt in a profound reverie, and did not appear to perceive the Prince, who gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approached.</p>
            <p>Whenever the prince came up to her, Aze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma affected ſurprize, and got up—Have I frightened you, ſaid Philamir?</p>
            <p>I wiſh to aſſume an air of modeſty and ſurprize, I have been waiting for you above an hour, in the ſame attitude in which you ſound me; and I flatter myſelf, added ſhe, with down-caſt eyes as if ſhe was taken by ſurpize, my leg and foot were noticed.</p>
            <p>The Prince ſmiling, ſaid he had never ſeen any thing more charming, and Azema hid her face with her fan.—What is your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for that, ſaid Philamir?</p>
            <p>I wiſh you to ſuppoſe I am bluſhing.</p>
            <p>Pray what think you of me, ſaid Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:028733_0099_0FDBE83C9E7DC170"/>I am pleaſed with you, and wiſh to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate you.</p>
            <p>I wiſh I had not been pre-engaged.</p>
            <p>If ſo; what then?</p>
            <p>Why this would be a critical minute.</p>
            <p>Critical! ſay you, that is pretty.</p>
            <p>I have a feeling heart; I doubt I'd be in love.</p>
            <p>My imagination is warm, which will ſuit you—I know I'll captivate you.</p>
            <p>I am rather doubtful, you are ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now let you ſee my arm, and for that purpoſe I will take off my glove, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be warm.</p>
            <p>The Prince when ſeeing one of her hands, replied, how elegantly turned and white.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now pretend to be offended with the liberty you have taken, and pout, as you ſee; after which I will turn very ſentiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
            <p>She then drew away her hand with dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and turned her back on Philamir.— Will you be long in a pet, ſaid he?</p>
            <p>Juſt to draw your attention to my fine ſhape and flowing inglets.</p>
            <p>Entertained with her ſchemes, Philamir exclaimed, what flowing hair!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:028733_0100_0FDBE7F4397486D0"/>Philamir in fact obſerved ſhe really had fine hair, an elegant ſhape, and one of the prettieſt faces in the world. After a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's ſilence, Azema ſaid to him, if you had common ſenſe, this is the inſtant in which you would fall at my knees, at which I ſhould then appear agitated.</p>
            <p>The Prince could not withſtand the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity he had, to know how Azema would act tenderly, and accordingly did as ſhe deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—So! ſo! cried ſhe, and are you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered!</p>
            <p>Say, charming girl, what you now think?</p>
            <p>I am enraptured—The Princeſs I have ſeen and hate.—Oh! what will her vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be, when ſhe ſhall know I have robbed her of her Lover, for know it ſhe ſhall? and ſoon I will tell her of it myſelf, for it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light me to ſee her deſpair.—She is ſo beautiful, and ſo good, that they ſpeak of nothing here but of her bounty, charms, and virtue; but I will defame her; I will —if in my power her reputation ſhall ſuffer.</p>
            <p>While ſhe ſaid this ſhe was ſtruck with the indignation ſhe ſaw painted in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Philamir. What, Prince, ſaid ſhe, do you ſuſpect me of affectation? Think you there is any exaggeration in the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028733_0101_0FDBE84185F09970"/>
ſentiments I wiſh to impreſs you with?</p>
            <p>It were to be wiſhed, ſaid the Prince, riſing, that all the monſters of your ſpecies were obliged to ſpeak with the ſame ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they might only have the influence to occaſion diſlike and deteſtation.</p>
            <p>Saying this, he immediately withdrew, reflecting as he went on this adventure. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what ſnares, ſaid he, might curioſity alone lead a perſon of my age, from a wiſh to ſee how far ſuch a woman could go. I found myſelf kneeling to her; I deſpiſed her, was not her dupe, yet ſhe amuſed me; appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed charming; and had ſhe not diſcovered a ſoul ſo baſe and vile, Zeolide would for an inſtant have been out of mind.</p>
            <p>With theſe reflections, Philamir returned with melancholy ſteps towards the Caſtle, when Gelanor came from a Grove, and ſaid, Come hither, my Lord; come, and if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſtop Zoram and Chriſel from murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another.</p>
            <p>What is it you ſay?</p>
            <p>In paſſing two hours ago, acroſs the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, they mutually accuſed each other with madneſs; but meeting with a gueſt, who informed them of the virtues of the Caſtle,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028733_0102_0FDBE7F8B6040C78"/>
they were terrified to think what they had ſaid to the Genius and the Queen, and went privately to concert what meaſures were beſt to take. From this converſation they learn, that they really had no friendſhip for each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; each queſtioned, was forced to confeſs they had committed reciprocal wrongs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly and recently, till they reſolved to fight, and are at preſent within a few yards of us.</p>
            <p>Shew me where they are, ſaid the Prince, I will attempt to reconcile them.</p>
            <p>My Lord, replied Gelanor, you know not how difficult it is to effect an agreement in the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The moment the combatants were begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the attack, Philamir joined them. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get paſt grievances—be reconciled.</p>
            <p>Chriſel inſtantly ran towards Zoram with a good grace, who met him with open arms. Zoram ſaid, with a ſmiling countenance, I here vow everlaſting malice.</p>
            <p>Chriſel immediately rejoined, So do I.</p>
            <p>How! exclaimed the Prince?</p>
            <p>Notice his baſeneſs, cried Zoram; yet I have the ſame thoughts.</p>
            <p>Keep ſilence, and be quiet, I entreat you, cried Philamir; were it in my power, my Lord, anſwered Chriſel, to deceive, I would
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:028733_0103_0FDBE842A153E410"/>
trick the traitor; but we are forced to ſpeak what we think, and cannot conceal our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reſentment. I ſee it is uſeleſs to ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the invincible virtue of this Caſtle, for I am obliged to ſpeak truth. I, who have carried the profound art of diſſimulation ſo far, the fruits of ten years labour are now gone.</p>
            <p>The firſt attack was yours Chriſel, ſaid Philamir; endeavour therefore to ſay a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle word in excuſe to Zoram, who I am ſure will be moderate and eaſily ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould attempt it, ſaid Chriſel, I will only widen the breach.</p>
            <p>Fight we muſt, ſaid Zoram, honour would have it ſo; deign therefore, my Lord, to be a witneſs of the combat. I flatter myſelf, that at the very firſt wound, however ſlight it may be, you will run to part us. So ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they again drew their ſwords, and the combat began. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a few minutes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was touched in the hand. Stop, ſaid Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamir, it is ſufficient.</p>
            <p>With all my heart, replied Chriſel; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, my Lord, be explicit if you think it neceſſary. I am ready to go on. I am very much attached to life, but it is not ſo valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:028733_0104_0FDBE7FA9D0E6A60"/>Theſe are alſo my ſentiments, ſaid Zoram.</p>
            <p>Part then peaceably, ſaid Philamir, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hour is ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Upon this they went away, and Philamir returned towards the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Phanor and Altemira had juſt likewiſe had a moſt diſagreeable converſation. Altemira, notwithſtanding her promiſes could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to queſtion Phanor; and his anſwers had ſo ſurpriſed and angered her, that the Monarch and Queen almoſt came to an open rupture, they were not on ſpeaking terms, but in a very bad humour.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs ſeemed ſo reſerved and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant that Philamir feared ſhe had heard of his adventure in the Orange-Grove. The ſupper was far from cheerful; the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Ariſteus durſt not make his appearance, and Zoram and Chriſel ſhewed not the leaſt eagerneſs to make their court. Palmis, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed with grief, was ſorrowful and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; the Queen and the Genius were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a profound reverie; and Philamir, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by inquietude, trembled as he ſpoke to the Princeſs, who would ſcarcely give him an anſwer.</p>
            <p>The day following, the Prince who had paſſed the night in reflecting on his ſituation,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028733_0105_0FDBE848AF170DC0"/>
determined to demand an explanation from the Princeſs. He went therefore in ſearch of her, and as ſoon as he found himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with her and Palmis, he threw himſelf at her feet, and ſaid, Oh! pardon me Zeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide; I ſee you know every thing. I will therefore make a full confeſſion.</p>
            <p>What do I know, ſaid the Princeſs?</p>
            <p>The adventure I have had with Azema.</p>
            <p>I never heard of it, but muſt now have the particulars.</p>
            <p>The Prince now ſincerely repented his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, but could not retract; he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſatisfy the jealous curioſity of the Princeſs; was forced to own that Azema might for a moment have miſled him had not her baſe heart appeared.</p>
            <p>So then, ſaid the Princeſs, had you not been in this Caſtle, and could this woman have concealed the atrocity of her mind, and the corruptneſs of her morals, ſhe might have ſeduced you.</p>
            <p>Forget, cried the Prince, this momentary crime; my repentance is moſt ſincere; you I love, and you only.</p>
            <p>She haughtily anſwered, and I renounce you for ever, unworthy man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="unknown:028733_0106_0FDBE80038714F70"/>With theſe words ſhe run to her chamber where ſhe ſhut herſelf up with Palmis.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs upon this gave free vent to her tears, and a thouſand times repeated Philamir was an ungrateful faithleſs man, who ſhe would never ſee more. Palmis long kept ſilence, but at laſt was obliged to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Alas! madam, ſaid ſhe, what ſhall I ſay? were I not here, I might pretend to feel as you do till you would attend, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees become reaſonable.</p>
            <p>Do you think me unreaſonable?</p>
            <p>I do, madam.</p>
            <p>You have little ſuſceptibility.</p>
            <p>I have at leaſt experience.</p>
            <p>My regard for you is much diminiſhed by your notions.</p>
            <p>I vex and provoke you; I foreſaw I ſhould; you are under the dominion of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and I cannot uſe theſe arguments you need.</p>
            <p>I cannot bear this—But let me hear you attempt his excuſe.</p>
            <p>I would not be ſucceſsful at preſent, allow me to decline.</p>
            <p>I inſiſt on knowing your opinion.</p>
            <p>If you are determined, I think that in this affair you have not common ſenſe. Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028733_0107_0FDBE84A47B1B230"/>
is only twenty; a very pardonable curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, and not an intention to deceive you, led him to the rendezvous; that coquette is charming; he for a moment forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was wrong, felt he was, and repented. This is the only error love can reproach him with; he now knows coquettes, deſpiſes them moſt ſincerely, has a ſincere love for you, and deſerves to be forgiven.</p>
            <p>He never ſhall.</p>
            <p>And do you expect perfect fidelity?</p>
            <p>I do indeed—Love never can exiſt if not reciprocal and ſincere.</p>
            <p>You are right; and therefore is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of love ſo ſhort, it is not poſſible for a man to have as much delicacy as an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate and virtuous woman; and the moſt tender Lover muſt ſoon be diſcarded, if his miſtreſs has neither credulity nor patience.</p>
            <p>You think me whimſical, then?</p>
            <p>To an extreme.</p>
            <p>Have you not then pity for me?</p>
            <p>I feel for you; but when I compare your ſituation to mine, my compaſſion is not great.</p>
            <p>The lover of a coxcomb muſt expect no other.</p>
            <p>And thoſe who love a youth under twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028733_0108_0FDBE80169A871A8"/>
ſhould lay their account with greater vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations than you have yet known.</p>
            <p>What a hard hearted ſpeech!</p>
            <p>'Twas you led me on.</p>
            <p>I expreſſed my thoughts without intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to vex you.</p>
            <p>And you have done ſo very much, which I ſhall remember hereafter.</p>
            <p>I ſhall never forget your indifference.</p>
            <p>You have no juſtice nor reaſon in your arguments.</p>
            <p>You go too far, interrupted Zeolide; leave me; I expected conſolation, and you aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate my pains; be gone.</p>
            <p>Palmis vexed, retired without ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>Zeolide then melting into tears, Philamir has betrayed me, and Palmis loves me no longer. I have loſt them both at once— But my mother remains.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs compoſed herſelf, and went to the Queen's apartment.—Altemira was the beſt and tendereſt of mothers; Zeolide told her of all her ſorrows, and the Queen partook of her griefs, and even her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How guilty did Philamir eſpecially appear! He had forgot Zeolide for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but ſuch, ſaid ſhe, are men. Alas! did you know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my daughter, what confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028733_0109_0FDBE84E657DCF10"/>
I have torn from your father's boſom. —But Philamir is to me a thouſand times ſtill more inexcuſable; yes, my child, the greateſt wrong that can be done me is to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict thee; thy pangs are the only ones I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſupport with courage; they diſtract me.</p>
            <p>Dear mother, cried Zeolide, in you I find all the tenderneſs I experienced before we entered this Caſtle, you are the only one whoſe kindneſs remains.</p>
            <p>No, my daughter, there are no alluſions mingled with the affections of nature; a good mother cannot ſpeak more than ſhe feels, nor paint tenderneſs more paſſionate than her heart really feels.</p>
            <p>Overcome with gratitude, the Princeſs claſped her mother's neck, whilſt the tears of filial affection gladdened her maternal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and mitigated one another's ſorrows.</p>
            <p>The Queen and her daughter ſpent ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days in the company of each other; at laſt they conſented to receive the ſage and virtuous Gelanor. The Philoſopher incited a ſpirit of indulgence; the Queen admitted Phanor; Zeolide went herſelf in ſearch of Palmis, and the two friends tenderly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced each other. Explanations, however, in the Caſtle of Truth, could not diſſipate all
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028733_0110_0FDBE806EBA39D98"/>
the clouds that had riſen. Gelanor conducted Philamir to the feet of Zeolide. The Princeſs wiſhed to aſſure Philamir ſhe had forgotten the paſt; but was forced to tell him her love was ſometimes leſſened, and that ſhe ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerved a little reſentment and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. The Prince was grieved, and was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to own too he was ſomewhat vexed; and had it not been for the remonſtrances and advice of Gelanor, the two lovers would have fallen out again; but they preſerved appearances although it was impoſſible to bring them again to their former happineſs.</p>
            <p>Phanor having queſtioned Ariſteus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantially, learned, that if he had not been ſcrupulouſly virtuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had eſtimable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; at leaſt, that he poſſeſſed probity and real patriotic ſentiments.—In Chriſel he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a flattering and ambitious Courtier, but a faithful ſubject; and as for Zoram, his foible was not wickedneſs, but folly.</p>
            <p>Be conducted by my advice, ſaid Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to the Genius; treat theſe courtiers with indulgence, but grant them no more a blind confidence; let them henceforth find the only means to obtain your favour is by rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and virtue, and they will become new men. When Monarchs have arrived at an
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028733_0111_0FDBE84F5D6CCE70"/>
age of maturity, and towards the end of their reign, they are then the real formers of Courtiers, and they are either good or bad as the monarch trains them.</p>
            <p>The Genius took his advice, and recalled his three Courtiers, who had been ſhut up in a corner of the Caſtle; but ſociety was no longer agreeable; no perſon durſt open his lips, leſt he ſhould ſay ſomething imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; and when forced to break this obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſilence, trembled as he ſpoke, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom uttered a word which was not either ill-timed or offenſive. All execrated the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and the only pleaſure they could find in it was, to entertain themſelves with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrangers they ſaw.</p>
            <p>One night the Prince, more diſcontented with Zeolide, and ſorrowful than ordinary, went to ſeek Gelanor, and relate his new cauſe with grief. He had never been in the apartment of this venerable old man, but was conducted thither by an attendant. As ſoon as he came to the door, he opened it, entered, and ſaw a young beautiful lady, in long mourning robes, ſitting by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's ſide, holding a book, and reading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud. Gelanor appeared embarraſſed at the ſight of the Prince; Philamir ſurpriſed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028733_0112_0FDBD690AABE71A0"/>
towards the handſome lady, enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if ſhe was lately come.</p>
            <p>It is ſix weeks, my Lord, ſince I came.</p>
            <p>Impoſſible! ſix weeks! and no body yet mentioned your name; you have no doubt, lived concealed; it is not elſe poſſible you could have been ſecret.</p>
            <p>Society I am forced to ſhun, and I am fond of ſolitude: I ſee no perſon here but Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, to whom I liſten, by whom I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and theſe are all my enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Mirza, ſaid Gelanor, the Prince wiſhes to ſpeak to me.</p>
            <p>I am in no hurry, ſaid Philamir.</p>
            <p>But I do not wiſh to loſe him; pleaſe leave us, Mirza.</p>
            <p>She immediately, laying the book on the table, modeſtly curtſied, and retired.</p>
            <p>A charming lady, indeed! ſaid the Prince, grace and modeſty—Why is ſhe in weeds?</p>
            <p>She is a widow.</p>
            <p>How long?</p>
            <p>Only about a month; her huſband was very diſtreſſed when he came.</p>
            <p>I doubt not beauty is not her only quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.—</p>
            <p>Why do you not ſpeak?</p>
            <p>Why do you enquire?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:028733_0113_0FDBE853A7BECE00"/>Nothing but curioſity.</p>
            <p>Be careful of curioſity; you are young, and know not whither it may lead you.</p>
            <p>My curioſity is harmleſs—But ſay, as to her mental Qualifications—</p>
            <p>She has many.</p>
            <p>Every perfection?</p>
            <p>Was it to talk of her you came hither?</p>
            <p>Any thing elſe I had to ſay was of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence —A repetition of old griefs. I am diſcontented; Zeolide is no longer the ſame; her temper is quite altered, vexed, irritated at nothing—Her reproaches are eternal—I I am tired of all this—Mirza has an air of ſuch mildneſs, ſuch modeſty—Is ſhe cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at times.</p>
            <p>What is the cauſe of that queſtion?—Let us ſpeak of the Princeſs; for never ſince I have inhabited the Caſtle of Truth, have I read a heart more noble, more pure, more loving than hers.</p>
            <p>Was ſhe very fond of her huſband?</p>
            <p>Huſband!—Of whom do ye ſpeak?</p>
            <p>Mirza.</p>
            <p>Indeed, Philamir, you are unworthy of the heart of the moſt charming Princeſs on earth.—What a difference there is between your ſentiments and thoſe of Zeolide! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028733_0114_0FDBE80BDCB88618"/>
all the men here aſſembled, and many of them are amiable, Zeolide ſees only you; all eyes are fixed on her, and I know two or three Princes who love her to diſtraction; Zeolide only is ignorant of their regard, or pays no attention to it.</p>
            <p>Sure, replied the Prince, I love none but Zeolide; and as I ſhould certainly excite her jealouſy, were I to ſee Mirza again, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to come hither again no more</p>
            <p>The Philoſopher much commended this intention, which the Prince kept punctually.</p>
            <p>Philamir left Gelanor, and viſited Palmis, for whom he had conceived a great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Palmis had not the delicacy of Zeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide, conſequently could not always in her heart approve her manner of thinking. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to ſpeak as ſhe thought, when Philamir complained of Zeolide, Palmis, though with regret, could not avoid owning Zeolide was rather ſtrict.</p>
            <p>While they were thus converting together, Zeolide unexpectedly entered. The Prince and Palmis bluſhed—And I diſturb you it ſeems, ſaid the Princeſs.</p>
            <p>You do, ſaid Palmis.</p>
            <p>Tell me of whom were you ſpeaking?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="unknown:028733_0115_0FDBE8549E17C028"/>Philamir was complaining of your unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conduct.</p>
            <p>And what ſaid you?</p>
            <p>I agreed.</p>
            <p>And thus you endeavour to encreaſe his ill opinion of me?— Were I really capricious and unreaſonable, ought my friend to ſpeak thus? and that to—</p>
            <p>Remember, madam, we are in the Caſtle of Truth; could I ſpeak as I wiſh, my firſt care ſhould be to perſuade the Prince he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wrong when he thinks any way to your diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs could make no anſwer, but was vexed and ſilent. Philamir and Palmis durſt not venture a word. At laſt, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, heaving a deep ſigh, ſaid, you are really both of you very agreeable company!—Of whom are you meditating, Philamir?</p>
            <p>Of the beautiful Mirza.</p>
            <p>Who is ſhe?</p>
            <p>A beautiful widow, I ſaw with Gelanor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
            <p>And you are doubtleſs in love with her.</p>
            <p>It is Zeolide alone I love.</p>
            <p>You are deſirous to ſee the widow again?</p>
            <p>I am not: to my love I ſacrifice my incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to enjoy her converſation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="unknown:028733_0116_0FDBE811D13F2940"/>You ſuppoſe me jealous, then!</p>
            <p>Certainly.</p>
            <p>Is there no way of concealing my failings? Muſt you know alt my weakneſs?</p>
            <p>Here ſhe burſt into tears—Thus, cried the Prince, I never meet with any thing but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings and tears from you.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had he thus ſaid, ere he felt the effect they muſt neceſſarily produce in the heart of Zeolide, and fell at her feet. Zeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide rejected him with anger; your want of feeling, ſaid ſhe, is ſhocking.—No, you love me not; or, at leaſt you are incapable of love like mine—Are you not—</p>
            <p>I wiſh I could.</p>
            <p>You then confeſs you do not love.</p>
            <p>Do not oppreſs me, I have not your refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed feelings, but as I can I love.</p>
            <p>So, ſo—you only eſteem—</p>
            <p>I do not uſe the word Love, becauſe you have forbidden me.</p>
            <p>Yes, before we entered this Caſtle.</p>
            <p>On pronouncing theſe words Zeolide bluſhed and turned away her head, to hide her confuſion. Philamir ſmiled, and ſeized the hand of the Princeſs, which he tenderly claſped between his own. Zeolide drew back her hand; pray tell me, ſaid ſhe, how
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028733_0117_0FDBE859104C2E20"/>
it is poſſible, having only ſeen this <hi>very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful lady</hi> once, you are ſo very anxious to ſee her once more.</p>
            <p>Say not <hi>very anxious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſaid, that to me you <hi>ſacrificed</hi> this happineſs.</p>
            <p>Though I did, yet had I the liberty of chooſing expreſſions I would have choſen another.</p>
            <p>Thus not ſeeing her is a <hi>ſacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely; ſhe is amiable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> witty, and her company would have given me pleaſure; I regret it, and your jealouſy I eaſily obſerve.</p>
            <p>Say you, <hi>my jealouſy,</hi> cried Zeolide, with extreme vexation, what expreſſions! what language!—Yet, alas! it is too true; I have been rediculouſly jealous, I condemn myſelf for it, and were we not in this fatal Caſtle, you had not known it.</p>
            <p>A few days after this converſation, as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamir was walking, according to his cuſtom, in the Alley of Palm-trees, he perceived, at a diſtance, the beautiful Mirza, greatly agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated. She approached the Prince, and with a diſturbed and timid air, exclaimed, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, my Lord—I am in great diſtreſs —I have been ſeeking a pocket-book,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028733_0118_0FDBE859DFDE5728"/>
which I have loſt above this hour; did you ſee it?</p>
            <p>I regret I did not, replied Philamir, as you are ſo much concerned for its loſs.</p>
            <p>My ſecret is in it.</p>
            <p>Your ſecret, madam!</p>
            <p>I have been fooliſh enough to write down my feelings in that book—But I muſt ſay no more—Adieu, my Lord, and if by chance you ſhould find my pocket-book, deign to promiſe you will reſtore it to me, and, above all, open it not.</p>
            <p>I certainly will not, but ſhould I find it, where ſhall I ſee you?</p>
            <p>In this place at this hour to-morrow.</p>
            <p>With theſe words ſhe left him, and as ſhe went, twice turned her head to look at the Prince, who followed her with his eyes, and when he loſt ſight of her he ſighed.</p>
            <p>In vain the Prince endeavoured to find the pocket-book; he ſearched the gardens round and round, but unſucceſsfully. As, about noon, he was returning towards the Caſtle, he met the three Courtiers Ariſteus, Chriſel, and Zoram, all in converſation. Surpriſed to ſee them ſo intimate, he approached and complimented them on the occaſion. Ah!
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028733_0119_0FDBE87C5DD8B770"/>
my Lord, cried Chriſel, we are united by our mutual apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>How, pray?</p>
            <p>Treaſon againſt the ſtate would not have more infallibly ruined us—we cannot eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.</p>
            <p>What do you mean?</p>
            <p>The Genius has this night deſired us to attend the recital of a Play he has written.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it is a good piece.</p>
            <p>Alas, it is execrable. It is ſix months ſince we heard it, and made him believe it a chef-d'oeuvre.</p>
            <p>I underſtand your difficulty; Phanor has deſired you to hear it again, to judge of your ſincerity.</p>
            <p>No, no; he is perfectly ſecure, and that is the worſt part of the affair; he believes we have flattered him on every poſſible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but only this.</p>
            <p>Wherefore then read it again to you?</p>
            <p>On account of alterations; there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe two celebrated Authors juſt arrived, whom he intends to aſtoniſh and confound, by ſhewing them his work.</p>
            <p>He will be engaged with them.</p>
            <p>True, but it is neceſſary to cry and laugh at this infernal piece; which is impoſſible
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028733_0120_0FDBE85E69B542E8"/>
here, for it would be immediately ſeen whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the tears were fictitious or not.</p>
            <p>An Author might be deceived perhaps? Is there, in fact, a charm ſufficiently ſtrong to prevent an Author from being a dupe? Let us only be confident, my friends, and I hope Phanor will not be able to judge by our countenances.</p>
            <p>And beſides, added Philamir, his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be wholly directed towards theſe newly arrived Authors, who will ſpeak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apprehenſion, not knowing the charms of this Caſtle.</p>
            <p>My lord, you ſay well; and in order to keep them in ignorance on this ſubject till the reading is over, they have been taken to an apartment and ſeparate from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>Came they together?</p>
            <p>They did not; and as they deteſt one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, they are kept in ſeparate apartments.</p>
            <p>Phanor appeared and the ſubject was changed.—You ſpoke of my Play, did you not, ſaid Phanor?</p>
            <p>We did, ſaid Zoram, trembling.</p>
            <p>I know well you were not ſpeaking againſt it; for never ſhall I forget, how you were affected when you heard it firſt. To-day
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:028733_0121_0FDBE88342E466F8"/>
you will be ſtill more delighted, for I have made ſuch additions! ſo ſublime! our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors will be ſomewhat ſurpriſed, and as they do not know the virtues of this Caſtle, I am certain they will teſtify as much jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy as aſtoniſhment. Will they not?</p>
            <p>Your wit will incite no jealouſy.</p>
            <p>You think ſo, becauſe of my high ſtation! I aſſure you that is no impediment. About a year ago I read this very piece to a man of real wit, but who is himſelf a writer; well, Sir, he could not hide his jealouſy, his praiſe was ſo cold, ſo aukward, his perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity ſo great, and his ſufferings ſo cruel, he really excited my compaſſion. The vanity of an author is abſolutely unaccountable. As for me, I am juſt, and do not deceive my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Often in the courſe of my exiſtence, I have been deceived, but never on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; never was flattered there—And the reaſon is, it is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>The Genius's aſſurance and converſation made the Courtiers hearts ſhrink within them. After dinner, the Genius ſent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Learchus and Tarſis he was ready to receive them; and the former arriving firſt, Phanor interrogated him concerning Tarſis. I hate him, replied Learchus, though the
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028733_0122_0FDBE85FDAD961F0"/>
principle of my hatred obliges me to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; I wiſh to ſeem equitable; ſecretly I ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate, publicly I praiſe him, but in an artful manner; it is only to convince the world, not to do him juſtice.</p>
            <p>Notice that! ſaid the Genius, whiſpering Chriſel, with a ſmile of penetration: ſuch is the envy of which I juſt now ſpoke, and hence you may imagine how much I know of the human heart.</p>
            <p>Immediately Tarſis entered, and, after a moment's converſation, Phanor unfolded his manuſcript; the two authors placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oppoſite; Phanor thus proceeded.</p>
            <p>This play I muſt tell you, Gentlemen, is Capital.</p>
            <p>That information, replied Learchus, is cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary; a reading has ſeldom begun, till ſomething like this has firſt been ſaid; but you need not fear, my Lord, we ſhall none of us ſpeak a word of what we think, the higheſt praiſes will be ſhowered on you.</p>
            <p>Tarſis was aſtoniſhed to hear him: he could not conceive it poſſible to carry truth and indiſcretion ſo far.</p>
            <p>The Genius ſmiled—Yes, ſaid he, I can depend upon your ſincerity, and am well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured you will be obliged to praiſe what you
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028733_0123_0FDBE884A198DC50"/>
ſhall hear. Know then, Gentlemen, you will melt into tears during the firſt and ſecond act, laugh at every ſpeech in the third and fourth, and be aſtoniſhed to find the fifth ſo ſublime. The ſtyle is elegant and pure, the characters natural and well ſuſtained, the plot is artfully conducted, and the denou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inimitable.</p>
            <p>Honeſt indeed, cried Tarſis. Authors u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſay as much, but it is in a far-fetched and ambiguous manner. For my part, my Lord, I like your proud plain way better; it is at leaſt more comic, and may bring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty into faſhion.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge, replied the Genius, when I am at home, I cannot help ſpeaking thus undiſguiſedly; my language may aſtoniſh, but you will ſoon ſee, however, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing really ridiculous in all I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Phanor then began to read, and, as it was neceſſary to weep during the two firſt acts, the Courtiers took out their handkerchiefs and hid their faces. The Genius ſtopped al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at every line: obſerve, ſaid he, how profound is that reflection! how original that thought! how philoſophic this! and ſpoke ſo continually, during theſe interruptions,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028733_0124_0FDBE8645F53BAC8"/>
and between the acts, and praiſed himſelf ſo much, that his auditors had abſolutely no room to ſay any thing. The two authors ſeemed very attentive, and finding the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the handkerchiefs a very happy one, they made uſe of the ſame expedient and hid their faces. Phanor triumphed when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held all their handkerchiefs in motion at the end of the ſecond act. Come, come, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſaid he, the ſerious part is over, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now comes on.</p>
            <p>He then ſet the example, when he thought it was neceſſary to laugh. How humorous this is, how full of wit is that, cried he every inſtant; there are a few free ſtrokes, and ſome double entendres, but theſe are the taſte of the age, and we cannot make folks laugh without them; to unite decency and wit is too hard a taſk; and, for my part, I only wiſh to pleaſe, therefore, do not perplex myſelf about morality and good manners, but ſacrifice them without ſcruple, whenever I am induced either by a witty ſtroke or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting deſcription.</p>
            <p>That is nothing uncommon at all, replied Learchus, we do the ſame; it is neceſſary, however, for form's ſake, though a work may be ever ſo licentious, to ſcatter a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028733_0125_0FDBE889E489D608"/>
quantity of ſentiments through it, and moral phraſes; after the moſt free and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent traits, one is charmed to ſee an eulogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um on virtue; ſuch a thing is not expected in ſuch a place, but on that account the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe ſtrikes the more.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, replied the Genius, and you will find I underſtood this fineſſe; for my play ends with four verſes, which tell the ſpectators it has a moral purpoſe; though I can aſſure you, without ſeeking to raiſe myſelf in your eſteem, I had no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but that of diſplaying my ſuperior abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. Now for the fourth act.</p>
            <p>Muſt we continue to laugh, ſaid Tarſis?</p>
            <p>So, ſo, I underſtand you, Phanor replied; keep ſilence and attend.</p>
            <p>While he read the three laſt ſcenes of this act, Learchus and Tarſis ſeveral times endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to burſt into a laugh; and the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, reclining towards Zoram, ſaid, ſoftly, do you not obſerve? envy will not let them laugh, only from the teeth outwards; how the hag gnaws their hearts; this is much more flattering to me, than all the praiſes they could poſſibly give, for my pride is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually delicate and penetrating.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="unknown:028733_0126_0FDBE865173D14D8"/>When he finiſhed, the Genius roſe, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed his hands, and ſmiling, ſaid, theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen will now explain themſelves, and we ſhall then know what ye think.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I am perplexed.</p>
            <p>Indeed, ſo am I.</p>
            <p>I doubt it not, replied the Genius, in a rage.</p>
            <p>It is not eaſy, my Lord, to praiſe.</p>
            <p>For want of expreſſions, no doubt—this is the higheſt praiſe.</p>
            <p>How extravagant and wild is this?</p>
            <p>My thrid and fourth act are out of the common road; thus you ſee I did not exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate, when I told you you would find hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour abſolutely run wild. It muſt be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Chriſel, added the Genius, it is charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear all this ſaid in the Caſtle of Truth.—What think you, Tarſis? Why this ſilence?</p>
            <p>However envious, my Lord—</p>
            <p>Well now! cried Phanor, tranſported with joy; there Zoram, did not I predict? You hear he is devoured with envy.—But why ſhould I longer abuſe the neceſſity theſe poor people are under of ſpeaking what they think? I ought to be ſatisfied, and not ſeek to humble men too much to depreſs them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:028733_0127_0FDBE88B80D6E3B8"/>The Genius then ſent the authors away, converſed ſome time longer with the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers. He aſked no queſtions for he had no doubts; he ſpoke only of his own fame, and the vaſt ſucceſs his piece muſt have. So the Courtiers got off for a little terror.</p>
            <p>Whenever they got by themſelves, was I wrong, ſaid Ariſteus, to conceive hopes of eſcaping the danger? Every illuſion vaniſhes here, except vanity, and that is more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than all the Magicians. Love itſelf is not ſo blind as an author hoodwinked by ſelf-conceit and vanity.</p>
            <p>The day following the Prince went to the Alley of Palm-trees, where he did not at firſt find Mirza, but walked about expecting her arrival. After he had walked ſome time, he ſaw a ſheet of written paper on the graſs in a woman's hand; he read, and was amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find charming verſes, in which Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za expreſſed for Philamir a moſt violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—Oh! unhappy and amiable Mirza, cried the Prince, this no doubt is one of the pages of that pocket-book which thou didſt ſearch for with ſuch anxiety. The wind du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the night has blown it hither.—Alas! is this then the ſecret Mirza would hide from me? this is a diſtreſſing diſcovery indeed!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="unknown:028733_0128_0FDBE8669D27BEC0"/>She immediately came in view, Philamir flew to meet her. Oh! my Lord, ſaid Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, I have juſt found my pocket-book, but there is a leaf gone.—Heavens! what do I ſee, that very leaf in your hands— And have you read it?—Unfortunate Mirza! now is thy diſtreſs at its height.</p>
            <p>When Mirza had thus ſaid, ſhe fell on the lawn, and ſeemed ready to faint; the Prince, quite beſide himſelf, kneeled to aſſiſt her. Oh Mirza! cried he, with a broken voice, into what a dreadful diſtreſs haſt thou plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me? Is it poſſible, I am indeed beloved by Mirza.</p>
            <p>Harſh Philamar, cried Mirza, ſince you have read that writing, the ſilence I had impoſed upon my lips is uſeleſs; it cannot now conceal my weakneſs.—Yes, I adore you. Alas! you alone have taught me to know the moſt violent, the moſt imperious of all the paſſions; never ſhall I baniſh it my boſom. No, I feel it will follow, or rather precipitate me into the grave. Your's I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, your faith is plighted, death is my only refuge.</p>
            <p>Death! ſay you! Heavens! cried Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir, and ſhall I be the cauſe of your death? —Rather let—Oh Mirza! conceive the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028733_0129_0FDBE890731C80D0"/>
horror of my ſituation—my engagement is ſacred.</p>
            <p>Too well I know that, cried ſhe; and were you willing to break it, I never would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Zeolide is worthy to participate your happineſs. Love ſhall never make me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. Often has Gelanor ſpoken to me or the Princeſs, and intereſted me in her behalf; not daring to ſpeak in your praiſe, I liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pleaſure, to the eulogiums of a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo dear to your heart. No, Zeolide, I cannot hate thee, for Philamir thou ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loveſt.</p>
            <p>Glorious ſentiments; and do you not hate her!</p>
            <p>You could not be happy without her, therefore could my life ſave her's, I would give it.</p>
            <p>Mirza, Mirza! how you fill me with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment!</p>
            <p>Farewel, Philamir, my heart! you know I cannot forbear repeating, and remember, <hi>I ſpeak it in the Caſtle of Truth,</hi> I ſhall love you to the laſt breath of life. In this boſom you will ever reign, and over a heart as vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and pure as it is noble and affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate. Incapable of ambition and of jealouſy,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028733_0130_0FDBE86742F5A508"/>
I might have made you happy if—Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deareſt Prince, Farewel.</p>
            <p>Alas! cried the Prince, this I cannot ſupport—Oh, adorable Mirza! do you then mean to quit the Caſtle? I know your three months are expired, but three weeks I am doomed to remain.</p>
            <p>Inſtantly would I leave this Caſtle, repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mirza, were not Gelanor ill; but to him my attendance is neceſſary, and I muſt ſtay. I inſiſt, however, that you come not to his apartment; and I conjure you never to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide to any one, the ſecret you thus have learnt by ſurpriſe. You cannot utter a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but you can be ſilent.—Again, Prince, farewel for ever.</p>
            <p>With theſe words, Mirza ran with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme precipitation; the Prince would have held her, but Mirza, with a commanding and majeſtic air, forbade him to follow, and Philamir was forced to obey. The charms of Mirza's perſon and mind, and the admiration and compaſſion ſhe inſpired, did but too powerfully combat the fidelity he owed to Zeolide; his vanity too was moſt potently flattered: to inſpire love in the breaſt of a lady ſo heroically virtuous, was a triumph which Philamir could not
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028733_0131_0FDBE8916173EF30"/>
help feeling. Love muſt rob the beauteous and ſublime Mirza of life; the Prince could not doubt it: Zeolide might find conſolation. This was a reflection Philamir often made, yet he continued to love Zeolide. He thought the Princeſs much inferior to her Rival, but at the ſame time he found an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known charm about Zeolide, which Mirza did not poſſeſs. Zeolide attracted, inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and was deeply engraven in his heart. Mirza dazzled and inflamed the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but ſhe was far above him; ſhe did not enrapture but amaze.</p>
            <p>Afraid to diſcover the ſecret of Mirza, Philamir avoided Zeolide as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and perceiving how mortally he dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be alone with her, reaſon and pride e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually bade the Princeſs not ſeek a flying Lover. After ſo much vexation, ſo many inquietudes, torments and ſtruggles, Zeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide began to ſuffer leſs; ſhe had ſeen the vanity of her ideas, and love was nearly extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>At length the three weeks were at an end, and the day came, when Philamir was to quit the Caſtle of Truth. Before the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was awake, Philamir went to the alley of Palm-trees. He had a ſtrong deſire yet
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028733_0132_0FDBE86B05A03F20"/>
again to ſee Mirza, and had written to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure her once more to come, yet durſt not hope that ſevere Mirza would conſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his laſt farewel. How great was his joy, when he ſaw her ſuddenly appear. Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za teſtified the utmoſt ſurpriſe at perceiving the Prince. She would have fled, but was withheld by Philamir. Ah, my Lord! ſaid ſhe, I thought you had already quitted the Caſtle, and I came again to ſee this place ſo dear to me.</p>
            <p>You got my line then?</p>
            <p>I did not, my lord; what line?</p>
            <p>The Prince was vexed to think he owed the happineſs of ſeeing her again to chance alone. Every thing that gratitude or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs could inſpire the Prince uttered. Mirza wept, and diſcovered ſentiments ſo heroic, and at the ſame time ſo paſſionate, that the Prince fell enraptured on his knees, and could only expreſs his admiration by his tears. The Prince juſt at this moment hearing the leaves ruſtle, turned his head, but what was his aſtoniſhment and diſtreſs when Zeolide appeared?</p>
            <p>Zeolide, ſtruck dumb with amazement, ſtood ſilent; the confuſed Philamir durſt not ſpeak. At length Mirza, addreſſing herſelf
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028733_0133_0FDBE8989AD49760"/>
to the Princeſs, related her whole ſtory. You ſee, madam, added ſhe, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to reproach myſelf with. I do not fear, that even my Rival ſhould read my moſt ſecret thoughts; and I not only do not hate you, but have a lively ſenſation of what your feelings muſt this moment be. I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as much from your woes as from my own. Philamir regrets me, this cannot be denied; but it is you he loves, and were he to attempt to break his engagement to you, I would oppoſe his intentions. I am about to quit, and never ſee him more. The effort will coſt me my life, but to my love duty is ſuperior.</p>
            <p>Can it be, cried Zeolide, that a paſſion which reaſon cannot approve, may become thus violent in a heart like your's?—A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu, Philamir, continued the Princeſs, I reſtore you your freedom, and at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain my own; but renouncing you, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the married ſtate.—Be happy, and farewel.</p>
            <p>Stay, Princeſs, cried the diſtracted Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir.</p>
            <p>Begone, my Lord, ſaid Mirza, with languiſhing voice, go recover your miſtreſs and abandon the wretched Mirza! She no
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028733_0134_0FDBE86C9D7A43C0"/>
longer loves, I adore—O! that with my heart I could reſtore you her, ſince without her life is a burden.</p>
            <p>How exalted a ſoul! Yes, Mirza, you deſerve happineſs! Yet Zeolide!—I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine my own feelings.</p>
            <p>Cruel Prince! do you doubt between a woman who abandons you, and the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate affectionate Mirza.—Should you, now hope has entered my heart, ſhould you now abandon me, you will behold me expire.—Yet what do I ſay? Heavens! I am diſtracted!—Alas! I cannot in this place hide my tranſports.</p>
            <p>Let me away, you ſhall not leave me, nor ſhall the beſt of her ſex be by me devoted to death.</p>
            <p>What is this I hear! cried Mirza. Is life yet in view?—And will you love me?</p>
            <p>Philamir could not anſwer for his tears— away then, dear Prince, ſtop not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Fly from this Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Thus ſaying, ſhe tranſported, pulled the Prince along with her, who ſhed a torrent of tears. They approached the fatal gates of the Caſtle, when they were ſuddenly met by the venerable Gelanor: Mirza ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028733_0135_0FDBE89A5BC24AF0"/>
—Fly, Prince, fly this old man, ſaid ſhe; hear him not!</p>
            <p>Stop, cried Gelanor; you cannot fly— The gates are ſhut.</p>
            <p>Mirza, at theſe terrible words, turned pale, her trembling legs ſcarcely could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her—Gelanor approached, and ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her by the arm—Perfidious woman, ſaid he, return <hi>the Taliſman,</hi> or I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deliver you to the vengeance of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor! Mirza did not heſitate a moment, but taking the <hi>box of cryſtal</hi> from her pocket gave it to Gelanor, who, turning towards Philamir, ſaid, Now liſten to that woman, for whom you have ſacrificed Zeolide; ſpeak, Mirza, ſpeak, I enjoin you, cried Gelanor.</p>
            <p>If it muſt be ſo, ſaid Mirza, I had but the maſk of virtue; ambition and vanity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, inſpired me with a deſire to ſeduce this credulous and ſilly Prince.</p>
            <p>Begone, ſaid the Philoſopher, you have ſaid enough.</p>
            <p>She immediately withdrew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Prince, raiſing his eyes and hands to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, exclaimed, Wretch that I am! What have I done? Oh Zeolide?—Yet how could
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028733_0136_0FDBE8742A55EFB8"/>
I conceive ſuch ſentiments and ſo ſeemingly ſincere a paſſion.</p>
            <p>Do you know how that happened?— Pride—With a little leſs vanity you would have thought, however dangerous love may be, it is not a diſeaſe of which people die; you would have known, that not even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion ſhould obliterate a promiſe ſo ſacred.</p>
            <p>O my Gelanor! What ſhall I do! become my Mentor and Protector.</p>
            <p>You are not yet hopeleſs; the Genius is informed of every thing, and is this inſtant endeavouring to prevail on the Princeſs to grant you a generous pardon; he will come to ſeek you, when your appearance will be proper.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, ſaid the Prince, tell me how this Taliſman, which Phanor gave to the beauteous Agelia, could come into the artful Mirza's poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>It was ſhortly thus, replied Gelanor— When Agelia quitted the Caſtle, as ſhe came to the gate, ſhe took this precious box from Nadir, and gave it me. Gelanor, ſaid ſhe, I give you this Taliſman, on condition you never return it to Phanor; and that you lend it to women, as often as by this means you can preſerve them from any great peril.
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028733_0137_0FDBE89C1931C4A0"/>
Be you, henceforth the protector of the weaker ſex, in this dangerous Caſtle; and though you muſt deſpiſe the guilty, yet grant them your pity and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The amiable Agelia thus ſpoke, I received the Taliſman, and, conformable to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent intentions, have, for theſe eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, preſerved many wives from the wrath and reſentment of their huſbands. I ſent them the Taliſman, and they had too much intereſt to keep the ſecret, for me to fear the leaſt indiſcretion on their parts; each woman, with whom the box has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, returned it at departing; and to this day the ſecret has never been diſcovered.</p>
            <p>It is about four months ago, as I was walking in the gardens, I perceived a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful lady weeping. This lady was Mirza; who told me ſhe had arrived that morning, and learnt, by chance, the virtue of the Caſtle. I have a huſband, added ſhe, in a conſumption; he has but a ſhort time to live; I have made him happy but have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him; ſhould he interrogate me, his laſt moments will become dreadfully miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, e're he dies he may take ſome method to be revenged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="unknown:028733_0138_0FDBE875A5394430"/>Mirza got the Taliſman from me, and calmed her fears; and her huſband, about a month afterwards expired in her arms, bleſſing heaven for having given him the moſt virtuous of women for a wife. Mirza, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a widow, conjured me to leave the Taliſman in her hands till ſhe departed, that ſhe might preſerve her reputation, which an indiſcreet queſtion in the Caſtle might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive her of, when this precious Taliſman was taken from her.</p>
            <p>She appeared fond of me; ſhe was amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and witty, and her company was not without its charms. I felt, however, how dangerous ſhe might be to others, ſince with ſo much wit and beauty, ſhe alone had the power of diſſimulation. I therefore required ſhe ſhould live in retirement; and when you arrived, I ordered her to avoid you. Her ſecret was in my keeping, and ſhe found it neceſſary to ſubmit.</p>
            <p>I became diſtreſt, and ſhe, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of nurſing me, prolonged her ſtay. I ſaw yeſterday ſhe was agitated, and had my ſuſpicions, but ſaid nothing. The Phyſician had ordered me to keep my room a few days longer, which Mirza knew; but this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I wiſhed to ſee the Princeſs before ſhe
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028733_0139_0FDBE89D5C25E308"/>
went, who related to me the heroic ſcene which juſt had paſſed, I inſtantly ſought for Phanor; he ordered the gates of the Caſtle to be ſhut; and as the Princeſs was ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of Mirza's perfidy, we agreed not to mention the Taliſman to her; that you, my Lord, if ſo you pleaſe, may avail yourſelf of its virtues to re-eſtabliſh yourſelf in the love of Zeolide.</p>
            <p>Gelanor then gave Philamir the cryſtal box; and at the ſame moment a ſlave came from Phanor to ſeek Philamir, who, full of trouble and diſtreſs, ran to the chamber of the Princeſs.</p>
            <p>Whenever he ſaw her, he ran, flung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at her feet, diſcovered the deceit of Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, and ſhewed her the Taliſman which he had laid upon the table; by hiding this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and keeping that Taliſman, ſaid he, I might have perſuaded you I did not go with Mirza, and had reſiſted all her ſeductions; but though I cannot loſe you without the loſs of happineſs, I would prefer even that to deceit. Yes, Zeolide, I was ſeduced, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled; I no longer have the ſame blind and impetuous paſſion, which I felt before our arrival in this fatal Caſtle; but I love you, as I ſhall for ever love you; without
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028733_0140_0FDBE87B30AD6148"/>
you I cannot be happy, and it is from you alone, of all the ladies in the univerſe, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect happineſs.</p>
            <p>When he had thus ſaid, his lovely Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs gave the Prince her hand, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with tranſport. The ſentiments you diſcover, ſaid ſhe, are worthy, and all I wiſh; and did this Caſtle deſtroy no other alluſions than thoſe which nouriſh love, I ſhould not repent my having inhabited it; but the air we here breathe, is fatal even to friendſhip. Let us then away, Philamir, from this vile Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Immediately ſhe aroſe, and went along with the Genius, her mother and lover, to take their chariots.</p>
            <p>Juſt as they were about to leave the gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Caſtle of Truth, they ſaw, with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible ſurprize, the cryſtal walls take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colour, loſe their tranſparency, become opaque, and ſuddenly transform themſelves into porphyry and marble of a radical white.</p>
            <p>The ſovereign of the Genii appeared; and addreſſed the lovers thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Charm of this Caſtle is at an end; and a new Palace fitted for your reception; in which the illuſions neceſſary for happineſs are to be found. May the</hi> Caſtle of Truth

               <hi>imprint on your memory, the fatal effects of jealouſy, and teach you to ſuppreſs the firſt ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of fooliſh curioſity; may you ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the ſoft ties by which hearts are united, are Mutual Confidence and Mild Conceſſions.</hi>
