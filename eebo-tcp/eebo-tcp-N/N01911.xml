            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe Subject-Matter of the enſuing Diſcourſe is repreſented ſummarily in the foregoing Contents. And a little comparing of the Heads propoſed to be handled, with the ſtate of things amongſt the generality of them who are called Chriſtians in the World, will ſufficiently evidence the ſeaſonableneſs of managing ſuch a Deſign, or publiſhing Diſcourſes of this nature. Wherefore the things treated of being ſuch, as at firſt view will extort an acknowledment from all perſons not under the power of avowed Atheiſm, that they are of the greateſt Importance; the open Preſumptions and Security of the minds of many under the preſent decays of Light and Truth, both in their Power and Diſpenſation, rendering their propoſal and preſſing on the Conſciences of men, both ſeaſonable and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; there is nothing further to be conſidered about them; but only how the <hi>Author</hi> of this Treatiſe hath aquitted and diſcharged himſelf in the management of his Deſign: This by an unexpected Providence in the Death of a worthy Perſon who furthered the Publication of it, is required of me, with an Importunity
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002260_0004_0FDADEE3CA5C2150"/>
which I could not withſtand, to deliver my thoughts unto. For although the Treatiſe be ſuch in the whole, and all the parts of it, as needeth no Recommendation of mine, nor of others though of more weight and Authority than in any thing I pretend unto, nor perhaps will any thing that I can ſay contribute much unto its eſteem with others; Yet out of that reſpect which I bear to the worthy <hi>Author,</hi> in that great diſtance from us wherein the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God hath fixed his ſtation in's Church and the World, I was not unwilling in a few words to declare my Judgment of his Labour in this matter, if ſo be it might prove a means to further the reception and uſefullneſs of it in the World. The Apoſtolical Rule is, that in <hi>Doctrine</hi> the Miniſters of the Word ſhould <hi>ſhew Uncorruptneſs, Gravity, Sincerity, ſound Speech that cannot be condemned.</hi> And I think I may ſay without offence, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting my Judgment unto that of other Readers, that I have not ſeen many Treatiſes of this nature, wherein <hi>that Rule</hi> hath been more diligently attended unto. Whatſoever elſe the Author aimed at, it is evident that <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, perſpicuity, gravity</hi> in delivering the Truth, were continually in his eye; nor hath he come ſhort of attaining his Deſign. And whereas it is kown unto all, unto whom he is known, that he is a perſon of ſingular good Learning &amp; Reading, he hath in this Diſcourſe andoned all Addit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

betaking himſelf alone unto the Exerciſe of a <hi>ſound Judgment</hi> and Spiritual Wiſdom, in giving Evidence and Authority to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Truth, over the Conſciences of all who are concerned in theſe things. And as theſe are the principal, if not the only things, which in ſuch an endeavour are to be attended unto; ſo the particular <hi>Applications</hi> that are made herein of the Truths ſolidly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confirmed, unto the Conſcinces of Men and the Occaſions of Life, are ſuch as will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Author a Workmam that needeth not to be aſhamed. Wherefore the whole Diſcourſe being, as to the <hi>Subject-matter</hi> of it, of the greateſt <hi>importance,</hi> as to the <hi>Time</hi> of its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing <hi>ſeaſonable,</hi> from the preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and peculiar Temptations of the Age wherein we live; the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the ſpecial Truths inſiſted on <hi>ſtable</hi> and ſolid; the <hi>manner</hi> of Teaching and Inſtruction obſerved throughout, being ſuited unto the condition and capacity of thoſe who are moſt nearly concerned in it; I do ſtedfaſtly hope that it will, and ſhall earneſtly pray that it may, every may anſwer the Deſign of the worthy Author in an effectual Tendency unto the Glory of God, and the Good of the Souls of Men.</p>

This conſideration then hath cauſed me firſt to preach and now to publiſh the <hi>enſuing diſcourſes</hi> (ſuch as they be) for your ſakes. And this I do the rather, becauſe (tho' I cannot ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I know,</hi> as not having had ſuch a <hi>Revelation</hi> as he there ſpeaketh of, yet I can truly ſay, I have had many ſerious thoughts, &amp; expectations of it that I muſt and that very ſhortly too put off this my Tabernacle.

If that may in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be the effect of this publication, my End is attained.

            <p>I cannot commend theſe <hi>Sermons</hi> to you from the manner wherewith the truth is managed, or from anything of mine which doth attend them.

out</hi> your Salvation, and concerning theſe <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and ſecond Converſions,</hi> which even Chriſt's own Diſciples may ſtand in need of.</p>
            <p>Others of you (and to ſpeak the truth plainly to you) by far the greateſt part of you, (the more is my grief) amongſt whom I have for thus many years been preaching the Goſpel of the Kingdom, are to this day in a natural <hi>iregenerate eſtate</hi>; Do you conſider what is here ſaid concerning <hi>the abſolute neceſſity of a true Converſion unto God in Chriſt, and the exceeding danger of living unprofitably under the means of Grace, and that God</hi>'s <hi>Spirit may ſoon give you over and then you are undone.</hi> Yea let all of you conſider and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that <hi>Chriſt knocketh at your doors; and that precious time ſhould be redeemed,</hi> and that ſtrait is the Gate and narrow is the Way, which leadeth unto life, <hi>and few there be that find it.</hi>

            <p>And as the ſence of my own mortality drew me both to publiſh and preach theſe <hi>Sermons</hi>; ſo likewiſe the ſame thing cauſeth me at this time, and in this way to ſpeak a few ſolomn words to you, and to leave them upon Record among you.</p>
            <p>The firſt word that I would ſay to you is this, <hi>for that little time which I ſhall continue with you, let me have the help of your fervent and conſtant Prayers.</hi> I believe you will all acknowledge, that my cloſing with your deſires (which I withſtood for divers years
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:002260_0012_0FDADEEF06B5B278"/>
together) in coming under that dreadful bond of Office-Relation, was the return and anſwer of your Prayers, yea of your extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Seekings unto God about that matter; and I doubt not but you will all lay, that my being delivered from ſo great a death as that which above two years ago I was under the Sentence of, is alſo an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that God hath heard your Prayers: Now then the experience of the <hi>power</hi> which your Prayers have with God as it doth encourage me to deſire them, ſo let it engage you to continue them. See then (for it is your duty ſo to do) that whenever you fall upon your knees in your Cloſets to pray for your own Souls, that you bear me upon your hearts and make particular mention of my poor name before the Lord: what ſhall I ſay unto you? I might tell you that equity requireth this at your hands; for God is witneſs, and day and night ſeeth it, that I am mindful of you before the throne of grace, and that almoſt <hi>in every Prayer of mine.</hi> And I might ſay to you, that if you grant my requeſt herein the benefit will be your own, <hi>All things are yours</hi>; my Gifts (ſuch weak ones as they are) my Time, my Studies, all of them are yours, who are <hi>my dearly beloved, and your Salvation longed for.</hi> If Chriſt fill me, I ſhall be the better able to give out to you. The more of the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit that a Miniſter doth
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:002260_0013_0FDADEB259D18EE0"/>
receive from above, the better it is for them that wait upon his Miniſtry. Therefore deny me <hi>not</hi> if you expect your own Spiritual Welfare. But I will ſay moreover, that <hi>I need your Prayers</hi>; and therefore let me have them. You ſee and cannot but be ſenſible of the ſtate of the Lord's poor <hi>New-England People</hi>; Our Prophets and our Fathers <hi>where are they?</hi> It is ſad, but ſo it is, <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land hath of late been a grave of God's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.</hi> Therefore thoſe few that yet ſurvive, need ſo much the more the help of the Prayers of God's praying people; <hi>Pauls</hi> are departed, pray then for <hi>Timothies, Daniels</hi> are gone to reſt, pray then for <hi>Haggai</hi>'s and <hi>Zacharies,</hi> that do ſucceed; <hi>Moſes</hi>'s are dead, pray that the Lord would take of the Spirit which was i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All the Lord's Miniſters need your Prayers, but none ſo much as he that is now writing to you, as being circumſtanced with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and temptations, which you little think of (but bleſſed be God that Chriſt ſeeth them) above others.

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nd. The Scripture which proveth it is that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1. <hi>The righteous is gathered
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:002260_0016_0FDADEF211C23420"/>
before the evil to come</hi>: was it ever known in any age of the World, that God <hi>gathered</hi> many eminently righteous men at once (as with us it hath been) into his Heavenly barn, but a ſad ſtorm was at hand? And I am verily afraid that this which I am now mentioning, together with the miſerable attendancies of ſuch a Calamity, is (at leaſt part of) <hi>the evil that's a coming.</hi> We know from the Scripture that the death or departure of the Lord's eminent Servants is wont to be a <hi>prognoſtick</hi> of Corruption in Religion, <hi>Deu.</hi> 13.29. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.29, 30. Again, when the Lord's faithful Miniſters have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued and diſcouraged, God is wont to puniſh ſuch a people with <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> It is <hi>Luther</hi>'s obſervation on <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>God</hi> afflicted the Churches in <hi>Galatia,</hi> the Church at <hi>Corinth, &amp;c.</hi> with falſe Apoſtles, was becauſe they were guilty of neglect towards their faithful Teachers. When the Jews rejected the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> God puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by ſending falſe Chriſts amongſt them; ſo when faithful and able Teachers are not ſo incouraged in the Lord's work, as it ought to be, the Lord a judicial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation ſends unto ſuch a people, ignorant, or prophane, or ſeducing Spirits, that he ſo may take revenge for the Contempt of his Grace offered in the Goſpel. Now if ever this were the ſin of a profeſſing people, it hath been the ſin of <hi>New-England.</hi> Beſides
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:002260_0017_0FDADEB54DC1B698"/>
all this it is a ſad Truth, that a Spirit of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a foreruner of Apoſtaſy &amp; Corruption in Religion, as the Scripture plainly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18, 19. I hear ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>that there are diviſions amongſt you and I partly believe it,</hi> Now mark his Reaſon, <hi>For there muſt be alſo Hereſies amongſt you.</hi> A Spirit of diviſion is a Prognoſtick of a Spirit of Hereſy, therefore, ſaith he, in aſmuch as there muſt be Hereſies, I am apt to think that the report about your diviſions is true. Hence alſo another Apoſtle, when he is mentioning preſervatives againſt the infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of error and Hereſy, ſaith, <hi>keep your ſelves in the love of God,</hi> Jude 21. becauſe that <hi>divine</hi> grace of <hi>Love</hi> is a notable means to preſerve us from the prevailing power of a Spirit of error and deluſion; and breaches of the Royal Law of Love are uſually puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this foreſt Judgment. Now alas the world rings with our diviſions. <hi>Many are the breaches of the City of David,</hi> which is one of the ſaddeſt Symptomes that can be; that this Calamity is approaching which you have been warned of. Theſe things I have ſpoken to you more largely in my Publick Miniſtry; yet I thought it not amiſs here again to mention them that ſo they might not be forgotten. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to his <hi>Philippians, To write the ſame things</hi> (which have been preached) <hi>to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is ſafe.</hi> And I am perſwaded
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:002260_0018_0FDADED101D64E70"/>
one Reaſon why the Church at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was ſo vigilant &amp; zealous againſt falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, was, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> had before-hand told them, that they ſhould be tryed with this Temptation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. with <hi>Acts</hi> 20.29. Now then being forewarned be forearmed alſo. And to that end let me add a third word which is this, <hi>when the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from you your preſent Teachers, ſee that you carry it with reſpect to the Miniſtry of the word as ought to be.</hi> Do not think it ſafe for your Souls to Live without Miniſtry &amp; Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which Chriſt will have to be, &amp; to continue in his Church even unto his Second Coming, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.28. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12, 13.

But ſearch the Scriptures and you will find that <hi>Ordinary Teachers</hi> in the Church were ever fitted for that <hi>great work of Teaching</hi> the Lord's people by a learned Education.

And as for the New-Teſtament Church, the Teachers therein have all along been Learned Men.

Miracle to make them <hi>underſtand</hi> the <hi>tongues,</hi> than that they ſhould be unlearned ſtill. Yea the truth is, that there never was any man eminently ſerviceable as a Teacher in the Church ſince the Apoſtles, except he were a Learned man. Antient (Fathers as they were called) who defended the Truth againſt the Heathen Philoſophers and the Hereticks of thoſe times, ſuch as <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Cyprian Auſtin, Hierom, &amp;c.</hi> were Learned men: And had ſome of them had more Learning in the Original Languages, it had been better for them, and for the Church of God; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many a miſinterpretaion of the Scripture would have been prevented. And as for the great Inſtruments of <hi>Reformation</hi> and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Calvin, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Malancton, Zwinglius,</hi> &amp;c. they were all of them very Learned men; wherefore believe not thoſe that would perſwade you; that Schools of Learning, Colledges &amp;c. are Antichriſtianiſm, or late Popiſh Inventions. Doth not the Scripture, before ever Popery was thought of, inform us of Schools of Learning? Do we not read of the School of <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> was once a <hi>Diſputant, Acts</hi> 19.9? and doth not the Old Teſtament ſpeak of <hi>Maſters and Scholars, Mal.</hi> 2.12. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.8. yea of Colledges. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 22.14. and in other places? The Jews alſo tell us of 3 famous Univerſities erected by their Fathers in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that ſo Religion
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:002260_0021_0FDADEB8A446D5B0"/>
might be preſerved among them. Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſtory informs us that great care was taken by the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors in the primitive times for the ſettling of Schools of Learning in all places, where Churches were planted, that ſo the Truth might be propagated to Succeeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>Magd. Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>and</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. And it is worthy the taking notice of, that the Intereſt of Religion and good Learning, have fallen together; the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth Centuries,</hi> are called the <hi>Learned ages</hi>; and then did Religion Flouriſh more than after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: but when Popiſh darkneſs overſpread the world, almoſt all good Learning was loſt with Religion. But when the light of the Goſpel did again break forth, about the ſame time did the Lord in his good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence revive the knowledge <hi>of Tongues and Arts.</hi> Hence the enemies of true Religion have been enemies of Learning. Some have obſerved that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> that ſo he might carry on his deſign of Corrupting Religion, did put down the Schools of Learning that were erected in the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> did again reſtore. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, that ſo he might root out the Chriſtian Religion, deſtroyed all <hi>Publick Schools of Learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to diſcover and ſcatter the falſity of their dark Religion. It concerns Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to keep their Shops dark, that ſo they may the more eaſily put off their deceitful wares. The Jeſuits in their private <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> lately diſcovered and publiſhed, Chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. have this for one, <hi>we muſt teach that Learning is needleſs in a Pariſh Prieſt</hi> (ſo they Jewiſhly term a Miniſter of the New-Teſtament) <hi>and that if they underſtand the Goſpel it is ſufficient.</hi> Theſe ſubtile <hi>Spirits of Devils,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> calls them, know full well, that if they could bring it to paſs; that there ſhould be no Learned men to oppoſe them, the World <hi>would</hi> ſoon be theirs.

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:002260_0026_0FDADEF778610F48"/>In the words we may take notice of three things: 1. The main Truth which is here affirmed, <hi>ſc.</hi> That Converſion is of abſolute neceſſity, in order to obtaining the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, <hi>Except there be Converſion,</hi> or (which explaineth the other) except there be <hi>a becoming as little children,</hi> even a <hi>Regeneration,</hi> &amp; beginning the world <hi>anew,</hi> as it were, except there be this, there ſhall be no entering into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. 2. We have here the Perſons unto whom this was ſpoken <hi>ſo</hi> the Diſciples of Chriſt; Except [you] my own Diſciples be converted, I ſay to [you] that [ye] ſhall nor enter: Not but that they were converted already; yet this may well be ſpoken, even to converted perſons, thereby to convince them further of the neceſſity of that Converſion which they had already attained. Alſo, becauſe though they were <hi>converted</hi> in reſpect of their <hi>state,</hi> yet they ſtood in need of a further Converſion in reſpect of a <hi>particular will,</hi> which they were too much unle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the preſent prevailing power of. And this ſheweth, that all men whatſoever are concerned in the truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered: For if it be true concerning Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt, that they muſt be <hi>either Converted, or not ſaved,</hi> certainly this is
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002260_0027_0FDADEC0ED87D2A0"/>
true, <hi>concerning all other men.</hi> 3. We have here the manner of the expreſſion. This Truth is not barely affirmed, but with a <hi>Verily</hi>; Chriſt doth not only ſay, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth it with a <hi>Verily,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Verily, except you be converted, you ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; which noteth both the certainty &amp; the ſolemnity of the thing expreſſed. This word [<hi>Verily</hi>] was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed by Chriſt, yet never but when there was ſome weighty and ſolemn Truth affirmed by him. The Doctrine therefore which we ſhall (by the Lords aſſiſtance) ſpeak unto from the words, is,
<q>That it is a most certain and weighty Truth, that a ſound, through Converſion is of abſolute neceſſity, in order to the Souls en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Kingdom of Heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the Doctrinal proſecution of this point, we ſhall attend two things, Firſt we ſhall lay down ſome Propoſitions for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; opening the Truth about Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, we ſhall demonſtrate the Truth by Argument.</p>

               </gap> The Explication of the Truth, may be ſet before us in ſundry Propoſitions.</p>

The words indeed may be rendred, <hi>Except you Convert</hi>; but this ſhaveth rather mans duty, than his power to Convert himſelf; I ſay, God and not man is the principal Cauſe of this work. Hence converted perſons are ſaid to be <hi>born of God, and not of man</hi>; becauſe not man, but God alone is the Author of Regeneration, <hi>John</hi> 1 13. therefore it was that <hi>Ephraim</hi> braved, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, Jer.</hi> 31.18. as if he had ſaid, Except the Lord turn me, the work will never be done. And God doth this by his holy Spirit, therefore a converted perſon is ſaid to be <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> John 3.6. and, <hi>born after the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 4.29 And the Spirit of God is called, the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> Heb. 10.29 becauſe all Grace, and eſpecially <hi>Converting-Grace,</hi> is from him: The truth is, that as Converſion is taken for the infuſing of a <hi>new Principle</hi> of Saving Grace into the Soul; ſo men are altogether <hi>paſſive</hi> in their <hi>Converſion,</hi> and the Eternal Spirit is the only principal Agent therein.

raiſe himſelf <hi>out of</hi> his grave, or is it in the power of men or Creatures to quicken thoſe that are dead? much more may we ſay thus as to dead Souls, that are buried in a grave of ſin, guilt and miſery: Yea, in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi> a Soul, there is a <hi>Converting-power</hi> put forth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. which ſheweth both that the Soul is paſſive in this work; and alſo that it is above the power of men or <hi>creatures</hi> to accompliſh. Creation is a bringing of <hi>ſomething</hi> out of nothing: Now in as much, as there is a kind of an Infinite diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Being and No-being; therefore an Infinite power is required, to produce a work of Creation. So it is in <hi>Converſion.</hi> Nay, that's harder than meer Creation: becauſe in the firſt Creation there was no oppoſition: But now when God enters upon this work of the <hi>new and ſecond Creation,</hi> there is what-ever reſiſtance all the powers of Darkneſs can make againſt him. Look, as it is an eaſier matter to make a new Glaſs, then to mend a broken one; ſo it is eaſier to create a new Soul, than by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion as it were, to <hi>make anew</hi> the broken, ruined Souls of men.</p>
            <p>Propoſ. II. <hi>The word of God is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental means of Converſion,</hi> Jam. 1.18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us, with the word of truth.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002260_0030_0FDADECAC1D7A630"/>
God is (as ſaid) the principal Cauſe, but <hi>the Word of truth</hi> is the Inſtrument and <hi>Mean</hi> in the hand of the Spirit, whereby this mighty and aſtoniſhing work is brought to paſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul.</hi> The Word of the <hi>Law, strictly</hi> taken, is partly Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and Influential to the Souls <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> For thereby is <hi>Conviction</hi> of ſin and miſery, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>By the Law is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin.</hi> If a man cometh to ſee and acknowledge himſelf to be a ſinful and miſerable Tranſgreſſor, this Conviction is by means of the Law. The <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> was a plain conviction &amp; evidence of the guilt of ſin. Hence it is called the <hi>Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing that is against us,</hi> Col 2.14. becauſe it was, as it were, a Bill of Indictment againſt the Obſervers of it: The Jews when they obſerved Circumciſion, did thereby confeſs themſelves guilty of Original ſin, which is the ſin of Nature; and when they offered any Sacrifice, they did thereby acknowledge, that they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be dealt with, as they did unto that Creature which was ſacrificed by them yea, to be made Eternal Sacrifices to; Infinite Juſtice. And the <hi>Moral Law</hi> doth convince of ſin When that in the holy
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002260_0031_0FDADEC54FA2CEC0"/>
nature and Exact purity of it, is brought home to the Soul, Conſcience is convinced and awakned thereby, with the ſence of Tranſgreſſion and guilt. Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>I was alive without the Law once</hi>: He ſpeaketh of what he was, in his natural unconverted eſtate; before the Law was effectually brought home to his heart, he was alive in his own conceit; <hi>But when the Commandment came, I dyed</hi>; when God ſet the Law, in the ſpiritual nature of it before him, then his Conſcience was touched indeed, that he ſaw himſelf to be by nature, no better then a dead &amp; damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed creature: Now <hi>Conviction</hi> of ſin is the way, and indeed the firſt ſtep towards <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verſion.</hi> But eſpecially the Word of the Goſpel is the great means of Converſion: Hence it is called, <hi>The Ministration of the Spirit, and of life,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.6. becauſe it is the means by which Spiritual life is conveyed to the Elect. The Law without the Goſpel will never Convert: Hence men that have been ſtrangers to the Goſpel, have been unacquainted with the <hi>Mystery of Converſion,</hi> all their knowledge in the Law notwithſtanding. The Gentiles, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Internal-Law written in the heart; and the Jews, notwithſtanding
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002260_0032_0FDADEFF51745688"/>
their knowledge of the External-Law, yet were ſtrangers to true Converſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew not the Goſpel in the power of it. The Law without the Goſpel, will but drive to deſpair, and ſo ſet the ſinner further off from God, but will never bring him home to God again: It is alſo true, that God doth many times bleſs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, Afflictions eſpecially, to help forward the Converſion of his Elect; but that is, by cauſing them thereby to mind and remember what the Word ſaith, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffliction maketh a ſinner to think of Chriſt.</hi> But how came he to hear of a Chriſt, or to know that any help is to be had for his Soul? This knowledge is by the Goſpel; ſo that ſtill it remaineth true, that the Word is the principal Means of Converſion.</p>
            <p>Propo. III. <hi>In true Converſion, the Soul is turned from Saten, the World, Sin and Self.</hi> In all changes, there is the <hi>term from which</hi> the change is: Now the Propoſition is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of <hi>the term from which</hi> the change in <hi>converſion</hi> is wrought. There are four particulars comprehended under this; we ſhall briefly touch upon each of them as we go along: 1. The <hi>converted</hi> Soul is turned <hi>from Satan</hi>; therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental towards the Converſion of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002260_0033_0FDC175DC1E99408"/>
Gentiles, he is ſaid to turn them from <hi>the power of Satan,</hi> Acts 26.18. and when the Diſciples were ſent forth to preach the Goſpel, &amp; thereby to Convert the World, <hi>Satan</hi> is ſaid <hi>to fall before them,</hi> Luke 10.18 Converſion is the ſame with effectual <hi>Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>: Now in Vocation, the term from which the Soul is called, is <hi>Satans Kingdom,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. <hi>He hath called you out of darkneſs</hi>; namely, out of the dark Kingdom of Satan. 2. From <hi>the World</hi>; therefore Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples after their Converſion, <hi>Ye are not of the World, I have choſen you out of the World,</hi> John 15.19. Sin doth carry away the Soul from God to the Creature; but now in Converſion, it is taken off from the Creature again; as we ſee in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.96 <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection:</hi> His heart was taken off from the Creature, ſo as he did not look for his happineſs there. The like we ſee in <hi>converted Paul,</hi> Gal. 6.14. <hi>I am crucified to the World, &amp; the World unto me.</hi> The World was as a dead object before his eyes, which is unlovely and undeſirable 3. From <hi>Sin:</hi> Oft in Scripture, Converſion is called, <hi>turning from ſin,</hi> Iſa. 59.20. Jer. 26.3. and <hi>a breaking off from ſin,</hi> Dan. 4.27. and a <hi>casting away tranſgreſſion,</hi> Ezek. 18.31. Iſa. 31.7. yea, it is a turning from <hi>all</hi>

the Lord,</hi> Deut. 30.10. Hoſ 12.6. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is an undoing the work of ſin; ſin is a departure from God; So Converſion is a going to him again. Hence the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Prodigal ſaid, he would <hi>go to his father,</hi> Luke 15.18. By theſe two parts, or terms, is the whole nature of Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſcribed; ſee <hi>Iſa</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts</hi>: Theſe words are expreſſive of the firſt part of Converſion; <hi>ſc.</hi> when the Sinner is turned from evil, and that not only as to his way, or outward converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in his own thoughts, and inward diſpoſition of heart; it followeth, <hi>and let him return to the Lord—To our God</hi>: Theſe words are expreſſive of the other and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive part of Converſion Moreover, this turning muſt be to God <hi>in Christ</hi>; for true <hi>Converſion</hi> is an <hi>Evangelical</hi> work; Though a man ſhould repent with a Legal Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and turn to God in a Legal way, this is <hi>no Converſion, if Christ be not turned unto and God, even the Father in him.</hi> The Jews did thus return, yet they <hi>Converted not,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſought God <hi>out of Christ,</hi> Rom. 9.32. Hence <hi>Converſion</hi> is called, a <hi>ſeeking of Christ,</hi> Hoſea 3.5. and <hi>converted</hi> Ones
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002260_0037_0FDADF0521D22C30"/>
are deſcribed to be ſuch, as are <hi>in Christ,</hi> Rom. 16.7. <hi>Paul</hi> there ſaith, that his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junius were in Christ</hi> before him, meaning, that they were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted before him; and to have <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27. Although there are many that call themſelves Chriſtians, that know not what Converſion means, yet <hi>a true Convert, and a true Christian,</hi> are the ſame: Converſion doth imply <hi>faith in Christ.</hi> It hath been a great Queſtion <hi>amongſt</hi> ſome, <hi>Whether Faith or Repentance be first wrought</hi>; and a great deal of diſputing there hath been about this point, which might have been ſpared. The true and plain Anſwer is, That as Repentance is taken for the firſt part of Converſion, ſo it is in order of Nature, before Faith, though in time with it: <hi>The term from which,</hi> is in order of Nature, before <hi>the term to which</hi>; but as Repentance is taken for the whole work of Converſion (as oft in Scripture it is) ſo it implieth Faith in Chriſt. You heard but now, that <hi>Converſion</hi> &amp; <hi>Vocation</hi> are the ſame. Now in Vocation, <hi>the term to which</hi> the Soul is called, is <hi>the Kingdom of Christ,</hi> Col. 1.13. This Text doth intimate, that Converted ones are brought into the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven</hi>; and it muſt needs be ſo,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002260_0038_0FDADF064A6C26E0"/>
becauſe in Converſion, <hi>the term to which</hi> the Soul is brought, is <hi>the Kingdom of Christ</hi>; now that is meant by <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> even the <hi>heavenly Kingdom of the Meſſiah</hi>: Chriſts Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Heaven, are the ſame.</p>
            <p>Pro. V. <hi>True Believers on Christ may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo a farther, and, as it were, a ſecond Converſion.</hi> This is plainly (and indeed a main thing intended therein) intimated in the Text: Chriſt here tells his <hi>own Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> that <hi>except</hi> they <hi>were converted</hi>: i. e. except there were, a new Converſion wro't in <hi>them,</hi> and upon <hi>them,</hi> they ſhould not ſee Heaven. There is an <hi>univerſal</hi> &amp; <hi>a particular</hi> Converſion: One in the ſtate of Nature, needs the former; a true Chriſtian may ſtand in need of this latter. This may be ſecretly hinted at by that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Plough up the fallow ground of your hearts.</hi> Fallow ground you know, is ſuch as hath been once broken up already; but by reaſon of its being overgrown with weeds and thorns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may need a further and a new breaking up. So it is here, they that have had their hearts truly broken up for ſin, may become <hi>fallow ground,</hi> ſo as to need that new furrows ſhould be made in their Souls: They may be ſo overgrown
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002260_0039_0FDAC983612D8F90"/>
with the weeds of ſin, as that the Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhare of Repentance muſt again break up their hearts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Converſion is ſometimes taken for a <hi>ſpiritual habit</hi> infuſed into the Soul, ſo it is not to be <hi>reiterated</hi>; for the habit of Grace wrought in the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, is never loſt. Sometimes it is taken for <hi>an act</hi> proceeding from that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit: Thus a man may be converted over and over again, yea, thus a Chriſtian is converting all his life long; that is to ſay, he is ſtill getting further off from ſin and the World, and nearer unto God in Chriſt; the life of a Chriſtian is and ought to be a life of Faith and Repentance. Hence even true Believeres yet are called upon to repent: So we find in thoſe Epiſtles which the Lord Jeſus ſent from Heaven to the Churches, they are commanded to repent, that is, to <hi>renew their Repentance.</hi> And this Truth is evident, in that a true child of God may be too far ſubject to the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of ſome ſpecial corruption, in which caſe, a new or further Converſion is requſite. This was the caſe of the Text; the <hi>Diſciples</hi> were under the preſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy of an ambitious Luſt, in a great meaſure, therefore the Lord tells them, <hi>they must be converted.</hi> The like we find
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002260_0040_0FDADF09D3D42FE8"/>
in that good Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſee <hi>chap</hi> 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, if thou return, then I will bring thee again, and thou ſhalt ſtand before me</hi>: You may ſee in the former Verſe, that the good man was ſurprized with a pang of Unbelief; and while the temptation and corruption prevailed upon him, he manifeſts much impatiency and murmuring of ſpirit: Now ſaith God to him, if thou wilt return from this evil frame of ſpirit, if thou wilt convert thee from theſe evils, then will I again make uſe of thee in my ſervice, <hi>&amp;c</hi> So that a very good man may be diſtempered with particular Corruptions, ſo as to need a returning &amp; converting from them to the Lord again. Yea, it is a ſad Truth, that a Godly man may poſſibly be under the preſent power of ſome Corruption, in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as that it is impoſſible for him to get to Heaven until that coruption be further mortified. This is plainly affirmed by the Text, Chriſt declareth to his Diſciples, that except that Luſt of Pride were further mortified in them, they ſhould not enter into Heaven. Some ſins which true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are guilty of, they muſt and ſhall repent of them before they go out of this World, that ſo they may be fit for Heaven.</p>
            <p>Again, Grace may be exceeding weak in a true Believer, &amp; in that caſe a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002260_0041_0FDADED4044D5180"/>
is neceſſary: Ordinarily it is thus with <hi>new Converts</hi>; in ſuch, many times Grace is very weak, and Corruption is very ſtrong; there is little Knowledge, &amp; much Ignorance; little Humility, &amp; much Pride; and thence a further Converſion muſt be. This we ſee in the Diſciples themſelves, a long time they were marvellouſly Ignorant, &amp; yet too full of Pride and other corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, there was a mighty change wrought in them; <hi>Then was that accompliſhed upon them, which here Christ ſaid must be, a new Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> they were <hi>endued with a power from on high,</hi> Luke 24.49. The Lord from on high poured his Spirit mightly upon them, &amp; thereby were <hi>they</hi> wonderfully changed; The change which was then wro't upon the Diſciples, was not much leſs, than that which was wrought on them at their firſt converſion; they differed from what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were afore, well nigh as much as at their firſt Converſion they were made to differ from other men.</p>
            <p>Again, True Believers may be under ſad Spiritual decays, and in this reſpect they may need, as it were, a <hi>new Converſion.</hi> This we ſee in the collaſped Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> yea, a godly man may fall into groſs ſins, ſuch as waſte and wound the Conſcience, and break communion with
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002260_0042_0FDADF0B9ECB9B20"/>
God; indeed into any ſin, though never ſo vile, except only that ſin againſt the Holy-Ghoſt, and final Impenitency. Now in this caſe a new converſion is neceſſary; we ſee inſtances hereof in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.10. after his fearful fall and miſcarriage in that matter about <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> (for that, as the Title ſheweth, was the occaſion of his penning that Pſalm) he prayeth, that God would <hi>create a clean heart, and renew a right Spirit in him:</hi> He ſpeaketh as if all the work of Converſion were to begin anew again. And in <hi>Solomon: His penitent Soul</hi> wrote a Book of Repentance; <hi>Eccleſiastes</hi> is the Book of <hi>Solomons</hi> Repenance, not of his firſt, but of <hi>his</hi> ſecond Repentance. And another inſtance hereof we have in <hi>Peter</hi>: Hence Chriſt ſaid to him, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. <hi>When thou art Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Peter</hi> was Converted before that him, as that by the ſudden ſurprizal of a time, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>an ſo far prevailed upon Temptation, he became guilty of Lying &amp; Perjury, and (which was worſt of all) denied Chriſt too: Now in regard of this fearful fall into ſin, he ſtood in need of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, <hi>Converted anew</hi>; therefore Chriſt ſaid to him, <hi>When thou art converted,</hi> meaning, when he ſhould he ſhould have repented of his grievous Tranſgreſſion Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, the truth of what you hear is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002260_0043_0FDADED744ADFF80"/>
evident, if we conſider the ſeveral ſteps of Converſion; <hi>e.g.</hi> A true Believer may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a new work of <hi>Conviction and Illumination</hi>; God may teach him that which he hath <hi>not</hi> ſeen, <hi>Job</hi> 34.32 he may have further Viſions of God, &amp; Viſions of his own Heart too, yea ſuch diſcoveries, as may differ in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as much from the enlightnings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, when firſt Illuminated, as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a man differs from the knowledge of a child, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. and he may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo a new work of <hi>Compunction or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition</hi> for ſin. Hence <hi>David</hi> after his fall complains of <hi>broken bones, Pſa.</hi> 51.8. becauſe his ſin occaſioned and cauſed as much grief to him, as if all his bones had been ſhive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in pieces. And <hi>Solomon</hi> found his vanity in the end of it, <hi>more bitter than death, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.26. And <hi>Peter,</hi> when his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was touched with a ſaving remorſe for his ſin, <hi>went out</hi> &amp; <hi>wept bitterly,</hi> Mat. 27. <hi>ult.</hi> So for <hi>Humiliation,</hi> a true Believer may undergo that work anew: We ſee it in <hi>Job,</hi> after the ſinful diſtempers of his Spirit had broke looſe, he cryed out againſt himſelf, <hi>I am vile,</hi> chap. 40. verſ. 4. And in as much as his Repentance and Humiliation was not altogether ſo deep and through as ſhould have been, the Lord ſpeaketh more awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly to him, untill he cry out a ſecond
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002260_0044_0FDADF0D0D5BAD80"/>
time, <hi>I abhor my ſelf, and repent in dust and aſhes, chap.</hi> 42.6. And the like we read concerning <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 32.26. <hi>He humbled himſelf, for the pride of his heart</hi>; not but that he had humbled himſelf for that and other ſins many a time, and many a day afore that time, but then he renewed his <hi>Humiliation</hi> before the Lord. And a further work of <hi>Converſion</hi> may be wrought upon the Believer, in reſpect of <hi>Seperation from ſin, and Amendment of life.</hi> Thus alſo with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.67. <hi>Before I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, I went astray, but now have I kept thy word</hi>: Not but that he made Conſcience of his ways from his youth up, but that affliction was a means to make him more circumſpect and exact in his walking before God. So the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> after that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Providence about the Inceſtuous Perſon, were much reformed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. Alſo in reſpect of cloſing with Chriſt, a true Believer may fall, as it were, under a <hi>ſecond Converſion</hi>: We therefore read, <hi>that the Diſciple believed,</hi> John 2.11. the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples believed before, otherwiſe they had not been called Diſciples, but now they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their cloſing with Chriſt. So that the Holy Spirit doth ſometimes go over the work of Converſion in all the ſteps of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002260_0045_0FDADED886DB62E8"/>
it, in the hearts of his children, and that again and again; yea, and ſometimes he doth all this in a very eminent manner.</p>
            <p>Prop. VI. <hi>In true Converſion, there is a change, even of the whole man.</hi> The ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing change wrought in <hi>converſion,</hi> muſt be proportionable to the <hi>defilement</hi> of natural Corruption. Now that's total; what the Prophet ſpeaketh, concerning that woful defection and corruption of the Jewiſh ſtate, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.6. <hi>From the ſole of the foot, even to the head, there is no ſoundneſs in it, but wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores,</hi> may truly &amp; fitly be applied unto the corrupted eſtate of all men by Nature. This Corruption of Nature was Typified under the Law by the ſpreading Leproſie <hi>(Lev.</hi> 13.12, 13.) which <hi>covered all the skin of him that had the Plague, from his head even to his foot.</hi> Now the Plaiſter muſt be anſwerable to the Sore; therefore inaſmuch as the Corruption of Nature is univerſal, as to all parts and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; ſo muſt Repentance &amp; Converſion be univerſal. Hence a true Convert is ſaid to be a new, and another Creature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>If any man be in Christ, he is a new Creatures old things are paſſed away, behold, all things are become new.</hi> In <hi>Converſion,</hi> Heaven and Earth is new; that is to ſay, all is new from
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002260_0046_0FDADF0E822F9DB8"/>
the top to the bottom; it's ſuch another change as that, which ſhall paſs upon the World at the laſt and Great Day; Indeed, then the materials ſhall be the ſame, but there will be a wonderful alteration as to qualities; ſo it is when a Soul is <hi>converted.</hi> As if a man ſhould deface a deformed Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and in the room of it ſhould draw another compleat and beauiful; here the ſubject matter is the ſame, only her's a new Image. Thus the Holy Spirit draweth the bleſſed Lines of the Image of God on that Soul, where once was the deformed Image of Satan. But to evince the truth of this Propoſition, by Induction of particulars: 1. In <hi>converſion, the head is made new.</hi> A true <hi>convert</hi> hath a <hi>renewed mind,</hi> Eph. 4 23. Hence <hi>Converſion</hi> is in the Scripture called, <hi>Illumination,</hi> Heb. 10.32. &amp; <hi>opening of the eyes</hi> of the Soul, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God converts a Soul, he lets in a new, and a bleſſed light into the Underſtanding, that the ſinner hath other apprehenſions about God, and Chriſt, and Heaven, and Sin, &amp; Hell, &amp; Spiritual objects, than once he had. Every <hi>converted</hi> ſinner may ſay, as the man that was born blind ſaid, after Jeſus Chriſt had healed him, <hi>John</hi> 9.25. <hi>One thing I know, that whereas I was born
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002260_0047_0FDADEDA0437C9C8"/>
blind, now I ſee.</hi> Some that are truly <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> cannot tell exactly the time, or the means, or manner of their <hi>Converſion</hi>; yet this they know, that now they ſee Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual things with another kind of ſight and apprehenſion, then once they did. The truth is, that <hi>converſion</hi> doth begin here: As in the <hi>first Creation</hi> God began with <hi>light,</hi> ſo in this ſecond and new Creation, the Lord begins with effectual Conviction and Illumination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 In <hi>Converſion, the heart</hi> is made new, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart will I give. Converting Grace</hi> is promiſed to the Elect under that expreſſion. <hi>A new heart</hi> is given to a man, when that heart which once was hard &amp; ſenſleſs, is become ſoft &amp; tender; <hi>when an heart of ſtone, is turned into an heart of fleſh</hi>; and when that heart which once was full of nothing but pride and vanity, is become humble and meek. And when that heart which was fooliſh is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Spiritually wiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.8. The Heart is oft in Scripture, put for the Will, becauſe it is the ſeed and ſubject thereof, as the head is of the Underſtanding. Now in converſion, the Will is wonderfully chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 110.3. <hi>A willing people in the day of thy power</hi>; when the day of Gods power doth paſs upon the Soul in Converting
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002260_0048_0FDADF11292CB1F8"/>
Grace, the Will is captivated. The Will then refuſeth old ſinful Objects which once were delighted in; and inſtead thereof, chuſeth new and better Objects: That Will which before was obſtinate and rebellious, is now become pliable to the will of God in every thing. You ſee it in <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was in the Pangs of the new birth, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts; 9.6. And this alone proveth the truth of the Propoſition before us; for a change of the Heart or Will, infers a change of the whole man; the Reaſon is, becauſe the Will is the Empreſs and Commandreſs of the Soul. Hence the act of any faculty or part belonging to a man, is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the act of the whole, except the Will be involved in it. 3. In converſion, <hi>the affections are renewed:</hi> A ſincere Convert doth not affect thoſe evils, which once he did affect; and doth affect thoſe good things which once he did not affect; Converting Grace cauſeth a marvellous change upon the affections; <hi>e. g.</hi> If we ſpeak of Love &amp; Haterd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when a ſinner is Converted, theſe affections are much altered and placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on new and other Objects: He loveth Spiritual good things in the chief place; he loveth God and Chriſt above all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. he loveth Truth,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002260_0049_0FDADEDDC3628420"/>
Ordinances, Saints, Holineſs, as ſuch, which the Natural man doth not; he hateth ſin, and that univerſally, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.128. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.13. he hath an <hi>heart after God's own heart,</hi> Acts 13.22. that is to ſay, he doth love the things which God doth love, and hates the things which God doth hate. Again, the ſincere Convert hath new joys and ſorrows in his Soul. As for the Natural man his chief joy &amp; delight is in ſome carnal, worldly Object, either in the Pleaſures, or Profits, or Honours which the World affords: But as for the Converted man his chief delight is in Spiritual Objects; as in the favour of God, and communion with him by Jeſus Chriſt, and in the precious Promiſes, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> yea, he finds more ſweetneſs in one good look from God in Chriſt, or in one Promiſe, than in all that the whole Earth can afford, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. &amp; 94 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So for Sorrow; the greateſt ſorrows of a Natural man, are upon the account of <hi>ſome</hi> worldly croſs or diſappointment; but the Converted man is grieved moſt of all with the loſs of Gods favour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6. and with the diſhonour done to Gods name in the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.136, 158. as to <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual and rational ſorrow,</hi> Sin is the matter of greateſt grief unto his Soul, eſpecially thoſe ſins which before Converſion were the moſt delightful, after Converſion are the greateſt bitterneſs of Soul. Again, where there is true <hi>Converſion,</hi> there are new hopes and fears; his hopes are placed chiefly upon Eternal Objects, upon Chriſt, and Heaven,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002260_0050_0FDADF8514B36C58"/>
and Eternal Life, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.5, 27. and the like may be ſaid concerning his Fear, it is not placed ſo much upon Temporal, as upon Spiritual and Eternal Objects. I do but touch at things is we go along; but by this you ſee, that <hi>Converting Grace</hi> makes a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful change upon the affections; yea, upon all the affections, whether they be affections of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> or affections of <hi>Averſation.</hi> 4. In Converſion, there are <hi>new thoughts</hi> put into the heart; &amp; if there be a real &amp; through change, in reſpect of the thoughts, it is a ſpecial Evidence of true Converſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. An Unconverted ſinner, or one that hath only a common work of Gods Spirit upon him may poſſibly make ſome Conſcience of his words and outward actions; but it's rare for ſuch an one to look narrowly and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to the inward thoughts and workings of his heart; but where the Goſpel prevaileth to a ſound Converſion of the Soul, it brings <hi>every thought</hi> into ſubjection to the will of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. The ſincere Convert will not allow himſelf in ſo much as in vain and unprofitable thoughts, Pſal. 119.113. <hi>vain thoughs do I hate</hi>; much leſs in proud thoughts, or unclean thoughts, or revengeful thoughts. 5. In Converſion, there is a great change wrought, in <hi>reſpect of Words:</hi> It is therefore ſometimes expreſſed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the <hi>Circumciſion of the Lips.</hi> And by that phraſe, of <hi>a pure Language.</hi> Zeph. 3.9.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002260_0051_0FDADF1245FF2418"/>
The ſame man that before his <hi>Converſion,</hi> was it may be, a Reviler of good men, a Scoffer of Godlineſs, a prophane Swearer, or a filthy ſpeaker; after his Converſion, you ſhall hear no more ſuch evil Communication from him: but inſtead thereof, he will be ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Chriſt, and Heaven, and the eſtate of his own immortal Soul, &amp; be full of gracious, edifying diſcourſe; ſuch a mighty change doth Converting Grace work, when it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in power. And certain it is, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a mans Lips and Language be ſanctified, he is a ſtranger to Converſion, and to the power of Religion or Chriſtianity; <hi>James</hi> 1.26. <hi>If any man ſeem to be Religious, and brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not his tongue, he deciveth his own heart, his Religion is vain.</hi> Men may call themſelves Chriſtians, and yet have <hi>unbridled tongues:</hi> and they may think to be ſaved, becauſe of their Profeſſion of Chriſtianity; but alas, they deceive themſelves, and all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Religion will prove a vain thing, if they have not a <hi>pure Language.</hi> 6. Where there is Converſion, there <hi>is a new life and Converſation,</hi> Epheſ 4.22. <hi>Rom</hi> 6.4. He that is Converted, doth, as it were, turn over a new leaf, and leads a new life, quite differing from what he formerly lived. And this is that which is eſpecially ſignified by the word [<hi>Converſion</hi>:] The word is a Metaphor taken from a man, that is walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a wrong way; but if ever he would
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002260_0052_0FDADF15A168A0A8"/>
come to his journeys end, he muſt turn quite about, and go in a contrary way to that, which at preſent he walketh in. Men by Sin turn out of the right way; ſinners are <hi>perverters of their way,</hi> but by Repentance and <hi>Converſion,</hi> they return, &amp; are bro't back into the right way again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.21, 22. The true Convert walketh in new ways, and taketh new courſes: He did walk in the way of ſin, he doth walk in the way which is called holy; he did walk in the broad way, he doth walk in the narrow way. 7. Where there is Converſion, there will alſo be <hi>a change in reſpect of company</hi>: As a new Converſation, ſo a new Company to converſe withal, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. We ſee a ſudden and marvellous change, in this reſpect, wrought in <hi>Paul</hi> at his firſt Converſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 9, 26. b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore his Converſion, he delighted in the Company of none but carnal Jews, but after his Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, none ſo welcome to him as Godly Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians; Thoſe very perſons that before he did malign, and hate to the death, afterwards he ventured his life for their ſakes. And indeed there is nothing that doth make a greater diſcovery of a mans ſpirit, than the company which he doth frequent and delight in. A propane ſpirited man, Loveth prophane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, one that is not prophane, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, only civil and outwardly blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in his <hi>Converſation,</hi> delights not in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Company, nor yet in Godly Society,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002260_0053_0FDADF17834F61B0"/>
only in ſuch as are in the ſame ſtate and form with himſelf, But gracious Souls delight in ſuch as truly fear God; yea, the more there is of God in any one, the more doth the true Convert delight in Communion with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 63. <hi>I am</hi> (though a King) <hi>a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of all them</hi> (be they never ſo mean in this world) <hi>that fear thee, and of them that keep thy Precepts.</hi> By theſe things then you ſee, that in Converſion there is an univerſal change wrought upon the ſinner. Thus much may ſuffice to be ſpoken by way of Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The nature of true Converſion hath been opened unto you in the Propoſitions cleared, which are expreſſive of the Cauſes, Parts, degrees, Subject of true Converſion.</p>
            <p>We come now to demonſtrate the Point <hi>ſ.c. that a ſound through Converſion, is of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity to the Souls enterance into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And this is proved. 1. <hi>From plain teſtimony of Scripture.</hi> The words of this Text (if there were no more) are a plain proof of this Doctrine, they ſtand li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This is the undoing miſery of many, that go far, and bid fair for Heaven, that they leave one unmortified luſt <hi>behind,</hi> which becometh <hi>their</hi> ruine at laſt. <hi>Jehu</hi> went far, but there was a luſt of Ambition left in him that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſubdued. <hi>Judas</hi> went far, but there was a luſt of Coveteouſneſs never mortified in his heart. <hi>Herod</hi> went far, and did <hi>many things,</hi> but there was a luſt of Uncleanneſs that he was never delivered from; and by this means did theſe men all loſe their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Souls. Know therefore for certain, that if there be but one luſt loved and lived in, that will exclude out of Heaven. Tho' a mens ſin ſhould be as dear to him as his right hand, or his right eye; if he do not forſake it, he muſt be caſt into <hi>Hell fire, where the Worm dyeth not, and where the fire never ſhall be quenched,</hi> Mark 9.47, 48.</p>
            <p>Having opened and proved the Point, we proceed, in the Lords fear, to make ſome Application of it. Now by way of Uſe, 1. <hi>We may hence</hi> infer, <hi>That they that are truly &amp; throughly Converted to God in Chriſt, are in a very happy condition.</hi> There are two things here that do ſhew the happineſs of ſuch Souls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that <hi>a Kingdom is theirs,</hi> they do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a Kingdom; therefore ſincere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts are called, <hi>The children of the Kingdom,</hi> Matth. 13.38. they are ſuch children as
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002260_0057_0FDADF1FDC4A5AF8"/>
have a Kingdom for their Inheritance. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, <hi>a Kingdom</hi> is the higheſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; ſo to ſhew the glorious happineſs wherewith ſuch ſhall be dignified, they are ſtiled Heirs of a Kingdom. 2. Another thing which ſets forth their happineſs, is <hi>the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Kingdom</hi> which they ſhall poſſeſs, <hi>it's an heavenly Kingdom</hi>: The Text calls it, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> All earthly Kingdoms are as nothing, compared with this. This Kingdom of Heaven noteth three things; all which do ſet forth the wonderfull happineſs of truly Converted ones. 1. <hi>It noteth a ſtate of ſaving ſanctifying Grace</hi>: Oft times in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the being brought out of a ſtate of Nature into a ſtate of Grace, is called, <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Kingdom,</hi> Col. 1.13. Matth. 21.31. For then men are delivered out of Satans, and are become Subjects of the Lords King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Now they that are brought into a ſtate of Grace are happy indeed: For Grace is Heaven begun; he that hath Grace, ſhall as certainly go to Heaven, as if he was there already; which may be one Reaſon why this Expreſſion, of <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> is put to ſignifie a ſtate of Grace. 2. <hi>It may note the Glory and Dominion which the Saints ſhall poſſeſs at the laſt and great Day,</hi> Luke 22.29.30. <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom—You ſhall ſit upon Thrones judging,</hi> &amp;c which evidently intimates, that at the Judgment-Day the Saints ſhall have a <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And no doubt

this is a ſpecial thing aimed at in the Text, as will appear to him that well conſiders the occaſion of theſe words: And though the Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It's not poſſible for the Soul to be entered into the Kingdom of Heaven, &amp; yet to live in darkneſs &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſtill. 2. <hi>They that are Prophane either in heart or life, are unconverted.

Alas, how many ſuch are there, whoſe hearts ſlight and diſpiſe Spiritual bleſſings, even as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Eſau</hi> did?

So as for all thoſe that live in any ſcandalous ſins againſt the firſt or ſecond Table of the Law, it is certain that they are not <hi>Converted.</hi> Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh as you find, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>The time paſt of our lives may ſuffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in laſcivouſneſs, luſts, exceſs of wine, revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, banquetings, and abominable Idolatries, wherein they think it ſtrange that you run not

Nay, his Religious Actions are ſins, his praying, and hearing, and faſting, and reading, all are ſo many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful abominations in the Lords ſight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.9. &amp; 28 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.7. A Natural man may do, and ſpeak, and think many things, which for the matter of them are good; but as done by ſuch a perſon as is out of Chriſt, they are not good, but evil in the ſight of God. Certainly this would be an <hi>awakening Conſideration,</hi> if ſinners would think ſadly of it. Canſt thou make light of this, that look how many actions there have been done by thee in all thy life time, how many words thou haſt ſpoken, how many thoughts have been in thy heart, ſo many ſins art thou guilty of, and muſt one day anſwer for them all! Laſtly, <hi>Thou art in a ſtate of Death and Condemnation.</hi> A Natural man <hi>is dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> Epheſ. 2.1. A poor ſinner hath all the miſerable properties of a dead man belonging to him. As now a dead man cannot ſtir or go, ſo it is with a ſinner, he cannot walk in the ways of God; one that's dead cannot hear, ſo a ſinner is deaf to all the Calls of Heaven. The Lord giveth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a loud knock and call, yet the ſinner hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing; the reaſon is, becauſe he is dead. Again, a dead man cannot ſpeak; ſo it is with a ſinner, he hath no ability for
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002260_0068_0FDADF3730C6FBF8"/>
ſpiritual diſcourſe. This is the reaſon why ſome of you live in the neglect of Prayer. The Word hath told you many a time, that you muſt pray in your Families, and in your Cloſets too, and you go with Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Conſciences that this is your duty, and yet you do it not; why? you ſay you cannot: I would pray in my Family, but I cannot. Alas, poor Creature, I believe thee; for thou art dead in ſins, and how ſhould a dead Creature ſpeak unto God in Prayer? Yea, and an Unconverted ſinner is not only under ſpiritual death for the preſent, but he remains under a ſad ſentence of Eternal Death, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already.</hi> It's not only true, that he ſhall be condemned hereafter, but he is ſo <hi>already.</hi> The ſentence of Death is <hi>already</hi> pronounced againſt him, and ſhall as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be executed upon him, <hi>if he turn not,</hi> as if it were already done. Oh conſider and tremble at it, all you that live in ſin. I muſt tell you, for I ſhould not be able to hold up my head before the Son of God ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, if I ſhould forbear to tell you the truth; and therefore I tell you plainly and truly, If any perſon amongſt you, man or woman, be they high or low, rich or poor, ſhall not turn from ſin, yea, and from all ſin, Eternal Death ſhall as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be your portion, as if you were already in Hell.</p>

Hence is that Expreſſion Rom.</hi> 6 4. Walk in newneſs of life. <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, there are divers properties in little Children which ſet forth a Converted perſon</hi>; e. g.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Humbleneſs of mind</hi>: A Child hath no ambitious high deſigns in his heart, only minds leſſer matters. Hence <hi>David</hi> ſaith;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002260_0070_0FDADF3A1000C188"/>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1, 2. <hi>Lord, my heart is not haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor mine eyes lofty, neither do I exerciſe my ſelf in great matters, or in things too high for me: Surely I have behaved my ſelf as a weaned child that is weaned, my ſoul is as a child. David</hi> was accuſed, as if he had had ambitious aſpirings after <hi>Saul</hi>'s Kingdom; But ſaith he, I am as free from thoſe Imputations as a child that is but a weanling, who hath no ſuch aſpirings in his thoughts. Now this humbleneſs of mind, is a ſpecial thing intended in the Text by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Unmortified Pride is a Soul-dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſin; yet there is no ſin more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or more hard to ſubdue than Pride; it's the firſt that liveth, and the laſt that dyeth. Hence the work of Converſion is well expreſſed in the Text, by the Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of that one luſt. And oft in the Scripture, a <hi>Natural man</hi> and a <hi>Proud man</hi> are the ſame, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1. and a <hi>Converted man,</hi> and an <hi>Humble man</hi> are alſo the ſame, <hi>James</hi> 4.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.14. <hi>He that humbles himſelf ſhall be exalted.</hi> That hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling noteth <hi>Converſion.</hi>

Tho' the Inſtrument be never ſo contemptible, yet if he bring Scripture along with him, doth the Authority of that carry you before it, this is a good ſign.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Children are apt to forget wrongs</hi>: Hence is <hi>that,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.20. <hi>in malice be ye chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> You often obſerve that Children, tho' they fall out never ſo, yet in a little time all will be forgotten, and they will become as good friends as ever they were. Truly he <hi>that cannot forgive wrongs,</hi> hath no Grace in his heart; ſo if a man hath <hi>a forgiving ſpirit,</hi> it's a good ſign; yea, if a man doth freely forgive thoſe <hi>that</hi> wrong him, and if he doth it out of conſcience to the holy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and out of a ſenſe of the Grace of God towards him, in pardoning of his many ſins, it is one of the cleareſt evidences of a true Child of God <hi>that can be given.</hi> This hath Chriſt taught us, <hi>Mat,</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>For if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father will alſo forgive you: But if you forgive them not their treſpaſſes, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you your treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> So <hi>that</hi> you ſee it holds true both in the Affirmative and in the Negative, That a <hi>forgiving ſpirit</hi> is an Evidence of a true Child of God; and the want of this, an Evidence of the contrary.

which the Text doth afford, ſome other things may be mentioned as marks of <hi>Tryal</hi> here. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Try this matter by the greatneſs of this change which is wrought in Converſion. <hi>You heard in opening the Point, how Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth imply an univerſal change? Is it ſo with you? Have you new heads, new hearts, new words, new thoughts, new lives and all? Moreover, the change wrought in Converſion is univerſal, in reſpect of entire obedience unto all Divine Commands, and an utter forſaking of every falſe way. Therefore it is ſaid,</hi> the fruit of the Spirit is in [<hi>all</hi>] goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eph, 5.9. <hi>Where the Spirit hath wrought Grace, there is</hi> all <hi>goodneſs; Such a Soul doth practiſe</hi> all <hi>duties, and forſake</hi> all <hi>ſins. It is indeed the greateſt change that men are ſubject to.</hi> It is a marvellous change which Death brings along with it; hence <hi>Job</hi> calls his <hi>death his change</hi>; It is ſo by way of eminency, <hi>Job.</hi> 14.14. But Converſion brings a greater change with it: For at death the change is only in reſpect of place and degree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in Converſion there's a change wrought in reſpect of ſtate and kind, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but now are light in the Lord.</hi> There are new and quite contrary qualities wro't in the Soul, ſo as the ſinner converted dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers as much from the ſinner Unconverted, as light differs from darkneſs. For,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:002260_0073_0FDADF4301895B38"/>3. <hi>If a man be converted, then his nature is changed</hi>; therefore ſuch are ſaid <hi>to partake of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. Such an one doth not only new acts, but there is in him a <hi>new nature,</hi> from whence <hi>theſe</hi> acts do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. He <hi>hath not</hi> only new practices, but a new principle. Hence it is in ſome ſort <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> for a <hi>converted man</hi> to ſin, <hi>that</hi> is, ſo far forth as he is <hi>regenerates,</hi> 1 John 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him; and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> And <hi>it</hi> is <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural unto</hi> him to do good, and <hi>to</hi> endeavour <hi>to</hi> pleaſe God. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians</hi> concerning <hi>Timothy, that he did na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally care for their eſtate,</hi> chap. 2. verſe 20. This was, becauſe <hi>Timothy</hi> was a Converted, Gracious man, and ſo a new Nature was conferred upon him. Had it not been for converting Grace, ſuch <hi>a care</hi> as <hi>that</hi> was, had never been <hi>natural</hi> to him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>You may try whether you are Converted, by that ſpiritual combat which is peculiar to the Regenerate.</hi> It is with a Child of God, as it was with <hi>Rebecca,</hi> in whom there was a <hi>Jacob</hi> and an <hi>Eſau</hi>; or as it was with the houſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> where there was an <hi>Iſaac</hi> and an <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> So it is with the heart of a Chriſtian, there is a Regenerate and Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, part conflicting and combating the one againſt the other, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. Now if there be Spirit luſting againſt the Fleſh, that
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002260_0074_0FDADF448B75AF70"/>
is a ſure ſign <hi>that there is Spirit</hi>; only there is a dangerous deluſion here, which many deceive themſelves with; they take the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy of a natural enlightned Conſcience againſt ſin, to be the ſpiritual Combat, which is peculiar to the Regenerate, but theſe differ much. As to the ground of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, there is a difference; the one op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſin, becauſe of the vileneſs and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Nature; the other only, or chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for fear of puniſhment. It may be illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by this familiar Compariſon; Some men are loth to meddle with coals of fire, becauſe of filth which is about them; others never ſtick at <hi>that,</hi> only becauſe of fire, leſt haply <hi>their</hi> fingers ſhould be burnt, <hi>they are loth to</hi> meddle; So it is here, a <hi>Natural man</hi> would never fall <hi>out with</hi> ſin, becauſe of <hi>the filth</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> only <hi>there</hi>'s fire in ſin, which would burn his Conſcience if he ſhould med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it, and <hi>therefore</hi> he forbears ſome acts of ſin; <hi>but the</hi> ſincere Convert is acted from <hi>another</hi> Principle. There is alſo a difference as to the evils oppoſed; for when the Conflict is only from an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Conſcience, the evils oppoſed are wont to be more groſs and vile; but in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual combat, ſeemingly little ſins are mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under, even vain <hi>thoughts</hi> are a weariſome burthen. In the one, only ſome ſins are oppoſed; in <hi>the other</hi> all ſin. So likewiſe there is wont to be a difference in reſpect of
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002260_0075_0FDADF465F9F69C8"/>
the continuance of the oppoſition: That which proceeds only from an enlightned Conſcience is wont to be but now and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perhaps when ſome groſs ſin hath been committed, or the like; but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Combat is conſtant, and without Intermiſſion.</p>

            <p>The danger of Apoſtacy is here very aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deſcribed, by ſhewing, that they that are <hi>wilful and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>otal Apostates</hi> from the Truth, cannot attain unto Repentance, but they muſt lie under the Curſe of God to all Eternity. And this the Apoſtle proveth by three Arguments; 1. From the Inmmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Counſel of God; hence he ſaith, <hi>It is impoſible for ſuch to be renewed by repentance.</hi> He doth not only ſay, that it ſhall not be, but that it <hi>is impoſſible</hi> that it ſhould be; which Expreſſion may reſpect the unalterable Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of God to the contrary, which maketh the thing impoſſible. 2. <hi>Becauſe they crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh</hi>; that is to ſay, they do it as much as in them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: And therefore, either God muſt give another Chriſt, or Chriſt muſt come again to ſuffer and ſatisfie for their ſins, neither of which ſhall be, or elſe ſuch ſinners muſt remain under the Curſe eternally. 3. The Apoſtle proveth this by ſhewing the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Equity which is in ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002260_0081_0FDADF53ABA06560"/>
and that is done in theſe words, which are <hi>Aitiolological</hi> they give a ſufficient Reaſon for that which before was aſſerted. Leſt any one ſhould think this hard and unreaſonable, he doth in theſe words, by a familiar, and yet elegant Compariſon, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from that which is cuſtomary amongſt men, and applied to Divine matters, both <hi>illuſtrate</hi> and <hi>demonstrate the point.</hi> The ſum is this; <hi>We ſee</hi> (ſaith the holy Apoſtle) <hi>that men if they bestow much pains in tilling a piece of ground, and yet it will bring forth no good, but abounds with evil fruit, they do even execrate ſuch ground, and forſake it, and at last make fuel of it; and therefore God may well deal ſo with ſinners.</hi>

               </gap>e <hi>Terms,</hi> before we come to the Doctrine from them.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Earth</hi> here ſpoken of, <hi>men</hi> are ſignified, ſo in the Parable of the Sower (<hi>Matt.</hi> 13.)</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Ground</hi> men are ſignified, who are indeed fitly compared to the <hi>ground,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the ſubject of <hi>Divine Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> The earth is tilled and dreſſed, ſo are men in a myſtical ſence: Seed is not ſown in any Element but the <hi>earth</hi> only; not into <hi>the</hi> fire or water, but into the moulds of <hi>the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002260_0082_0FDADF582C5A6E60"/>
earth:</hi> So the ſeed of the Word is diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt no other Creatures but men; only its true the Goſpel is ſaid to be <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every Creature,</hi> becauſe the Hebrews were wont to call <hi>Man</hi> by the name of <hi>Creature</hi>: So that by every Creature is meant, nothing elſe but men of all ſorts. Again, Man is a poor <hi>earthly Creature</hi>; ſo he is in reſpect of his original, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his end; therefore God ſaid to <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, <hi>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou ſhalt return,</hi> Gen. 3 19. Hence men are fitly compared unto, and reſembled by the earth.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Rain</hi> here ſpoken of, we are to underſtand, the Gracious Diſpenſations of God: In ſpecial, his word, and moſt of all, <hi>the word of the Goſpel</hi>: The word of God is frequently compared in the Scripture unto <hi>Rain,</hi> Deu 32.2. <hi>My doctrine ſhall drop as the rain, my ſpeech ſhall diſtil as the dew, as the ſmall rain upon the tender herb, and as the ſhowers on the graſs.</hi> Hence is that phraſe of <hi>dropping the Word,</hi> Ezek. 21.2. <hi>Amos</hi> 7.16 <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.6. And fitly is the Word of the Goſpel compared unto rain; for rain, if it fall upon good ground, cauſeth much fruitfulneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.10, 11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.14. ſo doth the Word, when it falleth into
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002260_0083_0FDADF5A4714A328"/>
good hearts: The rain cometh from Heaven, <hi>the Heavens</hi> do, (though not of themſelves) <hi>give ſhowers</hi>: Thus concerning the Word, it cometh <hi>from Heaven,</hi> the Ordinances of the Goſpel are the influences of Heaven; as it was ſaid concerning <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, that it was from Heaven, ſo are we to ſay concerning all the Ordinances of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Hence <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3. it is ſaid of the poor in ſpirit, that <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is theirs.</p>
            <p>Further, By <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Bryers,</hi> here are ſignified the ſins and corruptions of men: So <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.7. it is ſaid <hi>the thorns choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word</hi>; where by Thorns are meant, thoſe ſins of Voluptuouſneſs &amp; Worldlineſs. The <hi>corruptions</hi> of men are fitly reſembled to <hi>thorns</hi> and <hi>bryers,</hi> becauſe theſe are wont to ſpring of themſelves. Bad and barren ground, doth naturally produce ſuch things; even ſo ſin and vice is natural to men. <hi>Thorns</hi> &amp; <hi>bryers</hi> are unprofitable things, there is little uſe of them; even ſo the ſins of men are <hi>unfruitful</hi> (or unprofitable) works of darkneſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5 11. Sin is good for nothing; it is good neither for a mans body, nor for his ſoul, nor for his name, nor for his eſtate, nor for anything; yea moreover, <hi>thorns</hi> and <hi>bryers</hi> are hurtful, they
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002260_0084_0FDADF5BD4BC1B00"/>
will tear a mans cloaths, wound his fleſh, and prejudice the ground were they grow; ſo the ſins of men wound their ſouls, and are prejudicial to others where they are committed. <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>bryers</hi> are them more hurtful, for that they are of a ſpreading nature, and hard to be got out of the ground where they are rivetted; this is the nature of many evil herbs: So t'is with the corruptions of mens hearts, if once a vice be rivited in a mans ſoul, it is marvellous difficult to root it out from thence. But I <hi>muſt</hi> not ſtay here, nor ſhall we ſtand upon any further opening of the words, beſides what may be ſpoken to under the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine from them, which is this;</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That thoſe men who live under the in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fluence of the Goſpel, and the Ordinance thereof, and yet either bring forth no fruit, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>

               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:002260_0086_0FDADF625D493528"/>2. There is an <hi>outward fruitfulneſs</hi>; that is, when not only a mans heart, but his <hi>life</hi> alſo <hi>is comformable to the will of God in Chriſt.</hi> Thus good works are called fruit, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruitful in every good work:</hi> Therefore the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Phil. 1.11. becauſe if a man do the works required by the Law of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, after an Evangelical manner, this is ſuch fruit as pleaſeth God. And this alſo is required under the Goſpel; hence when <hi>John</hi> preached the Goſpel, he ſaid, <hi>Bring forth fruits meet for repentance,</hi> Matth. 3.8. See (ſaith <hi>John</hi>) that ye walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rule of the new Creature; let your Practices, Lives, Converſations be ſuch, as that it may appear, that your Profeſſion of Repentance is ſound and ſincere. The Goſpel doth require not only Faith, but Obedience alſo (and indeed where the one of theſe is in ſincerity, the other will be too) it calls both for internal and external Obedience, even for Faith and Works: Both theſe are here ſignified in the Text by that phraſe of, <hi>herbs meet for him by whom it is dreſſed.</hi> Men are (as was ſaid) the Earth, God is the <hi>Dreſſer</hi> of this Earth:
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:002260_0087_0FDADF6531415C18"/>
He is compared to an Husbandman; the Herbs or Fruits which is meet for ſuch a Dreſſer, are Grace and Holineſe, Faith and Obedience in heart and life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Goſpel doth require,</hi> not only ſuch fruit as hath been expreſſed, but moreover, <hi>that men ſhould he abundant therein:</hi> I ſay, an abundant fruit-bearing is requiſite for men, living under the gracious Diſpenſation of the Goſpel. Hence the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> chap, 12. v. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth from this Argument preſs unto Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even becauſe they were not under the Law, but under the Goſpel. Holineſs (ſaith he) was required under the Law, but how much more under the Goſpel? The more God hath done for you, the more ought you to do for him: That ſpecial favour which the Lord hath beſtowed on you, in bringing you under the gracious Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, ſhould be an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon your hearts to ſo much the more Holineſs. <hi>It is a great meaſure of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which the Lord look: for from New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Believers</hi>; therefore did Chriſt ſay, <hi>Bear much fruit, ſo ſhall ye be my Diſciples,</hi> John 15.8. Men do not act as becometh the Diſciples of Chriſt, except they bring
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:002260_0088_0FDADF664836FB48"/>
forth much fruit; they do not walk as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Goſpel, except they be very holy. New-Teſtament-Believers have (<hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily)</hi> a far greater meaſure of light and knowledge in Divine things communicated to them, than was given (<hi>ordinarily</hi>) to Old-Teſtament-Believers; and therefore more Faith and Holineſs is required to be found in them. God did bear with ſuch Infirmities, Ignorances, Carnalities in his people, in the days of old, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, as he will not bear with now under the Goſpel: It is requiſite, that men ſhould be anſwerable to the Diſpenſations of God towards them, Luke 12.48. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be required; and to whom men have committed much, of him they'll ask the more.</hi> Now they that are intruſted with the Goſpel, and Ordinances thereof, much is committed to them: If ſeed be ſown in a rich ſoil, men expect much fruit; they that are planted in the Houſe of the Lord, as all that enjoy the Goſpel and Ordinances thereof in their power, purity and glory, are ſo, are plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a rich ſoil indeed. Ground which is plentifully watered, ſhould be abundantly fruitful: They that live under the bleſſed
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:002260_0089_0FDADF67C0739DA8"/>
diſtillations of Goſpel-Ordinances, are plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully watered, <hi>Iſa</hi> 49.10. <hi>He ſhall lead them by the ſprings of water:</hi> What are thoſe ſprings of water, but the Soul-refreſhing Promiſes and Ordinances of the Goſpel? Hence Chriſtians are compared to <hi>watered Gardens,</hi> Iſa. 58.11. A Garden which is often watered, it is expected that it ſhould be exceeding fruitful: So then ought Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Goſpel to be.</p>
            <p>We proceed therefore unto the <hi>Second</hi> thing; and that is to inquire, <hi>How it doth appear, that unprofitableneſs under the Goſpel is a very dangerous evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only mention two Arguments, evincing the truth of this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe they that ſlight the Goſpel, are the greateſt and most guilty ſinners in all the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greateſt ſinners are in danger of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the dreadfulleſt Condemnation, now ſo are they that Live under <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> and yet ſlight it, ſuch ſin at high and dear rates indeed; for they ſin againſt light, as <hi>Jobs</hi> phraſe is concerning ſome, <hi>They rebel againſt the light,</hi> chap. 24.13. Had it been poſſible for them, they would have plucked the Sun out of Heaven, that their wickedneſs might not have been diſcovered: So Deſpiſers of the Goſpel, are <hi>Rebels against the light:</hi> yea,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:002260_0090_0FDADF6C9A2C4D58"/>
againſt the higheſt and moſt ſpiritual light that ever ſhone upon men. When Chriſt preached the Goſpel in ſome dark corners an the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>the people which fate in darkneſs, ſaw a great light,</hi> Mat. 4.16. The light of Nature is but a dark glimmering light, and the light of the Law was dark, compared with that of the Goſpel: but now the Goſpel is the moſt Clear, Divine, Spiritual, Glorious Light that ever ſhone into the hearts of men. Hence if men deſpiſe it their ſin, guilt and danger is moſt fearful: yea, and ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do not only ſin againſt the cleareſt <hi>Light,</hi> but againſt the higheſt <hi>Love</hi> that ever was. It was a wonderful Evidence of <hi>Divine Philanthropy,</hi> even of <hi>the love and kindneſs of God towards mankind,</hi> Tit. 3.4. that he ſhould find out a way for ſinful men to come unto Salvation, and by the Goſpel he diſovers this way. Now to ſlight the kind offers of God, muſt needs be hainouſly evil. God ſheweth ſpecial favour to that people, upon whom he beſtoweth the Goſpel and Ordinances thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.15. <hi>Bleſſed are the people that know the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound, they ſhall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance</hi>: The ſilver Trumpets
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:002260_0091_0FDADF6DC6582D10"/>
under the Law, by which the people were called together, at the times appointed for Sacred and Solemn Aſſemblies, did typifie the Goſpel and holy Ordinances thereof. It is a bleſſed thing to be often hearing the joyful ſound, which is made by the Silver Trumpet of the Everlaſting Goſpel; ſuch have the light of Gods countenance towards them, God from Heaven ſeems to look on them with a pleaſent, favourable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Now then to ſlight this favour, that is dangerous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2 4, 5. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs—After thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, treaſurest up to thy ſelf wrath, againſt the day of wrath.</hi> They that live impenitently under the Goſpel, they <hi>deſpiſe the riches of Divine goodneſs</hi>? therefore cannot expect other, but that treaſures of wrath will be <hi>laid up</hi> againſt them, and one day <hi>laid out</hi> upon them. In a word, this ſin of ſlighting the Goſpel, is virtually and cauſally all ſin; for all a mans other ſins would be forgiven, if this were not ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the reſt. If men did embrace the Goſpel, they ſhould alſo receive the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins. Unbelief is the greateſt ſin that ever any of you were guilty of in your lives: This binds the guilt of all ſins againſt
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:002260_0092_0FDADF714FE0E930"/>
the Law, upon a mans Concience forever: Now by Unbelief is not meant, the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether our ſins are forgiven, but the refuſing of the motion of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> when the <hi>Goſpel</hi> freely offers Chriſt and Pardon; Life and Heaven with him: Now to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect him, and to lie out from him, to prefer the World, or it may be, a baſe Luſt, before the bleſſed Son of God, this is that Unbelief which provoketh God more than tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of the Law doth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe to ſlight the Goſpel, is to ſin againſt the remedy.</hi> There is but one only Remedy in all the World for a poor ſinner; namely, that which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> tells us of, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other; for there is no other name under Heaven given amongst men whereby we may be ſaved.</hi> Now for a man to reject a Remedy, and an only Remedy that's exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangerous. Suppoſe a man to be poiſoned, yet if he hath a Sovereign Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote offered to him, he may do well; but if he ſhall fooliſhly and wilfully refuſe this Antidote, then his caſe is dangerous, deadly, deſperate: Thus it is here, all men are poyſoned with ſin; that deadly venome of ſin, the old Serpent hath poyſoned the whole World with it: But now the <hi>Goſpel</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:002260_0093_0FDADF73369CF8E8"/>
brings an Antidote againſt this Poyſon, even the precious Blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: he that ſhall refuſe this Antidote, will certainly periſh. If the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were ſtung in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the fiery Serpent, had not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Brazen Serpent, they had certainly periſhed; thus then to refuſe the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is to ſin againſt the only remedy: As <hi>Ely</hi> ſaid to his Sons, <hi>If one man ſin againest another, the Judge ſhall judge for him; but if a man ſin against the Lord, who ſhall entreat for him,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.25. So if a man ſin againſt the Law, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> may help him; but if he deſpiſe the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> what help then is left for him; ſo that this is a dangerous evil. But the truth of this will appear further, in ſpeaking to the third thing; that is, in ſhewing <hi>wherein the danger of unprofitableneſs under the Goſpel doth conſist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In what reſpect is unfruitfulneſs under the Goſpel and Ordinances thereof dangerous</hi>?</p>
            <p>Anſ. 1. <hi>There is danger, lest the Lord ſhould be provoked hereby to take away his Goſpel.</hi> The abuſes of mercies, provoketh the Lord to take them away: So the Lord threatens them, <hi>Hoſea, chap</hi> 2. that becauſe they had abuſed Temporal Bleſſings; <hi>Therefore,</hi> Verſ.

The Lord doth never puniſh ſin more dreadfully, than when he doth puniſh ſin with it ſelf. So it is here, the Lord by a Judicial act doth puniſh ſin with ſin: This was their ſin (ſaith God) that they were unfruitful under fruitful means; and therefore this ſhall be their puniſhment, they would not profit by what they did enjoy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſhall be their plague, they ſhall be given up to <hi>everlasting barrenneſs of Soul.</hi> There is an awful Scripture to this purpoſe, which we ſhall a little open to you as we go along; it is that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.11. <hi>The miry places, and the Mariſhes, ſhall not be healed, they ſhall be given to ſalt.</hi> By <hi>miry places,</hi> are meant ſuch earth as <hi>that</hi> which my Text ſpeaks of. In <hi>miry places,</hi> the water and the earth mix together, the water hath not a free paſſage, but ſtands and corrupts there; even ſo when the waters of the Sanctuary, that is, the Doctrine of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> hath not a free paſſage through the hearts of men, but the Word cometh to the ear, and there it ſtops, and doth not run through their hearts and lives, but the Word mixed with
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:002260_0098_0FDADF8211BF4DF0"/>
the corruptions of men, that they can hear Sermons, and keep their luſts too, theſe now are <hi>miry places.</hi> Obſerve then the judgement of God upon them, <hi>they ſhall not be healed</hi>; that is to ſay, they ſhall never be converted. They would not be converted, this was their ſin; therefore they ſhall not be converted, this ſhall be their puniſhment, <hi>but they ſhall be given to ſalt,</hi>; that is to barrenneſs of Soul. <hi>Salt</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Barrenneſs,</hi> Deu. 29.23. it's ſaid <hi>the land was ſalt</hi>; i. e. Barren. Thus then are unfruitful Hearers of the Word in danger of being judicially given up by God to everlaſting Barrenneſs of Soul: Therefore when Chriſt ſaw <hi>a figtree, and found nothing on it but leaves only, he ſaid unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee hence forward and forever,</hi> Mat. 21.19. The Son of God that hath eyes like a flame of fire, he looks <hi>into the hearts</hi> of men; and if he find that there's nothing but the leaves of an outward Profeſſion, but no fruits of Saving Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though they have enjoyed the means of <hi>Grace,</hi> now the Lord ſecretly paſſeth this heavy doom upon ſuch ſouls, ſaying, <hi>Never let fruit grow upon ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hence forward and forever.</hi> He would not

            <p n="4">4. Unprofitable hearers of the Word are <hi>in danger of utter ruine,</hi> Luke 13.6, 7. <hi>A certain man had a Fig-tree planted in his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; he came and ſought fruit thereon, and found none: Then ſaid he to the Dreſſer of his Vineyard, Behold theſe three years I come, ſeek-for fruit on this Fig-tree, but find none, cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground.</hi> So that unfruitful hearers of the Word, are in danger to hear that Sentence <hi>Cut it down:</hi> Inaſmuch as they hear Sermons, and yet will not repent and believe, therefore <hi>down with them</hi> (ſaith God;) their bodies <hi>down</hi> to the Grave, and their Souls <hi>down to</hi> Hell, <hi>Down with them</hi>! Thus did <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt preach to the unfruitful Jews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down.</hi> Such Trees ſuch Profeſſors of Religion, as either bring forth no fruit, or nothing but leaves of Profeſſion, or elſe only evil fruit, ſhall be <hi>hewn down</hi>! yea, ſuch are in danger of being caſt into <hi>Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire</hi>; therefore <hi>John</hi> addeth further, <hi>and caſt into the fire,</hi> And this is alſo expreſſed in the Text, when it is ſaid, <hi>whoſe end is

to be burned,</hi> that is to ſay, this is the end, even the event which ſhall befal ſuch earthly Chriſtians, that they ſhall be thrown into the fire, which never ſhall be quenched. You know in ſome Countreys they burn <hi>Turf:</hi> The earth which is altogether unfruitful, is made uſe of for fuel; thus doth the Lord ſay concerning men, either let them be for <hi>fruit,</hi> or elſe for <hi>fuel.</hi> As the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth concerning the Vine tree, <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 15.) that if it do not bear fruit, it is fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothing elſe but the fire. So for Chriſtians, either they muſt bring forth fruits of faith and holineſs, or elſe they muſt be made fuel for the fire of Divine wrath to feed upon to all Eternity. But more may be ſpoken to this purpoſe, in the Application of the Point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Becauſe I would finiſh at this time, I ſhall only mention one Uſe of this Truth.</p>

Oh beware of living unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly under the Goſpel and means of Grace which you are made to partake of.</hi> Conſider what hath been ſpoken concerning the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this ſin, and conſequently the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful danger which is therein. Is there any man willing to be <hi>curſed, rejected, burned?</hi> If not, in Gods fear take heed that you do not remain unfruitful under thoſe ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Heaven, which from day to day fall upon your Souls. Remember alſo, that
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:002260_0101_0FDADF97EF3F94C0"/>
unfruitfulneſs is the ready way to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Goſpel Ordinances, and all the means of Grace. Sometimes indeed God doth take away men from the means, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this ſin; hence the Lord ſtriketh them with ſickneſs, that they cannot come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to the publick Aſſemblies of his People, though they would; nay, with death it ſelf. Thus we ſee in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (ch. 11.) though they were true Believers, and ſuch as ſhould not be condemned with the World at the great Day; yet becauſe they did not come to, and profit by that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Lords Supper as they ſhould have done, therefore ſickneſs and death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel them. Sometimes again, God taketh away the means from men, becauſe of this ſin, Oh, <hi>I fear, I fear, I fear,</hi> this will be the Judgment of God upon <hi>New England!</hi> I confeſs ſometime, when I have not before my coming into the Aſſembly had any ſuch thought in my heart, yet as I have been here ſtanding and ſpeaking before the Lord, ſuch words as theſe have been, as it were forced from me; but now I do upon ſaddeſt deliberation ſpeak it. Alas, alas! how are many Profeſſors amongſt us too like the <hi>Gergeſens,</hi> Matth. 8.34. that prized their Swine above Chriſt: Thus do men value their Poſſeſſions in the World, above Chriſt and Goſpel. Hence it is that ſo little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is given to the Goſpel all the

Countrey over; I am ſorry to ſpeak of theſe things, did not Conſcience &amp; Duty conſtrain me to it) which is a ſad evidence, that the Lord Jeſus will depart from theſe Coaſts e're long; yea, and there are already lamentable ſymptomes of the Lords departure: God is never wont to remove his Goſpel and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances all at once, but by degrees; but now there begins to be a ſcarcity of Spiritual Food amongſt us already. Look into Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations round about, and conſider how it is; There was a few years ago a Lecture at <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> and at <hi>Dedham,</hi> at <hi>Braintrey,</hi> &amp;c. But it is not ſo at this day. All theſe places <hi>(and many other</hi>) had Miniſters and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amongſt them, when as now they are deprived thereof. Beſides, our woful decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings from <hi>Firſt-love</hi> to Chriſt, and to his holy Inſtitutions, and to one another, are a ſad ſign, that the Lord intends <hi>to remove his Candleſtick out of this place,</hi> Rev. 2.5. What do theſe things portend, but that theſe <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thels</hi> will become <hi>Bethavens,</hi> it may be e're this Generation be paſſed away? But beſides theſe things which have been inſiſted on, let me ſpread before you a few <hi>Awakening Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,</hi> which ſhould cauſe you to dread this ſin of unprofitableneſs under means of Grace.</p>
            <p>Conſider 1. <hi>That you are not, you cannot be Chriſtians indeed, except you be fruitful.</hi> It is given as the Character of a <hi>falſe Chriſtian,</hi> or
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:002260_0103_0FDADF9AC20AE748"/>
an Hypocrite, that though he be a <hi>Branch in Chriſt</hi>; that is to ſay, <hi>a Profeſſor</hi> of the true Chriſtian Religion, <hi>yet he bears no fruit,</hi> Joh. 15.1. And it is noted concerning thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Profeſſors, which proved Apoſtates at laſt, that they <hi>were unfruitful,</hi> Jude 12. Thoſe that have indeed an intereſt in Chriſt, are always fruitful; <hi>They that are married unto Chriſt, bring forth fruit unto God,</hi> Rom. 7.4. If therefore there be not a bringing forth of this fruit, that's a ſure ſign that the ſoul was never married to Chriſt, never u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited unto him by faith, never had a ſaving intereſt in him. It may be ſaid of every true Believer, as was ſaid of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> Phil. 11. <hi>In time paſt unprofitable, but now profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> So a ſinner before his Converſion, is an unfruitful Creature; but when once he is effectually brought home to God, then he is profitable; If he be (as <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was) a ſervant, he is a profitable Servant; he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to conform himſelf to the will of God and ſo to pleaſe God in every thing; whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Relation he ſtands in, he brings forth fruit according to that Relation, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to anſwer the duties of that Relation; never ſay or think that you are Chriſtians, if it be nor thus with you. Hence it is, that the Converſion of ſinners is in the Scriptures ſet forth by ſaying, <hi>Inſtead of the Thorn ſhall come up the Firr-tree; and inſtead of the Bryer ſhall come up the Mirtle-tree,</hi> Iſa.
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:002260_0104_0FDADF9C3B697CE8"/>
55.13. That is to ſay, they that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like the Thorn and the Bryer, even unfruitful, and unfit for any good work, ſhall become fruitful.</p>
            <p>Conſider 2. <hi>That many hearers of the Word are altogether unprofitable.</hi> Yea, the moſt by far are ſo; ſo we read in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four ſorts of ground, &amp; but one of them good; that is to ſay, four ſorts of hearers of the Word, and there are three to one that are bad. Oh, how ſhould this <hi>awaken!</hi> And alas, if we look into the World we ſhall find, that indeed it is thus: As it was ſaid of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,</hi> that he was an <hi>empty Vine,</hi> that bro't forth fruit unto himſelf; thus it is with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yea, with the moſt of men, nay of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, they bring forth fruit to themſelves, to the World, to Satan, but not to God. How is it with many of you? you have leaves and that's all, even Profeſſion without Practice; others of you, you bring forth the fruit of Morality and Civility, &amp; that's all; you bleſs your ſelves that you are no Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, no Adulterers, no Swearers; but I beſeech you conſider, Morality and Civility alone, is no ſaving Evangelical work; you may have this, and yet fall ſhort of that fruit which the Goſpel requireth: There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that inſtead of good, they bring forth evil fruit, even <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Bryers.</hi> Are there not lamentable Diviſions and Contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us? ſuch fruit is, <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Bryers.</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:002260_0105_0FDAC98657ABCC98"/>
Behold, the Lord hath planted a Vineyard amongſt us? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.8.9 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly be applied unto us: <hi>God hath bro't us as a Vine out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>he hath caſt out the Heathen, and hath planted us, he hath cauſed this vine to fill the Land</hi> But alas for us! we have been an unfruitful Vine; How may the Lord complain againſt us, as againſt his people of old, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.2. <hi>He looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes:</hi> So hath it been with us, <hi>wild grapes</hi> have been brought forth, Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, Swearing, Unlawful Gaming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh, how may we tremble to think what God <hi>will do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider 3. <hi>That the Word and Ordinances, if they do not good, they will occaſion much hurt unto us.</hi> Certain it is, that the Ordinances, if powerfully diſpenſed, ſhall have their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and operation upon the hearts of men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.10, 11. <hi>For as the rain cometh down, and the ſnow from Heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth fruit, and bud, that it may give ſeed to the Sower, and bread to the eater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So ſhall my Word be, that goeth out of my mouth, it ſhall not return unto me void, but it ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe, and it ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the thing whereunto I ſent it.</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, if they do not ſoften, they will har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; if they do not convince and convert, they will blind the minds of men, and ſeal
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:002260_0106_0FDADFA18D325B60"/>
up their ſouls under ſecret wrath. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>We are unto God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh; to the one are we a ſavour of death unto death, and to the other, the ſavour of life unto life.</hi> Oh, how would men and women ſit trembling under Sermons, if they did believe, that they were about a matter of life and death, yea, a concernment of everlaſting life, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting death. Sermons ſhall have their effect upon the hearts of men, either to ſave or to damn their Souls, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Go</hi> (ſaith God to the Prophet) <hi>make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they convert, and be healed.</hi> Mark, I beſeech you, was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a more dreadful word ſpoken? One would have thought, that if the Prophet ſpake to them, it ſhould have been only, that they might have been converted; but the Lord by a Judicial hand upon them for their Unprofitableneſs, ſent his Prophet to harden their hearts, <hi>leſt they ſhould be converted.</hi> So for Sacraments, they will have their effect upon mens Souls, either for life or for death. We read of <hi>Judas,</hi> that after he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sop, Satan entred into him; even ſo, when you have been at the Lords Table, if Chriſt do not enter into you, Satan will; either Chriſt or Satan will come and take a fuller poſſeſſion of your Souls. Believe it,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:002260_0107_0FDADFA666F13D00"/>
Sermons, Sabbaths, Lectures, Sacraments, they ſhall all of them work, either for life, or for death.</p>
            <p>Conſider 4. <hi>Long continued <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitableneſs under the means of Grace, is a ſad ſign of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</hi> I tell you truly, this is one of the blackeſt marks of an Eternal Caſt-away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt.</hi> If the Goſpel be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from a people, its a ſign they ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; or if it be ſent to them, yet if in the life, and power, and ſaving efficacy of it, it be hid from mens Souls, that's a ſign that they ſhall be loſt: It is an <hi>awakening word</hi> which you may find, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.2. <hi>ult. The bellows are burnt, the Lead is conſumed of the fire, the founder melteth in vain, for the wicked are not taken away, reprobate ſilver ſhall men call them, becauſe the Lord hath rejected them:</hi> As if it were ſaid, God and man even the Lord by his Prophets, hath beſtowed much labour about this people, and yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue wicked ſtill, therefore are they to be looked upon as <hi>Reprobate</hi> and rejected ones. Chriſt tells the Jews, that the reaſon why they did not believe was, becauſe they were <hi>not of God,</hi> John 8 47. and becauſe they were <hi>not ſheep,</hi> John 10.26. that is to ſay, becauſe they did not belong to Election. If men live long unprofitably under means of Grace, this is a ſad token that they do not belong to Election. Indeed ſecret things belong to

            <p>In this Verſe that Exhortation ſet down, in the two foregoing Verſes, if further ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from a double Argument, 1. From the gracious opportunity which they then had, inaſmuch as Chriſt was then amongſt them; in the firſt part of the Verſe. 2. From the good and benefit which would come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; in the latter part of the Verſe.</p>
            <p>For opening of the words, before we come to the Doctrine from them, we ſhall only enquire, what is here meant by the <hi>Door,</hi> when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If any man open the Door, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is this Door?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thereby <hi>the Heart</hi> is ſignified. Hence the Scripture ſpeaketh of opening the heart: It is ſaid of <hi>Lydia, that</hi> ſhe was one <hi>whoſe heart the Lord opened,</hi> Acts 16.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>4: The words are a Metaphor from the opening of a Door. The Door is <hi>that</hi> by which men enter into <hi>the</hi> Houſe. So it is by <hi>the</hi> Heart, <hi>that</hi> the Lord enters into a man to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his ſoul.

ſtrength. The Gates were places of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, men were wont to ſit in Judgment in <hi>the</hi> Gate; ſo <hi>the</hi> Heart bears <hi>Authority</hi> over <hi>the</hi> whole man. And Gates were for <hi>Conſultation</hi>; ſo is <hi>the</hi> Heart, therefore we read of <hi>the Counſels of the Heart.</hi> The <hi>Heart is the Counſel, Strength, Authority</hi> of <hi>the</hi> whole man. Hence it is <hi>that</hi> if Chriſt hath not <hi>the</hi> Heart, he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Though he ſhould have a mans Judgment, Tongue, Conſcience, Eſtate, if he hath not his Heart, he is kept out of Doors ſtill.</p>

            <p>In the Doctrinal proſecution of this Point, four things may be <hi>attended</hi>; 1. To ſhew what is implied in Chriſts ſtanding at the door and knocking. 2.

               <pb n="90" facs="unknown:002260_0114_0FDADFB5D13FD908"/>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is implied in Chriſt's ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the door and knocking</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Herein is implied, <hi>That Chriſt is not ſo far entertained as ought to be.</hi> As for every ſinful man, either Chriſt is out of his heart <hi>totally,</hi> ſo it is as to to thoſe <hi>that</hi> are in a ſtate of ſin and unbelief, <hi>John</hi> 1.11. <hi>He came to his own, and they received him not.</hi> The unbelieving Jews gave no entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Chriſt, but they ſhut him whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of doors, as it were. Faith and Repentance doth open the door to Chriſt; ſo Sin and Unbelief doth ſhut the door a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; hence the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that by Nature they were <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2.12. The natural man is out of Chriſt, and Chriſt is out of him; or if Chriſt be not out of doors wholly, yet he is ſo <hi>comparatively.</hi> Of ſome Chriſt is not at all entertained; of others, not ſo much as he ſhould be. There is a <hi>firſt</hi> and a <hi>further</hi> entertainment of Chriſt; the one of theſe concerns Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the other Believers. The Saints themſelves may give a further entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto Chriſt; hence Chriſt knocks at the door, even that he might have yet further entertainment. As in great houſes there are many rooms, there are rooms of common entertainment, and there's a Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet for a mans ſelf, and his intimate Friend, Thus it is here, Chriſt would be admitted,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:002260_0115_0FDADFB7BB4F8090"/>
not only into the out rooms of the Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but into the very Cloſet; that is to ſay, in to the very heart. Hence he knocketh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men do not give him ſo much of their hearts as they ought to do. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This knocking implieth, <hi>That Chriſt ſeeketh to come in</hi>: He deſireth admittance into the hearts of men, This knocking is attended with a motion, that the door might be opened, as you may ſee in that Parallel Scripture, which the words of the Text ſeem to allude unto, namely, that Cant. 5.2. <hi>My Beloved knocketh, ſaying open to me.</hi> Hence alſo in the Text, Chriſt doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, <hi>I ſtand and knock at the door</hi>; but addeth, <hi>if any man hear my voice</hi>; So that with this knocking, there is a voice, a call, a motion from Chriſt, that the door of the heart may be opened. As men ſometimes, before they knock at a door, they call an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> houſe? Thus doth Chriſt call upon ſinners, Who is within in that heart? Who is the Houſe-keeper? Is there any room for me there? Shall I come and lodge in that Soul of thine?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Herein is implied, <hi>That Chriſt doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſtay and wait upon ſinners,</hi> that he may do them good. This is here intimated by <hi>ſtanding, I ſtand at the door and knock</hi>; This ſtanding is a waiting Poſture, the Greek word is as much as to ſay, I have ſtood,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:002260_0116_0FDADFB8C5514460"/>
and do ſtand ſtill: Chriſt doth not come and knock at the door once, and then away again preſently, but he <hi>ſtandeth</hi> there. The words note then, not only that Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a motion of mercy to poor ſinners, but moreover Conſtancy and Aſſiduity in the motion; therefore he ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.2. <hi>I have ſtretched forth my hands all the day long.</hi> Such is his wonderful Patience and Grace, as that he is pleaſed to ſtand knocking at the door, as it were, from morning till night, even <hi>all the day long</hi>; Whence it is alſo ſaid, that <hi>the Lord waits to be gracious,</hi> Iſa. 30.18. He waits upon ſinners, till he hath run thro' a courſe of means of Salvation with them. As a Phyſician doth attend upon a Patient, until he hath run through a courſe of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and then indeed he giveth him over, when he ſeeth there's no good to be done upon him: So doth the Lord deal with the Souls of men; he waits alſo even till the ſinner hath run through a courſe of ſin and wickedneſs, many a ſinner, until ſuch time as he hath quite filled up the meaſure of his ſins, Chriſt doth <hi>wait</hi> to be gracious to him, thus doth he <hi>ſtand</hi> at the door</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>How or by what means is it that Chriſt doth knock and call at the door of the hearts of men</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſt knocketh at the hearts of men <hi>by his Word</hi>; by this Epiſtle he knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Laodicca</hi>'s door. Hence in the Text
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:002260_0117_0FDADFBCF20FF6B8"/>
Chriſt's voice is ſpoken of. When Chriſt's <hi>Voice,</hi> his Word is heard, then is he <hi>knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at the hearts of men; therefore the Word is compared to an Hammer, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.29. <hi>Is not my Word like an Hammer,</hi> &amp;c. An Hammer you know is an Inſtrument whereby men ſometimes knock and break open doors. So doth the Lord by the Hammer of his Word knock and break open the doors of the hearts of ſinners. The Lord knocks by the Promiſes of the Word, and Threatnings alſo, theſe are <hi>knocking awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> words indeed; ſo by Inſtructions and Exhortations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence it is, that as for all men that enjoy the Miniſtry of the Word, whoſoever they be that have the Goſpel diſpenſed amongſt them, Chriſt knocketh at their doors, and deſireth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into their hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt knocketh <hi>by his Works.</hi> There is a ſecret voice of the Lord to the Soul in every Providence, though few hear it, few underſtand it.

            <p>Again, the Lord knocketh at the door by <hi>Afflictions,</hi> as we ſee in his Context, <hi>Whom I love, I rebuke and chaſten</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) and then it follows, <hi>I ſtand at the door and knock.</hi> How? even by chaſtening Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Providence: Therefore is that, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Hear ye the rod.</hi> Affliction is Gods rod; &amp; an iron rod it is, whereby the Lord doth, as it were rap at the door of ſecure ſinners. If the Lord afflicteth a man, <hi>he ſtriketh and giveth blows:</hi> Hence <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Remove thy [ſtroke] from me, I am conſumed by the [blow] of thine hand,</hi> Pſal. 39.10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt doth call and knock at the doors of mens hearts, <hi>by the voice of his Spirit</hi>; It is ſaid, Iſa. 30.21. <hi>Thine ears ſhall hear a word behind thee, ſaying, This is the way, walk therein,</hi> &amp;c. namely, a word ſpoken by the

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a poor Creature begins to think ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with himſelf, <hi>Am I in Chriſt, or out of Chriſt?

            <p>Que. 3. <hi>What is implied, in hearing Chriſts voice, and opening to him</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Herein is implied, <hi>a regarding what the Lord ſaith.</hi> It noteth a diligent attention, even a liſtening unto Chriſt's voice.

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:002260_0121_0FDADFC4EEF35920"/>2. In <hi>this</hi> hearing <hi>

He <hi>that heareth my voice, that</hi> is, <hi>that knoweth</hi> that it is the voice of Chriſt which is ſpeaking <hi>to</hi> him, as John 10.3. <hi>The ſheep hear his voice</hi>; and <hi>then</hi> verſe 4. <hi>For they know his voice,</hi> and verſ. 5. <hi>But they know not the voice of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> That <hi>then</hi> is meant by <hi>hearing the voice of Chriſt,</hi> even a knowing <hi>that</hi> it is his voice, ſo as to be able to diſcern it from all other <hi>contrary voices.</hi> Except a man be able to diſtinguiſh between the voice of Chriſt, and of Satan; between <hi>the</hi> good <hi>motions</hi> of the Spirit of Chriſt, and the ſinful <hi>motions</hi> of <hi>the evil Spirit,</hi> he cannot be ſaid <hi>to</hi> hear and open <hi>to</hi> Chriſt. Thus the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles, It is the voice of my Beloved that knocketh.</hi> Chriſt no ſooner ſpake, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhe knew whoſe voice it was <hi>that</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to her, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2.

            <p n="3">3.

thing. Thus he <hi>that</hi> hears <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſubmits to the Authority of his Commands: <hi>Let me bear ſway in thy heart,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſuffer me to bear rule in my own houſe, to be King in my own Throne.</hi> Now where <hi>Chriſts</hi> voice is duly heard, the Soul doth not reſiſt, but yields it ſelf to <hi>this</hi> Command of his.</p>
            <p>Therefore laſtly, herein <hi>Believing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</hi> The door is ſet open to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when <hi>the heart doth by Faith</hi> receive him: Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is nothing elſe but a free, willing kind entertainment of Chriſt into <hi>the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

When the door of <hi>the heart</hi> is freely ſet open for Chriſt to come in, and lodge there, this is believing. As a Friend willingly <hi>ſets</hi> open <hi>the</hi> door <hi>to</hi> his Friend, he ſaith <hi>Is it you?

            <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>How doth it appear, that they are happy that do thus open to Jeſus Chriſt</hi>?</p>
            <p>

this, both which are mentioned in the <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In <hi>that</hi> he <hi>that</hi> doth thus open his heart to Chriſt, ſhall have <hi>union</hi> with him; <hi>I will come unto him,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſo as to dwell with him, ſo as to live in him.</hi> I will <hi>come to</hi> him, <hi>not</hi> as a Sojourner, but as an <hi>Inhabitant.</hi> Such an ones heart ſhall be my houſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>He dwelleth in the heart by faith.</hi> Now union <hi>with Chriſt</hi> is a bleſſed <hi>thing.</hi> Happy they <hi>that</hi> have this glorious Dignity belonging <hi>to them</hi>; for if a Soul be united <hi>to</hi> Chriſt, there is union with God alſo, <hi>the</hi> Eternal Fountain of all life and happineſs. Hence is <hi>that,</hi> 1 Theſ 1.1. <hi>To the Church which is in God, and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He <hi>that</hi> is in Chriſt, is <hi>in God</hi> alſo: If there be union with the <hi>Son,</hi> there is union with the <hi>Father</hi>; for the Son and the Father are one.

<pb n="100" facs="unknown:002260_0124_0FDADFCBBA7E0F60"/>
happineſs of thoſe that thus entertain Chriſt, as hath been opened to you, is <hi>that</hi> they ſhall enjoy <hi>Communion with him.</hi> This is here expreſſed by <hi>ſupping.

from Eating, Drinking, <hi>Supping</hi> or <hi>Feaſting</hi> (for it was the Eaſtern manner in old <hi>times,</hi> to have their great Feaſts, not at noon, but at night; not at dinner, but at ſupper; I ſay the glory of Heaven is ſet forth by the ſimilitude of a great and ſumptuous Feaſt; ſo 'tis here in my Text.</p>
            <p>But thus much ſhall ſuffice for the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinal handling of this point, we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude only with one Uſe of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> &amp; let it be in the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 24.7. <hi>Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory ſhall enter in.</hi> That Text indeed is firſtly and tipically to be underſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the doors of the Sanctuary being ſet open for the Ark to enter in, and then fulfilled, when the Eternal gates of the higheſt Heaven were ſet open, for Chriſt the King of Glory to enter in at his Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and laſtly are to be applied to mens opening the doors of their hearts, that Chriſt may come in there: Oh then be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted this day, to ſet open the everlaſting doors of your Souls, that Chriſt the King of Glory may come in.

            <p>Conſider 1. <hi>That Christ is importunate in the motion which he maketh, that he might

Now this importunity ſhould be a <hi>Motive</hi> to prevail with you, to open your hearts unto Jeſus Chriſt; for our importunity doth prevail with him to open the door of Heaven to us, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.5.—10 therefore his importunity ſhould prevail with us to open the door of our hearts to him.

If a Friend ſhould come from a far Countrey to viſit you, ſure you would not ſhut him out of doors? Behold Chriſt hath come from Heaven to the Earth to viſit that Soul of thine, and wilt thou give him no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment? Nay, he hath given his life for thee, and that's more than the life of all the Angels in Heaven, and wilt thou regard him now?

The very company of a godly wiſe man is profitable; but what then is Chriſts company; Chriſt never cometh empty-handed into any houſe, into any heart; no, but he cometh with both hands full of bleſſings. We read that when the Ark was in the houſe of <hi>Obed-edom,</hi> God bleſſed <hi>Obed-edom</hi>; and bleſſed his houſe, and bleſſed all that he had, becauſe of the Ark of God which was in his houſe.

My ſerious counſel to you is, get Jeſus Chriſt into your hearts; and if Chriſt be there, let the Devil do his worſt, you need not fear him, Chriſt will gaurd the houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Devils of Hell, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy Soul againſt the Temptations of the evil one. In a word, if Chriſt come he, he will bring Salvation along with him; therefore when Jeſus Chriſt was received into <hi>Zacheus</hi> his houſe, it was ſaid, <hi>This day is Salvation come to this houſe,</hi> Luke 19.9. Oh happy Soul! where Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be entertained.</p>
            <p>Conſider. 5. <hi>The evil and danger which is in refuſing to entertain Jeſus Christ:</hi> Every knock that Chriſt hath given at thy door, will ſink thy Soul ſo much the deeper into Hell, if thou refuſeſt him now. You may ſlight Chriſt, but the day is coming, when ſlight him if you can or dare. They that were invited to the Marriage-Feaſt, <hi>made light of it,</hi> and went away, one to his Farm, and another to his Merchandize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mat.

22.5. ſo now, when the motion of the Goſpel is tendred to you, you may make light of it, and go away to your Shops and Ships, and buying and Selling, and never mind whether Chriſt be formed in you or no. But the day is at hand, when every neglect of Chriſt ſhall be heavier than Mountains of lead upon thy miſerable Soul. Be it alſo known to you, that if you will not hear Chriſt now, he will not hear you another day; ſee that ſolemn Scripture, and tremble at it, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.25, 27. <hi>When once the Master of the houſe it reſen up, and hath ſhut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, and to ſay, Lord, Lord, open to us: and he ſhall anſwer, I ſay unto you, I know you not, whence you are, depart from me all you workers of iniquity.</hi> Thus it will be at the laſt day, thou wilt cry, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to me!</hi> Oh, how thou wilt cry, <hi>Lord, Lord, let me go to Heaven:</hi> But the Lord will ſay to thee, Remember thou ſinful Wretch, remember, there was a time when I called to thee, but thou wouldeſt not open the door of thy heart to me, and therefore now the door of Heaven ſhall not be opened to thy Soul: Thou didſt not care for my company when time was, and therfore now <hi>depart from me.</hi>

Other houſes may ſtand empty, but the heart will not; either you muſt entertain Chriſt or the World, and the truth is, this is the reaſon why many give ſuch cold entertainment unto Chriſt, it is becauſe they are ſo hot in purſuing of the World: The World maketh ſuch a noiſe and lumber in their ears, that they cannot hear Chriſt knocking and calling upon them. Thus it was with <hi>Laodicea,</hi> they were ſo taken up with their goods and riches, that they had no leiſure to attend unto what Chriſt ſaid to them.

For men ſometimes have a contention, <hi>a ſtrife</hi> and conflict in their Spirits, what they ſhould do, or what courſe it is beſt for them to take. After this manner doth the Lord here ſpeak, ſaying, I will not always have <hi>a ſtrife and conflict in my Spirit</hi> about the children of men; I am now come to an iſſue about that matter, the thing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have the Reaſon of this Commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>For that he alſo is fleſh</hi>; this is the Reaſon why the Lords Spirit will ceaſe ſtriving. <hi>He is ſo,</hi> that is, <hi>man</hi> is ſo, yet, even mankind; and conſequently men of all ſorts and conditions, even Profeſſors of Religion as well as others, <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> as it is expreſſed in the former Verſe: There were ſome that were only <hi>the Son, of men,</hi> that is, ſuch us never minded God, nor did make any profeſſion of his name; others did profeſs the fear and worſhip of God, and theſe are called his Sons. Theſe words may have dependance on the la-Verſe of the fourth Chapter; where it is ſaid, that <hi>unto Seth there was born a Son-then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.</hi> The Poſterity of <hi>Cain</hi> were a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, irreligious Generation, but the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Seth</hi> were otherwiſe.

In the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the things of the Fleſh, are ſet in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>the things of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.5. So here in the Text we may obſerve a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret oppoſition between <hi>the Spirit and the Fleſh.</hi> The holy Spirit did move theſe ſinners to Repentance, he ſtirred up their hearts to that which is good; but inſtead of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motions of the holy Spirit, they did purſue only the Carnal, Senſual deſires of their own fleſhly and corrupt hearts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Lord threaten, that his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould no more ſtrive with them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have the Limitation of this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>yet his days ſhall be an hundred and twenty years.</hi> The meaning of which is not, that the age of man after the flood ſhould be ſuch a ſpace of time; for we read <hi>that</hi> many of the Patriarchs lived a longer ſpace of time than that is. But the meaning of it may be, that a hundred and twenty years ſhould be given to the World, and if in <hi>that</hi> ſpace they would repent and return, and make their peace with God, well and good; but if not, his Spirit would <hi>utterly</hi> forſake them, and remedileſs ruine ſhould befal them.</p>

The Lord alſo <hi>ſtriveth</hi> by outward <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi> upon men. Hence Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are called <hi>Gods contendings,</hi> Job 10.12. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, he would ſay unto God, ſhew me <hi>wherefore thou contendeſt with me.</hi> When the Lord Afflicts a ſinner, he doth as it were, commence a Suit in Law againſt him, he brings the Law to him, and ſheweth him, <hi>that</hi> he hath tranſgreſſed the Law. Thus doth he contend, thus doth he ſtrive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are the <hi>Inward ſtrivings</hi> of Gods Spirit. All thoſe common operations of the Spirit, which ſinners, yea, Reprobate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may be ſubject unto, are the ſecret bleſſed ſtrivings of the holy Ghoſt, with the
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:002260_0144_0FDADFFADF90F2A8"/>
Souls of men. There is indeed an inward, powerful, effectual, ſaving Operations of the Spirit upon the hearts of the Elect. I am not ſpeaking of <hi>that,</hi> but of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon works of the Spirit which ſinners may partake of. To inſtance a little: 1. <hi>There are ſome ſinners, that the holy Spirit doth greatly enlighten their minds.</hi> They have much knowledge in the things of God, they are made to underſtand what their duty is, even what they muſt do, <hi>that</hi> ſo they may pleaſe God, and be made happy for ever, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> They could not plead ignorance of the mind of God, the Lord had taken care that they ſhould be inſtructed, both in duties of the firſt and ſecond Table. Now all Conviction of duty is from the Spirit, yea, all <hi>Illumination</hi> in Divine things is from him; therefore the holy Ghoſt is called, <hi>the Spirit of Truth,</hi> becauſe all truth and all diſcovery of truth is from him. If a man be but enlightned, ſo as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Fundamental points in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, this is a great work of Gods Spirit. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>No man ſpeaking by the Spirit of God, calls Jeſus accurſed; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:002260_0145_0FDAE00247BAB2E0"/>
Becauſe if a man be but convinced, <hi>that</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the true Meſſiah, even the Son of God, and <hi>Lord</hi> of all, this Conviction is however a common work of the holy Ghoſt upon the mind. 2. <hi>The holy Ghoſt may cauſe terror to be in the Conſcience of a ſinner</hi>: That then is a ſecond way how the Spirit doth ſtrive inwardly, it is he that doth <hi>convince the world of ſin,</hi> Joh. 16.8. All Conviction of ſin and miſery, is from the Spirit. Sometimes the holy Spirit cometh and reaſons the caſe with a poor ſinner, till at laſt he is ſilenced by the Evidence and Demonſtration of the Spirit; from the <hi>which Convincements,</hi> ſecret, awful terrors do ariſe. Hence the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>the Spirit of Bondage unto fear,</hi> Rom. 8.15. The holy Spirit convinceth a ſinner that his preſent condition is miſerable; ſo as <hi>that</hi> if he doth not get out of it, he muſt periſh to all e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence diſmal fears do ariſe in the Soul; the ſinner crieth out in the horror of his heart, <hi>I am a damned Wretch for ever, if death ſhould find me in this eſtate.</hi> Now theſe terrible awakenings of Conſcien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> are the mighty ſtrivings of the Spirit. An inſtance we have of this in <hi>Felix,</hi> Acts 24.25. As <hi>Paul reaſoned of Righteouſneſs, Temperance &amp; Judgment, Felix trembled.</hi> This <hi>Felix</hi> had been a very unrighteous and intemperate man, and did at that time live in unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and thence hearing <hi>Paul</hi> preach and

prove, <hi>that there is a Judgment to come,</hi> wherein all ſuch ſinners ſhall be puniſhed, he even trembled. Terror and trembling ſeized upon his guilty Conſcience, at the ſad thought of this. 3. <hi>The holy Spirit may ſo work upon the heart of a ſinner, as to cauſe ſome good affections to work within him.</hi> Many have ſome faint, languid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſome cold wiſhes and wouldings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Grace and life, <hi>that</hi> yet never did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience a ſaving work of the Spirit upon them. Now theſe ſweet affections and workings of heart after that which is good, are from the holy Ghoſt. Thus we ſee in thoſe Jews, <hi>John</hi> 5.35. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſay they) <hi>give us evermore of this bread.</hi> When they heard of the bread of Life, even ſuch Bread, <hi>that</hi> if a man eat, he ſhall never dye, preſently their affections were ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and marvellouſly taken for a while, but it laſted not. So the ſtony ground hearer, <hi>received the word with joy,</hi> Mat. 13.21. he was much affected with the ſweet promiſes of the Goſpel, yet this laſted not.

and earneſt</hi> workings of heart towards God, when the good fit was upon them, but all died away, and came to nothing at laſt. Yea, even <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelf had his good affections and good wiſhes when time was, Numb. 23.10. <hi>Let me dye the death of the righteous; let my laſt end be like his.</hi> Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am in a good pang, could wiſh himſelf in the condition that righteous men are in: Many there are that have ſuch <hi>Balaamitical flaſhes.</hi> 4. <hi>The holy Spirit may ſo far ſtrive with a ſinner, as to ſtir up good purpoſes and reſolutions of Soul, to be, and to do better.</hi> As we ſee by them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Thou ſaidſt, I will not tranſgreſs, when,</hi> &amp;c: They pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and promiſed, that they would no more commit ſuch and ſuch ſins, yet when the Temptation came, they committed thoſe very ſins, which they had reſolved againſt. Now good purpoſes are from the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. As evil purpoſes are from Satan, ſo good purpoſes are from God; and uſually it is ſo, that if God ſtrive outwardly by his Word or Works, he doth alſo ſtrive inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by cauſing Convictions, Terrors, good Affections and Reſolutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This we ſee in them, Pſal. 78 34. to 38. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, they enquired ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after God, nevertheleſs they did flatter him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue; for their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>

How common is it for ſinners in their diſtreſs to purpoſe, and to promiſe better obedience, when ſickneſs is upon <hi>them,</hi> when they ſee Death and Eternity before their Eyes, when they ſee Hell gaping for them, and Devils ready to ſeize upon their guilty ſouls; then Oh, if God will but ſpare them this once, it ſhall be ſeen how holy they will be; &amp; yet if the Lord doth deliver them, they are as bad or worſe than ever they were, forgetting that the vows of God are upon them.</p>
            <p>We come therefore in the ſecond place, <hi>to ſhew that the Spirit of God may ceaſe ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with men.</hi> This is expreſſed here in the Text, where God ſaith, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not ſtrive always.</hi> Now we muſt not think, that this was a thing peculiar unto thoſe times of the old World only. But God doth in the like caſe deal after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with ſinners in all ages of the World. The Dealings and Diſpenſations of God in ages of old, were to be Typical and Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative to ſucceeding Generations. Hence is that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. <hi>All theſe things hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They might have lived many a day, and many a year, but death cut them down afore their time; and then did the Lord fulfil this threatning,

If once the Lord ſend the Meſſenger of death, as it were, with an Ax, to lay the ſinner even with the ground, then there is no more <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi> about ſuch an one, that is to ſay, no more ſtrivings of the Lords Spirit with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sometimes the Spirit of God doth give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a ſinner, even whilſt in this life.</hi> Some there are, that the holy Spirit doth ceaſe ſtriving with them before, yea, long before death come upon them. This is an awful trembling Meditation, yet a truth needful to be inſiſted on; you ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hear ſome inſtances for the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof.

And ſo for <hi>Eſau, You know how that afterward, when he would have inherited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Bleſſing, he was rejected; for he found no place for Repentance, though he ſought it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with tears,</hi> Heb. 12.17. Alas, he came too late. If <hi>Eſau</hi> had come a little ſooner, he had certainly had the Bleſſing; but ſince he came when it was too late, though he begged with tears in his eyes, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would repent him of what was done in bleſſing <hi>Jacob,</hi> and pronounce the bleſſing upon him, yet he could not obtain it. Now in this there was a Myſtery; it was to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that if ſinners do out-ſtand their day, then though they ſhould ſeek the Bleſſings of Life, and Grace, and Happineſs, (all which were ſignified by the Bleſſings which <hi>Eſau</hi> loſt) it will be in vain for them.

Its true, the revealed day of Grace is, whilſt the day of Life, and the means of Grace do continue; but the ſecret day of Grace is according to the ſtrivings of the holy Spirit, or his Determination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſinner, never more to ſtrive with him.

therefore there are that out-live their day: So did the wretched-Jews, therefore Jeſus Chriſt ſaid of them, and he wept when he ſaid it, <hi>Oh that thou hadst known in this thy day, the things that do belong unto thy peace, but now are they hid from thine eyes,</hi> Luke 19.44. Alas, they had a day, but they knew it not until their day was done: That was a ſad word indeed, when Chriſt ſaid to them, <hi>Now are they hid from thy eyes.</hi> You will ſay, but <hi>who are they whoſe day is done</hi>? The Anſwer unto that hath been in part given already, in ſhewing <hi>when</hi> it is that the Spirit ceaſeth ſtriving. Indeed we cannot ſay of this or that particular man (except he be one that hath committed the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt) that the holy Spirit will ſtrive no more with him: For, <hi>Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or who hath been his Counſellor</hi>? Iſa. 40.13. <hi>Secret things belong to the Lord,</hi> &amp; <hi>not to us.</hi> Nevertheleſs, there are ſome that have ſad cauſe to fear and tremble, leſt thus it ſhould be with them.</p>

            <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>They that have ſinned away many and great Convictions of Conſcience.</hi> Oh think of it! for there are ſome of you that have been under Convictions. It may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the World hath awakened thy

I remember I have read a diſmal ſtory concerning a man that fell into the ſin of Drunkenneſs: <q>And firſt when he committed that ſin, his Conſcience was much troubled about it; but it was ſuggeſted to him, that if he would now in deſpite of thoſe Convictions, commit the ſame ſin again, he ſhould be never more troubled for it: The poor Wretch did ſo, &amp; found it lamentably true; for after that, he could be drunk as oft as he

            <p n="2">2. <hi>This ſadly concerns thoſe that are Revolters from Profeſſion and Religion.</hi> It is to be feared, that the holy Spirit will ceaſe ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them: This was <hi>Sauls</hi> caſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11. <hi>He is turned back from following me,</hi> ſaith the Lord.

There have been lamentable inſtances of men that have turned away from their Profeſſion of Religion, and have thereupon been given up by God to a Reprobate ſenſe.

So concerning <hi>the</hi> Jews, when God was reſolved againſt them, he ſaid to his Prophet, <hi>Pray not thou for this people, for I will not hear thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.14. The Lord by a ſecret wonderful Providence, is wont to move the hearts of his praying people, in their Supplications before him, according to what is in his own heart to do. The <hi>Spirit of Prayer</hi> is alſo <hi>the Spirit of Propheſie</hi>; hence from the Spirit of Prayer we may conjecture, how it is like to fare with ſinners. Conſider of it, thou haſt a

            <p>Here conſider a few things:</p>
            <p>Conſider. 1. <hi>That Gods Spirit will not always strive</hi>: Oh let theſe words ſound in thy ears, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord will not always ſtrive.</hi> Nay it may be, he will <hi>ſtrive no longer</hi>; Who knoweth, but that thy <hi>day</hi> may at this <hi>hour be</hi> ſhutting upon thee? If thou doſt not <hi>now</hi> reſolve in good earneſt to turn unto the Lord, it may be after this Sermon is ended, God will reſolve againſt thee, that his Spirit ſhall never ſtrive more with thee: Think ſadly on that awful Scripture, <hi>Ezek</hi> 24.13. <hi>Becauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be purged from thy filthineſs any more, till I have cauſed my fury
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:002260_0167_0FDAE01A5FD736F0"/>
to rest upon thee.</hi> God hath been purging of thee, and thou waſt not purged; that is to ſay, he hath been uſing means, and ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thee, that ſo thy Soul might be converted, and yet thou remaineſt a Carnal Creature ſtill: Fear leſt God ſhould ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt not be purged any more</hi>; thou ſhalt not have my Spirit to ſtrive with thee any <hi>longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider. 2. <hi>That if it ſhould be ſo, that Gods Spirit ſhould ceaſe striving with thee, thou art then utterly undone forever</hi>: For when the Lord doth ceaſe ſtriving with men, he doth <hi>even ſwear in his wrath</hi> againſt them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.11. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom I ſware in my wrath, [if] they enter into my reſt.</hi> Saith the Lord, [if] thoſe ſinners <hi>enter</hi> into reſt, then let me not be accounted God any longer: Oh thou ſinful Creature, if the Lord ſhould be provoked <hi>in his wrath to ſwear</hi> againſt thee, then as ſure as God is God thou ſhalt be damned. A man may ſay a thing, and yet poſſibly go back, but if he ſwear, he will not go from his word: So the Lord ſpeaking after the manner of men, is ſaid to ſwear againſt ſome ſinners, to ſhew his unalterable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination againſt them, <hi>when he hath ſworn, he will not repent,</hi> Pſal. 110.4. Alas, this day of Grace is paſt, if the holy Spirit
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:002260_0168_0FDAE05A2B64A098"/>
ſhould for ever ceaſe ſtriving with thee; and then no Prayers, nor Crys, nor Tears will avail for mercy. There is a Scripture, which methinks ſhould ſtrike cold to the heart of many an unconverted ſinner that hears me this day; it is that in the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the 28 Verſe, <hi>Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me.</hi> This was fulfilled upon the Jews, therefore did Chriſt ſay to them, <hi>Ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall dye in your ſins: whither I go you cannot come,</hi> John 8.21. Alas, they did not come till the door of Mercy was ſhut upon them. Had they ſought God <hi>early in the morning,</hi> they might have found him, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.17. But it was <hi>early in the evening,</hi> that is to ſay, preſently after the day of Grace was done that they ſought, and then found him not: O Remember <hi>Eſau, he cryed with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and ſaid to his Father, Bleſs me, even me alſo, O my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Gen. 27.34. But then it was too late, and therefore all crys were in vain. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member alſo how it was with the Children of <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 1.45. <hi>Ye returned and wept before the Lord, but the Lord would not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</hi> They
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:002260_0169_0FDAE022D4CD64C8"/>
would not when they might, and therefore when they would, God ſaid them nay. God commanded them to enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but they refuſed; afterwards they would gladly have done it, but then it was too late: Though they prayed and wept, yet they had ſinned away the offer of Grace, and the Lord was then become <hi>inexorable.</hi> Thus if men come after the day of Grace is over, though they ſhould weep Seas of tears of blood, all would be in vain; <hi>for time is gone then.</hi> 
               <q>As I remember I have ſome-where read of a woman that had been guilty of Adultery, and it pleaſed God to terrifie her Conſcience, and then ſhe cryed out, <hi>Oh time is gone!</hi> and many Miniſters were ſent for, to ſee if they could apply any word of Comfort, but ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Conſider. 3. <hi>That whilst the Spirit of God doth continue striving, there is a day of Grace vouchſafed to you.</hi> Some poor Soul that trembleth at the Word of God, is ready to ſay, Alas, this is my doleful caſe, I fear my

Say not ſo, if Gods Spirit be ſtriving with thee, thy time is not gone: If thou haſt now at laſt a ſerious purpoſe to return to God by Jeſus Chriſt, be of good comfort: &amp; in the name of the Lord be it ſpoken to thee, thy day of Grace is not done, but there is Mercy and Salvation to to be had for thee, if thou wilt upon graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous terms accept of it: Behold now is the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation; therefore Improve your <hi>now,</hi> without any further put off.

            <p>THE uſual method obſerved by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles, is, firſt to diſcourſe Doctrinally, and then Practically; and ſo he doth in this
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:002260_0171_0FDAE0240F9D96D0"/>
Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> The two firſt Chapters are Doctrinal, and the two laſt are practical.</p>
            <p>This Chapter then doth contain matter of Exhortation unto duty. 1. We have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>Oeconomical</hi> Precept, even a rule concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Houſhold-Government, (which in the former Chapter the Apoſtle had been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of,) <hi>verſ.</hi> 1.2. He lays down ſundry <hi>general Moral Precepts,</hi> which concern Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, in whatever ſtate or relation they may ſtand in.</p>
            <p>And here the Apoſtle doth exhort. 1. To the practice of <hi>that</hi> great duty of prayer, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and in ſpecial <hi>that</hi> they would pray for him, <hi>verſe</hi> 3, 4.2. He exhorts unto Chriſtian Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>And <hi>that</hi> is the ſcope of this verſe, in <hi>which we</hi> have three things: 1. The duty exhorted unto, namely, Wiſe Walking, <hi>Walk in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> that is, cautelouſly and circumſpectly, as it is expreſſed by the ſame Apoſtle, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> ch. 5. ver. 16.2. We have the object of this duty, <hi>towards them that are without,</hi> that is Infidels, who are out of the Pale of the viſible Church. The Church is compared to an Houſe, hence they <hi>that</hi> are of the Church, are ſaid to be <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> that is, within doors, in reſpect of that ſacred Houſe of the Church; and them that do not belong to the viſible Church, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be <hi>without,</hi> that is, they are not admitted
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:002260_0172_0FDAE05D1665E300"/>
within doors, but are kept out of the Temple.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is that which is the ſpecial work and evidence of this Wiſdom, namely, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the time,</hi> which are the words, that by Gods help, we are to ſpeak of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Time</hi> is ſometimes taken for ſpace of time. Sometimes it's taken for <hi>opportunity of time</hi>; it is the ſame with <hi>Seaſon.</hi> It may be taken both ways here, and eſpecially in the latter ſenſe; for the Greek word is not KRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOS, the uſual word for time, but KAI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROS, which ſignifieth Seaſon or Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> which the words do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford unto us, is this;
<q>That it is a great part of Chriſtian Wiſdom, timely to improve Opportunities and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Grace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Intending to diſpatch the point at this time, we ſhall in the Doctrinal proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, only ſpeak to two things, 1. What thoſe ſeaſons are which ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. 2. What is implied in redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſons of Grace; or when a man may be ſaid to redeem the time.</p>

               </gap>. 1. <hi>What are thoſe ſeaſons which ought to be improved</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>A mans life-time in this World is to be improved.</hi> Thus Chriſt hath taught
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:002260_0173_0FDAE02589070130"/>
us by his own <hi>unerring example,</hi> John 9.4. <hi>I muſt work while it is day, the night cometh when no man can work.</hi> A mans life is but a ſeaſon, even a day which ſhall have a night follow it; and therefore it is to be improved: Yea, and it is but a ſhort ſeaſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.30. <hi>The time is ſhort.</hi> He that hath longeſt to live, yet hath but a ſhort time to be in this World; therefore <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>What is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, and then vaniſheth away,</hi> chap. 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Behold thou haſt made my days an hand breadth, and mine age is as nothing before thee,</hi> Pſal. 39.5. A mans time in this World is as nothing before God, that is to ſay, as nothing in compariſon of Eternity; therefore this time ought ſo much the more carefully &amp; diligently to be improved; and it may be a mans time is much ſhorter than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth think for. We read of one in the Goſpel that was to fooliſh, as to dream of many years, when as he had not ſo much as one day to live: He ſaid he had goods for many, not only days, but years, when as before this next day, his Soul was taken from him, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.20. Beſides, when a mans life is once gone, it is irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, men muſt dye, and out of this World they ſhall go, and yet they <hi>dye but once,</hi> Heb. 9.27. <hi>It is appointed for men</hi> [once]
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:002260_0174_0FDAE05E888FA680"/>
               <hi>to dye:</hi> When once men are dead, <hi>the places that have known them, ſhall know them no more; the eyes that have ſeen them, ſhall ſee them no more; and the ears that have heard them, ſhall hear them no more.</hi> And thence if men do not improve their time whilſt they are alive in the World, they loſe their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ever. When death is come, it is then too late to improve time; therefore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>They that go down into the pit. cannot hope for thy truth,</hi> Iſa 38 18. When a mans body is gone down into the pit of the grave, and his ſoul is gone down into the pit of Hell, he is paſt hope, &amp; paſt help; he cannot hope for Gods mercy, he cannot hope for pardon of ſin, he cannot hope for the ſalvation of his ſoul. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore life-time is to be improved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Time ſet apart for the ſolemn Worſhip of God, are carefully to be improved.</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ought to redeem time from their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, to attend the duties of their general Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; they ought not to ſerve themſelves only, but they muſt look to it, that they allow themſelves time alſo for the ſervice of God. It is true, that ſome are ſo much in the outward performance of religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as that they do thereby intrench upon their particular callings, ſpending more time in outward Worſhip, than any rule of God doth require, or allow them to do: So the <hi>Heretical Euchites</hi> of old, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:002260_0175_0FDAE0270E15F118"/>
part of men err on the other hand, in allowing too little time, rather than too much, for the performance of ſacred duties. But it is a great point of Chriſtian wiſdom, to order things aright about this matter; ſo as that neither a mans particular calling may intrench upon his general calling as a Chriſtian, nor yet his general upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. I ſay, that time muſt be allowed for the Worſhip of God. A man may not neglect the Worſhip of God, either in his Family, or in his Cloſet, or in the publick Aſſemblies of his people, out of pretence <hi>that</hi> he wants time; rather let a man deny himſelf time to ſleep, nay time to eat and drink, than not to take time to pray, and to ſerve God. Moreover, when a man is worſhipping God in any duty, ſuch a ſeaſon is very heedfully to be improved, elſe the Lords name will be taken in vain; and men inſtead of ſerving and pleaſing God, will provoke him to diſpleaſure by an heedleſs ſerving of him. And in ſpecial, the Lords Day is a ſeaſon of Grace which ought to be improved, that's the day appointed to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize the Name and Worſhip of God in Chriſt amongſt men, to the end of the World, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118 24. <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will rejoyce in it:</hi> The day of Chriſts Reſurrection, which was upon the firſt-day of the week, even this very day is to be obſerved, in Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:002260_0176_0FDAE0600E343B00"/>
of the Reſurrection and Redemption of Chriſt: <hi>This is the day,</hi> which above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ought to be prized and improved: It is a Market-day for the Soul, and therefore to be redeemed. Beſides, if men take hold of opportunities, to attend there where God is worſhipped, they come where the Lord himſelf cometh, and thence may hope for a bleſſing: In which reſpect ſuch ſeaſons ſhould earneſtly be laid hold on. You read in the fifth of <hi>John,</hi> concerning an impotent man that lay waiting at the Pools of <hi>Betheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and Chriſt finding him there, he was healed. Had not the man layen at the Pools of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> Chriſt had not found him there, and had not Chriſt found him there, he had not been healed. Now the Ordinances of God are the Pools of <hi>Betheſda</hi>; if Chriſt find men there, who knoweth but that Grace and Life may be given into their ſouls; but if they be not there, they keep themſelves out of the way of a bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The time of proſperity is a ſeaſon which ought to be well improve.</hi> Thus you find <hi>David</hi> calling upon the Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 Chron. 22.11, 18, 19. <hi>Is not the Lord your God with you? hath he not given you reſt on every ſide? now ſet your heart and your ſoul to ſeek the Lord your God.</hi> It is (ſaith he) a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſeaſon with you, and therefore now be looking after God, &amp; the things of God; and indeed this is the moſt commodious ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:002260_0177_0FDAE028A4F906E0"/>
Husbandmen you know will take the ſeaſon whilſt the Sun ſhineth, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is favourable, to be gathering in the fruits of the earth: So if men would be laying in for Eternity, if they would be lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in ſtore for themſelves a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation againſt the time to come, <hi>that</hi> they may lay hold of Eternal Life, it will be their wiſdom to improve the time of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity in order thereunto. As now, if God give unto a man a time of health &amp; ſtrength, let him improve it, in order to making his peace with God, and promoting the Eternal welfare of his own Soul. Thus the Holy Ghoſt by <hi>Solomon</hi> doth exhort, Eccleſ. 12.1. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy Creator</hi>; Ay, but when? When old age cometh, or when ſickneſs or death cometh, but never before <hi>that</hi>; to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heart ſaith, and ſo the Devil ſaith, but the Lord teacheth otherwiſe; therefore it is added, <hi>In the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou ſhalt ſay, I have no pleaſure in them.</hi> The evil days of ſickneſs, or the troubleſome years of old age will come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; but ſee <hi>that</hi> you remember to make your <hi>peace with God,</hi> before thoſe days come. So again, if the Lord beſtow upon a man an eſtate, &amp; cauſe him <hi>to</hi> proſper in <hi>the World</hi> in <hi>that</hi> reſpect, let him improve this, <hi>to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God with his ſubſtance, and wiſely make unto himſelf Friends in Heaven, with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unrighteous
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:002260_0178_0FDAE065825029C0"/>
Mammon of this World.</hi> And truly if men do neglect ſuch ſeaſons, they have no reaſon to expect other, but <hi>that</hi> God will deprive <hi>them</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> and alter the tenor of his glorious Diſpenſations towards them. As it was ſaid to <hi>Heſter, who knoweth whether thou art come to the Kingdom for ſuch a time as this? if thou altogether holdeſt thy peace at this time, thou and thy Fathers houſe ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> Eſth. 4.14. So I ſay, who knoweth but <hi>that the</hi> Lord hath given men health and wealth, and proſpered <hi>them</hi> here and there in <hi>the</hi> World, <hi>that</hi> ſo they might improve theſe mercies and good things, to the honour of him <hi>that</hi> gave them, and for their own Spiritual and Eternal comfort; If therefore they altogether neglect this ſeaſon, let them look <hi>that</hi> God will blaſt their eſtates, and ſmite them with ſickneſs, yea, and that a worſe thing ſhall befal <hi>them.</hi> Nevertheleſs,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The time of Adverſity is a ſeaſon which ought likewiſe to he improved.</hi> Hence this Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Redeem the time, becauſe the days are evil,</hi> Eph. 5.16. The times were then as they are now. It was in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days a time of perſecution and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the people of God, therefore he calls that time an <hi>evil day.</hi> Now in this ſeaſon, time was to be redeemed; the worſe the times are, the better Chriſtians ought to be; if the times be very bad, Chriſtians ought to be very good. Hence alſo is that, 2 Tim. 4.
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:002260_0179_0FDAE02A05E29F50"/>
2. <hi>Preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon</hi> In ſeaſon, is in time of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; out of ſeaſon is a time of Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when a man cannot preach, nor hear a Sermon, without incurring danger; yet ſuch times muſt be improved to be doing &amp; receiving good. If the times be bad, then the Lord threatens men, to deprive them of ſeaſons of Grace, and in <hi>that</hi> reſpect there is the more need to improve them. And this is a ſpecial thing intended by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the Text. <hi>Walk in wiſdom redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time.</hi> Shew your wiſdom (ſaith he) <hi>by making the beſt of a bad Market.</hi> As <hi>wiſe</hi> Merchants, if the times be bad, will be more wary; if Trading be dead and low they will be loth to venture upon a bad bargain, or to let ſlip the advantage of a good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Thus ſhould men deal as to their ſouls; as for ſeaſons of grace, they ſhould ſee <hi>that</hi> they husband them well, eſpecially when the Lord is threatning to take them away.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Times of being in company and converſe with others, ought to be improved.</hi> Such times ſhould be improved for the receiving of Spiritual good. It is ſaid. <hi>He that walks with the wiſe, ſhall be wiſe,</hi> Prov. 13.20. If a man doth fall into the company of ſuch as are godly and wiſe, he hath now an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity put into his hands to get wiſdom; he might propound many profitable Queſtions,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:002260_0180_0FDAE066DBBC1130"/>
which he is not able to reſolve himſelf, but one <hi>that</hi> God hath given a greater meaſure of wiſdom and underſtanding unto, could ſoon reſolve him, had he an heart to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſuch an opportunity. Again, ſuch times ſhould be improved for doing good, that is, by holy Conference and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto the thing that good is; as we ſee in the Context, <hi>Redeem the time,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, and then the very next words are, <hi>Let your ſpeech be always with grace, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with ſalt, that ye may know how ye ought to anſwer every man,</hi> Col. 4.6. So then that's one way of improving time aright, even by gracious and ſavoury diſcourſes The neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this is the great ſin of many Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. Alas, how is it, as if <hi>holy Conference</hi> were baniſhed out of the World? Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But what ſaith the Scripture? <hi>Exhort one another daily,</hi> Heb. 3.13. <hi>As you have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of daily converſe, you ſhould take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to exhort and call upon one another, and ſay, How is it with you as to Spirituals? have you got aſſurance yet? do you grow in grace?</hi> How is it with your Soul, doth that proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Solitary times are alſo to be improved.</hi> I ſay, not only times of being in Company, but times of being alone, are to be improved.
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:002260_0181_0FDAE02B9A8DE5B8"/>
Such ſeaſons ſhould be made uſe of for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Meditation, and Self-Examination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We read concerning <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> that Chriſt ſaid to him, <hi>When thou waſt under the fig-tree, I ſaw thee</hi>; John 1.48. Though no mortal Eve beheld him, yet the Son of God <hi>that</hi> hath eyes like a flame of fire, looked upon him there: Jeſus Chriſt who is God as well as man, ſaw <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> when he was alone under the fig-tree: Indeed it is not ſaid what <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was doing there; but it is very probable, <hi>that</hi> he was praying or meditating, or about ſome ſuch holy deſign, <hi>that</hi> Chriſt ſhould take ſuch ſpecial notice of him. So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Iſaac,</hi> we read that he went out to <hi>meditate in the field,</hi> Gen. 24.63. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired himſelf into a ſolitary place, that ſo he might with the more freedom and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency practiſe that much naglected, and yet profitable duty of Meditation.

               </gap>ed example, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.23. <hi>He went up into a Mountain apart to pray, and when evening was come, he was there alone.</hi> And the truth is, that a time of privacy is the fitteſt ſeaſon for holy Converſe and Communion with
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:002260_0182_0FDADFA0155C2B90"/>
God, becauſe then a man may freely and fully open his whole heart to God. Men have their ſpecial corruptions, which it is <hi>not</hi> fit the World ſhould hear of; yea, all <hi>that</hi> are <hi>Chriſtians indeed,</hi> have their ſpecial and ſore Temptations that do moleſt them; as for looſe, formal Profeſſors, they may go on ſmoothly and eaſily; but as for ſuch as have taken up not only the form, but the power of godlineſs, they meet with many rubs and difficulties, &amp; ſtrong aſſaults from the great Enemy of Salvation; Now ſecret places are the fitteſt to complain to the Lord in about theſe temptations; therefore times of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, may and muſt be taken hold on by Chriſtians for ſuch an end.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>The time wherein Gods Spirit doth ſtrive with men is to be improved.</hi> There are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wherein the holy Spirit is bleſſedly at work with the heart: now theſe are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which ought carefully to be improved. If men be to ſet ſail, they muſt take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity when the wind ſerveth: So if they would be ſetting ſail towards Heaven, they muſt obſerve the gales of the Spirit; they muſt lay hold on the opportunity, wherein the bleſſed breathings of the Spirit are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to them. Theſe ſhould be improved in order to Repentance, leſt haply the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord do forſake a man, and give him up to the hardneſs of his own heart for ever; as you have lately heard that with
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:002260_0183_0FDAE02D01489918"/>
ſome ſinners it is ſo. And theſe ſeaſons ought to be improved for prayer, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Pray always, in every ſeaſon,</hi> as the Greek phraſe is, <hi>watching thereunto,</hi> &amp;c. You muſt watch when the Spirit of God ſtirs you up to prayer, and then upon your knees ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Lord by his Spirit ſecretly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth unto prayer, yea ſometimes he puts the heart into a praying frame: Now that's a ſeaſon of Grace which may not be neglected without great danger to a mans Soul.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>The preſent time is that which ſhould carefully be improved:</hi> So <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Remember</hi> [now] <hi>thy Creator.</hi> Men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially young men, when they are called upon <hi>to</hi> be mindful of God, &amp; the things of <hi>God,</hi> &amp; <hi>the</hi> great concernments of their Souls, are apt to <hi>put</hi> it off till <hi>to morrow,</hi> or <hi>ſometime hereafter</hi>; but the holy Ghoſt ſaith <hi>now.</hi> Mind this matter without any further delays; Do not think to put off God with <hi>Excuſes,</hi> or with <hi>To morrows,</hi> but the firſt thing you do, make ſure of an intereſt in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now is the accepted time!

Herein is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>An heart to receive and do all the good that may be.</hi> Except <hi>there</hi> be an <hi>heart</hi> to receive Spiritual good when it is offered, a man cannot be ſaid <hi>to</hi> redeem time; as <hi>Solomon</hi> complains, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.16. <hi>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wiſdom, ſeeing he hath no heart to it.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is ſo, <hi>that</hi> there is a precious Sermon Preached at a mans door; if he would come and hear, who <hi>knoweth</hi> how much good might be done <hi>to</hi> his Soul: But he <hi>cometh not,</hi> and <hi>yet hath</hi> no <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> reaſon <hi>to</hi> excuſe himſelf, only <hi>he hath no heart to it</hi>; therefore he is not worthy <hi>to</hi> be accounted a <hi>Time-redeemer.</hi> So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>there</hi> muſt be a <hi>heart to do good.</hi> As the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to them who are of the houſhold of Faith.</hi> When a man <hi>doth</hi> ſeriouſly and conſcienciouſly think with himſelf, <hi>How may I improve my time and talent moſt to the honour of God and good men, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of my own Soul, in the great day, and doth accordingly</hi>; ſuch an one doth <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the time.</hi> Though a man ſhould be providentially <hi>diſappointed</hi> as to actual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, <hi>yet</hi> if indeed he <hi>hath an heart</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="unknown:002260_0185_0FDAE031C4D32350"/>
to lay hold on <hi>opportunities</hi> of receiving or doing <hi>Spiritual</hi> good, he is a <hi>Time-redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Herein is implied, <hi>Wiſdom to diſcern of Times and Seaſons.</hi> As it is ſaid of <hi>the</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſſachar, that they had underſtanding of the times to know what Iſrael ought to do,</hi> 1 Chron. 12.32. There is no redeeming <hi>the</hi> time without wiſdom; therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Walk wiſely, redeeming the time:</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A wiſe mans heart diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth both time and judgment,</hi> Eccleſ. 8.5. As in Civil affairs, except a man know when the <hi>Market</hi> is, how ſhould he take hold of the opportunity while the Market is up, to buy and furniſh himſelf with what he ſtands in need of: So if a man hath not wiſdom to diſcern of times and ſeaſons, he will never improve them aright; hence Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of the Jews, <hi>How is it that you do not diſcern this time,</hi> Luke 12.56. and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.43, 44. <hi>If thou hadſt known in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace. Thou knoweſt not the time of thy viſitation:</hi> They did not improve their day of Grace; therefore are ſaid, <hi>not to know their time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Herein is implied, <hi>A willingneſs to part with thoſe things that would hinder from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or doing good.</hi> The Greek word which is here uſed, ſignifieth to <hi>buy.</hi> Now in buying there is always a parting with ſomething; as the Goſpel ſpeaketh of the wiſe Merchant, that <hi>he parted with all that
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:002260_0186_0FDADF86815E2C88"/>
he had for the Pearl of great price</hi>; So it is in buying or <hi>redeeming time,</hi> there muſt be a parting with thoſe things that would make a man loſe his time. The Original word is a Metaphor taken from wiſe Merchants or Tradeſmen, that prefer their profit above their eaſe and pleaſure. So if a man would <hi>redeem time,</hi> he muſt forego thoſe things which would hinder him from glorifying God, or that would keep him from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the eternal Salvation of his own Soul; yea, and he muſt be content to put himſelf to ſome trouble and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that he may promote the Spiritual and Eternal Welfare of other mens Souls; and this is here intended by the Apoſtle, <hi>Walk in Wiſdom towards them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, redeeming the time</hi>; as if he had ſaid, take hold of opportunities to gain Infidels to Chriſt, though it ſhould be to your own outward diſadvantage; ſee that you do what you can to gain men to Chriſt, though you your ſelves ſhould loſe by it, as to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral concerns.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When a man doth endeavour to make up <hi>his former loſſes and miſpence of time by a diligent improvement of the preſent ſeaſon,</hi> then he may be ſaid to redeem time; when a man hath lived and ſpent his time unthrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, but now he endeavours by double dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to redeem, and, as it were, to <hi>buy back again</hi> the time that's paſt and loſt;
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:002260_0187_0FDAE0334BE66AD0"/>
when he is made ſenſible, that he hath done little for God in former times, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavours to live much unto, and do much ſervice for God in Chriſt now, then he <hi>redeems time.</hi> As the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the laſt year of their being in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, diſpatched more way than in forty years before. So when a man doth more for God now in one year, than he hath done in twenty or forty years before: We may ſay that, that man <hi>Redeemeth time.</hi>

            <p>Come we to the Uſe of the point:</p>
            <p>Uſe I. <hi>Here is matter of ſad reproof unto thoſe that do miſpend precious time.</hi> You ſhall have ſome that ſay; They do ſuch a thing <hi>to paſs away time,</hi> &amp; ſuch a thing is <hi>very</hi> good <hi>to paſs away time.</hi> O lamantable! as if men had more precious time then they knew what in the World to do with, or how to beſtow it!

lived upon the face of the earth! Alas, there be that ſpend their time even in ſinful practices, for the which no time ought to be allowed. There is one practice which I hear much precious time is ſpent in, that I muſt <hi>needs</hi> bear my Teſtimony againſt: That which I mean, is thoſe unlawful Games of <hi>Cards</hi> and <hi>Dice</hi>: Thoſe <hi>Games</hi> have always been condemned by the Servants of God, as things that are in themſelves unlawful. I uſe not to tell you much what Fathers ſay, elſe I might ſay, that <hi>Cyprian, Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus, Ambroſs, Chriſoſtome, Austin,</hi> &amp;c. have of old condemned ſuch practices. Yea, in the days of Chriſtian Emperours, there have been ſevere Laws againſt ſuch <hi>Gameſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> In <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s time there was a Law, not only that no man ſhould play at Cards and Dice, but that no men ſhould ſo much as be preſent to ſee others play: Nay even Heathens by the light of Nature have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſuch practices. The Philoſopher ſpeaketh againſt it in his Morals: An Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Poet ſharply inveighs againſt it; and <hi>Cicero</hi> in one of his Orations objects againſt <hi>Antonius,</hi> that he was a <hi>Dice-player,</hi> and one <hi>that</hi> entertained ſuch Gameſters in his houſe. And amongſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> theſe kind of Games have ever been diſapproved. <hi>Popiſh
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:002260_0189_0FDAE034CCE2ACF0"/>
Authors</hi> uſually plead fort he Lawfulneſs of them but <hi>Proteſtants</hi> generally write againſt them. And it muſt needs be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all mens Conſciences, that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to ſpend much time in any Rercre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, as is uſually ſpent in attending thoſe <hi>games</hi> by thoſe that uſe them. There is a ſecret Curſe of God goeth along with them: Hence it is, that if perſons be once given to this practice, they can know no bounds, but ſpend day and night therein. Beſides, there is therein a breach of the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, in as much as theſe Games are not without <hi>Lottery</hi>; tho' there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Skill in them, yet there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Lottery.</hi> Now a Lot is a Sacred thing, wherein the name of God is much concerned: In all Lots there is an appeal to Providence to decide the matter in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. It is ſaid concerning a Lot, <hi>that the whole diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord,</hi> Pro. 10.33. Hence it is that Lots may not be uſed in trivial matters: Search the Scriptures, &amp; you ſhall never find that Lots were uſed in trivial, but only in weighty momentous matters, which might be prayed over. Now no man, whoſe Conſcience is not profligate, dare pray over his Cards and Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not do it in act, or in ſigns to ſignifie it, as 'tis in a Lot. And it is a good Rule, <hi>That practice which a man dare not pray over, let him evermore ſuſpect it for an unlawful practice.</hi> Moreover, as theſe Games are uſually prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, there is in them a breach of the eighth Commandment, that is, when men play for money. If a man get anothers goods at under price, this is Injuſtice, it is Theft, and a Tranſgreſſion of the Rule of Righteouſneſs: How much more to take from another his Eſtate for nothing at all in lieu thereof, but only play. Every Lawful way of getting is ſanctified by prayer, which you heard but now that theſe Games are not; and therefore the eſtate got thereby is unlawful gain. And in this reſpect alſo, the Name and Providence of God is abuſed therein: For when God hath by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence poſſeſſed a man of a juſt eſtate, for him now to go and make a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Eſtate ſhall be his or another mans, and then decide the Controverſie by <hi>Dice,</hi> is unworthily to abuſe the good Providence of God. Again, this practice is of evil report, and therefore ought not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians: The Scripture bids us <hi>follow the things that are of good report,</hi> Phil. 4 8. which ſheweth, that things of evil report in
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:002260_0191_0FDAE037C88AEF78"/>
the World ought to be avoided, by thoſe that profeſs the name of Chriſt: Now ſo are theſe Games. You heard how heathens by the Light of Nature condemned them, and ſhall Chriſtians take up ſuch practices? The People of God are offended and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſuch things; and therefore I beſeech thoſe of you that have been guilty here, for the Lords ſake to reform this evil. Oh it is a ſad thing that ſuch a practice ſhould prevail in <hi>New-England</hi> that once was, and ever ought to be, <hi>a Land of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs.</hi> Yet I hear, that <hi>the riſing Generation,</hi> are many of them, tainted with this vice, not only in this great Town, but in many places in the Countrey: This is a ſad and ſure ſign of Degeneracy in the <hi>riſing Generation</hi>; For twenty years ago, there was no ſuch prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice known amongſt Children born and bred in <hi>New-England</hi>: And therefore that now it ſhould be ſo common, doth teſtifie againſt young ones that they are <hi>degenerate Plants.</hi> I have not ſpoken this out of the leaſt prejudice againſt any that hath been guilty this way only that ſo this evil might be rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A tale that is told, can never be untold again; ſo the time that is paſt, will never be here again. A man may loſe other things, and find them again; he may loſe his eſtate, and have it again, or he may loſe his name and recover it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but if he loſe his time, he ſhall never have it again: It is impoſſible that yeſterday ſhould be here again, or that the time paſt ſhould be preſent, and not paſt. As I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I have read of a poor woman, that being in great diſtreſs of Conſcience, many Miniſters came to ſpeak with her, and they could have nothing from her, only ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them with a ghaſtly countenance, and cryed, <hi>Call time again! Call time again!</hi> except you can bring back time again, you can do nothing for me. This was the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effect of neglecting, <hi>the preſent ſeaſon</hi> when time was. Oh think what they in Hell would give to have choſe hours, which they have loſt in ſin and vanity! They would give ten thouſand thouſand Worlds if they had it, that they might again have a ſpace to repent in: yea that they had but one hour <hi>to pray</hi> &amp; ſeek the face of <hi>God,</hi> with

any hopes of mercy, but it cannot be. And for <hi>time to come,</hi> you cannot ſay, that that is yours, for that is altogether uncertain: A man cannot live a moment beyond the time appointed. One miſerably cryed out upon a death bed, <hi>A World of wealth, for an inch of time, A World of wealth, for an inch of time.</hi> And another when dying, ſaid, <hi>If I had ten thouſand Worlds, I would give them all, that I might live one day longer.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Scripture, which ſaith, <hi>Boast not thy ſelf of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth,</hi> Prov. 27.1. Men have not, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had, a promiſe of life for fifteen years. It may be thou haſt not fifteen days, nay, not fifteen hours to live: If thou wert ſure thou ſhouldeſt live but one week, how wouldeſt thou redeem the time? Yet it may be thou ſhalt not live one day, and dareſt thou then miſpend thy time.</p>
            <p>Conſider. 2. <hi>The exceeding danger which is in neglecting the preſent ſeaſon.</hi> This is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous dangerous, becauſe there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for to morrow, but only for <hi>to day,</hi> Heb. 37.

To day, To day</hi>; but you will no where find in all the Book of God, any promiſe, that, To morrow if you will hear his voice, it ſhall go well with you. The Devil and a mans own treacherous heart may promiſe for to morrow, but God doth not ſo. It may be either <hi>now or never</hi>; all times will not ſerve <hi>for</hi> Soul-ſaving purpoſes. Hence is that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near.</hi> There is then a time wherein God may be found, and a time wherein he will not be found: If you delay and put off God for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it may be he will not be found for the future; Oh therefore make thy peace with God <hi>quickly,</hi> leſt it be too late, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.25. Know this for certain, that the longer you delay your Repentance, the harder work you will find of it; the longer any man liveth in ſin, the harder it is for him to turn from ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? then may you do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> This very Deluſion, that man will repent hereafter, &amp; therefore that they may venture to neglect the <hi>preſent ſeaſon,</hi> hath been the Eternal ruine of millions of Souls. Oh Sirs, if ſome of you could but ſpeak with your old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in ſin, that are dead and gone to

their own place, they would tell you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſtories to this purpoſe; they would ſay to you, <hi>Ah Fools that we were, to neglect the preſent ſeaſon, out of a vain Confidence, that hereafter we would repent and turn to God:</hi> This hath brought us into the place of Torment, from whence there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
            <p>Conſider 3. <hi>That the Lord will ſurely call you to an account one day for your time.</hi> You ſhall all appear before the Son of God one day, and give an account how you have lived and ſpent your time in this World: Men muſt give an account how they have improved <hi>Talents,</hi> eſpecially this <hi>great and precious Talent Time.</hi> The Lord keeps an exact account how many years, days, hours, is allowed to every man in this World, &amp; will reckon with men for all one day. As I remember it is ſtoried of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that if he did hear the Clock ſtrike, he would ſay, <hi>There is another hour gone which I must anſwer for.</hi> Oh if men did think ſadly of this, how would they improve their time? Did they know how great a ſin it is to miſpend ſo much as one hour, would they ſpend it may be whole days in vanity?</p>

Alas, men ſpend the greateſt part of their time either in doing nothing, or in doing amiſs. How much time is there ſpent in exceſſive ſleep, or in needleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, or in unprofitable diſcourſes? nay, how much time is ſpent in ſin? All the days of a mans irregeneracy, are days of vanity. All that time (which as to the moſt of you hath been the greateſt part of your lives) hath been utterly loſt. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>his being born out of due time,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.8. Becauſe afore his Converſion, his life was a death rather than a life, he loſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l that time, even as if he had not been born into the World. An old man once ſaid, when dying, <hi>I have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but ſeven years,</hi> becauſe he was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but ſeven years before his death, and before that he made account he was as a man that did not live, as a man that had no time or being in the World.</p>
            <p>Conſid. 5. <hi>Your time in this World is but ſhort</hi>; therefore improve it, it's pity to loſe any part of a ſhort time. Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

not much above two and thirty years, therefore did he go up and down doing good, and was wonderfully careful to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his time to the beſt advantage. Who knoweth how ſoon thy Soul may launch forth into the Ocean of Eternity? Thy time will quickly be gone; hence <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, Chap. 9. verſ. 25, 26. <hi>My days are ſwifter than a Post, they flee away, they are paſſed away as the ſwift Ships, as the Eagle that hasteth to the prey.</hi> When men ride Poſt you know they go ſwiftly, but a Ship in the Sea hath a ſwifter motion, &amp; fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſwifter than that, and an Eagle is amongſt the ſwifteſt of Birds, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Eagle when haſtening to the prey, is more ſwift than ordinary: All this is ſaid, to ſhew how faſt a mans time doth ſpend away. If a man hath much work to do, and but little time to do it in, he had need to beſtir himſelf. Suppoſe the Sun to be almoſt ſet, yet much work muſt of neceſſity be done e're the Sun be down; How needful is it to improve that little time? So 'tis here, every man hath much work of abſolute neceſſity to be done, many duties to perform, many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to ſubdue, many ſins to repent of, and if all this be not done before Sun ſet, a

            <p>Conſider 6. <hi>Eternity depends upon the well improving of a moment.</hi> According to the Seed-time in this Life, ſuch will the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt be in the World to come for ever, Gal. 6.7, 8. Oh! <hi>Eternity, Eternity, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> is a ſolemn and awakening Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I am perſwaded, if you would when you come home, think ſeriouſly one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour about Eternity, it would by the bleſſing of God tend to <hi>awaken</hi> you to improve your ſhort time in this World. Remember then and often think on it, that thou muſt ſhortly go either into <hi>Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weal,</hi> or elſe into <hi>Everlaſting woe,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as time in this World hath been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved or neglected. Within a few days thy Immortal Soul ſhall be either in <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Joy,</hi> or elſe in <hi>Eternal Torment</hi>; that after thou haſt been therein, as many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Ages, as there are Stars in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; as many millions of Ages, as there are piles of Graſs upon the Earth; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny millions of Ages, as there are ſands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea-ſhore, thou then ſhalt be no nearer unto an end of that condition, than thou waſt at the firſt moment when thou didſt enter into it. Oh I do beſeech you
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:002260_0199_0FDAE03FC5227018"/>
for Gods ſake, for Chriſts ſake, and for your Immortal Souls ſake, that you would think of this ſeriouſly, though it be but one quarter of an hour together.</p>

            <p>If you were ſure, that as ſoon as this Sermon is ended, your naked Souls ſhould appear before God the Judge of all, how then would you hear? Verily if theſe truths were realized to the hearts of men, they would labour to redeem there time, yea, they would watch and pray.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>bleſſed is that Servant, whom the Lord at his coming ſhall find ſo doing.</hi>

            <p>THeſe words are part of that large and bleſſed Sermon which Chriſt preached on the Mount; the <hi>whole Sermon</hi> is full of Heavenly matter. Amongſt other things, we have the Parable concerning the two Gates, and the two Ways; namely, the <hi>Wide and the Strait Gate,</hi> and <hi>the Broad and Narrow Way,</hi> in this, and in the foregoing Verſe; where our Saviour doth compare all the men in the World, to a company of Travellers, that are walking ſome one way, and ſome another. Thus it is with men, they are all Travelling to another World, they are all walking towards Eternity, but in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ways: Some are going towards Eternal
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:002260_0201_0FDAE099C8B78D58"/>
Life; others are going towards Eternal Death. Wherefore Chriſts ſcope in theſe Verſes, is, to perſwade men to enter in at the Strait Gate, and to walk in the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way.</p>
            <p>Divers Arguments are uſed to preſs this Exhortation, both with reference unto the Broad, and alſo with reference unto the Narrow Way. As for the Broad Way, one Argument there mentioned is, that it is a common thing to walk therein, <hi>Many there are that walk therein</hi>; and therefore there is ſo much more need to be careful about the matter. Again, becauſe of the miſerable end which that way doth bring unto, <hi>It leads unto deſtruction:</hi> That's the end and iſſue of walking in the Broad Way; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould be ſure to walk in the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Way. And then in reference to the Narrow Way it ſelf, there are divers <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tive Conſiderations</hi> mentioned; 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ends in life, <hi>Narrow is the way which leadeth unto life.</hi> 2. Becauſe <hi>there be few which find it.</hi> Which are the words, by the Lords help, to be ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That find it</hi>; i. e. That find the way to life. Which ſpeech muſt not be underſtood <hi>ſimply and abſolutely</hi>; For the number of ſaved ones abſolutely conſidered, is a very great and vaſt number; they are ſaid to be a <hi>great multitude which no man can number,</hi> Rev. 7.9. There are many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:002260_0202_0FDAC98C57A77350"/>
many thouſands, yea, million of them, even a numberleſs number, like the <hi>ſtars of Heaven.</hi> But this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>comparatively</hi>; the number of thoſe that walk in the way to life is but ſmall, compared with the other number, namely, in reſpect of thoſe that ſhall miſs of Eternal Life. The Doctrine therefore which may be inſiſted on from the words, is this.</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That the number of thoſe that walk in the way which leads to Eternal Life, being compared with thoſe that are in the way to Deſtruction, is but a very ſmall number.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Doctrinal proſecution of this point, three things may be attended. 1. To ſhew what is that way of Life which is here ſpoken of. 2. How it doth appear that but few ſhall find Eternal Life. 3. Whence it cometh to paſs, that ſo few do find E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is the way to life</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In general, <hi>That way which God hath preſcribed unto men to walk in,</hi> that ſo they might obtain Eternel Life; <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.17. <hi>He is in the way of life that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth inſtruction.</hi> The inſtruction there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is Divine inſtruction. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that if a man doth obſerve the Word
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:002260_0203_0FDAE09D74167518"/>
of God, then he is in the way of life. This way is laid out by Rule, and that Rule is none other but the Word of Truth. Hence it is called, <hi>The Way of God,</hi> and the <hi>way of the Lord</hi>; that is to ſay, the way which the Lord hath appointed men to walk in, that ſo they may be ſaved. Particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In this way <hi>Repentance and ſound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion unto God</hi> is implied. For men by Nature are out of the right way, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. The Apoſtle there ſhewing what is the eſtate of all men by Nature ſaith, <hi>They are all gone out of the way,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>The way of peace have they not known.</hi> That way which leads to everlaſting peace and happineſs, men by Nature are eſtranged from it; Therefore Repentance is neceſſary. And if there be a true and ſound Repentance, Life will follow. Hence it is called, <hi>Repentance unto life,</hi> Acts 11.18. and, <hi>Repentance unto Salvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. becauſe Repentance will bring unto Life, and unto Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the way which is here ſpoken of, <hi>Chriſt, and Faith in him</hi> is implied; when it is ſaid, <hi>Enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, make ſure of an intereſt in Chriſt; therefore Chriſt himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>I am the door, by me if any man enter in, he ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Joh. 10.9. Chriſt is that ſtrait Door, that whoſoever enters in thereat, ſhall be ſaved: That ſtrait Gate that if any enter in thereat he live. So when it is ſaid, <hi>Walk in the
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:002260_0204_0FDAC98DD7BF6050"/>
narrow way,</hi> the ſame thing is intended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, namely, the obtaining of an intereſt in Chriſt by Faith unfeigned in his name: Therefore alſo Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> Joh. 14.6. Never any man did obtain Eternal Life, but it was in this way, even in a way of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt; and never any man did miſs of Eternal Life, that did indeed walk in the way of Faith. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</hi> Whoſo findeth Chriſt, finds the way to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The way of new and holy obedience</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in Chriſt, is the way of life; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture ſpeaks of the <hi>holy way,</hi> Iſa. 35.8 <hi>And a way ſhall be there, and it ſhall be called the way of holineſs, the unclean ſhall not paſs over it.</hi> Now this Holineſs is the way to life, Prov. 12.28. <hi>In the way of Rigteouſneſs is life, and in the path-way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is no death.</hi> If a man doth walk in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous paths, and keep in righteous holy ways, no Eternal death ſhall take hold of him, but this way will lead him unto life. This which hath been expreſſed, is the only way to life and glory; this way hath ever been the ſame in all ages of the World. Hence it is called, <hi>The way Everlaſting,</hi> Pſ. 139.27. <hi>Lead me in the way Everlaſting,</hi> that is to ſay, in the way which the Saints in all ages have and ſhall walk in, towards life and
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:002260_0205_0FDAE09FBB3B9AD0"/>
happineſs. Hence alſo it is called, the <hi>good old way,</hi> Jer. 6.16. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Stand ye in the way, and ſee and ask for the old path, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye ſhall find reſt for your ſouls,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay, the way of Repentance, Faith and Holineſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hath been, and is, and ever ſhall be the way unto life.</p>
            <p>We come then unto the ſecond thing, that is, to enquire, <hi>How it doth appear, that the number of thoſe that find the way to life is comparatively but a ſmall number</hi>?</p>
            <p>Now for Anſwer unto that Enquiry, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things may be mentioned, which are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences and clear Demonſtrations of the truth of this point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe thoſe that do enjoy the Word and outward means of Grace, are comparatively but few.</hi> God hath appointed the means &amp; the end to go together; therefore where he intends that end of Eternal Life, he is wont to beſtow the means which himſelf hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, in order to the attainment of that end; Hence is that, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>God will have all men</hi> (that is to ſay, men of all ſorts, as the Context doth manifeſt) <hi>to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth</hi>; thoſe two go together, even <hi>Salvation</hi> and the knowledge of the Truth. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, that the Jews would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them from <hi>preaching</hi> to the Gentiles, <hi>that they might be ſaved,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.16.
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:002260_0206_0FDAE069F2AABFB8"/>
which plainly declares, that without Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching (according to ordinary Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) there is no Salvation This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that there is no Salvation without Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. It was <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s ſaying, that <hi>he that doth think that one may be ſaved without Chriſt, it may well be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned whether that man ſhall himſelf be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or no.</hi> And there is no Salvation by Chriſt, without Faith in him: <hi>This is Life Eternal to know</hi> (that is, to believe on) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> John 17.3. And there is no faith <hi>ordinarily,</hi> but it is wrought by the Word preached. What God may do for Infants, or deaf perſons, or the like, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion; but we ſpeak concerning the Lords ordinary courſe of Diſpenſation: Hence is that, Tit. 1.1. <hi>according to the faith of Gods Elect, and acknowledging the Truth.</hi> Ordinarily there is no faith, but it is by means of the knowledge of the truth of the Goſpel. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh fully to this purpoſe, <hi>Rom</hi> 10.14, 15. <hi>How ſhall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? and how ſhall they preach except they be ſent</hi>? and then in <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Argumentatively, <hi>So then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> It's true, that men may by the light of Nature know many things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout God; as that he is, and that there is
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:002260_0207_0FDAE0A462360E80"/>
but one God, one Eternal glorious Being, who ought to be ſerved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know Chriſt by the light of Nature. God is kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wn as a <hi>Creator</hi> by the light of Nature, but not as a <hi>Redeemer.</hi> There is no faith with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut the knowledge of Chriſt as a <hi>Mediator,</hi> which Myſtery is not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but by <hi>Supernatural</hi> light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; but they that have the knowledge of the Scriptures, are comparatively but few. In the Ages of the Old Teſtament, there was but that one only Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that enjoyed the outward means of Grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his Word to Jacob, his Statutes and his Judgments to Iſrael: He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation; and as for his Judgments, they have not known them.</hi> It's true, that there were ſome few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons that had the knowledge of God, who were not Iſraelites, but no other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore it is not ſaid, <hi>He hath not ſo</hi> with any <hi>perſon,</hi> but with any <hi>People,</hi> or <hi>Nation.</hi> Hence the Lord ſpeaking unto his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaith, <hi>You have I known of all the Families of the earth,</hi> Amos 3, 2, And while it was thus, the way of Salvation was to be found amongſt that people only: Therefore Chriſt ſaid to the woman of <hi>Samaria, Salvation is of the Jews,</hi> John 4.22. Becauſe then a man muſt be a Jew, in reſpect of his Religion and Profeſſion a Jew, or elſe he could not be ſaved;
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:002260_0208_0FDAE06C09AC22A0"/>
wherefore alſo the Scripture giveth us to underſtand, that as for thoſe miſerable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which peopled the earth in thoſe dark days, which were before the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs did ariſe upon the World, they periſhed in their ignorance, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. <hi>The times of this ignorance God winked at</hi>: The meaning is not, that God winked at their ſins in theſe days of ignorance, but at their perſons: He <hi>overlooked</hi> (as the Greek word properly ſignifieth) them. The Lord had no ſaving regard to them, and to their times, but ſuffered them to walk in their own ways, even in the Broad Way which leadeth unto deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now although in theſe New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment times there are many Nations that have the Goſpel, yet but few in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe that are deſtitute thereof. Therefore as for the way to Eternal Life, <hi>Few there be that find it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This is farther evident, becauſe the <hi>Elect of God are but few.</hi> Eternal Life runs parallel with the line of Election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. All, and only thoſe ſhall be ſaved, that belong to the Election of Grace, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. But the Elect are but few in number. Indeed the Elect, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in <hi>themſelves,</hi> without <hi>comparing</hi> them with the Reprobate World, are many, (as before was hinted at) which may be one Reaſon why the Elect are expreſſed by
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:002260_0209_0FDAE0A7820161C8"/>
that term of <hi>the World,</hi> 1 John 2.2. Chriſt <hi>is the Propitiation for our ſins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole World.</hi> The <hi>Elect</hi> there are called, the <hi>whole World</hi>; the main Reaſon of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion may be, becauſe the Elect do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a great part of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are called the <hi>World</hi> oft in Scripture, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Jews,</hi> formerly the only people of God. Chriſt (ſaith the Apoſtle) is a Propitiation, not only for our ſins, who are Jews, but for the ſins of the Gentiles alſo, whom he calls the World. But another Reaſon of the Expreſſion may be, becauſe of the multitudinous number of the Elect ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely conſidered; yet <hi>compare</hi> them with the <hi>non-Elect,</hi> and then they are but very <hi>few.</hi> The word <hi>Election</hi> doth import this; for to elect is to chuſe or pick a few out of a greater number, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. Hence the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are called a <hi>Remnant,</hi> Rom. 11.15. <hi>and a little flock,</hi> Luke 12.32. The Greek is, where there are two Diminutives ſignifying, a <hi>little, little flock,</hi> that is a very little flock, The Iſraelitiſh Nation was a Type of the Elect of God; hence the Apoſtle calleth the Elect an <hi>Holy Nation,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Iſraelitiſh <hi>Nation,</hi> which typified the Elect. Thence alſo the Elect are called by that name of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; Gal. 6.16. Rev. 7.4. Now that <hi>Nation</hi> when God firſt choſe them, were a very ſmall Nation, compared
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:002260_0210_0FDAE06DA3A9B708"/>
with other Nations in the World, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor chuſe you, becauſe you were more in number than any people, for you were the ſmalleſt of all people.</hi> Therefore the Elect are but few; yea, they are but few, compared with thoſe that are outwardly called, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are called, but few are choſen</hi>; So that amongſt called ones, that is, in reſpect of the outward call of the Goſpel, there are but few choſen, but few of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Election of Grace. You heard in the <hi>firſt Argument,</hi> that there are but few outwardly called, compared with the reſt of the World, yet but few elected amongſt <hi>ſuch called ones.</hi> Therefore as for the way to life, <hi>Few there be that find it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This truth is alſo manifeſt, in that <hi>thoſe things which are neceſſary in order unto life, are rarely attained.</hi> To inſtance, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is neceſſary in order unto life (as but now was intimated) therefore is that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. <hi>ult. Turn and live ye</hi>; ſo that there is no living without Turning. But true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is a rare thing; ſo rare, as that in the Prophet <hi>Jeremies</hi> time, there was upon the matter none at all, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>I hearkened and heard, but no man repented of his wickedneſs; every one turned to his courſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>repented him</hi>; that is to ſay, they were very <hi>few,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>ſo few,</hi> that they ſeemed <hi>none at all.</hi> As
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:002260_0211_0FDAE0A8D70C8EF8"/>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh concerning Repentance for that ſin of Uncleanneſs, that he found but <hi>one man of a thouſand,</hi> that repented of it; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.28. And in another place he ſaith, <hi>None that go in to her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life,</hi> Prov. 2.19. So it is meaſurably true concerning Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for other ſins. Again, you heard, that Faith in Chriſt is requiſite in order un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Eternal life. The ſum of the whole Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is contained in thoſe few words, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> But true faith is a rare thing, therefore is that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed our report</hi>? So that even amongſt thoſe unto whom the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Goſpel cometh, there are but few that believe in truth: To preſume is common, but to believe is rare. You have heard alſo, that Holineſs is required in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto life. That Text is plain, and the words are peremptory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> No man, be he high or low, ſhall ſee the Lord of life; and therefore no man ſhall inherit Eternal life, without Holineſs. But holy men and women are rarely found, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19. The Apoſtle there ſaith, that <hi>the whole World lieth in Wickedneſs.</hi> Yea, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who are Pretenders unto Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, there are but few that have the thing in reality, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.5. <hi>They ſay. Stand by thy
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:002260_0212_0FDAE0708B794568"/>
ſelf, come not near to me, I am holier than thou: Theſe are a ſmoke in my noſe, a fire that burneth all the day.</hi> Mark you, they were perſons that did pretend to <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Holineſs,</hi> (as ſuperſtitious perſons and Hypocrites are wont to do) yet the Lord tells them, that his anger ſhould ſmoke and burn againſt them everlaſtingly. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as for the way to life, <hi>Few there be that find it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the truth hereof will be further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by ſpeaking to the third thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for the opening of the point; that is, <hi>Whence it cometh to paſs that ſo few do walk in the way of life?</hi> We ſhall only mention two <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe <hi>the way of life doth not ſuit with Nature.</hi> There muſt be a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural light to direct the Soul into this way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural man receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the things of God, neither can he know them.</hi> And after a man doth ſee this way, there muſt be a Supernatural work of the Spirit to cauſe him to venture on in it; yea, it is not only <hi>above</hi> nature, but <hi>againſt</hi> corrupt nature. The way of Mortification, is the way to Heaven. Now that's a way to which men are naturally as averſe unto, as they are to cut off their right hand, or to pluck out a right eye, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29. If this be ſo, no wonder that ſo few are found walking in this narrow way. To ſee men
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:002260_0213_0FDAE0AA4470CB88"/>
ſwimming down the ſtream is no ſtrange thing, for that's natural; but to ſee them ſwimming againſt the ſtream, would be wonderful. Thus it is here, when men walk in the way to life, they ſwim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtream. Hence we need not marvel if there be but few ſuch. And this is further manifeſt, becauſe,</p>
            <p>Reaſ. 2. <hi>The way to life is an hard way,</hi> even a way full of Afflictions and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on the right hand and on the left; hence Chriſt calls it a <hi>narrow way,</hi> or an <hi>afflicted</hi> way, as the word intimateth, a <hi>compreſſed way,</hi> as ſome render it: Things that are <hi>dilated by preſſure,</hi> are made <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>; ſo is this way which you hear of, <hi>The way to the Kingdom of God is through many tribulations,</hi> Acts 14.22. It's like the way out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> there was a diſmal deſolate Wilderneſs in the way, which was a Land of drought, and of pits, and of fiery flying Serpents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So is the way to the heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> no leſs terrible. Thence there are but <hi>few that find it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the Truth cleared and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Scripture.</p>
            <p>But ſome one will ſay, <hi>Doth not God delight more in glorifying his Grace, that in manifeſting the dreadfulneſs of his Juſtice? How then can there more be damned than ſaved</hi>?</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, but Grace is glorified more in the life of a few, than Juſtice in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thoſe many millions of millions that ſhall periſh. The reaſon is, Becauſe all men have deſerved death, but none have deſerved life. And as for thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, becauſe they are but few, therefore Grace is the more magnified towards them, and will be glorified in them, and by them to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>We come then to apply this truth.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>This Doctrine alſo confuteth the Error of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Redemption.</hi> Certainly if Chriſt had dyed for all, he would never himſelf affirm, <hi>that but few ſhall find the way to Eternal Life.</hi> If Chriſt have died <hi>to</hi> ſave men, and <hi>yet they</hi> fall ſhort of <hi>Salvation,</hi> then muſt his blood be ſhed in vain, as <hi>not</hi> being able <hi>to</hi> accompliſh <hi>the</hi> end intended by him, which <hi>thing</hi> may <hi>not</hi> be imagined, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21.

            <p>Now of this ſort are the greateſt part of the Inhabitants of the Earth by far. <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endom</hi> (as it is called) even the whole Chriſtian World, is but a little ſpot, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the reſt of the World.

For in many Places and Nations there are more Papiſts than Proteſtants, albeit as to our Nation, through the mercy of God, it be not ſo. But you have heard it proved that Popery is damnable Hereſie. No doubt but that there may be ſome ſimple Souls amongſt Papiſts, who having the knowledge of the Fundemental points in Religion, and living according to the light they have thereby received, though they may ignorantly think well of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> God may ſhew them mercy: But I ſpeak of wilfull Papiſts, and of ſuch as live up to the Principles of that Religion, which is inconſiſtent with living according to the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, now theſe muſt needs periſh. I would be loth to be the Author of an harſh Cenſure, yet I am willing to ſpeak after the Angel of God: See then <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.9, 10. <hi>The third Angel followed them, ſaying with a loud voice, If any man Worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the Wine of the Warth of God which is poured out without mixture into the Cup of his Indignation, he ſhall be tormented with fire and

Now then if the Third Angel ſay thus, why <hi>ſhould not</hi> we declare the like, that ſo we may be amongſt the number of the Angels whom the Holy Ghoſt there ſpeaketh of? Beſides, Idolaters cannot be ſaved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.8. But if there be any Idolaters in the World, the Papiſts are ſuch, when they worſhip graven Images, and pray to Saints, &amp; to <hi>Gods that cannot ſave them:</hi> How then ſhould they be ſaved? Again, their Doctrine of Juſtification by Works is a Fundamental error, as <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth in his Epiſtles, eſpecially in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> (which was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out myſtery, that the Apoſtle writing to the Romans, ſhould ſo much inſiſt upon that ſubject) beſides many other Hereſies by them maintained.

If they</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be ſaved, then we must needs be damned; but if we be in the way of Salvation, then they are in that way to deſtruction</hi>?

<pb n="200" facs="unknown:002260_0224_0FDAE07D88729CE8"/>
Papiſts do not belong to the viſible Church of Chriſt.

Yet if we come nearer home, and look amongſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> and Profeſſors of the true Religion; Alas, we ſhall find many there that are walking in the broad way to deſtruction.

(as afterwards may be ſhewed more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly) and thence it's called a <hi>strait gate,</hi> yet it's poſſible, as the words of the Text do imply. It would be an improper ſpeech to ſay, <hi>Few there be that find it,</hi> if none at all could find it: This ſhews that the way may be found, yea, and by ſome is found: Chriſt hath made the the way <hi>paſſable,</hi> Heb. 10.20. <hi>He hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated a new and living way through the vail of his fleſh.</hi> Chriſt by his blood hath ſet Heaven gates open (as when Chriſt was dying, the vail of the Temple rent) to true Believers on him; yea, and Eternal Life is freely offered to all where the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel cometh; Heaven is brought to your doors, Eternal Life is, as it were, brought and laid at your doors, if you will accept of it, when the Goſpel is preached to you.

is, that there are <hi>ſome that have ſpecial cauſe to fear and tremble,</hi> leſt they ſhould miſs of Heaven, that is, ſuch as are well to paſs in this World. <hi>Not many Noble, not many Mighty, are called,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26. ſo not many Rich ſhall be ſaved. It was a ſolemn word which Chriſt ſpake, when he ſaid, <hi>Wo unto you that are rich, for you have received your Conſolation,</hi> Luke 6.24. There cometh to my mind a paſſage of <hi>Buchanans</hi> (who was King <hi>James</hi> his Tutor) when he was upon his death-bed, King <hi>James</hi> ſent to him to know how he did, Go, ſaith he, and tell the King, <hi>that I am going to a place, where but few Kings ſhall come</hi>; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he was going to Heaven, and but few Kings ſhall come there: even ſo but few of thoſe that have much of this Worlds good, ſhall enter into the ſtrait gate of Life. Therefore ſuch of you as enjoy much of the profits and pleaſures of the World, have ſpecial cauſe to tremble, leſt haply the Lord ſhould put you off with a Portion in this life. Yet this truth concerns all to think of, yea, even thoſe that are already entred into the way of Life.

            <p>THE ſcope of the Apoſtle in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Chapter, is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>Philippians</hi> unto Chriſtian Love and Unity, unto which there is a moſt ſolemn obteſtation in the firſt and ſecond Verſes of the Chapter. And in order thereunto, he doth exhort unto Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Self-denial, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3, 4. becauſe Schiſms and Contentions do uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the <hi>want of,</hi> or <hi>defect in</hi> thoſe
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:002260_0234_0FDAC98AD98AC5C8"/>
Graces. Had men that meaſure of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Self-Denial which would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, they would certainly live in love and peace one with another. Now this Self-denial is urged here by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, from the higheſt example and pattern thereof that ever was, namely, the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, which together with the glorious effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of it, is deſcribed from the fourth to this twelfth Verſe of the Chapter. This Verſe then, is an inference from <hi>that which</hi> is in the foregoing Verſes expreſſed, as we ſee by the firſt word in it, [<hi>Wherefore, &amp;c.</hi>] That <hi>illative</hi> particle [<hi>Wherefore</hi>] ſheweth, that theſe words are inferred from the former Diſcourſe. It is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, We muſt go to Salvation in the ſame way which Chriſt, who is the Captain of our Salvation hath gone before us. But Chriſt went in a way of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Self-denial, therefore we muſt do ſo likewiſe. Thus for the ſcope of the place.</p>
            <p>In the words read we have two things, 1 The duty, <hi>viz. To work out Salvation</hi>; which Salvation is here deſcribed from the ſubject of it, <hi>your own Salvation</hi>: It is ſaid to be <hi>ours</hi> not <hi>originally</hi>; ſo it is Gods,
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:002260_0235_0FDAE0C395C954E0"/>
as in <hi>Chap. Verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>Salvation, and that of God</hi>: And <hi>David</hi> ſaith unto God, <hi>Thou only art my Salvation,</hi> Pſ. 62.6. But this Salvation is ſaid to be <hi>ours ſubjectively,</hi> becauſe we par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it: It is ours in reſpect of Commun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ication and Donation. God whoſe it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> originally, is pleaſed to make us partakers of it. 2. We have the manner of the duty, in theſe words, [<hi>with fear and trembling</hi>:] There are two words to the ſame purpoſe uſed, becauſe of the momentous greatneſs of this work &amp; duty, which is to be performed. We ſhall not inſiſt upon any opening of the words, beſides what may be ſpoken to under the Doctrines from them: which are theſe two:</p>
            <p>Doctr. 1. <hi>That men ought to work out their own Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That Chriſtians ought to work out their own Salvation, even with fear and trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To begin with the firſt of theſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, namely, <hi>That men ought to work out their own Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Doctrinal proſecution of this point, we ſhall only attend two things: 1. To ſhew what is implied in working out
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:002260_0236_0FDAE08A4C132020"/>
our own Salvation. 2. The Reaſon of this point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What is implied in working out our own Salvation</hi>; or, <hi>When may a man be ſaid ſo to do</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt know <hi>Negatively,</hi> that herein is not implied, as though men had power to ſave themſelves. Men are able to deſtroy themſelves; and that's all they can now do of themſelves, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Thou haſt destroyed thy ſelf, O Iſrael.</hi> There is a <hi>Self-deſtruction</hi> which every man is ſubject unto; but there is no <hi>Self-ſalvation.</hi> Herein is the difference between man in his firſt, and in his fallen eſtate: <hi>Adam</hi> was able to do and live, had he improved the ability which at firſt God beſtowed on him; but ſince the fall none can do ſo: It is therefore given as the deſcription of a man in his natural condition, that he is <hi>without strength,</hi> Rom. 5.6. A man by nature, hath no ſpiritual ſtrength for the performance of the thing that good is; nay, a natural man cannot ſo much as deſire that which is good, much leſs can he perform it: Therefore in the next Verſe to the Text, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That it is God that worketh both to will and to do, of his own good pleaſure.</hi> So that a man cannot <hi>will,</hi> he cannot <hi>deſire,</hi> much leſs <hi>do,</hi> that which is truly good, except Divine,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:002260_0237_0FDAE0C48039B958"/>
Supernatral help be afforded to him. And therefore though the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Work out your Salvation,</hi> his meaning is not, as though men were able to ſave themſelves: Nor in his meaning, as though men could by their works merit Salvation. In a meritorious work, there muſt be ſome proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the work, and thing merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby; whereas there is no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between our Works and Salvation, Rom. 8.18. <hi>I reckon</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that the ſufferings of this preſent life, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed.</hi> Suffering-work is hard work-paſſive obedience, is the hardeſt and higheſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, therefore if a man could merit by any thing, it would be by ſuffering, when as we ſee there is no proportion between our ſuffrings &amp; the reward. Beſides, to be ſaved by Works, is contrary to being ſaved by Grace: Works and Grace are in the matter of Salvation, as oppoſite as two things can be: <hi>If it is of Works, it is not of Grace</hi> (ſaith the Scripture) <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. &amp; 11.6. But we are ſaved by Grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved, and not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> In a word, to merit is none of our work, it is Chriſts work: Though God calls us to work out our Salvation, yet not

As now, Prayer is one means: This we find uſed, Jer. 17.14. <hi>Save me, O Lord, and I ſhall be ſaved</hi>: And diligent hearing of the Word preached is a mean of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore an Angel from Heaven ſaid unto <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that he ſhould go to hear <hi>Peter</hi> preach, who ſhould <hi>ſpeak unto him words whereby he ſhould be ſaved,</hi> Acts 11.14. And indeed all Divine Ordinances are means of Salvation; therefore are they called <hi>the Wells of Salvation,</hi> Iſa. 12.3. The holy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of God, are <hi>Soul-ſaving</hi> things, when he is pleaſed to own them, and bleſs them, and to go along with them: They are means either to begin the work of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or elſe to carry it on where the Lord hath already begun it: The Word and Prayer are means to begin this work, and Sacraments are means appointed to carry it on to perfection, where the Lord hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to ſave, or brought into a ſtate of Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Herein is implied, <hi>That a man do make ſure of a ſound, through work of Grace in his Soul.</hi> As the Apoſtle exhorteth. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Make your calling ſure.</hi> This is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in working out Salvation, even to make ſure of effectual Calling.

our Salvation is neceſſarily implied, the being brought into the ſtate and <hi>way of Salvation</hi>: Now that is by effectual Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; Grace is the way to Glory, <hi>Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> begins in <hi>Vocation,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>He hath ſaved us, and called us</hi>; ſo that if a man be called, then he is ſaved, that is to ſay, in reſpect of his ſtate he is ſo. Hence <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. ult. <hi>Turn your ſelves, and live ye.</hi> A man begins to live, when he begins to turn; wherefore in working out Salvation is implied, <hi>the</hi> practice of <hi>Repentance,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Repentance</hi> is there ſaid to be <hi>unto Salvation</hi>; ſo that the one of theſe argueth the other: And true <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> is there implied, <hi>John</hi> 6.28.

Herein is implied <hi>Growing in Grace</hi>; and therefore the Text ſaith, [<hi>Work out</hi>] <hi>your Salvation;</hi> Which phraſe noteth, a <hi>progreſſive motion,</hi> that we are to go in the way and work of Chriſtianity, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth exhort, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Repentance, and Faith and Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of Baptiſms,</hi> &amp;c. Let us not (ſaith he) content our ſelves with a ſtate of Initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we are become Chriſtians, and ſo baptized; but let us <hi>go on ſtill,</hi> let us not ſtand at a ſtay in Chriſtianity, but let us go <hi>on, on</hi> ſtill. This is implied, in <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Salvation,</hi> even that a man ſhall be on the gaining, growing hand in Grace &amp; Godlineſs, in Faith and Holineſs. It ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth not only effectual Calling, but alſo a diligent <hi>following of that Calling.</hi> As a man that would be a Workman in any Civil Calling, muſt not only begin to work, but muſt follow his calling. So it a man would be a <hi>a Workman in the matter of Salvation,</hi> he muſt follow, and go on with the buſineſs of Religion, and of his <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Calling,</hi> Hoſ. 6.3. <hi>Follow on to know the Lord.</hi> The Apoſtle in theſe words, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto ſuch as had Grace, and were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in a ſtate of Salvation; yet he ſaith to them, <hi>Work out your Salvation.</hi> Theſe <hi>Phillippians</hi> were, as we ſee in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Epiſtle, <hi>Saints in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>;
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:002260_0242_0FDAE09191429FF8"/>
that is, they were New-Teſtament Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſuch as had embraced the Chriſtian Faith outwardly, and many of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and ſavingly; yet to theſe he ſaith, <hi>Work out your Salvation,</hi> i. e. <hi>do it more and more.</hi> Do not think you have Salvation enough already, but labour after more; ſeek after more Grace, more Humility, more Knowledge, more Faith, more Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> in this Chapter he exhorts the <hi>Philippians,</hi> to work out their Salvation; in the next Chapter he ſheweth by his own example, what it is ſo for to do, Chap. 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13, 14. <hi>Not as though I were already perfect, but I follow after in reaching forth to thoſe things which are before, I preſs towards the mark,</hi> &amp;c. he did not ſtand ſtill, but kept going forward, being on the gaining hand every day. Not a day that paſſed over his head, but he did, and gained ſomething in this matter of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He was a days journeys nearer Heaven, every day than other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The improvement and exerciſe of Grace is implied herein.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> of <hi>their Work of Faith and labour of Love,</hi> 1 Epiſt. chap. 1 verſ. 3. When Faith and Love, and other Graces of the Spirit are exerciſed, then there is a <hi>work,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Salvation-work</hi> which is attended. That ſtock of Grace which the Lord beſtoweth upon his ſervants, it muſt be laid out for
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:002260_0243_0FDAE0CC04460E20"/>
God. The Lord doth not beſtow Grace (nor gifts) upon men, that ſo they ſhould let them lie by them idle; but that ſo they might improve what they have received, ſo as ſhall make moſt for the honour and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of him that gave it, and thereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their own Salvation. As the not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of Talents, is the way to miſs of Salvation, as we ſee in the Parable of the Talents, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>Adam</hi> had a large ſtock of Grace conferred upon him, the ſtock of all the World was put into his hands, but he improved it not, and thence loſt the life of himſelf, and all his Poſterity. So the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Talents is the way to further Salvation; yea, the truth is, that the more any man doth exerciſe Grace, the more Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſhall he have: Degrees of Glory in Heaven, will be according to Improvements of Grace upon earth; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that ſoweth ſparingly, ſhall reap ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly; and he that ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.6. and Chriſt ſaith <hi>that whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance,</hi> Mat. 13.12. <hi>He that hath</hi>; that is, he that improveth the Grace which he hath received; for not to uſe a thing, is as if a man had it not; So [<hi>to have</hi>] is to <hi>improve</hi> what a man hath; ſuch a one ſhall have much Grace here, and much Glory hereafter. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the exerciſe of Grace doth bring much
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:002260_0244_0FDAE0931CED6928"/>
glory to God; therefore Chriſt ſaid to the Diſciples, <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit,</hi> John 15.8. It's a greater glory to God for a poor Soul to act faith upon him, or to exerciſe love towards him, than all the Creatures in the World that have not Grace are able to bring unto him. Now the more any doth (through Grace) glorifie, God in this World, the more ſhall he be glorified by God in the World which is to come.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Herein is implied, that decays in grace be repaired. It is indeed certain, that there is no falling away from true Grace, that is, totally and finally; Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith of true Chriſtians, <hi>they ſhall never fall,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. You ſhall, ſaith he, hold on in your Chriſtian courſe, till you come to the end of your race, <hi>and ſhall never fall by the way,</hi> that is, not <hi>irrecoverably.</hi> Yet it is ſadly true, that there may be gradual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays, though that ſtock of Grace which God beſtoweth upon the Soul in its firſt Coverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be loſt; yet a gracious Chriſtian may be, as it were, in a ſwooning fit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. The <hi>wiſe Virgins ſlept.</hi> The lively and vigorous actings of Grace may decay yea, a man may decay in Knowledge, in Love, in Practice, that <hi>poſſibly</hi> he doth not <hi>pray</hi> ſo often as formerly, nor hear ſo diligently nor keep ſuch a ſtrict watch over his own heart, nor is ſo <hi>heavenly</hi> minded, nor ſo
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:002260_0245_0FDAE0CD8F1BB0E8"/>
zealous for God as once he was. A true Chriſtian, if he be not <hi>very</hi> watchful, will be ſubject to not only <hi>actual,</hi> but <hi>even habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual declenſions</hi>; As we ſee in the Chriſtians at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who had not only loſt their <hi>firſt works,</hi> there was actual declenſions; but their <hi>firſt love alſo,</hi> there was inward and habitual declenſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. Now when it is thus, they that would work out their own <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> muſt labour for renewing, ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace. As it was ſaid to backſliding <hi>Sardis, Repent, ſtrengthen the things which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and are ready to dye, Rev.</hi> 3.2, 3. So as for decaying, dying, languiſhing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the things which concern them, is to repent, and to ſeek after renewing Grace. As <hi>David</hi> in ſuch a caſe did, Pſal. 51.10. <hi>Renew a right ſpirit within me,</hi> and again, Verſ. 12. <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> This is neceſſary in order to work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out <hi>Salvation.</hi> If a man be going to ſuch a place, and turn out of his way, if ever he would come to his journeys end, he muſt return into his way again. So when a man is <hi>travelling to Heaven,</hi> if Temptation draw him aſide, he muſt look to it, that he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return into the way of life again.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Herein is implied perſeverance in the way of Grace and Salvation to the end.</hi> The Text doth not only ſay work, but <hi>work out,</hi> which noteth an holding out in the way of <hi>Salvation</hi> to the end. The Greek word here
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:002260_0246_0FDAE0978A096988"/>
uſed, is a word of Perfection, and implieth a full and final ending of a matter. It is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, <hi>You muſt never leave working about your Salvation, till you have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed it, till you have made compleat work of it.</hi> As it is ſaid concerning the Righteous, <hi>that he ſhall hold on in his way,</hi> Job 17.9. This is implied in working out <hi>Salvation,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>that a man ſhall not give out, but hold out, and hold on in his</hi> Chriſtian courſe to the <hi>very</hi> end. As this Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I preſs forward toward the mark of the high Calling.</hi> He was reſolved not to leave run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till he come to the end of his race, <hi>even to the mark</hi> of high and <hi>heavenly</hi> Glory <hi>which his eye was ſet upon.</hi> This is requiſite in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obtaining <hi>Salvation</hi>; Therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that endureth to the end, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mat. 24.13. If a man deſire to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then let him pray to the end, &amp; believe to the end, and keep up a ſpirit of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the end, and be patient to the end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Another thing implied herein, is, <hi>That every man muſt chiefly mind the Concernments of his [own] Soul.</hi> This is intimated, when it is ſaid, your <hi>Own Salvation.</hi> Alas, men are apt to mind <hi>others concernments,</hi> with <hi>the</hi> neglect of <hi>their own.</hi> It is a ſad complaint which you find, <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t.</hi> 1.6. <hi>They made me the keeper of the Vineyard, but my own Vineyard have I not kept.</hi> So there are <hi>that</hi> look after
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:002260_0247_0FDAE0D0F9ADD6B0"/>
the concernments of others, but mind not at all <hi>their</hi> own; nay it may be, <hi>that</hi> are buſie in other mens <hi>matters,</hi> which do <hi>not at</hi> all belong <hi>to them,</hi> when in the mean time, the <hi>Salvation</hi> and eternal Concernment of their <hi>own Souls</hi> are not minded as ought to be. There was a time when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>John, What ſhall this man do</hi>? John 21.21. So men are apt to ſay, This ſuch a man ſhould do, and this is ſuch a ones duty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as every one ſhould think with himſelf, <hi>What is my duty? What is the work that I ſhould do?</hi> As it was with <hi>John</hi> Baptiſts hearers, Luke 3.12, 13. The people came and ſaid, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> and the Publicans ſaid, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> and the Souldiers ſaid, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> Thus men ought to look to themſelves, and to their own particular duty. A man ſhould watch over his own heart, and look well to the frame of his own ſpirit; Then may he be ſaid to work out his <hi>own</hi> Salvation. So much for the firſt thing.</p>
            <p>We ſhould come now to the Reaſons of the Doctrine: I ſhall mention only one <hi>Reaſon</hi> at preſent, and that ſhall be taken <hi>from the high and abſolute neceſſity of this matter.</hi> Indeed, if it were needleſs, or an indifferent matter, men might be held ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, though they ſhould not work out their own Salvation, at leaſt though they ſhould not do it with fear and trembling,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:002260_0248_0FDAE09852849DA8"/>
(of which under the next Doctrine) but it is a thing of the greateſt concernment and <hi>neceſſity</hi> to be performed. It is neceſſary in reſpect of the Commandment of God, which requireth this work to be done. <hi>There is a neceſſity of the Precept,</hi> hence it was ſaid to the Jews, that <hi>it was</hi> [neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary] <hi>that the word ſhould firſt be ſpoken to them,</hi> Acts 13.46. Why was this neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? but that ſo the Commandment of the Lord might be obeyed. The Lord had ſo commanded, that the Jews ſhould have the firſt offer of the Goſpel, therefore it was <hi>neceſſary</hi> that ſo it ſhould be. Thus here, the Lord hath commanded that men ſhould <hi>work out their own Salvation</hi>; hence in this Verſe, doing thus is called. <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> This is alſo a <hi>neceſſary mean</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obtaining Salvation; Salvation is not to be had without this: Hence Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Labour for everlaſting life,</hi> John 6.27. Certainly, the Lord would not preſcribe unto men needleſs <hi>labour</hi>; if Eternal life could be had without <hi>Labour</hi>; if Salvation were to be obtained without <hi>working,</hi> the Lord would not require men thus to do. It is true, that if God hath decreed a mans Salvation, he ſhall be ſaved, but not without the uſe of means; for God hath decreed, that the end and the means ſhall go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we may therefore ſay here, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh concerning his preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:002260_0249_0FDAE0D2116FFD40"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon me, and woe unto me if I do it not:</hi> So I ſay, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is laid upon every Soul of you, to work out your own Salvation, and wo unto you, if you do it not. Beſides, men by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are in a loſt, periſhing eſtate, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is moſt neceſſary for them to look &amp; to labour after Salvation. As if a man be fallen into a pit, it is neceſſary that he ſhould endeavour to get out of that pit; ſo 'tis here, men by nature are fallen into a <hi>horrible pit</hi> of Sin, Guilt, Miſery, Death and Deſtruction, and therefore needful it is, that they ſhould labour to get out of that woful pit; yea, the truth is, that other things are not needful in compariſon of this, therefore Chriſt ſaid to Martha, <hi>Thou art careful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout many things, but one thing is needful,</hi> Luk. 10.41, 42. Alas! thus it is with men, yea, with the moſt of men, and with the greateſt part of Chriſtians alſo, their time &amp; hearts are taken up about a thouſand needleſs <hi>things:</hi> One man is careful how he may build a great houſe, but <hi>this is not needful</hi>; another is troubled about his Trading, how he may grow rich in this World, <hi>but this is not needful</hi>; another is taking care night &amp; day, how he may have Portions for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after him, <hi>but this is not needful; There is one thing needful,</hi> to make ſure of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that's needful to do, as <hi>Mary</hi> did, even to hearken to, and to obey the Doctrine of
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:002260_0250_0FDAE1033373CC78"/>
Chriſt, which teacheth the way unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this is needful, for a man to make ſure that it ſhall go well with his Immortal Soul, when he ſhall dye, and leave this World: Oh that is needful!</p>
            <p>We therefore proceed unto the Uſe of the point; let it be a word of earneſt <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</hi> Oh <hi>make ſure of your own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Conſider well what you heard but now concerning the neceſſity of this matter, Salvation is that which muſt be had. As we ſay of bread. <hi>Bread muſt be had</hi>; ſo may we ſay of Salvation; <hi>It muſt be had</hi>; you are undone without it for ever. It had been better for you that you had never been born, than that you ſhould miſs of <hi>Salvation</hi> at laſt. As the Diſciples once cried out, <hi>Save us, Lord, or we periſh,</hi> Mat. 8.25. So there is no middle way between theſe two, but either you muſt have Eternal Salvation, or elſe you muſt to Eternal Damnation.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But what ſhall we do that we may be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Oh that there were many of you that did in earneſt make ſuch enquiries. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve then theſe Rules of Direction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Take heed of thinking that you are in a ſtate, or in the way of Salvation, when as it is not ſo.</hi> Alas, it is thus with many, &amp; this proveth the Eternal ruine of their Souls, Prov. 14.12. <hi>There is a way which ſeemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:002260_0251_0FDAE0D3814A5280"/>
ways of death:</hi> There are that think they are going in the way which leads unto Life, when-as they are going in the way which will bring them down into the Chambers of Death. So it was with the Phariſees: therefore Chriſt ſaid to them, <hi>that he came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>; And <hi>that the whole have no need of a Phyſitian, but the ſick,</hi> Mat 9 13. They were righteous in their own eyes, they conceited themſelves to be whole, and thence never ſought after Chriſt the Phyſitian of Souls for help and healing. This conceit was their ruine. Thus it is with millions, they feel not their need of Chriſt: Every man indeed <hi>knoweth,</hi> as to a general <hi>Notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Conviction, that he hath need of Chriſt, but few that <hi>feel</hi> it. Men ſee not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Chriſtleſs, loſt condition, and thence they periſh. This alſo was <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea's</hi> undoing, Rev. 3.17. <hi>Thou ſayeſt, I am rich, and encreaſed in goods, and have need of nothing, and knoweſt not that thou art wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> This is the reaſon why many are never ſaved, even becauſe they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſure of Salvation already. Many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of thoſe loſt Souls that are dropt down for ever into the pit of Eternal Darkneſs, this which you now hear was their ruine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Caſt away thoſe things that would hinder Salvation.</hi> The gate of Salvation is a ſtrait
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:002260_0252_0FDAE1044E6EF628"/>
gate. You have heard what Chriſt ſaith, Mat. 7.14. <hi>Strait is the gate which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</hi> Now if a man be to go in at <hi>a ſtrait gate,</hi> he had need throw away thoſe things which are Incumbrances, or he will never be able to enter. So if you deſire to enter in at the <hi>ſtrait gate</hi> of Life, away with thoſe things that would hinder. As now, the World is an Enemy to <hi>Salvation,</hi> when mens hearts are ſet upon it, they will be drowned in the Pit of Perdition; their end will not be Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but Deſtruction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. As ever therefore you deſire to be ſaved, take heed of having your hearts too much engaged in the World. Again, ſin will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Salvation, and therefore if you would be ſaved, caſt ſin out of your hearts and lives, Jer. 4.14. <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thy heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved.</hi> Forſake ſin in life, yea, and in heart too, if ever you would be ſaved, yea, and ſinful Company alſo; for ſinful Companions are the greateſt hindrances of Salvation. What ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Forſake the Fooliſh and live,</hi> Prov. 9.6. Would you live, would you be ſaved? then forſake the fooliſh, beware of prophane or corrupting Company, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. <hi>He that walketh with wiſe men, ſhall be wiſe; but a Companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> So that ſinful Companions will bring to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and therefore whoſo deſireth Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:002260_0253_0FDAE0DBC502EDB0"/>
muſt beware of ſuch. Alas, this which I now ſpeak of, hath been the ruine of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Soul that hath been in a hopeful way towards Heaven. Sometimes the Word of God meets with a ſinner, and he hath ſecret purpoſes to forſake his ſin, and to return to God by Jeſus Chriſt, but he falls into wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Company, and they entice him to Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Gaming, or to ſome other evil courſe, whereby the Convictions which were upon his Conſcience are loſt, and his Soul is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done to all Eternity. The truth is, that evil Company is one of the greateſt and moſt ruining ſnares in the World, and therefore if you love your Souls. Oh beware of it!</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Make ſure of thoſe things which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be attended, in order to Salvation.</hi> As now Repentance is of abſolute neceſſity to Salvation; hence when the Jews were <hi>pricked at the heart,</hi> by a Sermon which <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> preached unto them, and cryed out, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do</hi>? that is to ſay, What ſhall we do in order to obtaining Salvation? The firſt word which <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to them, is, <hi>Repent,</hi> Acts 2.37, 38. There is no Salvation for impenitent ſinners; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.13. <hi>Except ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ye ſhall periſh,</hi> And that you may ſee he is in earneſt, he cometh over with it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Except you repent, you ſhall periſh.</hi> The words are plain and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Repent or periſh, Repent or periſh.</hi> Tell
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:002260_0254_0FDAE108C1099830"/>
me then, and let thy Conſcience anſwer to it, Haſt thou repented of all thy ſins? Doth not Conſcience tell thee, thou haſt been guilty of ſome ſins which never were repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of to this day? Why then be it known to thee, if thou ſhouldſt dye in thy preſent condition, thou canſt not be ſaved. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Faith in Chriſt is requiſite (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was hinted) in order to Salvation; therefore when the Jaylor ſaid, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Anſwer was made, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 16.30, 31. Oh then make ſure of an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, by Faith in his Name, that you may be ſaved. Ay, but men ſay, we cannot Repent, and we cannot believe of our ſelves. Very true: Therefore,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Be diligent in the uſe of means:</hi> The want of this, is that that utterly and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſably ruins the Souls of men, they will not work (as the Text requireth) about their <hi>Salvation</hi>; they will not labour and take pains in the uſe of means as they ſhould do, that they may be ſaved. Oh! this ſpiritual ſloth &amp; ſluggiſhneſs is that which kills many a ſoul God hath given thee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural abilities, why doſt thou not improve 'em? Thou haſt a tongue that is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce good words as well as bad ones, why then doſt thou not make uſe of thy tongue for good &amp; profitable diſcourſe? Why dost
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:002260_0255_0FDAE0E15A1DC2B0"/>
thou not ask after the way to Salvation? why doſt thou not take unto thee words for prayer, as well as expreſs, vain, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, looſe, and it may be prophane ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es? Thy legs are able to carry thee to one houſe as well as to another, why then doſt thou not frequent good Company? why doſt thou not go to houſes where the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God are praying together, as well as go into wicked Company, or into houſes where there is looſe and lewd doings? Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will not do as much as they can; they will not hear, read, pray, when they ought and might do it; but are like unto them. Jer. 6.16. <hi>The Lord ſaid, This is the good way, walk therein, and you ſhall find reſt for your Souls: But they ſaid, We</hi> [will not] <hi>walk therein.</hi> So God ſaith, Forſake ſuch a courſe, and ſuch a Company. <hi>I will not,</hi> ſaith a wicked heart. Practiſe ſuch a duty (ſaith God) read thy Bible much) and pray in ſecret every day. <hi>I will not,</hi> ſaith a wicked ſinner. Oh what a Wretch art thou, that dareſt thus diſobey the voice of the Lord! Ah! wo be to thee if thou goeſt on thus in a careleſs neglect of God, and of thy <hi>own Salvation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Betake thy ſelf unto God in Jeſus Chriſt ſon Salvation.</hi> This Salvation is from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and therefore go to Heaven for it. Do you not remember what Chriſt ſaid to that Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Joh. 4.14. <hi>If thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:002260_0256_0FDAE10A9CB555B0"/>
—thou wouldſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</hi> Would you partake of the waters of Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then go to the Lord and ask for it: The reaſon why men partake not hereof, is, becauſe they ask not for it; Do but ask, &amp; ask as you ſhould do, &amp; you ſhall receive; Ask earneſtly, conſtantly, ſincerely, and you ſhall have Salvation. Know for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, the Lord is able to ſave thee, yea, and full of Grace and Compaſſion, willing to ſave all that come unto him. Only then yon muſt remember to ask in ſeaſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore this brings to the laſt Direction, which is this, <hi>Improve your time, work while it is day,</hi> John 9.4. while you have time, <hi>up and be doing:</hi> Let not this great work of your Salvation ſtand ſtill, but while you have time, labour about it night and day, yea, every day follow this work Let not a day paſs without ſomething done this way, get every day a ſtep nearer Heaven than you were before: And in ſpecial, <hi>the Lords-Day</hi> is a ſeaſon which ſhould be improved to this end. Indeed other works muſt not be done upon this day; <hi>ſervile works</hi> may not, but <hi>Spiritual-work, Soul-work, Salvation-work</hi> is this day to be attended. Improve then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opportunity, Oh, let not any ſlip, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome good done: And eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:002260_0257_0FDAE0E2DB962DF8"/>
the preſent opportunity, to take hold of it; concerning which you have heard more largely. To be ſure this thing is your preſent duty. If a mans houſe were on fire, his preſent work would be to think how he might quench it: Oh! thy Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul is in danger of Hell-fire every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! Thy poor Soul hangs over the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal flames, only by the twine thred of a rotten life (as I may ſo ſpeak) if that break, thy Soul is dropped down into eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and endleſs wo; and is it not thy <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent work</hi> to endeavour with might &amp; main, that thy Soul may be delivered from this danger, before the Pit, from whence there is no Redemption, hath ſhut its mouth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee? Jeſus, that delivers from the wrath to come, let him be thy Salvation!</p>
            <p>We come now to the Second Doctrine; namely,
<q>That Chriſtians ought to work out their own Salvation, even with fear and trembling.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to this point, we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame method which was attended under the former Doctrine.</p>

Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are bid to be obedient to their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>fearing God.</hi> That which in one place is expreſſed by <hi>fear and trembling,</hi> is in the other place called <hi>fearing God.</hi> Thus alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Perfect holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> There the Apoſtle doth exhort the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto the ſame duty, which here he exhorteth the <hi>Philippians</hi> unto: <hi>To perfect holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> and to <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> are the ſame thing. I ſay, an holy fear of God, namely, leſt he ſhould be diſhonoured, as the Lord ſpeaketh by the Prophet <hi>Malachi, If I he a Lord, where is my fear? and if I be a Father, where is my honour?</hi> Mal. 1.6 This is indeed the true fear of God, when a man is afraid leſt Gods name ſhould any way ſuffer diſhonour by him; and when a man is afraid of loſing Gods favour, and dreads the diſpleaſure of God as the greateſt evil. This is neceſſarily implied here in <hi>working out Salvation,</hi> becauſe Salvation ſtands in the <hi>favour of God.</hi> Therefore it is three times expreſſed in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 80. <hi>Cauſe thy face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſaved,</hi> verſ. 3.2, 19. So then Salvation conſiſts in the <hi>ſhinings of
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:002260_0259_0FDAE0E401880760"/>
the face of God,</hi> that is to ſay, in his favour. And to be caſt out of his favour, implieth <hi>everlaſting deſtruction.</hi> It is ſaid concerning Reprobates, that they ſhall be puniſhed <hi>from the preſence of the Lord with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.9. So that to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Gods gracious preſence, doth infer <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction</hi>; therefore to work out Salvation with <hi>fear,</hi> doth imply an holy fear of loſing the favour of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Herein is implied, a <hi>fear with reſpect to the ſervice of God,</hi> that is, leſt God ſhould not be ſerved &amp; worſhipped after a due and acceptable manner, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2 11. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling:</hi> Fear and tremble, leſt you ſhould miſs it in the ſervice of God. And indeed all acceptable Service or Worſhip doth proceed from a principle of fear in the heart towards God, Heb. 12.28. <hi>Let us have Grace whereby we may ſerve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.</hi> If a man doth ſerve God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, his ſervice doth proceed from a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious principle of godly fear: And men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their fear of God, in and by their ſerving of him; therefore the Service or Worſhip of God is in the Scripture called his fear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.9. <hi>The fear of the Lord is clean,</hi> that is, the Worſhip and Ordinances of God, whereby men expreſs their fear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. And the true <hi>Worſhipers</hi> of God are ſtiled <hi>fearers</hi> of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.12,

13. <hi>He will bleſs the houſe of Iſrael, he will bleſs the houſe of Aaron; He will bleſs them that fear the Lord.</hi> Mark, here are three ſorts of perſons ſpoken of; 1. <hi>The houſe of Iſrael,</hi> that is, the common Members in the Church of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 2. <hi>The houſe of Aaron,</hi> That is, the Miniſters in the Church of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> 3. <hi>Thoſe that fear the Lord</hi>; that is, Proſelytes to the true Religion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; ſuch as did ſerve God in that way of Worſhip which himſelf hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Now this fear is implied in <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our Salvation with fear and trembling</hi>; For Gods Service and Glory, and our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation go together. It is the great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, that theſe cannot be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that in faithful attending to the one, we ſhall promote the other alſo. A man cannot ſerve God aright, but that he will thereby help forward his own Salvation; hence the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>It is good for me to draw nigh to God,</hi> Pſal. 73.28 It is not only good in it ſelf, but <hi>good for me</hi>: Why? Becauſe in ſerving God, he did promote his own Eternal ſafety and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. And thoſe unto whom Salvation is promiſed, are deſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>ſerve God</hi>; and they againſt whom Deſtruction is threatned, are ſaid to be ſuch <hi>as ſerve him not,</hi> Mal. 3.18. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Herein is implied, <hi>An awful reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reſpect unto the Word and will of God.</hi>
               <pb n="237" facs="unknown:002260_0261_0FDAE0E58CB8C660"/>
This in Scripture is called the <hi>fear of Gods name,</hi> Mal. 4.2. There are many that have a kind of natural, ſervile fear of the Divine, Infinite Majeſty, that yet do not <hi>fear his Name,</hi> that is to ſay, they have not a due reſpect to his Word, nor do they reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Authority of his Command as ought to be; but this is here included. Hence we read of <hi>fear of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Prov. 13.13. <hi>Whoſo deſpiſeth the Word, ſhall be deſtroyed; but he that feareth the Commandment, ſhall be rewarded</hi>; He that regardeth not the Word of God, ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; but whoſo feareth his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall receive the reward of Life &amp; Salvation; hence the promiſe is made to ſuch, as <hi>tremble at Gods Word,</hi> Iſa. 65.2, 5. This fear of the Commandment, is, when a man dare not diſobey the Command, or go contrary to the revealed Will of God in any thing; when he had rather ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any hazard, than to violate the holy Commandment: Thus it was with <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 119.161. <hi>Princes have perſecuted, me— but mine heart ſtands in aw of thy Word</hi> He had rather incur the diſpleaſure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. Herein is implied, <hi>An holy fear and jealouſie, left haply a man ſhould miſs; and fall ſhort of Salvation. Work out your own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling</hi>; that is to ſay, ſince there is Salvation purchaſed by the Obedience of Jeſus Chriſt, O fear and tremble, left you ſhould by any means miſs of this Salvation; as the ſame Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the Hebrews, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Let us therefore fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt a promiſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> The Children of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) they began well, but they did not end well; They came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but they held not out till they came to <hi>Canaan.</hi> Oh fear leſt it ſhould be ſo with you; left after all your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Reformations, and good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings in the ways of God, you ſhould at laſt come ſhort of that Salvation, which is the end of all. Thus alſo he ſpeaketh here in the Text. This <hi>Fear</hi> is a vertue <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Security and Self Confidence</hi>; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a man doth thus fear, he taketh the right way, and the right courſe towards Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Let him that thinks he ſtands' take heed leſt he falleth.</hi> None are in ſuch danger of falling, as they that think they ſtand. Self-Confidence is a fore-runner of Deſtruction; ſo fear, in reſpect of a mans own weakneſs and jealouſie over his own heart, is a notable means of being preſerved unto Salvation. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Herein is implied. <hi>Lowlineſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</hi> Some have well obſerved, that this phraſe of <hi>Fear and Trembling,</hi> is uſed five times in the Scripture, and always it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this ſenſe, even for Lowlineſs and Humility. And this ſuits here with the Context, where the ſcope of the Apoſtle (as before was intimated) is to exhort to <hi>Humility and Self-denial</hi>; and this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by ſaying, <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

And this is well put in, becauſe if men work about their Salvation, they are apt to be proud. There is nothing more natural unto man, than to be proud &amp; ſelf-confident by reaſon of his own works. If men labour in the practice of works of Righteouſneſs, which are, though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they are apt to reſt therein; and ſuch Souls are in the greateſt danger of ruine. There is no evil more dangerous than that of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Pride, when men reſt in their Prayers and Duties and good Works; therefore this of <hi>Trembling</hi> is fitly put in by the Apoſtle, <hi>when he exhorts to work about our own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Herein is implied <hi>great care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in the work of Salvation.</hi> This fear is not a fear of <hi>Diffidence,</hi> but of <hi>Diligence</hi>; It is not I ſay, a fear of Diſtruſt or deſpair, as if a man could not be aſſured of his <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> no ſuch thing is intended or implied in the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that is contrary to other Scriptures, which require us to endeavour after <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> which ſheweth that Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is attainable; and alſo, contrary to the experience of Saints, who have ſome of them had <hi>a full Aſſurance.</hi> But it intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that men ſhould be very diligent in endeavouring after <hi>Salvation</hi>; that every one ſhould make this matter of <hi>Salvation</hi> his main buſineſs. And not to do, as moſt do, <hi>who</hi> mind other things in the firſt place, &amp; look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Salvation, and the Eternal Concernments of their Souls only in the ſecond place.

are in the firſt and chief place to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And this is implied, <hi>in working with fear and trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu 2. <hi>But why ſhould it be thus</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is the ſecond thing to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to: We ſhall only mention two <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of this point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe of the difficulty which is in attaining to Salvation.</hi> Heaven is in the Scripture compared to an Hill, even ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Heaven, is going up Hill. Now that's hard; to go down Hill is natural and eaſie, ſo it is in going to Hell. But going in the way of Salvation, is like going up hill, or like ſwimming againſt the ſtream, which you know is not eaſie. The way of Salvation is a <hi>narrow way</hi> You have heard that Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Narrow is the way which leadeth unto Life.</hi> Now if a man be walking in a narrow path, he had need look well to every ſtep that he taketh, leſt haply he ſhould turn out of the right way. The gate of Salvation is a <hi>ſtrait gate</hi>; therefore Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, for many ſhall ſeek, and ſhall not be able,</hi> Luke 13 24. If a man were to go in at a wide gate, that were eaſie, and needed no ſtriving about it; but to get in at a ſtrait gate, will coſt a man labour and ſtriving</p>
            <p>But a little to enlarge here; there are two things eſpecially that ſhew the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is in obtaining Salvation: And
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:002260_0266_0FDAE1158899BC88"/>
that therefore it is to be ſought after with fear and trembling.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In that there are many Impediments to hinder a man from coming into, or from going on in the way of ſalvation.</hi> There are many and mighty Enemies unto Salvation. As now the Devil is one Enemy to Salvation, his name is <hi>Abaddon,</hi> and <hi>Apollyon,</hi> that is, a Deſtroyer: Chriſt and Satan are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in Nature, Properties and Works; Chriſts work is to be a Saviour of Souls, but the Devils work is to be a Deſtroyer of Souls. And this is a mighty Enemy; hence the Scripture ſpeaketh of <hi>the power of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We wreſtle not with fleſh and blood,</hi> that is, not with weak Enemies, but with <hi>Principalities and Powers,</hi> even with ſtrong and potent Enemies, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.13. And alſo a moſt ſubtile Enemy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore compared, not only to a Serpent, but to an Old Serpent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9. becauſe of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſubtilty. Now if a man hath a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>litick Enemy to watch all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities againſt, this calls for fear and care, leſt his Enemies ſhould be his ruine. Satan labours by <hi>fraud</hi> to hinder the Salvation of ſinners; thence ſometimes he perſwades them, that they are in the way of <hi>Salvation,</hi> when as it is not ſo; and ſometimes he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth a ſinner, that it is ſoon enough, &amp; too ſoon for to look after Salvation: Thus he ruines many by <hi>Preſumption.</hi> Alſo he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to hinder the Salvation of Souls by
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:002260_0267_0FDAE0EE7A6D13B8"/>
               <hi>force,</hi> and thence perſwadeth them, that it is too late for them to look after <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> and ſo ruins them by <hi>deſpair.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> doth what he can to keep men from entring into the way of <hi>Salvation</hi>; or if he cannot do <hi>that,</hi> then he endeavours to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from going on in <hi>that</hi> way: Whence it is <hi>that</hi> they <hi>that</hi> are brought into the ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> meet with new fears, new difficulties, new temptations, which other men are not acquainted with, and which themſelves in former times were not troubled with.</p>
            <p>Again the <hi>World</hi> is another Enemy, which doth greatly hinder mens Salvation. Worldly Incumbrances are a marvellous Impediment; hence is that <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Let us lay aſide every Weight.</hi> What are theſe weights but worldly Incumbrances? If a man hath weights tied about his legs, theſe will hinder him from making <hi>any great</hi> progreſs in his way: So it is here, worldly Incumbrances are as weights which hinder from going forward in the way to Salvation. There are <hi>the reputed good things of the World,</hi> and in theſe there is a temptation and a ſnare to the Soul; <hi>e.g. worldly gain</hi> &amp; <hi>profit</hi> is an heavy ſnare, &amp; that which hindreth the Salvation or many a Soul. Some that have bid fair for Heaven, yet have fallen ſhort at laſt, becauſe of this: ſome that have
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:002260_0268_0FDAE1171089DF18"/>
wrought much and long about their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, yet have not been able to work it out by reaſon of this ſnare. We read in the Goſpel, of a man that came to Chriſt to know what he ſhould <hi>do</hi> that he might have Eternal Life: He was willing to <hi>work,</hi> that he might be <hi>Saved:</hi> He came with a Legal Queſtion, and with a Legal Spirit: Chriſt Suiteth his Anſwer according to the Enquirer, and tells him of obſerving the Commandments of the Law. The man profe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in keeping theſe for many years: Chriſt then toucheth him where his greateſt wound &amp; ſnare was, namely, his inordinate love to earthly things, and <hi>to try him,</hi> the Lord bids him forſake all his worldly poſſeſſions to follow him; but then the man g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h away with a ſad heart, ſeeing that he muſt either miſs of Eternal Salvation, or loſe the World, and of the two, chuſeth rather to part with Eternal Life, then to part with his Worldly gain: Hereupon Chriſt ſaid, <hi>How hardly ſhall they that have riches, enter into the Kingdom of God: It is eaſier for a Camel to go through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Luke 18.24, 25. It is an hard matter for any man to be ſaved; but for a rich man much
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:002260_0269_0FDAE0F156FB4530"/>
more hard than for others; were it not that with God all things are poſſible, it would not be poſſible for ſuch an one to be ſaved. So for the <hi>pleaſures of the World,</hi> they are a great ſnare and hindrance to Salvation. A man muſt forſake theſe ſo far as they ſtand in oppoſition to the will of God, but it is hard ſo for to do: How hard is it for a carnal heart to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the pleaſures of ſin? A poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thinks with himſelf, <hi>if I ſhould turn into the way of Salvation, then I must never ſee a merry day more</hi>; here his Soul ſticks and periſheth. And as for <hi>the evil things of the World,</hi> theſe are alſo great obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the way to life, <hi>e. g. The cares of that World, the Thorney-ground hearer,</hi> tho' he did and ſuffered much in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he went far, and held out long in an high and glorious Profeſſion of the Goſpel, yet after all, <hi>the care of this world</hi> proved his ruine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22. Alas, men take more care how they ſhall live in this World, wherein they ſhall continue but for a moment, than they do how they ſhall live in another World, where they muſt be to all Eternity. And hence it is that Salvation is neglected, &amp; the means conducing thereunto are neglected: Men
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:002260_0270_0FDAE11942958790"/>
are not ſo frequent and diligent in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word as they ought to be, and prayer in Families; but eſpecially prayer in ſecret is lamentably neglected; &amp; the pretence is, they cannot ſpare time from their <hi>worldly</hi> occaſions, to attend theſe duties of their <hi>Chriſtian Calling</hi> Thus doth the World eat out the heart and life of Religion. So for the <hi>Croſſes of the World,</hi> they are alſo a very great ſnare. Men would fain have their Heaven here and in Heaven too, they would fain have their Paradiſe upon Earth: But when they ſee that that cannot be, then they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and knocked off <hi>from Religion, and from Salvation.</hi> There have been that have begun to work about their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that yet have not been able <hi>to work it out,</hi> or to finiſh what they begun, becauſe of this which you now hear. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſpake an excellent Parable to this purpoſe, which you may ſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.27, 28, 29. <hi>Whoſoever doth not bear my Croſs, cannot be my Diſciple: Which of you intending to build a Tower, doth not first count the cost; leſt after he hath laid the foundation, he is not able to finiſh it.</hi> Alas there are that enter upon Religion, and do not think what it will coſt them; and thence when they meet with unexpcted,
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:002260_0271_0FDAE0F301785BA8"/>
temptations and difficulties, though they made a good beginning, they come to a miſerable end at laſt. Now then inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as the <hi>Profits, Pleaſures, Cares, Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of the World, are ſuch Impediments in the way to life, men had need work out their Salvation with fear and trembling. Yet there is another Enemy more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than all theſe, that is, <hi>Self.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that prayed, <hi>Lord deliver me from that miſerable Wretch my ſelf</hi>; had a great deal of reaſon for what he ſaid. <hi>Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> is requiſite in order to Salvation, as the Apoſtle ſheweth in this Context, but that's an hard task. The firſt Leſſon in Chriſtianity is an hard Leſſon, namely, that a man muſt <hi>deny himſelf,</hi> Mat. 16.24. <hi>Natural Self</hi> muſt be denied, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Lean not to thine own underſtanding.</hi> A mans <hi>own</hi> underſtanding, his <hi>own</hi> will, his <hi>own</hi> affections and inclinations, ſo far forth as they ſtand in oppoſition to, or in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with the will of God, muſt be denied; yet there is no man that hath any acquaintance with his own heart, but finds that this is hard work, ſo for <hi>Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſinful ſelf,</hi> this muſt be denied; yet this is very difficult: The ſins of men are like ſtrong fetters, which keep them from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward in the way to Salvation. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

ſaid to <hi>Simon Magus, Thou art in</hi> (<hi>the bond) of Iniquiny,</hi> Acts 8.23. How ſhould a man that is <hi>bound</hi> hand and foot get for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? Thus do the <hi>Bonds of Iniquity,</hi> the Chains of ſin, keep down the Souls of men, that they cannot mount up towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: A very hard thing it is to part with a beloved darling Luſt. Mens ſins are called <hi>their members,</hi> Col. 3.9. <hi>Mortifie your members,</hi> becauſe they are as dear, and men are as loth to part with them, as the members of the body, life and limbs are not more dear to the ſinner, than are the vile luſts of his heart. Hence Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If thy right eye offend thee, pull it out, and if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee,</hi> Mat. 5.29, 30. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man that hath a luſt, that he had as lieve have his right eye pulled out of his head, or his right hand cut off from his arm, as to part with that ſin, yea, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too. As I remember I have read of a miſerable man, that was addicted to the ſin of Drunkenneſs, and thereby a diſeaſe in his eyes was cheriſhed; and being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by ſome to leave his Drunkenneſs, becauſe it was hurtful to his eyes; Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>that he had rather loſe his eyes, than part with his Drunkenneſs.</hi> Miſerable Wretch! Thus <hi>hard</hi> is it to forſake ſinful ſelf. Yet

there is that which is harder than all this, for even <hi>Righteous-ſelf</hi> muſt be denied alſo. The Apoſtle ſheweth the reaſon why the Jews miſcarried in ſeeking after Salvation was, becauſe <hi>they went about to establiſh their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 10.3. for a man to Confeſs Sin, and to Reform, and Hear, and Pray, and Faſt, and yet to renounce all this, and to abhor himſelf after all, <hi>this is hard, this is hard.</hi> 2. It appears that it is an hard thing to be ſaved, in that <hi>thoſe things which are requiſite to Salvation, are not eaſily attained.</hi> As now, 1. You heard the laſt time, that Repentance is neceſſary to Salvation; There fore Repentance is ſaid to be <hi>unto life,</hi> Acts 11.18. But the practice of Repentance is no eaſie work. Indeed that which ſome take for Repentance is eaſie; that is, when a man hath ſinned in words, to ſay <hi>that he is ſorry for it, &amp; God forgive me:</hi> But true Repentance is not in words only, but from the heart: It is <hi>heart-work,</hi> and therefore <hi>hard work,</hi> Joel 2.13. <hi>Rent your hearts</hi>; For a man to have his heart rent within him, muſt needs be <hi>hard</hi> to endure. To have any member rent from the body is hard, but what then is it for to have the very <hi>heart rent?</hi> Jer. 4.3. <hi>Plough up the fallow ground of your hearts.</hi> Your <hi>hearts</hi> are over-grown with <hi>the weeds of</hi>
               <pb n="250" facs="unknown:002260_0274_0FDAE1201130DD18"/>
ſin, but theſe muſt be ploughed up with godly Sorrow and Repentance for ſin. For a man to ſuffer furrows to be made in his heart within him, how tedious and how terrible is it. 2. Faith in Chriſt is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation, but it is no eaſie matter to believe: For a man to renounce Sin, Self and World, and to cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt upon his own bleſſed Terms, is a hard work: Therefore Chriſt hath ſaid, John 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father draw him</hi>: There muſt be <hi>draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for it, and drawing of the Almighty, or the Soul will never come to Chriſt; for ſin draweth, and the World draweth, and the Devil draweth, to pull the Soul away from Chriſt, and therefore except God by an Infinite hand draw the Soul to Chriſt, they will not come together. See what the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>The exceeding greatneſs of his power to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ, when he raiſed him from the dead</hi>: So that <hi>Power, Mighty Power, Greatneſs of Power, Exceeding greatneſs of Power,</hi> is put forth in making a Soul to believe, nay, the ſame <hi>power which was exerted in raiſing Christ from the dead</hi>: And that was ſuch a mighty
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:002260_0275_0FDAE0F5F9C46FD8"/>
Work, as a greater never was. When <hi>Christ</hi> was brought into the Priſon of the Grave; the ſins and guilt of all the world of God's Elect, was laid upon him, and therefore it was the mightieſt work that ever was to raiſe Chriſt out of the Grave; yet the like Infinite Power is required to make us believe. It is as hard a matter to make a Soul believe, as it is to raiſe the dead; and therefore it is a work beyond the power of any man or creature. A car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man once having a Daughter in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, being asked how ſhe did, <hi>Tuſh, tuſh</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſhe is well enough, if ſhe would but believe; ſhe aileth nothing, only ſhe wont believe.</hi> Soon after it pleaſed God to ſtrike this mans Conſcience with terror; &amp; then he was bid to believe; what, can you not believe now? <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there are mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ſins I have been guilty of, and God hath let looſe all the Devils of Hell upon my Soul; and how is it poſſible for me to believe</hi>? Alas men that think it is an eaſie matter to believe, never knew what it was. To <hi>preſume</hi> is eaſie, or to <hi>deſpair</hi> is eaſie, but to <hi>believe</hi> is hard. There never was any man that did believe, but he found hard work of it. Theſe things then ſhew, that it is an hard matter to obtain Salvation. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

            <p>Reaſ 2. <hi>For the paucity of the number of them that ſhall be ſaved.</hi> It many ſhould be ſaved, and a few miſs of <hi>Salvation,</hi> yet there were cauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>We proceed therefore to the Uſe of the Doctrine: Let it be of earneſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and that in the words of the Text, <hi>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling</hi>: So that you do not only work about, but work out your Salvation, and that you do it <hi>with fear and trembling.</hi> And for rules of Direction here, 1. <hi>Go to work underſtandingly. David</hi> prayeth, <hi>Give me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> &amp; <hi>I ſhall live,</hi> Pſ. 119 144. even ſo, if <hi>you would</hi> nave Life &amp; Salvation, then <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> after ſpiritual underſtanding. It is true, knowledge alone will not ſave, a man may have a wonderful meaſure of knowledge, and yet periſh; nevertheleſs, the want of knowledge may deſtroy a man, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.6.
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:002260_0277_0FDAE0FA332C6720"/>
               <hi>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.</hi> He that would be a Workman as to any Civil Calling, muſt have knowledge: So he that would be a Workman as to his general Calling, muſt have ſpiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. A workman hath the Idea, Model and Platform of his work in his head, whereby he is enabled to go to work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandingly, that he knoweth where to begin, and how to go on, and where to finiſh: So he that would be a Workman, as to this work of Salvation, muſt get a Platform thereof into his head and heart; he muſt know what work of the Law, what of the Goſpel, what Preparation, what Conviction, what Contrition, what Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what Faith, what Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is requiſite in order to Salvation. 2. <hi>Look well to your Foundation</hi>: As in all works, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Foundation be right, the works will come to nothing: So it is in this work of Salvation. Oh therefore take heed of building upon a ſandy Foundation. They that build upon Priviledges, or Gifts, or Duties, or Creatures, build upon a ſandy Foundation: But ſee you build upon the Rock. Remember what you have lately heard in many Sermons, concerning the <hi>wiſe</hi> &amp; <hi>fooliſh</hi> Builders, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.24. to 28.
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:002260_0278_0FDAE1231706E9A8"/>
Chriſt is the only ſafe Foundation to build upon, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Other Foundation can no man lay, beſides that which is laid, even Jeſus Chriſt</hi>: Therefore ſee that you build upon him, and upon him wholly and only: Not partly upon Chriſt, and partly upon other things, but wholly on Chriſt alone. 3. <hi>Be often examining how this work goes forward</hi>: The reaſon why this work of a mans <hi>own Salvation</hi> goeth no more forward, is, becauſe the duty of <hi>Self Examination</hi> is no more practiſed: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine whether you have Grace, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 13.5. and whether you grow in Grace: exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether you have laid a good Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and alſo how far you proceeded in the work. Alas, ſome think the work is well over, when it is to begin ſtill; and the reaſon of their miſtake is, becauſe they do not take pains to examine how matters ſtand between God and their Souls. I have Read of a Heathen, that every day when night came, would call himſelf to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and if he had not received and done ſome good that day, he would be much troubled. Alas, how much do many Chriſtians fall ſhort of this? 4. <hi>Allow time for this matter, and make it your work.</hi> Great works muſt have time allowed to do them
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:002260_0279_0FDAE0FB77FA4AB0"/>
in. Now <hi>the greateſt work which every Man hath to do in this World, is to make ſure that his Soul get ſafe to Heaven, when he dyeth and leaveth this World</hi>; Therefore allow your ſelves time to attend the Duties of your general Calling, every day allow your ſelves time for reading the Scripture, and for Prayer in your Familes, and in your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets alſo; you can allow your ſelves time for other matters, nay it may be needleſs matters, and very vanities; and will you not allow time to look after the Eternal Concernments of your imortal Souls? you can allow your ſelves time to ſleep, and will you not allow your ſelves time to pray? Rather be without ſleep, nay without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Food, than live without Prayer, and ſee that you make this buſineſs of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your work.</hi> Do not think to make it a by work, which you will mind when you have nothing elſe to do. But whatever be done, or leſt undone, let not this matter of your Salvation be left undone, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. two laſt Verſes. 5. <hi>Set about the work, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="256" facs="unknown:002260_0280_0FDAE124846EE728"/>
mighty Corruptions (Sons of <hi>Anak</hi>) to be ſubdued, there are mighty ſtrong Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be reſiſted, there are great Duties to be performed; therefore enter upon all in <hi>the</hi> name of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Christ ſtrengthening of me.</hi> Then may you be able to ſubdue <hi>all</hi> Corruptions, reſiſt <hi>all</hi> Temptations, perform <hi>all</hi> Duties, bear <hi>all</hi> Afflictions, if the ſtrength of Chriſt be engaged with you &amp; for you. 6. <hi>Live in love and peace amongst your ſelves.</hi> The Apoſtle in this Context is exhorting to peace and unity, and then ſaith, <hi>Work out your own Salvation:</hi> Why, wha't that to the buſineſs of Salvation? Oh yes very much, for Diviſions do exceedingly hinder Salvat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion-work: Therefore it is that the Devil maketh it his main deſign to ſow diſcord amongſt Chriſtians, becauſe he l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>eth that the work of God will never go forward as it ſhould do, if there be Contentions and Schiſms amongſt the Lords people. Alas, when it is thus, mens time &amp; ſpirits will be taken up about parties, that every one inſtead of working out his own Salvation, will be ſtudying and buſying himſelf how he may promote the intereſt of his own party &amp; faction: I tremble to think what account many amongſt us will be able to give unto Chriſt another day in this reſpect.</p>

               <pb n="257" facs="unknown:002260_0281_0FDAE0FCC5B49628"/>Now for Motives here,</p>
            <p>Conſider. 1. <hi>The poſibility which is in this thing</hi> which you are exhorted unto. Indeed it is an hard matter for men to work out their own Salvation (as but now was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto you) yet it is poſſible: If you will <hi>abound in the work of the Lord, your labour ſhall not be in vain,</hi> 1. Cor. 15. <hi>ult.</hi> Certain it is, that there is a poſſibility of being ſaved, for Chriſt hath purchaſed Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: And God freely offers it in the Goſpel to all that will accept of it, upon gracious and bleſſed terms. Beſides, if a man be once brought into the way of Salvation, he is then able (by the Grace of God) to <hi>work out his Salvation.</hi> A man that hath not Grace, is not able <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o give himſelf Grace; but a man that hath Grace, is able to get more Grace, if he will be laborious in improving what he hath, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.12.</p>
            <p>Conſider. 2. <hi>The momenteous greatneſs of this matter</hi>: It is a matter of the higheſt concernment which now you hear of; and therefore you had need be converſant about it, <hi>with fear and trembling.</hi> If a man were ſet about a work, and it were ſaid to him, if you do your work well, you ſhall live, but if you do not your work well,
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:002260_0282_0FDAE126066DC080"/>
you ſhall dye; With what trembling would he do it? So 'tis here, if you do this work well, you ſhall live; but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, you ſhall dye: You are about a matter of life and death, nay, of Eternal life or Eternal death, and therefore you need be in good earneſt. Of ſuch moment is this Salvation, that if a man ſhould fall ſhort of it, all the World is never able to make him amends, or to countervail his loſe: You know what Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. <hi>What is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? or what ſhall a man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his Soul?</hi> If a man ſhould loſe the Salvation of his Soul, all the World can never make him amends for that loſe.</p>
            <p>Conſider. 3. <hi>That Salvation is not in your own hands, but depends on the good pleaſure of God:</hi> This is the motive which the Apoſtle makes uſe of in this context, <hi>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling; For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is God that worketh of his own good pleaſure:</hi> As if it were ſaid, <hi>Tremble</hi> to mis God's ſeaſon; if you do not work out your Salvation, it may be God's ſeaſon will be over, and then you may go to work, and all in vain. <hi>Remember</hi> what you have heard concerning the
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:002260_0283_0FDAE0FE410BA3A0"/>
ſtrivings of Gods Spirit, he will not ſtrive always: <hi>Remember</hi> how it was with <hi>Eſau:</hi> And <hi>Remember</hi> how it was with the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they neglected God's ſeaſon, and afterwards laboured in vain to enter into <hi>Canaan. Remember</hi> how it was with the fooliſh Virgins, they came and knocked and cryed, and ſaid, <hi>Lord, Lord, open unto us</hi>; but the door was ſhut upon them.</p>
            <p>Conſider. 4. <hi>That except you [work out] your Salvation, you had as good do nothing.</hi> Though you ſhould <hi>work,</hi> if you do not <hi>work out,</hi> you do nothing. As in running a Race except a Man <hi>hold out</hi> to the end of his Race, he loſeth the Crown; O then, be ſure that you ſo run as that you may obtain, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24. You may run, you may labour, and yet not obtain the Crown of Life, except ye <hi>ſo run,</hi> as to come to the end of your Chriſtian Courſe. You may work, and yet miſs of Salvation, except you <hi>work it out</hi>; and you muſt <hi>begin well, and hold on well, and end well,</hi> if you deſire happineſs. O how lamantable is it for a man to periſh eternally, after he hath done and ſuffered many things, after he hath made many prayers, and heard many Sermons, and it may be come to
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:002260_0284_0FDAE127ABAA92D8"/>
many Sacraments, after all this to periſh, that's exceeding lamantable! to be caſt away in the Harbours mouth as it were, to dye within ſight of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to go to Hell after the Soul hath been within on ſtep of Heaven, that's ſad indeed. Now the Lord write theſe things in your hearts by the finger of his holy Spirit, and help you <hi>to work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
