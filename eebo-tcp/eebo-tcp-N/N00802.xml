            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MANS natural and extinguiſhable cravings are after <hi>Happineſs.</hi> God at firſt put him in a fair way for the ſecuring and obtaining of it; having, beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of it imprinted in his nature, which ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, given him a <hi>Rule</hi> to direct him the way to it, and a concreated <hi>power</hi> to conform to that <hi>Rule,</hi> and brought him under ſtrongeſt obligations to that Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. But, by his unhappy fall, he hath reduced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a ſtate of miſery, in which the whole Race of ſinful men is involved, and under which he muſt have abode for ever, had not God, in his rich mercy, opened <hi>a new and living way</hi> for his recovery. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Goſpel, in which <hi>life and immortality are brought to light;</hi> but for which undone man muſt have groped in the dark, and it is certain, that thoſe to whom this <hi>Revelation</hi> is not made, do but graſp after ſhadows inſtead of ſubſtances, <hi>and lay out their money for that which is not bread.</hi> Their inſatiable deſires puſh them forward in queſt of felecity, and their crazed and deluded understandings, which

               <p>The firſt thing then in the Pſalm, is a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given of a bleſſed man, <hi>verſe</hi> 1, 2. And it
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000965_0008_0FADE69BE8BBAC60"/>
bears reſpect to the ſtate of Bleſſedneſs which is enjoyed in this life. There is an <hi>Inchoate Felicity</hi> which the Children of God are partakers of here, which ſhall arrive at perfection hereafter. The <hi>Topick</hi> from whence he argues or deſcribes this <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> is the ſtate of Pardon or Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in which ſuch do now ſtand.</p>
               <p>In the words obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The bleſſedneſs of ſome is aſſerted; <hi>Bleſſed.</hi> Interpreters are at a loſs about the word. Some make it an <hi>Adverb,</hi> ſignifying, <hi>well: q. d. it ſhall be well with ſuch an one.</hi> Others an <hi>Adjective</hi> of the plural, ſignifying, <hi>That all manner of felicities belong to ſuch an one, both in this life, and that to come.</hi> The word certainly denotes an happy ſtate, and tells us, that there is in it the affluence of all the good that is deſirable; and the Pſalmiſt gives us to underſtand that there are ſuch men as theſe in the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This bleſſed man is characterized; he is a <hi>pardoned man</hi>: where,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We have the nature of this pardon expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in three particulars, in all of which <hi>Sin</hi> is conſidered as the thing about which this pardon is applied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſet forth in divers names which are given it in the Word of God; and when he mentions ſin indefinitely, it is to be underſtood of all ſin: for <hi>one ſin unpardoned, is enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and overthrow all the mans bleſſedneſs.</hi> Here then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The pardoned man is one <hi>whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven.</hi> The word, <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> ſignifies a

                  <hi>proud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rebellious, wilful breaking of the Law; or high-banded iniquity</hi>; and the word, <hi>Forgiven,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>to take off from one</hi>; and is ſuppoſed to be a Metaphor from a burden which oppreſſeth one, by the removal whereof he is eaſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is one <hi>whoſe ſin is covered</hi>; the word, <hi>Sin,</hi> ſignifies <hi>an erring, or turning out of the right way</hi>; and is applicable to all Sin whatſoever, which is <hi>Anomy,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.4. the word, <hi>Covered,</hi> ſignifies, <hi>to hide a thing, by throwing ſomething over it, that it may not be ſeen</hi>; and is a metaphor from the covering of naſty dirty things, that one is not willing ſhould be taken notice of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is one <hi>to whom the Lord imputes not ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>; the word, <hi>Iniquity,</hi> ſignifies that which is <hi>crooked or perverſe</hi>; and is ſometimes uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Original Sin,</hi> which is the crookedneſs of our nature; and is often alſo applied to <hi>Actual Sin,</hi> which is called mans <hi>crooked way</hi>; and the word tranſlated <hi>Impute,</hi> among many other ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of it is often uſed for <hi>reckoning or char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to ones account</hi>: and Sins are ſometimes called <hi>Debts</hi> in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have the evidence of this pardon ſet down, with reſpect to the ſubject of it, he is one <hi>in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile</hi>; the word, <hi>Guile,</hi> ſignifies, <hi>fraud, falſhood, and deceit</hi>; and is here taken for <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>integrity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there is a Bleſſedneſs which God hath provided for, and will beſtow upon ſome of the Children of men, is a truth obſervable

               <p>A <hi>Pardoned Man, is a Bleſſed Man</hi>; That perſon who hath obtained at the hand of God a Remiſſion of his ſins, is poſſeſſed of true felicity; a ſtate of forgiveneſs, is a ſtate of real happineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I might here ſpend ſome time in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the nature of <hi>Pardon</hi>; but that will follow to be diſtinctly conſidered afterwards; here therefore let it be only in general obſerved, <hi>that pardon properly conſiſts in the removal of the Guilt of ſin from the ſinful creature.</hi> It ever ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth guilt ariſing from ſin, with which the man was juſtly charged, and by which he was under a Sentence of Condemnation. When this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is taken off, and the perſon is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cquitted, then he is ſaid to be pardoned. It is therefore an act of authority, done by one who hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to apply it; and that is no other but God; they ſaid the truth in <hi>Theſi,</hi> Mark 2.7. <hi>Who can forgive ſins but God only?</hi> only their charge was falſe, becauſe Chriſt was God; and being
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000965_0011_0FADE6A0342B50F0"/>
conſtituted by his Father to be Judge of all the World, he had this authority, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. But that which I here deſign, is only to clear up the truth of the Doctrine, by eſſaying to diſcover the great bleſſedneſs of ſuch an one as is pardoned: only obſerving, that their whole bleſſedneſs doth not conſiſt in this; it being a collection of many things together, that are requiſite to the making one compleatly happy; but this is one of them, and inſeparable from the reſt; and doth alſo communicate to the man that which is truly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying.</p>
               <p>There are two heads to which we may refer the demonſtration of this truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The evil and miſery which this pardon frees the man from, declares him to be happy. <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> are directly contrary each to other: that therefore which removes this from the man, reſtores him to that again: now this pardon hath a main ſtroak here. How this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves it, will be conſidered hereafter; we now only conſider the things that it delivers the man from, and they are not only ſeeming, but real and great miſeries; it therefore muſt needs be a real and great felicity. Here then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It takes off the <hi>Condemnation</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> which was fallen on the Sinner; all mankind were for ſin, condemned by the Law of God: we read therefore of unbelievers, that they <hi>are condemned already,</hi> Joh. 3.18. and this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was according to the tenour of the Law, Gen. 2.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely dy.</hi> This Sentence
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000965_0012_0FADE6A0584DD128"/>
is paſt by God on the whole race of fallen men; &amp; every unpardoned ſinner abides under it; &amp; every ſort of death is contained in it; and what a fearful thing is it to ſtand condemned? how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable is ſuch an one? but as ſoon as the pardon comes, the <hi>Condemnation ceaſeth,</hi> Rom. 8.1. and if it never comes, it is impoſſible for the man to ſcape the Execution of it; he cannot break pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; the Law muſt take place: but this ſtops the mouth of the Law, and that nothing elſe can do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It pacifieth the <hi>Anger of God</hi> which was out againſt him. Sinners are under the influence of it, and expoſed to feel its terrible impreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; we read in, Pſal. 7.11. <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day</hi>; and this proceeds from his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which being ſo ſet againſt Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.13. makes Sinners, who are under the Guilt of Sin, the objects of his diſpleaſure; and it is a dreadful miſery to be under the anger of God, Pſal. 76.7. <hi>Who may ſtand in thy ſight when once thou art angry?</hi> but when a pardon comes, that anger is laid aſide: and it brings the teſtimony of it. God in applying of forgiveneſs, ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be atoned: and how happy did he reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf on the conſideration of this benefit? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.1. all the miſeries o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the creature are the effects of Gods diſpleaſure, how muſt they then ceaſe upon his being reconciled.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It diſchargeth them from the <hi>Curſe.</hi> There is a <hi>Curſe</hi> contained in the <hi>Law-Condemnation</hi> that is paſt upon the Sinner; and it belongs to all
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000965_0013_0FADE6A11932D9F8"/>
that are <hi>under the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.10. and this is a miſerable condition. Beſides the things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it referring to another world, which will fall under an after conſideration, let us here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that in this life it is very fearful: and that obſervable on a double account. There is a <hi>Curſe</hi> on all their <hi>Bleſſings.</hi> They do enjoy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favours in this life, through the benignity of God, but there is a Curſe upon them all; and that not only to remove them, but to harm them in the very enjoyment: hence that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we have ſuch an expreſſion, Mal. 2.2. <hi>I will curſe your bleſſings, yea I have curſed them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi>; every thing doth them hurt; all tends to their diſadvantage, <hi>Their Table is a ſnare,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 69.22. Whereas they that are pardoned, have this Curſe removed from them; this is a benefit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in, Rev. 22.3. <hi>There ſhall be no more Curſe</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this flows from forgiveneſs. There is a Curſe alſo in their <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and that is it which puts the bitterneſs into them. All the Afflictions that come upon Unpardoned Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are the Executions of the Sentence of the Law, and are diſpenſed by God as a Judge. We read, in Eccleſ 5.17. <hi>He hath much ſorrow and wrath with his Sickneſs</hi>; in all this there is a ſignification of vengeance, and they come to tell men what they are to expect. But, tho' the pardoned man may meet with afflictions and ſore trials, yet the bitterneſs is taken out, becauſe they are, though oftentimes the fruit of <hi>anger,</hi> yet of <hi>love</hi> too, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. they are
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000965_0014_0FADE6A1D68C81B8"/>
not the beginning of ſorrows, but to prevent greater, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. and they ſhall do them no <hi>hurt,</hi> but <hi>good,</hi> Rom. 8.28.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It ſtops the mouths of all <hi>accuſers,</hi> and makes void all their charges. We have that demand of the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that Justifieth</hi>; an unpardoned ſinner is liable to the clamour of every accuſer; and whenſoever his Sin is charged upon him by his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the terrors of the Lord are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he hath nothing to ſupport himſelf with, but is liable to all horror and deſpair, being conſcious of his Guilt, and the Wrath that is our againſt him. But it is not ſo with him that is pardoned: When his own heart tells him, that he hath been ſuch a Sinner, and Satan endeavours to terrify him with the moſt fearful repreſentations of Sin, and the Law, and the Wrath of God, and would fain diſtreſs him therewithal, he hath his pardon to ſhew, Signed and Sealed by the Spirit of God: ſo that he can think of his ſins with deepeſt abaſement, and ſoul humbling thoughts, and yet not be terrified with them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It takes away the <hi>terrours</hi> of the <hi>Grave.</hi> It doth not indeed prevent the death of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but it takes off the horror of it. Death is called the <hi>King of Terrours,</hi> and well may it be ſo to the unpardoned Sinner, for it is his paſport in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to endleſs miſeries: and a dreadful thing it is, to be in expectation of dying, and horribly afraid

Job</hi> 14.14. this is it that <hi>unſtings death,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.55.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It quencheth the fire of <hi>Hell.</hi> The Unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Sinner is going to <hi>Everlaſting Burnings</hi>; the Curſe is dragging him to the place <hi>where the Worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched</hi>; theſe endleſs plagues are prepared on purpoſe for him, and without a pardon, there is no eſcaping of them; the doom is paſt upon him, and there is no other way for the averſion of it, but this, and this is a miſery which exceeds our preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; and the expectation of it is tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, it is a <hi>fearful looking for Judgment, and fiery indignation,</hi> Heb. 10.27. But where a pardon is beſtowed, this Execution is ſtopt, and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which adjudged him to it is reverſed, and he can now meditate of theſe terrible things with a ſedate mind; and improve this meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the raiſing of his ſoul to the more admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the wonderful kindneſs of God, in giving him a delivery from theſe torments; and is not this happineſs indeed? is not he beyond queſtion a bleſſed man, who is thus freed from all theſe miſeries? this is the lot of every one that is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:000965_0016_0FADE6A385C72BF8"/>2. The <hi>priviledges</hi> which flow from, or attend upon this pardon, do no leſs declare the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch an one; theſe have not the ſhadow, but the ſubſtance of felicity in them. Pardon of Sin brings with it all the benefits of Chriſt; forgiveneſs derives to us through him, as may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be particularly evidenced, it is from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his Righteouſneſs; and ſo it derives to us by Faith, with which we accept of, and cloſe in with his perſon: and if he be once ours, all his benefits are ſo too; for they are inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. if God makes him ours, he makes him all to us: and by vertue of that, all bleſſedneſs is made ours. Hence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They that are pardoned are <hi>Juſtified.</hi> There are two things that belong to the Juſtification of a Sinner, and this is one of them: their ſins are forgiven, and they are adjudged righteous, and theſe are never parted; for, where God pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſin, there he imputeth Righteouſneſs, and thence the man comes to be Juſtified, ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle argueth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7. and certainly, he that is Juſtified is bleſſed: for indeed, as all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is rooted in Condemnation, ſo all felicity flows from Juſtification: the Apoſtle therefore puts them together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he hath Juſtified, them he hath Glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Pardon of Sin layeth the foundation for all <hi>Peace</hi> in the Soul. Unpardoned Sinners have <hi>no peace</hi> at all. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. <hi>ult.</hi> They indeed ſometimes <hi>Cry peace, peace, to themſelves,</hi> but it is ungrounded. Whereas there is all ſolid peace comes in with
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000965_0017_0FADE6A41254A850"/>
forgiveneſs; <hi>peace with God,</hi> Rom. 5.1. He is now reconciled, and the man may appeal to him, and he will not be a conſuming fire to him; he hath now the free <hi>liberty of acceſs to the Throne of Grace with boldneſs</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to put up his requeſts without terror. He hath <hi>peace</hi> at home in his own <hi>Conſcience</hi>: The Wickeds Conſcience is <hi>like a raging Sea,</hi> always tumbling and toſſing: but there is a calm and quiet in the Conſcience of a pardoned one, Conſcience is now his friend, and ceaſeth to accuſe; and it puts a <hi>confidence</hi> in him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. Yea it <hi>teſtifyeth</hi> for him, and ſo gives him matter of <hi>rejoycing,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. and he hath <hi>peace</hi> with the <hi>Creatures</hi>; they are armed in Gods Controverſie, and the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner may expect every one to be his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner; but there is a <hi>league</hi> between this man and the Creatures, <hi>Job</hi> 5.23, 24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They that are pardoned are alſo <hi>Adopted</hi>; this therefore is mentioned as one great deſign of Chriſt's Redemption, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. <hi>That we might receive the Adoption of Sons</hi>; hence we have them both joyned together as concomitant bleſſings, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, 5. and this is a felicity which ſurmounts our conception; the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it as a thing out bidding all expreſſions, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. the love of God appearing in it is incomparable, and they who are entituled to, and poſſeſſed of ſuch love, cannot but be in an happy condition; <hi>How is it poſſible that a Child of God ſhould be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They are hereupon made great <hi>heirs</hi>; this
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000965_0018_0FADE6A8D5F5C7C8"/>
is inferred from the former, Rom. 8.17. <hi>If Sons, then heirs, heirs of God</hi>; and theſe two are put together, as being conſequent one upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Acts 26.18. <hi>To receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and an inheritance,</hi> &amp;c. and who can tell what are thoſe glorious things are contained in this Inheritance? they are the things which <hi>eye hath not ſeen, &amp;c.</hi> ſurely the portion which Chriſt hath purchaſed and laid in to be beſtowed on the Children of God, is ſufficient to make them happy for ever; they that are owners of it cannot poſſibly want for any thing that may give them compleat ſatisfaction, and anſwer their moſt enlarged cravings to the uttermoſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They are made to enjoy intimate <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with God. Being reconciled, they are now heavens favourites, and the Great God conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to have fellowſhip with them; what ſaith he? 1 Joh. 1.3. <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with God the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; and who are they but ſuch, and all ſuch whoſe ſins are forgiven? it was ſin that made the <hi>wall of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between God and them,</hi> Iſa. 59.2. but now the wall is pulled down, and God <hi>delights</hi> in, and <hi>dwells</hi> with them, <hi>Iſa</hi> 57.15. and needs muſt that ſoul be in a bleſſed ſtate, that hath ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Communion with the fountain of all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They are <hi>ſafe</hi> from all danger; they are out of the reach of harm; their ſtate is ſecure; if God once pardon, he will never condemn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: if they are once in his love, they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000965_0019_0FADE6A9B535EAF0"/>
be put out of it more; when they once are numbred among Children, they ſhall never be diſinherited; nothing <hi>ſhall be able to ſeparate them from Gods love, Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. God may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them, but he will not reject them: if he afflict them, it ſhall be for their good, but his <hi>kindneſs he will never take away,</hi> Pſal. 89 34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> every pardoned one may without fear, challenge that priviledge, 1 Pet. 1.5. <hi>To be kept by the power of God, through faith unto Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Their preſent <hi>joyes</hi> are truly happifying. There is that Conſolation flowing down to the Soul from the ſenſe and apprehenſion of pardon, which is raviſhing; and none can tell what it is but he that hath it: <hi>a ſtranger</hi> cannot <hi>intermeddle</hi> with it. There is ſomething like it in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Malefactor, when at the place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, terrified and amazed at the apprehenſion of inſtant death, a pardon is ſent him, and he is diſcharged; well might our Saviour preface that happy ſentence, with ſuch an encouragement, Mat. 9.2. <hi>Be of good cheer, thy ſins are forgiven</hi>; 'tis <hi>joy unſpeakable and full of glory</hi>; and is not this bleſſedneſs?</p>
               <p n="8">8. The pardoned ſinner, ſhall without doubt be made a <hi>glorious Saint in Heaven</hi> Where God begins with forgiveneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will end with Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. It was the <hi>Salvation of Sinners</hi> that Chriſt came to bring about, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. and it was to <hi>Save them from their ſins</hi> that he was made a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> Mat. 1.21. the firſt ſtep of this Salvation is when he ſaves them from Condemnation by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000965_0020_0FADE6AA1AA27B40"/>
them; and the laſt is to follow in due time, which is done by beſtowing eternal ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon them; he is therefore ſaid to be the <hi>Author</hi> of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. and if it be ſo, ſhall we not pronounce pardoned men, bleſſed men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE I.</hi> Let this then ſerve to awaken all of us to ſeek after this pardon. There is in all a natural deſire to be happy: but alas! what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy courſes are the moſt taking to obtain it? but here you are pointed to a way that will not fail, if duly attended; be then perſwaded to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Rule; and to move you, conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a pardon to be had; this comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table news is brought to us in the Goſpel: we are told that <hi>there is forgiveneſs with God,</hi> Pſal. 130.4. yea it is one of the titles that he aſſumes to himſelf in the Scriptures, Exod. 34.7. <hi>Forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin</hi>; and for this is he celebrated, that he is forward to apply it, Pſal. 86.5. <hi>ready to forgive</hi>; and there is full evidence for this; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed it; he came for that very end, and he hath accompliſhed it; there was more done for the making way for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, than in the making of the World. When Juſtice had condemned the Sinner to dy, and there was no deliverance to be had, but by ſatisfaction made to it, and there was none that could make that ſatisfaction but a Divine Perſon, <hi>God ſpared not his own Son, but gave him for us</hi>; when there was no other offering that could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000965_0021_0FADE6AAECE45AF8"/>
this guilt, <hi>he delivered him for our offences,</hi> Rom. 4. ult. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and he hath paid the Redemption price; and now <hi>God may be both juſt and juſtify.</hi> Here lay the neceſſity of Chriſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and dying, becauſe ſinners could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unleſs pardoned; and they could not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned unleſs the Law were ſatisfied; this was the one thing that made his coming neceſſary; and in coming he hath done it to effect, ſo that <hi>he is able to ſave to the uttermost, Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God freely offers this pardon where the Goſpel cometh. He invites the children of men to come to him that they may be forgiven; he proclaims pardon to the world, and bids them ſeek it of him, and maketh large promiſes to them that ſo do, of beſtowing it on them; that is one great argument that he uſeth, when he bids men to ſeek after him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18.55.7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30. and elſewhere plentifully; yea, he is grieved when men will not come to him for it. It is the great provocation under the Goſpel, that Chriſt and his Salvation are neglected: and he hath put it in the directory of prayer, and made it one petition that he hath put into our mouths, Mat. 6.12. <hi>Forgive us our debts</hi>; and ſuch as have ſought it, have readily obtained it, <hi>Context. Verſe</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is never an one of us but doth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely need it; there is no doing without one for the children of men: it is therefore the greateſt concern that lies upon us; the firſt thing we have to ſeek after; for,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:000965_0022_0FADE6AB94AC1188"/>1. We are all Sinners. This is the natural ſtate in which all men are at firſt: the fall hath brought it upon the whole race. We are Sinners by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; the great Tranſgreſſion which our firſt Parents perpetrated, when they ſtood as publick Perſons, is become ours, and we ſtand condemned for it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. The defilement of nature is upon us all, that <hi>Original, in dwelling Sin,</hi> which hath depraved all our faculties and powers, and filled them with the habits of perverſneſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 51.5. And we have committed innumerable <hi>Actual Sins Gen.</hi> 8.21. So that there is a woful deal of matter for pardon in every one of us; for it is Sin that makes us to need forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are hereby under <hi>Guilt.</hi> Guilt is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable companion of ſin, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Law-Covenant; ſo that as long as we are under that, we ſtand guilty. The Law dooms every ſinner to dy for every the leaſt tranſgreſſion of it, and <hi>Guilt</hi> is the <hi>Obligation</hi> lying on him to ſuffer the ſame. <hi>Guilt</hi> is a <hi>Priſon</hi> in which the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is ſhut up for puniſhment, and he cannot break out of it; its bars and bolts are too ſtrong: and we are told that <hi>all the world are guilty before God. Rom</hi> 3.19. <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo long as they abide under the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are fearful miſeries await us, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Guilt. <hi>Guilt</hi> holds us under the <hi>Curſe,</hi> and that is a tremendous thing: all the miſeries of this life, and all the ſorrows of hell are contained in it. We read of a fearful great <hi>Roll,</hi> and it was <hi>Written within and without</hi>: and what were
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000965_0023_0FADE6AC6FF1FCA0"/>
the contents of it? why it was the <hi>Curſe, Zech.</hi> 5. <hi>begin.</hi> No tongue can expreſs, no heart conceive, the wretchedneſs of that man who muſt undergo all that is written in it: and yet this is the guilty ſinners portion, and, whiles guilty, he cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is no avoiding theſe miſeries without a pardon: that, and only that can remove our Guilt. We cannot make ſatisfaction; it is vain to hope or attempt it; <hi>Thouſands of Rams,</hi> &amp;c. ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy nothing here, nor can we any way fly from it, becauſe our Guilt keeps us cloſe priſoners, and will drag us before the great Tribunal: forgiveneſs is the one way to have it taken off; and that is the thing we want. Try all other courſes, and they will deceive you; but get a pardon, and your buſineſs is done; miſs of that, and you are undone. There lies all the hope of a ſinner. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.9. <hi>To the Lord belong mercies and forgiveneſſes.</hi> It is as much as your Lives, yea your Souls are worth, that you obtain it: be not then careleſs about this one thing, leſt you rue it for ever.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Obtain forgiveneſs, and you have all ſecured to you that is needful to make you happy for ever. Get this, and all will come with it: without it you can have nothing elſe. Chriſt will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his Adoption, and his Grace, and his Glory upon an unpardoned ſinner: but when he gives a pardon, he will give every thing elſe. Why then do men ſit ſtill, &amp; neglect this great buſineſs? Can you find any thing elſe of equal moment? is there any other buſineſs comparably neceſſary
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000965_0024_0FADE6ADD4B9F050"/>
to this? be not then careleſs about it, but ſet your ſelves to ſeek it.</p>
               <p>Directions how to do ſo, will fall under a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Doctrine; only be not ſlight about it; give your ſelves no reſt, till you have gotten a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſigned and ſealed. Bleſs God who hath told you of it, and go to him for it in the Name of Chriſt, ask that faith of him by which you may receive it, and be made happy by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE. II.</hi> Let this put us all upon the <hi>Trial</hi> of our ſtate, Whether we are indeed pardoned. And I know no queſtion more ſolemn and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that any of us hath to put to our own Soul, than this, <hi>Am I a pardoned one? are my ſins forgiven? hath God blotted out my Tranſgreſſions?</hi> And, except men be dead aſleep in a Lethargy of carnal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, one would think, they could not live at any reſt, till they had gotten a comfortable reſolution of this queſtion; till they had a ſupporting hope, built upon a good foundation? Can we think of the Judgments of God to which we are expoſed? Can we meditate on the day of Death which we are haſtning unto, and know not how ſoon it will over take us? Can we have any comfortable thoughts of the day of Judgment which is haſtning, where all that are found out of Chriſt, and ſo without a pardon, will be adjudged to everlaſting miſeries, and yet not know how we are laid in for ſuch a day? Let us then be ſollicitous about this matter, and be often bringing our ſelves to the ſtricteſt Rules of Trial which the word of God
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000965_0025_0FADE6AE9189EDE0"/>
affords us, and of which we may ſhortly have an account. Believe it, the reſolution of this caſe of Conſcience, will make amends for all the pains that we can be at in ſeeking after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE. III.</hi> Let it be for a word of <hi>Conſolation</hi> to all ſuch as are pardoned. Are all ſuch bleſſed men? how ſhould the apprehenſion of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our hearts? and certainly, if we do not find more ſweetneſs in it, than in all that is delightful in this world, we never felt the burden of Guilt thereby, and may well queſtion whether we are forgiven or no. Are you delivered from wrath to come, and can any thing elſe damp your joys is not here enough to ballance, yea to ſwallow up all other ſorrows whatſoever? And that you may ſuitably expreſs this joy of yours, take theſe two words of direction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Bleſs God for this wonderful gift. This i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And can we ſufficiently admire, &amp; bleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What manner of Converſation ought we to lead in the world, to whom God hath given his free forgiveneſs? Shall we not loath Sin more, by the conſideration of the great pardon that is given us? Shall we not abſtain from it with the more care and abhorrence, by conſidering what it coſt the Son of God to procure a Remiſſion of it for us? Shall we not make it our conſtant care and endeavour to pleaſe and ſerve that God who hath dealt ſo bountifully with us? Shall we not love him who hath ſo loved us? And if we do indeed love him, according to this obligation, it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make us willing and unwearied, in ſeeking to expreſs this love ſuitably, in dayly <hi>Dying unto Sin, and Living unto Holineſs,</hi> and purſuing of this all our days.</p>

                  <hi>GOD'S forgiveneſs extends to all Sin.</hi> This is implyed in the threefold expreſſion of Sin here uſed, which contain under them, not only the errours that men are apt to fall into, but alſo the crooked and perverſe nature and actions which they are chargable with; yea the bold, proud, and high handed Tranſgreſſions which they rebelliouſly

perpotrate againſt God. Give me leave firſt to explain the Doctrine, and then to give the reaſon for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Explication we may premiſe, That there is one Sin which, in the Goſpel, is exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from forgiveneſs, and but one. It is true, all Sin impenitently perſiſted in unto death, leaves the Sinner unpardoned; for there is neither Save<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Repentance, nor forgiveneſs to be obtained in another World, by one that dies in his Sins: but it is not becauſe former impenitency may not be pardoned upon Repentance, but becauſe the Sinner hath, by perſiſting in it, loſt the opportunity of a day of Grace. But there is one that in it ſelf puts the man, in this life, out of all hope of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and that is called <hi>The Sin against the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> of which our Saviour ſo ſpeaks. <hi>Mark</hi> 3.28, 29. This is that which is called the <hi>Sin unto Death,</hi> which puts the man out of our Prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.16. And this is that which is deſcribed to us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6 4, 5. Nor indeed is this Sin unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, becauſe its Guilt out-bids the value of the Atonement, but becauſe by it, the man puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the road of forgiveneſs, according to the Divine Ordination, and by a malicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the Goſpel, and the Spirit of God in it, after great illuminations, and an high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, he provokes God to give him over to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, and ſearedneſs of Conſcience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is Sealed to final impenitence, there being a total and final withdrawing of the Spirit from him. Concerning which, I ſhall only ſay thus
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000965_0028_0FADE6B42A5E3CB8"/>
much, that the perſon who is troubled and grieved in himſelf, for fear leſt he have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Sin, hath therein a good evidence that he hath not, ſince the Goſpel ſeems to give that as one inſeparable concomitant of it, <hi>viz.</hi> an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and a malicious hatred of the Goſpel way of Salvation.

               <p n="1">1. The greateſt and vileſt ſins in themſelves may be forgiven. Our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> tells us, that <hi>ſome ſins are in themſelves more heinous than others</hi>; and the Scripture is full for it. Not but that all ſins are equally tranſgreſſions of the Law, and conſequently incur the guilt of Eternal Death: yet if we conſider and compare ſome with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there is in the things themſelves more of the malignity of the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a ſin to be angry without cauſe; but greater to commit actual Murder; a ſin to murmur againſt God, but greater to blaſpheme; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the greateſt and moſt abominable of theſe are not out of the reach of a pardon: and we may well argue, that if Gods forgiveneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to thoſe that are greater, it is not out bid by thoſe that are leſſer; there are <hi>ſcarlet</hi> and <hi>crimſon</hi> ſins, and yet theſe may be <hi>waſhed</hi> away, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. I might here inſtance in thoſe that are

deſervedly reputed the moſt odious and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and point you to ſuch as have been horribly guilty of them, and yet obtained mercy, and are now glorified Saints in Heaven: we have a whole heap of them numbred together, and ſuch an obſervation made on them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11. <hi>Murder</hi> is an horrible ſin, and the blood of the innocent cryes to heaven for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and yet <hi>David</hi> obtained a pardon for this: he prays, Pſal. 51.14. <hi>Deliver me from blood guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs</hi>: and the Prophet tells him, 2 Sam. 12.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt not dy. Idolatry</hi> is a fearful ſin, and that which is terribly threatned in the Word of God; and yet God invites ſuch to <hi>return</hi> upon the promiſe of <hi>pardon,</hi> Jer 3. <hi>begin.

               <p n="2">2. Sins committed with the greateſt and moſt horrid aggravations, do not exclude men from pardon; that the ſame ſins in themſelves, are more or leſs heinous according to their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, is evident by the Word of God, <hi>John</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:000965_0030_0FADE6B5584443D8"/>
15.22, 24. and the light of nature tells us that the more there is of <hi>preſumption</hi> or <hi>ingratitude</hi>; that the more obligations are broken, the more is the Guilt that is contracted thereby; and by this occaſion the ſin that is leaſt in it ſelf, may grow up into a formidable great one; and yet, when all theſe are added to encreaſe the Guilt, they will not make the ſin amount to unpardonable; it may yet be forgiven; Here I might multiply; but I ſhall only point to three or four more comprehenſive ones.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though men have fallen into all manner of ſins, and thoſe the moſt vile, yet there is forgiveneſs. Some men have been noted for one, ſome for another; but when men <hi>Sell themſelves</hi> to all wickedneſs; Sins againſt the <hi>light of nature and conſcience,</hi> this renders them exceeding great. When every one brings guilt inſupportable along with it, what muſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do? when they have <hi>added iniquity to ſin, as drunkenneſs to thirſt,</hi> this declares men to be beyond meaſure vile, and fills up their indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a fearful company of Articles; and yet ſuch a man ought not to deſpair of, but ſeek to God in hope for a pardon; how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins of the firſt magnitude are charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>? 2 Chron. 33. begin. What a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious monſter of iniquity was he grown up to be? and yet is he left as an inſtance of Gods pardoning grace, to give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how far it can extend it ſelf in ſhewing mercy.</p>

                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:000965_0031_0FADE6B612957A10"/>2. Though they have lived a long while in ſuch ſins and multiplied them; they have not only fallen into them, but made a trade of them, and purſued them to old age; it hath been the courſe they have followed from their youth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; <hi>they have accuſtomed themſelves to it</hi>; there is a vaſt difference between being overtaken with a Sin, and making it ones way and courſe; and every repeated act of a ſin, enflames the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fills up the <hi>Ephah</hi>; vea, by this means men grow more and more hardned, and ſo they grow worſe and worſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet when men have done their utmoſt on this account, God may, and ſometimes doth come and turn them to himſelf, and beſtow a compleat remiſſion upon them: and for this alſo <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> is an amazing inſtance; hence Gods offer is not only to ſuch as have <hi>played the harlot</hi> once, but many a time, and have made a trade of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. begin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though men have long withſtood the calls of the Goſpel, and ſtrivings of the Spirit with them, yet they may be forgiven. To ſin againſt <hi>Goſpel light,</hi> is far more provoking than to Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the meer light of nature; to deſpite and not regard the means of Grace, in which God ſets before men the things of their peace, and againſt the Spirit, who comes in and with thoſe means, and pleads with Sinners by Convictions, Awakenings, Terrors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a moſt ſtupendous aggravation of Sin; much more then for ſuch to live and ly in ſcandalous Sins, and follow the abominations of the Heathen; to Sin in a

Land of Uprightneſs; for men that ſit under the Goſpel, and are followed with calls, and counſels, and promiſes, and threatnings, not only to live in Unregeneracy, but to addict themſelves to, and allow themſelves in Drunkenneſs, Swearing, Whoredom, Sabbath-breaking, and all manner of debauchery and profaneſs, is a moſt unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wickedneſs; <hi>this is to do worſe than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>: and yet ſuch as theſe are not hopeleſs; God hath forgiveneſs for ſuch too.

fall? and we have that Aſteriſm on it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11 9. <hi>God had appeared to him twice</hi>; and yet God forgave him. <hi>Aarons</hi> Calf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Aſa's</hi> Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Prophet, are alſo inſtances for this; and is not here enough to prove the truth, that it is ſo? if the things mentioned are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves excluſive of a pardon, what can be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more likely to do it than they?</p>
               <p n="2">2. I proceed now to give the ground or reaſons of the Doctrine: and there are two aſſertions that will be ſerviceable for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the vertue of Chriſt's Sacrifice is ſufficient for the forgiveneſs of all ſins; and we may gather ſome intimation of what Gods purpoſe was, when we conſider what proviſion he hath made. However, here is reaſon ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to evidence that all Sin may be pardoned when we are acquainted that there is enough in the remedy for it. Here obſerve three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is no forgiveneſs without ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made to the Juſtice of God; the Law ſtands out againſt every Sinner, and condemns him to dy: and that Law was the <hi>Rule of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Juſtice</hi> between God and man, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be baulked without violence offered to that Righteouſneſs. It therefore is aſſerted, Heb. 9.22. <hi>Without blood there is no Remiſſion,</hi> for, tho' God forgives the Sinner freely, in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to the Subject, yet forgiveneſs muſt be firſt laid in for him, and that by a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

price paid for him, or elſe there were no room for ſuch an Application, as the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe ſtands between God and man in the <hi>Firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>; ſo that if there could have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> no ſatisfaction made, there could not have any forgiveneſs been conferred, but the Law muſt have unavoidably paſt into execution <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pon the guilty Creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God hath accepted of his Son to make his ſatisfaction. Jeſus Chriſt hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and his Father is well plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed with it. The Sinner himſelf was firſtly reſponſible for it, and God might have made his demands of him, and no other; but it hath pleaſed him to look to his Son for it. This was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented for in the <hi>Covenant of Suretyſhip</hi>; the Father offered it, and the Son complied with it, and there were Articles concluded about it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. God <hi>Sent his Son</hi> about it, and he came accordingly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. his buſineſs was <hi>to take away his peoples ſins,</hi> Joh. 1.29. and one thing that belonged to this, was the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Guilt by forgiveneſs: and when he was engaged in this affair, his Father witneſſed to his acceptance of him in it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in Chriſt's ſatisfaction, there is a ſufficiency to expiate the Guilt of all ſin. Such was the vertue of this <hi>One Sacrifice,</hi> which he offered up to the Juſtice of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.14. hence is he ſaid to be <hi>able to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, Heb.</hi> 7.25. It was not only enough for ſmaller treſpaſſes, but for the <hi>Chief Sins and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:000965_0035_0FADE6BC4B6488D0"/>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. and this will be very evident, if we conſider what he did for the expiation of the Guilt of our Sins; and that was, he ſuffered for them, the whole puniſhment that was by Law due to us for them; it is full<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> expreſt, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53, 4, 5, 6. he underwent the whole weight of the Wrath which we ſhould have undergone; <hi>he was made ſin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. and then let us add to conſider, that he was the Son of God, a <hi>Divine Perſon,</hi> that ſuffered all this; though it was his <hi>Humane Nature</hi> that bare it, yet the perſon that ſuſtained it was God, and therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>his blood,</hi> Acts 20.28. and this put an infinite value and vertue into his Obedience: So that there is a ſtock of pardon laid in, that cannot be exhauſted: all the ſin of all the Sinners in the World, cannot exhauſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Goſpel deſign is moſt of all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, by his forgiving of all Sin; and this is reaſon ſufficient why he not only can, but will do it. Here obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Goſpel great deſign is the illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> of God. By Gods ſpecial Grace, I intend that which is to be ſhewn in the Salvation of fallen man; there is common grace expreſt in many other things, but this is that which God hath a peculiar deſign of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the undone creature; and this is that which is diſcovered in the Goſpel; the great contrivances in Gods Eternal Decree, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Elect, had an aim at this, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. and thoſe aſtoniſhing Providences which were
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000965_0036_0FADE6BCE1091B88"/>
concerned in our fall by the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repaired again by the Second, were <hi>media</hi> ſubordinated to this purpoſe; all was to make way for the Grace of God to appear in its moſt ſplendent luſtre: So that our whole Salvation is aſcribed to this <hi>grace,</hi> Eph. 2.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the forgiveneſs of Sins is an expreſſion of rich Grace. The not doing of it without the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, is no obſtruction of the Grace of it, as ſome fondly dream, but doth the more enhance it. What is Grace, but an act of free favour beſtowed on the Subject, which he no way deſerved, nor could have laid any claim unto, had it not been ſo conferred? and ſuch is this forgiveneſs: hence ſaid to be done <hi>freely,</hi> Rom. 3.24. The pardoned Sinner deſerved to dy; all miſeries belonged to him; he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to offer to atone God to himſelf withal; Chriſt freely ſatisfied for him, and God freely applies the merit of this to him: and it muſt needs be rich Grace, for we have already obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the man is made a bleſſed one by it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the more and greater ſins it extends unto, the more illuſtrious is the Grace of it. There is ſo much of malignity in the leaſt ſin, and ſo juſt a provocation given to God by it, and the merit of death in it is ſo righteous, that it is a wonder that God ſhould forgive one Sin: how then is this admiration juſtly encreaſed, when the Sins of the Creature, have riſen to a moſt formidable multitude and magnitude? <hi>Paul</hi> puts a great Emphaſis on this, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000965_0037_0FADE6BD9320CA20"/>
                  <hi>Who was a blaſphemer, a Perſecutor, injurious,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant,</hi> &amp;c. What is the forgiving of an <hi>Hundred pence,</hi> to <hi>ten Thouſand Talents? Paul</hi> tells us that he was by this <hi>made a pattern, verſe</hi> 16. and <hi>David</hi> makes this an argument to plead for pardon withal, Pſal. 25.11. <hi>Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great</hi>; we are therefore told, that <hi>where Sin abounded, grace much more abounded, Rom.</hi> 5 20. hereby the great love of God is manifeſted, and the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable value of Chriſt's Obedience is diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Hence the exhibition and offer of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is made to the greateſt Sinners; the Goſpel invites all without exception, whatſoever they have been or done. See how God invites, and what an argument he uſeth to back this invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7, 8, 9. <hi>q. d</hi> you may think your Sins to be ſo many and great, that there is no hope for you; but remember, I have other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thoughts about it, and I can do that which you cannot ſo much as think, hence he uſeth that encouragement, Iſa. 45.22. <hi>I am God.</hi> Hoſ. 11.9 <hi>I am God and not man</hi>; yea, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth that, upon their accepting of his offer, he will not <hi>remember one of their ſins</hi> againſt them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. but <hi>pardon them all.</hi> Chap. 33.8. and the reaſon is, becauſe he doth it <hi>for his own name ſake,</hi> Iſa. 43.25. and what more heeds to be ſaid for clearing of this truth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE I.</hi> For Caution: Be we adviſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of abuſing this precious Doctrine, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000965_0038_0FADE6BE82E3F998"/>
our ſelves to live and ly in Sin. Such is the baſeneſs in the heart of ſinful men, and ſo ready is Satan to inſinuate himſelf into it, that they are exceeding apt to take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Sin, from that which ſhould be the moſt heart breaking incentive of them to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt it. Oh! ſay they, is there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs for all Sin, then there is no danger, <hi>Let us follow the ſight of our eyes, and the way of our hearts; let us ſin that grace may abound</hi>: as the Apoſtle brings them in with abhorrence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8. &amp; 6.1. How many Drunkards, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Whoremaſters, Profane Wretches harden themſelves in their wickedneſs by this? and if we tell them of their vileneſs, they have a ready anſwer, <hi>there is forgiveneſs,</hi> and they fear not; but let ſuch conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is to <hi>turn the Grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs.</hi> It is the higheſt affront that can be given to the rich mercy of God, and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can you give him more horrible provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is to make the ſtrongeſt poyſon of the moſt refreſhing cordial. It is the beſt news that ever was reported in the world, that great Sinners may have a pardon; but this is to make it the worſt and moſt pernicious to you; and indeed this miſimprovement carries the moſt fearful ſymptom of <hi>Reprobation</hi> in it, <hi>Jude</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God will forgive none but in a way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his <hi>Holineſs.</hi> Remember, that as there is a pardon to be had with God, for all ſin, ſo there is a way in which it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000965_0039_0FADE6C1490CE118"/>
and out of the way it is vain to expect it: and God will not advance one <hi>Attribute</hi> to the wrong or injury of another. Now Gods <hi>Holineſs</hi> is precious to him, and he hath a regard to that in all, and becauſe of this, <hi>he cannot abide ſin,</hi> Hab. 1.13. Pſal. 5.4, 5. he did not come to ſave his people <hi>in,</hi> but <hi>from their ſins,</hi> Mat. 1.21. whom he pardons, them he will alſo purify; that therefore is the character of one that hath a grounded <hi>hope,</hi> viz. <hi>he purifieth himſelf, as he is pure,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence, if you live and dy in your ſins, this forgiveneſs will be none of yours. God can exalt his forgiving mercy on ſuch as ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting monuments of it, though you periſh; and he will do it on ſuch as ſhall make a better improvement of it than you do: and though all ſin may be forgiven now, yet there is a time coming, when there will be no forgiveneſs; and there is no readier a way for you to bring your ſelves into that diſmal condition, than to offer ſuch an affront to the Grace of God which is now tendred you. Remember, this Grace now waits upon you; but when once time ends with you, you ſhall hear of it no more; and if you dy under the dominion of ſin, you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly dy under the guilt of it: and there is no readier way to provoke God to cut you off with a <hi>ſwift deſtruction,</hi> than thus to offer indignity to the proclamation of pardon, that he hath made unto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:000965_0040_0FADE6C2109BC908"/>
                  <hi>USE II.</hi> Let this ſerve to encourage droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls, that are under deſpondency by reaſon of the greatneſs of their ſins. When the Spirit of God comes in with his Convictions, and ſets mens ſins in order before them, to make them know their miſery, and need of pardon: Satan uſually ſets in, and a miſgiving heart entertains him, and now, he that made light of ſin before, begins to fall into the other extream, and looks upon it with thoſe conſiderations that put him upon deſpairing of ever obtaining mercy. Every ſin now looks formidably great, and all the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating circumſtances come in, and he looks upon them through the magnifying glaſs of an <hi>accuſing conſcience,</hi> and <hi>tempting Devil</hi>; and now there is no hope for him; there never was ſuch a Sinner as he; he hath committed ſuch and ſuch enormous ſins, that there are none like them; he hath multiplied tranſgreſſions beyond count; he hath ſinned againſt ſo much light, ſo many warnings, counſels, reproofs; he hath been a contemner of the means, a ſcorner of the offers of Grace; he hath ſinned againſt uncountable mercies, that ſhould have <hi>led him to repentance,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt powerful convictions of Conſcience, and many reſolutions made to the contrary; he hath broken Covenant with God, and hath lived a long while in ſin, and ſent the Spirit away griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many a time, ſo that now he hath ſinned him quite away, and he will come no more: he hath ſinned out his day of grace, <hi>and there now remains
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000965_0041_0FADE6C216FBC618"/>
nothing for him, but a fearful expectation of the fiery indignation of God</hi>; there is none that knows what a ſinner he hath been, elſe they would give him no encouragement. To any that are in ſuch a condition, let me, from this Doctrine, offer theſe things to your conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You have not out ſinned the vertue of Chriſt's Satisfaction. If you had arrived at that, you might well deſpair and dy; but as long as there is vertue enough in that for your pardon, there is hope, and you ſhould improve it; your ſins have been horribly great, but Chriſt's merits are ſtill greater. It would be a reproach to the value of Chriſt's oblation, if that could not buy off the greateſt Sinner from Condemnation. If you could run on the ſcore with revenging Juſtice, beyond his ability to make payment, how ſhould he be one <hi>able to ſave to the uttermoſt?</hi> Remember, Chriſt paid an infinite price, and that which is ſo, cannot be out done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You have not ſo ſinned, but that God can magnify his mercy in forgiving you. It will be no reproach to his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> becauſe Chriſt hath done enough to anſwer that; and it will be a wonderful manifeſtation of his <hi>Grace:</hi> God will be <hi>for ever admired</hi> in your pardon and ſalvation; the more and more aggravated ſins are forgiven you, the more will his <hi>kindneſs</hi> appear to you, and the more praiſes will be to his name for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: and your <hi>love</hi> will be the more enlarged to him, becauſe he hath <hi>forgiven you much,</hi> Luk. 7.47. and God highly prizeth the <hi>Attribute</hi> of his <hi>Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:000965_0042_0FADE6C2DEE0A1F0"/>3. You have not out-ſinned the examples of his pardoning mercy. It is an encouragement to think, that whatſoever you have to ſay againſt your ſelves, in this reſpect, you may find a paralel inſtance for it in the word of God, of ſuch who were <hi>in the ſame Condemnation,</hi> and yet are forgiven, as hath already been pointed at in the Explication. And what God hath done, he can do, for <hi>His Arm is not ſhortned</hi>; and it is to be hoped he will do, for he is as gracious now as ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You have not out-ſinned the Goſpel call. It is Gods rich forbearance that you have not, but through mercy you have not. Why then do you ſtand drooping and deſponding! be of good cheer, he calls you; he ſends to you, he makes you the offers of his Salvation; the proclamation of pardon is not out, there is room for you to come in and have it; you grieve him that you ſuſpect his willingneſs, you cannot better pleaſe him, than to adventure and caſt your ſelves upon his mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE. III.</hi> Let this then be glad tidings to great Sinners, and put you upon going to God for this forgiveneſs. Is it to be had with him? why then do you not ſeek it of him? Are there no grievous Sinners among us? yea, ought not every one that lives impenitent under the means of Grace, to account himſelf ſo? And are there none that have exceeded in notorious Crimes? and are you no whit taken with this good news? why then do you ſit ſtill, and not make out after it? Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:000965_0043_0FADE6C3A1380740"/>1. If your Sin be not forgiven you, you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. <hi>Guilt,</hi> not removed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will drag you down to the bottomleſs pit: <hi>The weight of one Sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned is enough to ſink you for ever.</hi> If God had not found out a way to pardon Sin, all the race of mankind had been in a deſperate condition. If you appear before Chriſt, in the great day, in your Sins, you will not be able to ſtand in the Judgment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The more and greater your Sins have been, the more fearful will be your Condemnation. Great Sinners have moſt of all need to fly to God for a pardon; for the puniſhment of ſuch is like to be far <hi>more Intolerable</hi> than that of others. You ſhould therefore look upon the aggravations of your Sins, to be the more Potent incentives to drive you to God, for forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you do not make haſt, it will quickly be too late. It muſt be done while God ſits on a throne of Grace, or elſe it cannot be done at all: when he hath ſat out his patience, and given out the <hi>Oath,</hi> there is then no pardon to be had. And great Sinners have the greateſt reaſon to be afraid, leſt the day ſhould be done ſpeedily: for of all Sinners, ſuch have leaſt hope to eſcape; and ſuch Sins give ſpecial provocation to an Holy God to <hi>make a ſpeedy work</hi> with them. Be then awaken<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, and perſwaded forth-with to <hi>fly to the City of Refuge.</hi>

others notwithſtanding their grievous Sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. There is in every gracious Soul an earneſt deſire after the good and welfare of others; their Children, Friends, Neighbours; which puts them upon endeavours with and for them, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they may be freed from Condemnation, and obtain forgiveneſs of God: but when they have uſed all means, and waited with much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and find all to work contrary with them, and they grow worſe under all, and are now fallen into more horrible and ſcandalous Sins, and habituated to them, and it may be to <hi>deſpiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and hate to be reproved</hi>; they are ready to give them up for gone, and abandon all farther endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for them, reputing them hopeleſs. But here is that which may prevent ſuch deſperate conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and put you upon renewing your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours again: Remember <hi>there is forgiveneſs with God</hi> even for ſuch as they are; they are not gone ſo far, but that God may ſtill turn them at laſt and have mercy upon them. Their Sins are aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, but not beyond the line of forgiveneſs; their hearts are hardned, but not beyond the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of God to ſoften them; they have provoked him to caſt them off for ever, but <hi>who knows</hi> but that he may yet come and exalt his infinite Grace in giving them a pardon? Let this hope then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive your Spirits, and, though you do it with fear and trembling, yet be the more ardent and earneſt with and for them: Counſel them affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately, warn them with greateſt Solemnity, and pray for them with all importunity: plead Gods

               <p n="1">1. That the Guilt of Sin is an exceeding heavy burden.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Forgiveneſs removes this burden from the Sinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:000965_0046_0FADE6C8B5F2FD48"/>1. That the Guilt of Sin is an exceeding heavy burden</p>
               <p>Sin, as light as the moſt of men make of it, is an oppreſſing, and intollerable load, and it is Guilt that makes it ſo; the truth of this concluſion will appear from the conſideration of three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the nature of Guilt it ſelf; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there need no more but this to clear the truth in hand.</p>
               <p>In the Demonſtration of this, I ſhall not inſiſt largely; <hi>Guilt is properly an obligation lying upon a Sinner to ſuffer puniſhment</hi>: and it falls upon him as ſoon as he hath by Sin made himſelf obnoxious. It properly ariſeth from the relation which he bears to the Law of God. All mankind origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally are the Subjects of the Law, and by the <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of it they are denominated <hi>Sinners,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.4. Now there is in the Law a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of puniſhment denounced againſt the man, in caſe of his ſinning; and by vertue of this threatning, as ſoon as the man is chargeable with Sin, he is under that Sentence by which the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment becomes due to him, and is judicially laid upon him; and it is truly and properly the Guilt under conſideration. <hi>We are to diſtinguiſh between the Sentence of the Law, and of the Judge</hi>; the former renders the man Guilty in his ſtate, the latter doth but declare him to be ſo, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly adjudge him to puniſhment; the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the Jury doth not make the man guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but finds him ſo; and if he were not ſo
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:000965_0047_0FADE6C9DEF5E358"/>
before, it is a falſe Verdict. Now this muſt needs be an heavy weight; and will appear ſo, if we conſider, that the whole puniſhment that is due to, and deſerved by ſin, is hereby laid upon the Sinner, and he is <hi>held fast</hi> to the ſuffering of it: and he that ſhall read all the Curſes of the Law, and the fearful things that are therein threatned muſt needs ſay that they are unconceivably heavy, and enough to make the ſtouteſt Sinner to ſink under them; theſe, when they ſhall come to be born, will be found unſupportable: and it muſt needs be very oppreſſive to have them charged upon the man ſo as Guilt doth; ſo a man to read over all the Curſes of the bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of God, and have his Conſcience to tell him, <hi>this is thy portion,</hi> thou art the man againſt whom this doom is out, and muſt expect every moment when it will fall upon thee, is extreamly oppreſſive: and yet this is the nature of Guilt; but this will be farther illuſtrated in the next thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the bitter groans and complaints of thoſe who have been under the apprehenſion of the guilt of Sin. How have they cried out as oppreſſed, and ſinking under their burden, when nothing elſe hath ailed them, but only God hath awakned them, and charged their ſins heavy upon their Conſciences, with the diſcovery of his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, or that Wrath which was out againſt them for their ſin? this may be exemplified in three reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:000965_0048_0FADE6CA56F31388"/>1. The reſentment that impenitent Sinners have had of this Guilt, when awakned. God hath left us ſome inſtances of it, and teſtimonies about it in his word for our admonition. How was it with <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in</hi> when his doom was paſt upon him? <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. and whence aroſe that deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluſion of his, but from the weight of his Guilt? and how was it with <hi>Judas</hi> upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>begin.</hi> out of doubt it was the intollerableneſs of the oppreſſion of his Guilt that drave him to hang himſelf; and whence are theſe fearful expoſtulations of Sinners? Iſa. 33.14 <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell,</hi> &amp;c. and in how many doth God inſtance this truth, that <hi>a Conſcience throughly wounded with Guilt, is a thing that cannot be born,</hi> but ſinks the man under it, more than if he had a mountain lying upon him, according to Prov. 18.14. <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear</hi>?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The preſſure that men have been under by reaſon of one ſin laid upon them. God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, by Conſcience, chargeth one particular ſin upon a man, and when he doth it home, it is too much for him, eſpecially when it is ſome great and horrid ſin; or if the Conſcience doth ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it; and we find not that <hi>Cain</hi> was in diſtreſs on account of any other ſin but his <hi>Murder,</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> for any thing beſides his <hi>betraying his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Maſter</hi>; and yet how <hi>Tragical</hi> was it to them? what then muſt it be to be under the load of innumerable Sins? to have the firſt great tranſgreſſion charged on them, and that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Sin which hath all abominations in it, and

a life full of uncountable and aggravated actual prevarications: certainly every one muſt add its proportionable weight.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

from the weight of it. This is the <hi>Talent of lead</hi> that will ſink them into Eternal Perdition: Needs then muſt it be beyond meaſure heavy.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>If any ſhould here demur and ſay, how can this be? who are more eaſy and jocund than Guilty Sinners? do we not dayly ſee the vileſt of men the moſt unconcerned; they look as if nothing oppreſſed them, but live careleſs and confident: and how could they do ſo, if ſuch a burden were on them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There may be a fair account given of this; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>Spiritual Death,</hi> under which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men are; and lay never ſo much weight upon one that is dead, he feels it not. <hi>Carnal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> is one thing belonging to this death, which renders men ſtupid and regardleſs: and it is a <hi>puniſhment</hi> upon Sinners, keeping them under <hi>Guilt,</hi> which if they did feel the burden of, they would ſeek after relief; and therefore it is many times judicially encreaſed, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a falſe eaſe which many have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that takes off the ſenſe of this burden. They think they have gotten it removed, and that pleaſeth them. Some are perſwaded by Satan to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ink there is no danger, God will not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them for their Sins; and ſo their Guilt troubleth them not; to ſuch God ſpeaks, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.4. <hi>Fury is not in me: q. d.</hi> You think I will not puniſh you. Some think themſelves well ſheltered under their <hi>refuges of lies,</hi> Iſa. 28.14.
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:000965_0051_0FADE6CEAF35E448"/>
Others pleaſe themſelves with ſome legal work that hath paſt upon them, thinking that they have gotten a pardon, and that quiets them: or they reſt upon their outward priviledges, Crying <hi>The Temple of the Lord,</hi> which for the preſent keeps them from reſenting their burden.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We do not know always how it is within with theſe that carry a ſhew of mirth and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The wiſe man tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Even in laughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the heart is ſorrowful.</hi> And certainly there are many that put on a bold face, and hide their troubles, who yet have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. That God will ſooner or later make every Sinner to feel this burden. The few inſtances we have of this, tell us what is their Condition; and God, will, either in this life, or a death, or after it, lay it on ſo as they ſhall feel it terrible. There is never a Sinner Converted to God, but hath had of this experience, this was it that made him fly to Chriſt, this put him into dread, made him go about under horrours, till he gat a pardon. Stand by the bed ſide of ſome dying Sinners, and you ſhall hear thoſe bitter complaints, that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth in hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the reſt is known <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o them that are gone to the place of Torments.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:000965_0052_0FADE6CFDD34F978"/>2. That forgiveneſs removes his burden from the Sinner: it takes off this heavy weight from him; this is the proper and genuine effect of pardon of Sin. This will be evident in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The wrath of God lying upon Sinners is that which is the great burden of Sin. It is true, Sin it ſelf is a vile, odious, filthy thing, and that which no gracious Soul can endure, but deſires to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of, and delivered from: but the diſtreſs that is in it, is that the Great God is offended by it, and that he is angry at the Sinner: hence the great Complaints of Gods Children themſelves, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Lying of wrath heavy upon them, Pſal.</hi> 88.7, 16.89 46.90.7, 9, 11. To have that God, whoſe <hi>Voice makes the hills to quake, and mountains to tremble</hi>: that God, whoſe fury when it burns is a fire unquenchable, to be angry at us; this is that which we cannot bear: all the rage of men and devils is nothing in compariſon with that. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Can thine heart endure? Can thine hands be ſtrong,</hi> &amp;c</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which lays this burden on the Sinner is his Guilt. But for that he would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it. God is angry at nothing but Sin, and Sinners for it: and that which brings them under this wrath is their Sin, that hath engaged his <hi>Revenging Juſtice</hi> againſt them, on account of his <hi>Law,</hi> by which he Governs the reaſonable Creature. Gods anger, as it is an <hi>Attribute</hi> in him, would hurt none of his Creatures, but if they become the butt againſt which it ſhooteth its
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000965_0053_0FADE6D08BBFD000"/>
arrows, then they have put themſelves in the way of it, and woe to them; and none but Guilty Sinners ſo do. The holy Angels have no burden by it, it never toucheth or comes near them: they that are reconciled to God in and through Chriſt, by the application of his Blood to them, cannot be hurt by it: No, it is the Sentence, which tells the Sinner, from the Mouth of an Holy, and True God, <hi>Thou muſt dy</hi>; this, this is the burden: and what is it that receives this, but a Conſcience convicted of Guilt?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence as long as this Guilt abides, he muſt needs be under that load. This is it that chains him down to it, which <hi>Concludes him under it</hi>: let him be otherwiſe circumſtanced to his hearts deſire, yet all avails not; Guilt maintains the Curſe againſt him; Guilt for all pronounceth him a man of Death; whiles he is under Guilt the Law is his enemy, it thundereth our its threatnings againſt him, and he is every moment expoſed to feel the dint of the Curſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.11. And it is certain, that if it abide it will ſooner or later work his bane: <hi>the arrow is upon the ſtring,</hi> ready to fly, and bath it ſelf in his hearts blood. <hi>Verſe</hi> 12, 13. And hence <hi>there is no Peace</hi> to be hoped for in this Condition. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. God, in pardoning the Sinner takes off this Guilt from him: This is the great benefit that comes in to him by it. And here obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That pardon bears a proper reſpect to <hi>Guilt.</hi> There are ſeveral Conſiderations under which Sin cometh, but of them all, that which a pardon is
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000965_0054_0FADE6D1163351B0"/>
concerned about and extends to, is <hi>Guilt.</hi> It doth nothing to the taking away the being of Sin, to the removing of the defilement of it; that belongs to <hi>Sanctification</hi>; but it is converſant about the <hi>Guilt.</hi> Pardon is the act of the <hi>Judge,</hi> and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the <hi>Crime,</hi> as it expoſeth the Sinner to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, and that ariſeth from his <hi>Guilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence, in it, the Sentence of the Law Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him is removed: This is the very thing it doth: The penalty of the Law was <hi>Death,</hi> and he, by being expoſed to it; was <hi>a man of Death</hi>; but a pardon brings with it a revoking of that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. God, when he pardons the Sinner, ſaith that <hi>he ſhall not Dy but Live</hi>; the Curſe of the Law ſhall not take place upon him, but he ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from it. It is excellently expreſſed. <hi>Job</hi> 33 24. <hi>Deliver him from going down to the pit.</hi> Hence that concluſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.1. <hi>There is now no more Condemnation:</hi> the Sin remains; for that which hath once been done, cannot be undone: the merit abides; it will be for ever true, That <hi>the man hath done things worthy of Death:</hi> but the Sentence it ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is revoked. How this is done, conſiſtent with the Juſtice of God, will be enquired in a following Doctrine: but ſo it is; a pardoned man is out of the reach of the Law in its Curſes: <hi>He is for ever delivered from his Judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereupon, in the account of the Law, his Sins are as if they had never been. When Guilt is tranſlated by a pardon, the Law hath no more to charge the man with, than if he had never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any Sin at all. It is true, he hath reaſon
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:000965_0055_0FADE6D1D11AF3B8"/>
                  <hi>to remember his faults,</hi> and to be humbled for them, but the Law hath diſcharged him: and this is part of the meaning of that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you; for you are not under the Law: Sin doth not reign to death</hi> in ſuch an one: the pardoned Sinner <hi>is made the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, in Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and this is the meaning of that ſtrange expreſſion, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.21. <hi>He hath ſeen no iniquity in Jacob, nor perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Iſrael</hi>; it cannot be intended of his <hi>Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> for, if there be any ſins committed by his people, as cetainly there are, he muſt needs ſo ſee and know them. Nor can it be intended o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his dealing with them in the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the New-Covenant, for ſo he both ſeeth and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at the bold tranſgreſſion of his Children, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. The thing that David did diſpleaſed the Lord</hi>; and he corrects them ſeverely on this account, as he did <hi>David.</hi> It muſt therefore aim at him as a <hi>Judge</hi>; he ſeeth nothing in them for which to condemn them, and why ſo, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Guilt is removed?</p>
               <p n="4">4. This makes way for the eaſing Conſcience of its load. It is true, as there are ſome whoſe Sins ly upon them, and they are inſenſible of it, as was before obſerved; ſo there are ſome whoſe Sins are taken off by this forgiveneſs, and yet the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the reaſon why things are Covered, is that they may be hidden out of ſight; that they may not always be in our eye and view to be looked on; and the end of our Covering a thing is either with reſpect to our ſelves or others. In regard to others, we Cover it, that they may not ſee or know it, thus, 1 Pet. 4.8. <hi>Charity ſhall cover the multitude of ſins; i. e.</hi> it keeps them to it ſelf, and doth not divulge them. <hi>Covering</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>diſcovering</hi>; thus when men bring pretences to put off things, they are ſaid to cover them: excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are called Covers. With reſpect to our ſelves we are ſaid to cover a thing, when we <hi>put it out of our ſight, in order to the putting it out of our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi>: and we are wont to do ſo by things, the ſight and memory whereof would be a grief or a vexation to us; and thus are we here to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. God covers his peoples ſins from his own ſight, that <hi>ſo he may not remember them,</hi> nor be angry at his Children by reaſon of them, ſo as to take vengeance on them upon the account thereof, the Scripture repreſents Sin as a thing
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:000965_0066_0FADE6DC50F3D800"/>
                  <hi>odious</hi> to God, a thing that he <hi>cannot endure</hi> to look upon, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. a thing that horribly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes him againſt the Sinner; and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the abominable thing that he hates,</hi> Jer. 44.4. Hence, when he is reſolved to puniſh men for it, he is ſaid, to <hi>ſet it in his ſight,</hi> Pſal. 90.8 <hi>to make ſtrict ſearch after it,</hi> Zech. 1.12. <hi>To call it to remembrance, Ezek.</hi> 21.23. When therefore he comes to pardon it, it ſets it forth by contrary expreſſions, <hi>the putting it away,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his face from beholding it,</hi> Pſal. 51.9 <hi>not ſeeing it,</hi> Numb. 23.21. <hi>The removing it far from him,</hi> Pſal. 103 12. <hi>Forgetting, or not remembring it any more,</hi> Iſa. 43.25. <hi>Caſting it into the depth of the Sea,</hi> Mic. 7.19. All of which expreſſions are of the ſame import with this of Covering them.</p>
               <p>If it be here enquired, how can God be ſaid to cover our Sin out of his ſight? It muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that it is ſpoken after the manner of men, who are wont to forget, or take no notice of that which is laid out of the way. And here let us obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That nothing can be covered to God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his <hi>Omniſcience.</hi> Heb. 4.13. There is no ſuch veil of darkneſs can be caſt over any thing that can intercept his ſight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.11, 12. Gods Infinite Omnipreſence neceſſarily infers that every thing muſt be in his eye, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to abſcond it from him, ſo as he ſhall not know it thoroughly; and equally impoſſible that he ſhould forget it; we are on this account of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten warned to be cautious, becauſe we are ever
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000965_0067_0FADE6DED5273CC8"/>
under the inſpection of his all ſeeing eye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God doth not ſo put their Sins out of his ſight, but that he puts them in mind of them, and ſometimes makes them ſmart for them; thus we have <hi>Job</hi> awfully complaining, <hi>Job</hi> 13.26. What a ſolemn memorial did he cauſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to mention to <hi>David</hi>? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7, 8. and how much and how long did he make him to ſmart on this account afterwards? yea doutleſs all the Afflictions that are brought on the Children of God in way of Correction for their Sins, are witneſſes that he hath an eye upon them, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them in a diſciplinary way; Hence,</p>
               <p n="3">3. This covering them properly reſpects <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Juſtice,</hi> or the Sentence of the Law which is out againſt them; and that is the Guilt that cleaves to them, and it is a pardon that doth it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When God pardons Sin, he removes the Guilt of it from the Sinner; the obligation that lay on him, binding him over to dy, ceaſeth: this hath been already made evident.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In removing this Guilt, God turns away his <hi>Vindictive eye</hi> from it: though the Sin remains, and the merit too, yet God will no longer look on him as a Guilty Sinner; he will not <hi>ſee iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in him</hi>; the man deſerves that he ſhould; but God is reſolved that he will overlook it, as a thing out of ſight; he hath nothing to lay to the man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> charge, nor will he hear of any <hi>Charge</hi> laid againſt him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. and this is aptly expreſt by his
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:000965_0068_0FADE6E0065191A8"/>
covering it, for <hi>if he ſhould mark, who could ſtand</hi>? Pſal. 130.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereupon the Guilt comes to be utterly loſt; it is a ſtrange expreſſion, Jer. 50 20. <hi>The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there ſhall be none, and the Sins of Judab, and they ſhall not be found</hi>; alas! if ſearch be made, there is enough to be found, that hath been ſinful and provoking; but it refers to puniſhment, which preſumeth Guilt, and ſo there ſhall be none found. When they are put on trial for their lives, and enquiry is made, What Sins are to be charged on ſuch? the anſwer is, there are none to be found, they ſtand condemned for none: and why? <hi>for they are cast into the Sea</hi>; they are all <hi>blotted out</hi> of the book of accounts; the Indictment againſt them is defaced; they are covered as a thing that is buried out of ſight, as one that is dead and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; they are <hi>blotted out as a Cloud,</hi> Iſa. 44 22. and one well obſerves, that a Cloud is it ſelf a blot in the face of the Sky, and is therefore blotted out by making it to vaniſh and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: and ſo doth God by his peoples ſins: and this is the covering of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Who is it that Covers it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is God, and he only, who can thus Cover Sin. If Covering be forgiving, then it belongs to him alone who can forgive, and that is <hi>Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, Dan.</hi> 9.9. If it be the Guilt of Sin that is covered, and ſo covered that it ſhall never riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or be charged, it muſt needs be a Divine Work. <hi>Sin is a Tranſgreſſion of Gods Law,</hi> and the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:000965_0069_0FADE6E111A1AFE8"/>
Guilt contracted by it is an Obligation to ſuffer accordingly; and who ſhall remove it but he? Men may forgive the wrong that is done to them, ſo far as they are concerned, but they cannot forgive the Violation of the Command of God that is therein perpetrated. Men may indeed Charitatively, or Miniſterially declare this forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but they cannot beſtow it. It is one of the Letters of Gods Name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Forgiving ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin.</hi> We may indeed cover the Sins of our Neighbour, by keeping them Secret, and not divulging them, but that doth not hide them from the Revenging Juſtice of God, who will for all in due time make a diſcovery of them, if they be not forgiven by him. And we may cover our own Sins, by denying them, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, excuſing, extenuating, juſtifying them: but this will but aggravate the Guilt of them, and expoſe us to the more ſevere puniſhment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13 This covering of Sin belongs to Juſtification; &amp; it is <hi>God alone that Juſtifyeth, Rom.</hi> 8.33. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God, and no other, hath that cover to throw over the Sins of his people, that can hide them from his revenging eye: Every other cover is but <hi>an hiding place of deceit.</hi> God therefore challengeth it to himſelf as his prerogative, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions.</hi> If all the power and authority in the World, Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, ſhould Subſcribe and Seal an act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion for us, it will ſignify nothing; no, though the Angels of Heaven ſhould joyn in it. <hi>God is Judge of the World,</hi> and he can either ratify or
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:000965_0070_0FADE6E1955BFCB0"/>
nullify all that is done; his act alone can make it authentick. Hence, though we are to ask forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs one of another, yet we are not to reſt in that, but if we would have our Sins buried, and not digged up again, we muſt go to him to do it for us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How, or after what manner it is Covered?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We are here to conſider God as a <hi>Righteous Judge,</hi> and therefore to do nothing but what is conſiſtent with that Righteouſneſs of his. We read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. <hi>He is both juſt, and juſtifyeth.</hi> Now it is one piece of Gods Righteouſneſs as a Judge, to puniſh the Sinner according to Law; and Guilt binds him over to puniſhment: how then doth he continue juſt, and yet cover this Guilt ſo as it ſhall not riſe againſt the Sinner to procure his puniſhment? And the reſolution of it is in Sum; <hi>That he doth it by caſting the Robe of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs over the Sinner, and ſo covering his Sin out of his ſight.</hi> And here two things offer themſelves to conſideration,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt</hi> is a <hi>Robe</hi> ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſufficient to cover our Sins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How God caſts it over us to this purpoſe?</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt</hi> is a <hi>Robe</hi> ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and ſuitable to cover our Sins. As Sin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in Scripture to our Nakedneſs and Shame, ſo is Chriſts Righteouſneſs reſembled by a Robe provided to cover it withal: and as it was Sin that firſt gave occaſion for mans needing ſomething to cover his Body, ſo it introduceth the neceſſity of Chriſt to hide the nakedneſs and filthineſs of our
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:000965_0071_0FADE6E253B040B0"/>
Souls. This is deſigned by <hi>the beſt Robe, Luk.</hi> 15.22. This is pointed at in the <hi>White Raiment, Rev.</hi> 3.18. And this is the <hi>Wedding Garment, Matth.</hi> 22.11. Now this <hi>Robe</hi> is made of the <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive</hi> Obedience of Chriſt, for the matter of it. By the former of theſe he kept the Law exactly, <hi>Fulfilling all Righteouſneſs, Matth.</hi> 3.15. He was <hi>Holy, Harmleſs, Undefiled, and without Spot.</hi> By the latter he made full ſatisfaction to the Law in all its demands, by bearing the whole penalty that was threatned in it for Sin. And the ſufficiency of this Garment to cover all the Guilt of our Sin herein appears.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Righteouſneſs it ſelf anſwered the Law in the utmoſt extent of it; ſo that it is wide enough and large enough to cover all Guilt. Chriſt bare the penalty to the full which the Law exacted; he bare the whole weight of that wrath which was due to man for Sin. His Righteouſneſs therefore is able to hide the greateſt and moſt multiplied tranſgreſſions out of ſight: the Law can ask no more than there is in that, to anſwer God as a Judge, who is fully pleaſed with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is enough in it to Cloath all that come to him for it. It is called <hi>Everlaſting Righteouſneſs, Dan.</hi> 9.24. becauſe it will hold out as far as there is occaſion for it: there may be Garments cut out of it for as many as ask for them, and to ſpare: it can never have an end: the Vertue of Chriſts ſatisfaction is Infinite, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. All are therefore invited to come for it, and a promiſe is made that
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:000965_0072_0FADE6E310E48238"/>
none that do come ſhall be rejected. It is called <hi>the Righteouſneſs of God, Phil.</hi> 3.9. becauſe the perſon whoſe it was, or who performed it, was God, and ſo put a Divine Vertue into it, making it infinitely extenſive.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Righteouſneſs was provided on purpoſe for this end; it was prepared to cover the Guilt of Sin. As the Active Obedience of Chriſt was to purchaſe for us the inheritance, ſo his Paſſive was to ſatisfy Revenging Juſtice on our account, by Vertue whereof our Guilt comes to be hidden out of it's ſight, by the caſting of this over it. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt neither Lived for himſelf, nor Dyed for himſelf.</hi> The Son of God needed no Active Obedience to Juſtify him, being a Perſon above Law; nor did Chriſt need a Paſſive Obedience to ſatisfy for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as man, being perfectly righteous: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Gave himſelf for us, Gal.</hi> 2.20. And this was according to Divine compact, ſo that it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, and it was laid in for this; and thus it becomes applicable to us, and ſo is every way ſufficient.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence he is out of the danger of <hi>Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Rom</hi> 8.1, 34. Condemnation is properly a Sentence paſt by the Judge, upon a perſon Convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Guilty, dooming him to ſuffer penalty according to the mind of the Law: So that where there is no Guilt, there can be no Condemnation; and where there is no Tranſgreſſion chargable, there can be no Guilt found.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence flows great Peace of Conſcience. It is the foundation on which our deliverance from the terrours of an accuſing Conſcience is built: when that tells us we have thus and ſo Sinned, &amp; thereby provoked God, it is hereby pacified, when it can look on all this Sin as covered. Now the <hi>Spirit of Bondage,</hi> which is rooted in every unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Sinner, is remedied, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. The Soul hath the ground of inward Tranquillity notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all; and hereupon he can, with the more humbling ſenſe, mourn for his Sin, whiles he can mourn as one that hath a good hope, and is not ſunk in deſpondency.</p>

He hath great liberty of acceſs with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Throne of Grace; there is ſuch a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which Gods Children enjoy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. and this is that which principally contributes to it.

When we know that our ſin is covered, we need not be terrified with the thoughts of the <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God.</p>

God ſaith of all their ſins, as in Jer. 29.23. <hi>I know, and am a witneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence when they are judged, they muſt needs be condemned; this follows upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Gods Holineſs and Relative Juſtice. God ſtands engaged to paſs Sentence upon every one as they ſtand related to his Holy Law: if he ſees Sin in men, and upon trial they are found Guilty, they are <hi>condemned already,</hi> and the <hi>Judge of all the earth will do that which is right</hi>; it is therefore impoſſible that they, in ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould eſcape his righteous Judgement, for we read, Rom. 2.6. <hi>He will render to every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deeds.</hi>

Hence the whole weight of Gods Wrath will certainly fall upon them at laſt; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape it; if he paſs the Sentence on them, he will puniſh them, for that is paſt in order to Execution. Our Saviour tells us what ſhall be the iſſue of the Sentence of the Great Day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>ult.</hi> and who knows the forlorn condition of that man, who muſt thus <hi>fall into the hands of the living God? it had been good for that man if he had never been born.</hi> Eternal Separation from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Gods favour, with an endleſs ſuffering the Torments of Hell, are his portion from the hand of God; and how dreadful a thing is this?</p>

Whatever other difference the Goſpel priviledges have made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſome and others, which are great, and are not to be deſpiſed, but prized; yet herein all are alike. There is never a Child of <hi>Adam</hi> can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf from Sin; and Guilt is an inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble concomitant of Sin, according to the Law un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which you are; that hath ſaid, <hi>Ezek</hi> 18.4. <hi>The Soul that Sins, that Soul ſhall dy</hi>; and there is no man, whiles under the Law, that can exemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence except your ſins are covered, you are undone; if Sin riſe up and appear againſt you, when you come to your trial, it will procure that Condemnation which will ruine you for ever, read the Sentence, and that will be enough to convince you of this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Depart ye Curſed, &amp;c.</hi> and is not he an undone man on whom this muſt paſs? for as ſure as you are Creatures, ſo certainly will it be executed, if once it proceed from the mouth of the Judge againſt you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We obſerved, that the word in our <hi>Text</hi> is often uſed for <hi>reckoning,</hi> or <hi>charging to ones account,</hi> or <hi>making a man a debtor for a thing.</hi> Man is by ſin become a Debtor to the Juſtice of God, and that expects ſatisfaction of him, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly chargeth it to his ſcore, that it may call him to an account about it: hence in the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſin; there are theſe things to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Sin is reckoned to the perſon. Here lies the foundation of it, and hence it is called <hi>the Imputation of Sin,</hi> becauſe all that follows, flows from it; and hence it is to be obſerved, that this <hi>Imputation</hi> being a <hi>Forenſical</hi> act, if the Sin may any way be faſtned on the man as his, ſo that he ſtands related to it as his own, whether he himſelf hath actually committed it or no, yet it is juſtly imputed to him: <hi>David</hi> did not with his own hand ſlay <hi>Uriah,</hi> but yet the Sin is made his, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.9. ſo, if a man owes nothing on a Debt firſtly contracted by him, yet if he owes it by <hi>Suretiſhip,</hi> it is legally imputed to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence the Guilt of it is charged upon him; and indeed, theſe two are inſeparable in the Law; for looking upon the man as under it, it is impoſſible that he ſhould be charged with Sin, but he muſt be reputed Guilty by it: that hath connected the prohibition and the threatning inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably; it hath ſaid, <hi>He that Sins ſhall dy</hi>; and it cannot go back from it. Now the Charge of Guilt is nothing elſe but the aſſuring of the man,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:000965_0083_0FADE6EFD9993518"/>
that he is by Sin become a Subject of Death; ſo ſaith the Law, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18 4. and a righteous God looks upon ſuch a man, and reckons him bound over to dy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereupon the Law rigorouſly demands its ſatisfaction of him; the Law is ratified by the Law-giver, and he will give it its claim, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that it ſhall not ſuffer loſs in a <hi>tittle, Mat.</hi> 5.28. It ſaith, I find this man to be under the charge of ſin, and ſo to be Guilty, and I demand Juſtice upon him: and its mouth cannot be ſtopt till it hath its demands anſwered: it is reſolved it will have its penniworths out of the perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath done with him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hereby he is obnoxious to ſuffer all the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of the Law, in purſuit of this charge; thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Imputation makes him a priſoner of Juſtice, and liable to the execution of the threatning: hence ſaid to be <hi>in danger, Mat.</hi> 5.22. the word ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>one that is held in, and kept faſt, as one that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned</hi>: this execution being the deſign of, and that in which the Imputation is to determine. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation claps an arreſt upon the man, which will be proſecuted, till Juſtice hath obtained all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In what reſpect all mankind by nature are under this Imputation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That all are ſo, is every where aſſerted in Scripture; and is evident, becauſe the penalties properly belonging to ſin are fallen upon them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. If all are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, then ſin is imputable to all, and if they are
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:000965_0084_0FADE6F0B7ED3708"/>
dead by it, it hath ſurely been imputed. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that Sin which hath killed a whole world, is imputed to them, how elſe had they died by it? it includes old and young, perſons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and Infants, whoſoever deſcends from <hi>Adam</hi> by natural generation, and hath a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul. Now there is a threefold reſpect in which ſin comes to be imputable to mankind, and that righteouſly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When it is actually and perſonally commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the man. I name this firſt, becauſe it is moſt plain and accountable. Sin is properly a <hi>Moral Tranſgreſſion,</hi> and ſuppoſeth a Law againſt which the tranſgreſſion is: and to actual ſin it is requiſite that it be done by a reaſonable creature, capable of acting as a cauſe by counſel: this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not imputable to Infants, for, though they have a reaſonable Soul in them, yet it is not in a preſent capacity of exerciſing that reaſon; which want ſeems not to be a fruit of ſin, but a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature, and had not man fallen, it would in all likelihood have been ſo; it is therefore ſaid of thoſe that dy in their Infancy, <hi>That they have not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams Tranſgreſſion, Rom.</hi> 5.14. Though how ſoon they diſcover their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural corruption is lamentably to be obſerved; however this extends to all men without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that arrive to any uſe of their reaſon; how actual ſin will be charged on meer naturals, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not graſp, though the want of the uſe of reaſon be a puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; yet this utterly obſtructs the rational acting of ſuch an one, for
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:000965_0085_0FADE6F35053B3E8"/>
that he <hi>cannot diſcern between good and evil.</hi> But there is none that ever had the uſe of reaſon, but hath abuſed it by ſinning againſt God, and that both by ſins of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion</hi>: he hath thought, ſpoken, done otherwiſe than the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; we have a natural man characterized, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And none are exempted from it, we are told, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.3. <hi>They go aſtray as ſoon as they are born, ſpeaking lies; i. e.</hi> they are ſet that way, and it breaks out as ſoon as they are capable, though in ſome more notoriouſly than in others. Now there is no difficulty in telling how actual ſin ſhould be imputable to the perſon committing it; for, if all owe Obedience to the Law, their neglect of, or doing any thing contrary to it, cannot but render them Guilty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the nature is corrupted by the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of Original Sin. That there is ſuch a thing as the ſin of nature is evident from the word of God; it is called <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> or <hi>Luſt, Jam.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Indwelling Sin</hi>; Rom 7.17 <hi>Sin that is alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi> Verſe 21 <hi>The Fleſh,</hi> Joh. 3.6. <hi>The body of ſin.</hi> Rom. 6.6. <hi>Of Death,</hi> 7.24. <hi>The Law in the members,</hi> v.23. <hi>The body of the Sins of the fleſh,</hi> Col 2.11. <hi>The Old man,</hi> Eph. 4.23. Now all theſe point to the root or fountain from which actual Sin proceeds, and therefore muſt intend ſomething divers from it; hence we read of <hi>Luſt Conceived,</hi> and Sin the iſſue of it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15. Now this Sin is in all Adams Poſterity, born after the ordinary courſe of nature; even Infants, and Naturals too: it is therefore u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually called <hi>Our Birth Sin,</hi> and <hi>Our Conception Sin,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:000965_0086_0FADE6F4757BD948"/>
according to, <hi>Pſal</hi> 51.5. And it derives from the corrupt fountain from whence we all proceed. <hi>Adam</hi> defiled himſelf, loſt the Image of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the Image of Sin, and then he <hi>Propagated it, Gen.</hi> 5.2. And how ſhould it be otherwiſe? for <hi>Who can bring a clean thing cut of an unclean? Job</hi> 14.4. And though this be in one ſence a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fallen upon us for the firſt Tranſgreſſion, yet in it ſelf it is really Sin; it is a Sinful ſtate that we are in by it; the Definition of ſin belongs to it, it is <hi>Anomy,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. Mans nature by it doth not anſwer the Law of Creation And that it is imputed is evident, becauſe it is an <hi>Image</hi> for which God <hi>deſpiſeth man, Pſal.</hi> 73.20. It is that which they <hi>Dy</hi> for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137 <hi>ult.</hi> It is certainly in them, and therefore may be charged on them, and the Righteouſneſs of their being found Guilty by reaſon of it, will one day be made good by him who is Judge of all: mean while the foundation of the equity of it is laid in that which follows: Hence,</p>
               <p n="3">3. In reſpect of the Relation which they bear to Adams firſt Tranſgreſſion That our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents became Guilty by their eating the forbidden fruit, is beyond diſpute: God had a Sovereign Authority to Command, and they owed him entire Obedience: the Sin it ſelf was great, being a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and ſo the whole Law was tranſgreſſed by it: and that they dyed juſtly none can rationally doubt. But we are given to underſtand that they drew their whole Poſterity into the ſame Condemnation with
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:000965_0087_0FADE6F566283810"/>
themſelves, and this is clear from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 17, 18, 19. Hence, though they were not actually in being, yet that Sin is imputed to them as theirs, and here upon they ſuffer penally for it: their being born in Sin, and unto miſery is a proper reſultan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from it. <hi>Verſe</hi> 12. The equity of which <hi>Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is, in that God tranſacted with <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt as a <hi>Publick Perſon,</hi> in whom he would have all to ſtand or fall: he therefore repreſented his whole Progeny, as a <hi>King</hi> doth his people, as a <hi>Father</hi> his Family: So that all Humanity being contracted in our firſt Parents, humane nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Guilty in and with them, as it was naturally derivable from them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>What is the state of thoſe that are under this Imputation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In one word, it is a ſtate of <hi>Condemnation.</hi> We read, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believes not, is Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already:</hi> By which we are given to underſtand how it is with all men by nature: all the World ſtand Condemned before God, and there is not one clear of it, till by Faith in Chriſt they come to receive a diſcharge. Now they come under this <hi>Condemnation,</hi> by the <hi>Imputation</hi> of Sin to them: for Condemnation hath a reſpect to puniſhment, and that always preſumes a fault that hath meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it: and hence, in a fair proceſs, the fault is firſt charged and proved, and there-upon the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſſeth. Now this muſt needs be a miſerable ſtate, if we Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if God impute Sin to any, he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them for it; the Righteouſneſs of God as a
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:000965_0088_0FADE6F5D4188418"/>
Lawgiver and Judge calls for this. <hi>God cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Iniquity</hi> in any, without deteſtation of it, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. And the <hi>Sanction</hi> of the Law, by which he teſtifyeth this deteſtation of his, is that which he hath bound himſelf unto. As therefore God will charge none but Guilty Sinners, and ſuch as he will convince of Sin and Guilt, ſo he will doom them accordingly, for in this his <hi>Relative Juſtice</hi> manifeſts it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That if God do thus condemn, he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Execution according to it. He will be as good as his Word, and the Condemned Sinner ſhall find it ſo to his coſt. God ſaith as he meaneth, and will therefore do as he faith. When God had paſt a fearful doom upon <hi>Saul</hi> for his diſobedience, we find what a Seal he clapt upon that Sentence, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29. <hi>The ſtrength of Iſrael will not ly or repent.</hi> True, there is room at preſent, under the Goſpel, to have the Sentence reverſed by a free pardon; but if this be neglected, and the perſon comes thus to the bar of Juſtice at laſt, he muſt feel the Execution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The puniſhment of Sin is tremendous. <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Heb.</hi> 10.31. In this puniſhment God will make it known how hateful a thing to him Sin is, and he will do it by the fearfulneſs of it: hence theſe penalties are ſet forth in the word of God after a formidable manner. God intends in it <hi>to ſhew his wrath, and make his power known, Rom.</hi> 9.22. Theſe penalties are expreſſed as intolerable, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.14.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="90" facs="unknown:000965_0089_0FADE6F6AE412FC0"/>4. <hi>How this Imputation comes to be taken off from Sinful men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In Sum, it is done by the Tranſlation of it from the account of the Sinner, to the account of Chriſt. There is no other way in which it can be done conſiſtent with the Juſtice of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>: and in this way it may be, and is done for all that are pardoned. Of this we may take this ſhort account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whereſoever Sin is Imputed, the Law requires ſatisfaction of the perſon to whom it is Imputed. This is evident by the nature of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, according as hath been explained: for where God reckons Sin to a man, he gives the Law Credit againſt him for it, and makes him a Debtor to the Law; now the <hi>Law</hi> being a <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> is rigorous, and exacts all its debts: it will not ſtop its mouth, till compleatly ſatisfyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 5.18. So that it holds the man faſt by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Imputation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in Chriſts Sufferings there was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to make this ſatisfaction. This was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily prerequiſite, elſe it could not have anſwered the demand of the Law for us. For, though it be not therefore our Satisfaction, becauſe there was ſuch a ſufficiency in it, Gods acceptance of it being free; yet if it could not have anſwered the Law in all its demands, it could not have been capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Gods acceptance on this account: there was therefore enough in it to do this. Chriſt Suffered the whole Eſſence of the penalties that were due to us for ſin; he bore the whole weight of the Wrath of God; <hi>He was made Sin,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:000965_0090_0FADE6F75461F8C8"/>
And <hi>A Curſe, Gal.</hi> 3.13. And the Excellency of his perſon, being Divine, put that Value upon his Sufferings, that rendered them equivalent to the Sufferings of all his people: it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the blood of God</hi> that was ſhed, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is conſiſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> with Gods Juſtice, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this Satisfaction on the Sinners account. True, the caſe is Criminal; the Sinner himſelf deſerves to dy, and if God had ſaid he ſhall dy, and no other for him, it had been very juſt: but yet it is no wrong either to his <hi>Holineſs</hi> or <hi>Juſtice</hi> to ſay, I will accept of the Sufferings of Chriſt for the Sinner. If there were nothing more to be ſaid for this than that God hath actually ſo done, this ought to be enough to ſtop our mouths, for <hi>the Judge of the World can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is right.</hi> But it is acknowledged among men, that a Prince may, if he will, although he may chuſe whether he will take another for the offender by exchange, if he freely offers himſelf: however, God is not bound to the Laws which men are.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That God did, by an act of Sovereignty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt for this end. This is evident in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> in which we are told that there was ſuch a thing: and all our hopes for Salvation by that <hi>Covenant,</hi> are built on this foundation; for we are Saved by Chriſt, we are therefore acquainted with a <hi>Covenant of Redemption,</hi> on which the <hi>New Covenant of Grace</hi> is founded; in which God the Father indented with his Son on this account, and made him a promiſe in
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:000965_0091_0FADE6F812806F58"/>
reſpect to it, that upon his Satisfaction the Vertue of it ſhould derive to them for whom it was, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. And Chriſt dyed for this end, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Yea he was <hi>made under the Law,</hi> that ſo it might exact this of him, in order to our being <hi>Redeemed</hi> from it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. And hence all the penalties he underwent are ſaid to be on the account of <hi>Our Sins, Iſa.</hi> 53.4. And this acceptance was an act of Divine Sovereignty; God acted as a Lord in it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Chriſt in theſe Sufferings bare thoſe relations to his Elect, which rendred them ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory for them; he did all in their ſtead, and that it might be effectual, he took ſuch Relation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that rendred it ſo in the account of Gods Juſtice. Now there were two relations that he bare, which comprize in them all that can be required in this regard.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of a <hi>Surety</hi>; this is expreſſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22 Now a <hi>Surety</hi> is one that is bound with or for anothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> fails: and when it refers to caſes criminal, he becomes liable to ſuffer for the principal offender, and upon his ſo ſuffering, the Law is ſatisfied, and he for whom he ſuffered is releaſed; for no Law requires double ſatisfaction in the ſame caſe: and therefore if the Law take its ſatisfaction on the Surety, it exempts the offender himſelf; but there is yet more, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of a Common perſon or repreſentative, which will yet be a clearer diſcovery of the fulneſs of the ſatisfaction. We therefore have a parallel
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:000965_0092_0FADE6FA93B92608"/>
made between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. And <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to be a <hi>figure of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 5.14. Now <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood as a publick perſon, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting his Seed; and ſo doth Chriſt repreſent his: hence as <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion was influential to the undoing of his Seed, ſo Chriſt's ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is no leſs to the making or repairing of his. <hi>verſe</hi> 18.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence this pardon of ſin removes our Guilt to Chriſt's account, and his Righteouſneſs to ours: this is fully expreſt, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He was made ſin for us, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God through him; i. e.</hi> Our ſin was charged on him, and his Satisfaction went for it, and his Righteouſneſs was reckoned to us, and ſo became ours: and this is done by <hi>Imputation.</hi> Nor can it be in any other way; it muſt be ours either <hi>Relatively,</hi> or <hi>Inherently</hi>; Inherently it cannot be, neither can Chriſt be the real Sinner, nor can his Sufferings, which in perſon ſuffered, be ſuffered perſonally by us; but by this tranſaction it beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſo by <hi>Imputation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. This is done upon our believing in Chriſt; they that talk of an Eternal Juſtification, forget to diſtinguiſh between a <hi>purpoſe,</hi> a <hi>purchaſe,</hi> and the <hi>application</hi> of it to us, which are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.

All the Sin, the Guilt whereof derives to any of the Children of men, ſtands out againſt them, till a pardon removes it, by taking away the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: his whole account abides on record, and is not croſſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Your danger by this is very great. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer the Juſtice of God for one of theſe Sins, and what an innumerable Company of them is there? So that you go in continual hazard of being laid up by Juſtice, and proſecuted for them, and then what a woful condition are you in? Our Saviour therefore adviſeth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48, 49.</p>

This takes away the ground of terrours, becauſe <hi>it blots out the Hand writing that was againſt you.</hi> If, when the Books are opened, there is nothing there to be ſeen, but it hath the lines of Chriſt's Blood croſſing it, or his Satisfaction and Payment char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

               <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt hath enough in his Satisfaction to anſwer for them, and ſo to remove the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to his ſcore: there is nothing wanting in his Righteouſneſs to anſwer all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He offers it to you to be made yours. This is the deſign of the Goſpel treaty, to propoſe Chriſt to Sinners; and that is one thing in it, to be their <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 1.30 And what is this for, but that he may diſcharge the Debt or Imputation for them?</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you would have it, you muſt go to Chriſt, and believe in him for it. It comes in by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and Chriſt is the author of that faith, it muſt be fetched from him; none but Believers can ſhare in this Imputation of his Obedience.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This manner of expreſſion is uſed in the Scriptures more than once, as a <hi>Periphraſis</hi> of a Godly man: So, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.47 <hi>Rev.</hi> 14 5. The word [<hi>Guile</hi>] ſignifies <hi>Fraud</hi> or <hi>Deceit</hi>; but is uſed equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally, Sometimes in a good, ſometimes in a bad ſenſe. There is an honeſt <hi>Craft,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.16. and there is a diſhoneſt one, which is pointed at in our <hi>Text</hi>: and there are many things in which this Guile is practiſed; there is <hi>Guile</hi> in mens words, ſuch is <hi>Flattery, Pſal</hi> 12.2, 3 and <hi>Lying</hi> to deceive, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.12. And there is Guile in mens carriages, when they pretend <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> and yet <hi>lye in wait, Pſal.</hi> 55.21. And there is Guile in a <hi>Profeſſion of Religion,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. But the root of all this lies at the heart, the falſeneſs whereof puts men upon theſe Guileful practiſes: Hence <hi>Guile</hi> is in the word of God uſed for <hi>Hypocriſy</hi>; and to be <hi>without Guile</hi> for <hi>Sincerity:</hi> And when this is referred to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Soul, it intends that there is an inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of it in the man which influenceth into his

Life and Converſation; and this points us to that <hi>Sanctification</hi> that is wrought in the man at <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> But for a more particular opening of this, obſerve theſe things</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in the beſt of Gods Children here, there is a <hi>Body of Death</hi> remaining.

And what elſe is intended by this, but the relicks or rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ins of the Sinful Corruption, which the nature of man is defiled with by the <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi>? It is that Sinfulneſs in our nature, which hath in it a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy to the Law of God, and cannot yield ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. And therefore is always <hi>Warning againſt the Law in the Mind, Chap.</hi> 7.23. And for any meer man, in this Life, to exempt himſelf from it, is counted a daring piece of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20 9. Hence that Hypotheſis, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If we ſay we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves</hi>: And that poſitive Concluſion, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.20. <hi>There is not a juſt man upon earth, that doeth good, and ſinneth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That in this Body of Death, there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Sinful <hi>Guile.</hi> It is therefore called a <hi>Body,</hi> becauſe there is every branch or member of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Concupiſcence in it: for, though the whole of it be mortifyed in Sanctification, yet there is no member of it is wholly deſtroyed, but remains, though not in its reigning power; and there is no luſt but a Child of God ſhall find the ſtirring of it in him, if he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That this Guile doth too often wofully break forth in the Lives of Gods people. And this is a ſufficient evidence that it is there, for if they had none, they would never diſcover any: but how often doth it appear to others? And though it many times acts cloſely and indiſcernibly to the world, yet they themſelves might obſerve it, if they would be acquainted at home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Do not good men ſometimes act deceitfully in their treating with others?

And how much of Hypocriſy is a ſenſible Believer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with in himſelf, attending on his beſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? How many wry glances, and ſiniſter aims in his prayers, and hearing, and whole Converſation? Whence elſe is it that he is ſo often at a loſs what to judge of himſelf as to any thing he doth?</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the work of <hi>Converſion</hi> there is a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture put into the man. The man that is here ſaid to be <hi>without Guile,</hi> is to be ſuppoſed a true Convert, for there is nothing elſe but Guile in an Unconverted man; he is wholly acted by a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Heart</hi> which perverts him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44 20. But when God comes to Convert a Sinner to himſelf, he then makes a powerful and thorough Change in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. This is that which is called
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:000965_0103_0FADE62D9C931FE0"/>
the <hi>New Man,</hi> in oppoſition to natural Corruption, which is called the <hi>Old man, Eph.</hi> 4.22, 24. This is called the <hi>New Heart,</hi> which God hath ſaid he will give to men in this work, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36 26.

And therefore every Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, ſo far as he is renewed, ſo far is he alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without Guile. As Guile is a quality ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to every Luſt, ſo integrity is no leſs to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Grace of the Spirit, that is in the Children of God: their <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>Unfeigned,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. And their <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>without Diſſimulation, Rom.</hi> 12.9. And ſuch are all the Graces which flow from theſe two, which are the root Graces in a Child of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The New Nature ſets it ſelf againſt the Guile of the Law in the members, in a Child of God. It

doth not only exert none it ſelf, nor conſent to that which the Corrupt part is acting, but it diſſents from, and withſtands it. There is the <hi>Luſting of the Spirit</hi> mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. And there are two things wherein it diſcovers this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Reluctancy of it againſt the Corrupt part in us, ſeeking to ſuppreſs and prevent it. So far as Grace is active in the heart of a Child of God, when it meets with a <hi>Temptation</hi> to Guile or Hypocriſy, it Reſiſts it, bears its Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; influenceth the Conſcience according to its preſent activity, ſo as to endeavour to Arm it againſt that part in him, which is eager and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent for it: and this <hi>Paul</hi> deſigns in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. When he ſpeaks of <hi>the Good he would do,</hi> and <hi>the Evil he would not do.</hi> And doubtleſs, many a time, by the help of the Spirit of God, he gets the Victory, overcomes the Temptation, and rejects the Motion with abhorrence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Repentance which it brings the man to afterwards. Sometimes the Law of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is too ſubtile and ſtrong, and <hi>leads the man Captive,</hi> and he is drawn into <hi>Diſſimulation,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his worſer part impoſeth upon him, and he plays the Fool; but as his Grace had no hand in it, but was meerly overborn; ſo it recruits again, and what it could not prevent by withſtanding, it clears it ſelf of, by Repentance. The Godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, bitter mourning, ſelf-abhorrence and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication he applies to it, witneſſeth for him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. And this belongs to that <hi>Spiritual warfare,</hi> with which the Goſpel acquaints us.</p>

               <p n="8">8. Hence ſuch an one is, in a Goſpel eſteem, one in whom is no Guile. Who,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hath been Regenerated by the Spirit of God, and ſo hath a principle of ſaving Grace in him. A <hi>Godly</hi> man, and one without <hi>Guile</hi> ſound the ſame thing in Scripture language: he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo called, <hi>Context, verſe</hi> 6. for by vertue of ſuch a ſaving change, the man comes to have a <hi>Right Spirit</hi> in him, as it called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10.</p>

And this is the natural inclination of the new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in us: for it was put into us to enable us to Glorify God, and hath therefore in it a tendency to the end it was Created for, and accordingly prompts us hereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence he abhors every thing in him that draws to the contrary. He finds enough and too much in himſelf which is moleſting of him, and ſometimes wofully too hard for him; but he is grieved at it, carries it about as his burden, and cries out by reaſon of it; yea he is vile in his own eyes on this account, as he, <hi>Job</hi> 41.5. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it his miſery, that he is ſo unhappily chained to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hereupon he lives in the practice of the mortification of this deceitfulneſs. As he doth not allow it, ſo he cannot be quiet for it, but ſeeks to have it deſtroyed. We are commanded to <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the luſts in us,</hi> Col. 3.5. and he makes it his buſineſs to do ſo, he fights againſt it, he brings it to the Croſs of Chriſt to be crucified, he <hi>prays</hi> hard againſt it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.29. he <hi>hates</hi> it, <hi>v.</hi> 128.

Give me leave then to clear up this matter, and ſhew the miſtake of ſuch an opinion in the following Concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> are two diſtinct benefits flowing to us from Chriſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever vain men have confounded them, yet the Scripture ſpeaks of them as divers priviledges one from the other, ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Chriſt indeed is <hi>made</hi> both <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> to us, but they are two things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and applied to us after a different manner. We are Juſtified <hi>relatively</hi>; we are Sanctified <hi>really</hi>; we are Juſtified by <hi>Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> we are Sanctified by <hi>Infuſion</hi>; Juſtification is a <hi>Garment</hi> thrown over us, Sanctification is by a <hi>new principle</hi> put into us; Juſtification is a <hi>Change in our ſtate,</hi> Sanctification is a <hi>Change in our nature</hi>; in the one we are made <hi>legally</hi> innocent, in the other we are made <hi>inherently</hi> holy; hence the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e is ſaid to be an <hi>Act,</hi> and the other is called a <hi>Work</hi>

by our <hi>Divines:</hi> becauſe the one paſſeth upon us <hi>Declaratively</hi>; whereas the other operates in us <hi>Effectually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That both of theſe derive to us from the ſame fountain of free grace. Mans whole Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth ſo, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. and both of theſe do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to it; that Juſtification is a fruit of meer Grace, we are plainly aſſured, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. And hence pardon is to be ſought of God, or <hi>for his own name ſake, Psal.</hi> 25.11. And our Sanctification hath the ſame original too, for it is a product of his meer good pleaſure, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Grace</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which is the ſame thing, is given of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. God ows neither of them to us, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We have nothing but Sin, and Guilt, and pollution cleaving to us in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, when God comes to pardon and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us; quickning is beſtowed on them that were the <hi>Children of wrath, Eph.</hi> 2.1, 3. How then ſhould our Sanctification, or being without Guile, poſſibly contribute any thing to our Juſtification or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they are both of them applied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in or upon our <hi>Effectual Vocation.</hi> They are contemporaries: for though <hi>Divines</hi> do allow them an order in the handling of them, and an order of nature, and accordingly give the priority to Juſtification; yet there is no diſtance of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one and the other, by their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; and they are reckoned as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits joyntly flowing from our Effectual Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;

If it bate but a <hi>jot or tittle,</hi> it is ſo far a loſer, and for that reaſon our Saviour aſſures us that it ſhall not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the moſt eminent ſincerity of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, doth not amount to ſuch a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. And if this be ſo, here is reaſon enough to deny it to be the meritorious or material cauſe of pardon and Juſtification; for, if it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it could not merit for us a pardon, becauſe we owe it: but if it be imperfect, it cannot be reputed a Righteouſneſs at all, with reſpect to the Law-Covenant. It is certain, that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which that required was ſuch as is without the leaſt flaw or defect, and we ſee how ſtraitly man was obliged, if he hoped to Eſcape the Curſe of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.

in a firm belief and comfortable expectation of it; and if the proof of the two former muſt be by our Sanctification, the clearing up of this muſt be ſo too, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 14. <hi>Holineſs without which no man ſhall ſee God.</hi> As therefore the beſt way to make it appear to the charitable perſwaſion of others, that we are in a good and ſafe ſtate, is by an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Converſation, and without Guile; ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle argues, 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 1 4, 5. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. So it is a neceſſary <hi>Medium</hi> by which we may know our ſelves to be ſo, to be able to find in our ſelves ſuch things as evidence that we are really ſuch as we ſeem to be. The Evidence then of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned State from our being without Guile, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the inſeparable connexion there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two: and hence it amounts to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible <hi>Demonſtration.</hi> So that if the premiſes be true, the concluſion muſt needs follow. Now the Connexion in the firſt Propoſition is the ſtrongeſt that can be; form it which way we will, and it abides true, and reciprocally ſo. Now the ground of the certainty of this Connexion will be made clear in the following Concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All thoſe, and none but thoſe that are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted are forgiven. Converſion is the firſt ſaving gift that God beſtows on any of the Children of men; this is the primary deſign of the Goſpel Diſpenſations, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. When God comes to purſue his Eternal Purpoſe to any one, he then Converts him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. In which Converſion he gives men <hi>Faith and Repentance, and then a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; Acts</hi> 5.31. It is in Converſion that a <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

principle</hi> is put into men, and before that they are <hi>Dead, Eph.</hi> 2.1. Dead legally, and dead ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually: but as ſoon as that comes in, they are now <hi>Alive to God</hi>; unto which life this pardon doth appertain; and as this priviledge is entailed on Converſion, ſo it is reſtrained to it, and no impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s partake in it, they are in a ſtate of Condemnation, <hi>Mat</hi> 18.3. <hi>Job.</hi> 3.36.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this Converſion, in and with which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs is applied, there is wrought an univerſal Change in the man. When God Converts a Sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner, by turning him from his ſin to himſelf, he doth it not by force or violent conſtraint, but cauſeth him to be ſpontaneous in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. Now the will of the natural man, is in it ſelf vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently and unperſwadably ſet againſt this turning to God, being a lump of <hi>Enmity, Rom.</hi> 8.7. That then it may be drawn to conſent, it muſt have a <hi>New principle</hi> put into it; and becauſe the <hi>Will</hi> is a power in a cauſe by counſel, it requires that the <hi>Understanding</hi> be alſo rectified, which is filled with crooked principles, <hi>Call good evil, &amp;c.</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do other ſo long as it remains in its carnality, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44 20. The New Convert is therefore ſaid to be a <hi>New Creature</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all in him to be <hi>New,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. And what is it wherein this change conſiſts, whereby he is new made, but thoſe ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying graces that are infuſed into him, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d through the whole man? <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. Such a diſcovery then muſt needs witneſs to the man that he is pardoned, becauſe it witneſſeth the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:000965_0116_0FADE63B089EAE28"/>
that is an inſeparable companion or forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God, deſigning his own Glory in forgiving the Sinner, doth it in ſuch a way, as may be in all reſpects anſwerable. Gods laſt end in all his works is his own Glory; that there are deſigns of love and good will to the Creature in many of theſe works, is beyond queſtion; but theſe are ſubordinated, and ever refer to that as their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aim, and are accordingly ſo regulated as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it in the accompliſhment of them: So that though God intends the Sinners Salvation when he Juſtifieth him, and therefore together with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, he entituleth him to the Kingdom; yet there are ſeveral <hi>Attributes</hi> that are concerned in this affair, every of which muſt have its luſtre herein: and as his rich grace and mercy are in this exalted gloriouſly; and as his <hi>Juſtice</hi> muſt be ſecured from wrong, yea and triumph in it; ſo there is his <hi>Holineſs</hi> here to be diſplayed, for God will be <hi>Holy in all his doings, Pſal.</hi> 145.17. Now the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God hath a ſpecial concern here, in the manifeſtation of the hatred he bears to ſin, notwithſtanding the love he bears to the perſon whom he pardons; and if God ſhould forgive the Sinner, and yet not take away his Guile, or purge him from his ſin, and overturn the Dominion of it, he would ſeem not only to love the perſon, but approve of his iniquity, contrary to, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. On this account, wicked men, who for the preſent eſcape puniſhment think ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. And therefore to vindicate his holineſs, wherever
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:000965_0117_0FADE63B182EAC80"/>
he <hi>pardons</hi> ſin, he <hi>ſubdues</hi> it: they go together, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.19.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Pardon of Sin is a New-Covenant Bleſſing, in which there is a perfect Reconciliation made between God and the perſon forgiven. God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſpeaks of a <hi>Covenant</hi> that he will make with his people, and we are told what are the benefits of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>The ſure mercies of David; i. e.</hi> all the good that Chriſt hath purchaſed for them, whereof this is one, and is expreſly mentioned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. Now ſin had made a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us; and when God forgives and Juſtifies the Sinner, he thereby ſignifieth that he is atoned; and the Reconciliation is mutual, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. And there is no proſpect of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, either on Gods part, or the Sinners, ſo long as ſin remaineth in its power, and he is not Sanctified; this is the <hi>abominable thing that he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,</hi> Jer. 44.4. It is that which made the <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Iſa.</hi> 59 2. How then ſhould he hold amity with one that hath nothing elſe in him? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4, 5. It is ſin that hath filled the <hi>Carnal mind</hi> with <hi>enmity, Rom.</hi> 8.7. Till then he is Sanctified, and his Guile ſubdued, he cannot poſſibly be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God, and ſo the New-Covenant cannot be plighted, without which he is not forgiven.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Jeſus Chriſt Redeemed us for his Service. Forgiveneſs of ſin is a fruit of Chriſt's purchaſe; he <hi>Bought it for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. And in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a pardon, the Redemption of Chriſt is applied to us; and where any one part of it is applied, the whole is ſo; for Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

loſe any part of the deſign of this great work; and we are aſſured that he <hi>Sought</hi> in it a people <hi>to Serve him,</hi> which is promiſed to him as a fruit of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.38. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told that it was for this, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. And his people are ſaid to be <hi>Redeemed from their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities, Pſal.</hi> 130.8. And <hi>from their vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. And the ſtrongeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to oblige us to Holineſs is fetcht from this conſideration, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now as long as <hi>Sin reigns</hi> in the man <hi>he is the Servant of Sin,</hi> during which he cannot Serve the Lord Chriſt: he muſt then be made free from it in order to his attaining this end, <hi>Rom</hi> 6. compare <hi>verſe</hi> 20. <hi>with</hi> 22 It is ſincere Service, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Guile that he expects, and by which he is honoured: and becauſe Chriſt will have Service from every pardoned one, he with his pardon, puts into him a new principle, which makes him <hi>upright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Pardon or Juſtification is in order to Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. They are Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So long as the Law Sentence of Death was out againſt them, they were incapable in that ſtate of being Glorified: when God taketh off the Sentence, it is always in order to the making them happy for ever: and therefore it muſt needs be followed with the <hi>Making them meet</hi> for that Glorious ſtate, which cannot be enjoyed by any of the Children of men, ſo long as they have a Spirit full of Guile. The natural man cannot be entertained in the ſpotleſs Kingdom; nor can he reſent the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

That then God may accompliſh this deſign of his, he Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth them together with Juſtifying of them. Chriſt had an eye to this, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. From all theſe Conſiderations, we ſee how evidential this being without Guile, is of our being pardoned; and how neceſſary it is for us to be able to argue this from that, if we would not be miſtaken in our hopes and aſſurances.</p>

And it is to be feared, that beſides thoſe that walk open faced, there are a great many of cloſe covered <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> whoſe own hearts would condemn them, if they would hear them ſpeak, how plauſibly ſo ever they carry it in appearance.

                  <hi>IT is a diſmal diſtreſs to have a Conſcience bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with the lively ſenſe of the Guilt of Sin.</hi> It is indeed, of all burdens the moſt heavy and oppreſſing, none comparable to it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14.

                  <hi>A.</hi> We may take a ſhort account of this in three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Diſtreſs is properly a ſinking or over bearing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity on the mind.</hi> There is indeed a diſtreſs that meer <hi>Animals</hi> may be in, ariſing from an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made in their ſenſitive Spirits: but we are ſpeaking of man, who is a rational being, and acts according to the principles of reaſon.

<pb n="132" facs="unknown:000965_0131_0FADE64AD6A56CA0"/>
reaſon of perplexity that is in it. For, let a man meet with what he may, yet ſo long as the mind is quiet, he is not diſtreſt; and it muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that over bears, or is too hard for him, for whiles he can ſtand ſteadily under it, and ſinks not nor is ſtaggered by it; it doth not amount to a diſtreſs: Hence this condition is ſet forth by ſuch expreſſions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31 9, 10.38.8, 10.142 3. When a man is in trouble, and his Spirits give in and fail him, then he is diſtreſſed.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>That this diſtreſs is greater or leſs from the conſiderations of the evil that gives being to it.</hi> And this hath a reſpect either to the evil it ſelf, or the apprehenſion that the man hath of it in his mind.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of the evil it ſelf.</hi> And here are three things.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:000965_0132_0FADE64BB08518C8"/>1. <hi>The Nature of the Evil.</hi> Though all are evil, and ſo have a tendency to become diſtreſſing, yet there are two ſorts of them, ſome are bodily, ſome are ſpiritual; &amp; although men that are immerged in ſenſe, are apt to be more ſurprized &amp; perplexed with the former; yet the latter are in themſelves moſt terrible, and when aright conceived of, moſt diſtreſſing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. And in this reſpect <hi>Sin</hi> is, in its own nature of all the moſt diſtreſſing, becauſe it is the worſt and moſt pernicious: and ſo <hi>Spiritual Plagues</hi> are the moſt terrible of all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The degree of it.</hi> There are different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in thoſe Evils that men are liable to, ſome are lighter, others are heavier. Some are ſo eaſy to be born, that though there be ſome inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in them, yet the Spirit is not over born by them, and ſo they are not diſtreſſing; others are heavier, and harder to bear, and out bid the man: God therefore ſo expreſſeth the Judgment that he was about to bring on them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The proſpect the man hath of the iſsue of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> The only inward ſupport which a man in diſtreſs hath, is in his <hi>Hope.</hi> If he hath a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of an end of his trouble, it gives him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to feed upon, that is of the nature of a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial</hi>; and though it ſhould be long firſt, yet it helps to bear more patiently: but when he feels the weight, and ſees no end of it, it then makes it inſupportable. <hi>Deſpair</hi> under trouble is the height of diſtreſs; it is a <hi>deadly diſcouragement,</hi> when it cometh to ſay as they, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.11. <hi>Our hope is leſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:000965_0133_0FADE64C52A99A68"/>2. <hi>In reſpect of the apprehenſion the man hath of the Evil on his mind.</hi> Every thing is to the mind of man, as he reſents it. If the man be ignorant of the Evil, he is not troubled about it; if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not the evil in the thing, he maketh a light matter of it, and that is the reaſon why <hi>Fools make a mock of ſin, Prov.</hi> 14.9. Which they would never do, if they knew the world of miſchief there is in it. On the other hand, when men do over value the evil in the thing, it makes lighter troubles the more diſtreſſing; which is the reaſon why worldly croſſes more perplex men, then Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Plagues, and the loſs of a creature comfort more oppreſſeth them than the loſs of a Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It now follows to ſhew the truth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or evidence that a Conſcience thus bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, is a diſmal diſtreſs. For which let theſe three Conſiderations be laid together.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Conſideration of the ſtrength of the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Guilt is a priſon that holds the man faſt: the bars of it are too ſtrong for the whole Creation to be able to break: the powerful hand of <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency,</hi> keeps them in, and the watchful eye of <hi>Omniſciency</hi> guards them, ſo that there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of making an eſcape: the Sentence declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Guilty is poſitive, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17.

Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords are much blurred in natural men, however, meer <hi>Heathen</hi> have enough to convince, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to condemn them: they are ſaid to be <hi>A Law to themſelves, Rom.</hi> 2.14. Conſcience not only tells them this is a Sin, and that a Duty, but alſo that there is ſuch a recompence due to ſin in Juſtice, it teſtifyeth both to the Law, and the equity of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> 2 1. And when Conſcience hath been enlightned by the Word, it is yet more fitted to diſcharge this Office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſcience is a <hi>Regiſter.</hi> It is a Book of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in which all matters of fact are fairly written and reſerved. Man may for the preſent have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten a great many things, but they are faithfully entred in the rolls of Conſcience, and he ſhall there read them ſooner or later: they are there graven indelebly, <hi>As with a Pen of Iron, and point of a diamond, in the Rock</hi>: and not one ſin that he was ever Guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="137" facs="unknown:000965_0136_0FADE650CE9AA1D8"/>
And this it is in all the Circumſtances; and as good as ten thouſand, being privy to all, ſtanding by, looking on, and writing down the moſt <hi>Secret Sins, Rom</hi> 2.15. And it will not, dares not withold its Teſtimony, when God commands it to declare: if he lay the matter before it, it will not be ſilent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.9. Nor will the man dare to deny, when Conſcience ſtares him in the face and terrifyeth him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſcience is an <hi>Accuſer.</hi> This is one office it bears under God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. And though, for the preſent, men bribe and baffle their Conſciences, and make them to hold their peace, yet they will certainly betray them; and when there is neither Man, Angel, nor Devil appears, to lay any thing to their charge, this will haunt them with its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, and give them no reſt. Yea, how often doth it blab all, and force a confeſſion from them before men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſcience is a <hi>Judge.</hi> It hath and keeps a Court in the man, in which it arreigns, tries, and condemns him; and when God gives it a <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Oyer and Terminer,</hi> it will do it to purpoſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3 20. It calls the man to its bar, lays open his caſe, indicts him, maketh him to hold up his hand, convinceth him effectually, and then paſſeth the Sentence of the Law formally upon him, and ſo he ſtands Condemned. We have this inſtanced in <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. In <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21, 22. In <hi>Judas, Math.</hi> 27. <hi>begin.</hi>

It begins to feed upon him here in this world, it fills him with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and many times precipitates him into miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. Now all this proceſs of Conſcience in the Sinner, is built upon the Guilt that lyeth on him, and ſo tells us how much there is in it to diſtreſs the man, becauſe it provides this work for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but for which it would be his Friend, and ſpeak peace to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>From the impreſſion which this lively ſence maketh upon the Conſcience.</hi> The matter of this diſtreſs lies in the Guilt it ſelf; and the Conſcience is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject fit to afflict the man with it; but the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it ariſeth from this ſenſe: ſo that though the man were quiet before, though his condition were the ſame, yet now he cannot be ſo. It is impoſſible but the man ſhould be horribly diſtreſt.</p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It fills him with aſtoniſhing</hi> Fear; <hi>and that is a perplexing thing.</hi> Fear, when it only awakens man to duty, and makes him cautiouſly ſeek to ſecure himſelf from danger, is good and profitable: but when it over-bears, and puts the man beyond the uſe of means, it is terrible, and yet ſuch a fear is a natural iſſue of this ſenſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It puts him into</hi> Horrour <hi>of Conſcience.</hi> It fills him with amazing Agonies in his mind.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>They have a Conſcience in them, though they ſtiffle it.</hi> A natural Conſcience is inſeparable from a Reaſonable Creature; and though it be aſleep for

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The work of <hi>Conviction</hi> is the firſt work of the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. Now the Conſcience is the Subject of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:000965_0140_0FADE653162622B0"/>
and the matter of it is the Guilt ariſing from ſin, or Sin and Guilt which are inſeparable, according to the tenour of the Firſt Covenant; and though the way of the Spirit of God with Infants be to us a ſecret, yet in grown perſons, who are Converted by the Word and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, God leaves this Conviction upon them, in order to his drawing of them to Chriſt, and they are diſtreſſed by it; the next Invitation therefore is to ſuch as are <hi>weary and heavy laden, Mat.</hi> 11.28. The Spirit of God acts arbitrarily in meaſuring the degrees of this, and uſually when men have been moſt notorious for ſin, the diſtreſs is the greateſt; but there are ſuch impreſſions of it on all who are thus drawn, ſo as to bring them into a <hi>loſt ſtate,</hi> and make them apprehenſively pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing: and by this means God embitters Sin to them, ſo that he may hereby make his grace the more welcome and acceptable to them; that being oppreſſed, they may cry out for help.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE III. Let this help to bring ſecure Sinners into Diſtreſs.</hi> And Sinner! Beware of flying from it. How afraid are men of trouble of mind? how do they ſhun it? And how fearful are many of bringing them into it? how many prepoſterous courſes are uſed to comfort them againſt it? Well, you that live in ſin, and are quiet, that ſleep and care not to be awakened; let me tell you, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for you, is that he would bring you into this diſtreſs. Oh that you would think and conſider of the Guilt that is
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:000965_0141_0FADE653E00E19B8"/>
lying upon you; that you did but feel the Curſe that is upon you for ſin, and had the Sentence of Death and Damnation upon you. And be not angry at me for ſuch wiſhes and requeſts as theſe are; for Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>You are certainly under all this Guilt, whether you will believe it or no.</hi> You brought it with you into the World, and if Chriſt hath not removed it by his Grace, it abides on you; yea, and you have encreaſed it by every ſin you have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſince you were born: the leaſt vain thought hath laid in more for your Condemnation; and if you are Guilty, you may well think what is like to become of you, if you ſo abide; that is one of Gods <hi>Attributes,</hi> as well as thoſe that vain men feed their preſumption with, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. <hi>That will by no means clear the Guilty.</hi>

but now it may be a ſtep to it. Next to the Joy over a Sinner that is Converted to God, is that of a Sinner in anguiſh of Soul, crying out, <hi>How ſhall I be Saved</hi>? And of all the ſights in the World, there is none more dreadful, than to ſee a Sinner manacled with the Chains of Guilt, and unconcerned as if nothing ailed him.</p>

Are there any that can on experience ſeal the Truth of the Doctrine, and ſay, I am the perſon that you ſpeak of, I find all to be true that you tell me; nay, there is none that can tell the load, the burden that my afflicted Soul is ſinking under, and is there ever a word of relief to be ſpoken, that may under-prop me? To ſuch let me ſay.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi> As he, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10.2.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect to his Perſon and State.</hi> The natural ſtate of every Child of <hi>Adam,</hi> is a ſtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, as he ſtands Guilty of the Imputation of the <hi>Firſt Tranſgreſſion,</hi> and as he is Born under the power of In dwelling Original Sin, by vertue whereof his <hi>State</hi> is a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Guilt.</hi> Now this ſtate is removed in Juſtification, in which there are two things done for the perſon, <hi>viz</hi> He is ſet free from Guilt, and Condemnation, and adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Eternal Life; called <hi>a paſſing from death to life,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14.

the perſon over to ſuffer the vengeance of the Law, ſo there is none can befal a juſtified Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 1. The perſon is, by the juſtifying act put beyond this danger: God hath ſaid, <hi>Deliver him from going to the pit, I have found a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom</hi>; he hath imputed Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to him, and it ſtands for him, and cannot ceaſe ſo to do. But yet there is ſomething that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal a Juſtified perſon, that the Scripture puts ſuch a name upon. <hi>David</hi> was ſuch an one before he murdered <hi>Uriah,</hi> and yet prays to be cleared from <hi>Guilt, Pſal.</hi> 51.14. What this is, we muſt further enquire, only in general obſerve, that it cannot reſpect the mans ſtate, but his actions, and the conſequents thereon in the Providence of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That actual ſins are not actually forgiven the man before they are committed.</hi> Every Juſtified Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is under the moral Law as a Rule, though not as a Covenant; and ſo every neglect of, or doing any thing againſt the Law, is truly Sin, and ſtands in need of forgiveneſs: and for this reaſon they are enjoyned to pray every day for it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. This ſaith they want it, elſe there would be no occaſion to pray for it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all the ſins we commit after believing, muſt go to Chriſt's ſcore, elſe the Law would fall foul on us. This forgiveneſs muſt be taken out after the ſin is committed; for if it were actually applied before, we need not go for it every day.

Now the Juſtifying act, as it reſpects the perſon is at once, and in an inſtant: at what time God imputeth the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt to a Sinner, and reckons it to him for his, by this Imputation, he is in the Law account, a perfectly righteous perſon, whence it is abſtractively declared of him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. And in this reſpect he is as Righteous in Gods account, the firſt hour of his believing, as he ſhall be in the Day of Judgment. But the actual forgiveneſs of his particular ſins, is an effect or reſultancy fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing from this Juſtification; and it comes in after the ſins are committed, and upon his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and renewal of his Faith in Chriſt; and that muſt needs be ſuccedaneous: for it is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, not in reſpect of God, in whoſe Eternity there is no ſucceſſion, but of the Creature, in which there is a ſucceſſion of acts, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receives mercy from God ſuccedaneouſly. Forgiveneſs is ſaid to be of <hi>Sins that are paſt, Rom.</hi>

               <p n="7">7. <hi>That a ſin may be forgiven in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not in the Court of Conſcience.</hi> Divines do rightly and neceſſarily diſtinguiſh between theſe two Courts. Every man is to be cited to anſwer for himſelf at both of theſe <hi>Tribunals</hi>; and an act may paſs in one of theſe, when it hath not paſt in the other. Conſcience indeed is Gods Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but yet many a man, through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart, and falſe opinion of himſelf, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a wrong judgment on himſelf, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brings in a Verdict of acquittance, when he is indeed condemned before God: And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, God ſometimes paſſeth the act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don on the Sinner, as he ever doth on his believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt, and yet doth not immediately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it in the Conſcience; and ſo he may ſtand condemned within for the preſent, though he be really forgiven; <hi>i. e.</hi> in his own apprehenſion: For it is certain, that a man may, in a ſenſe, be ſaid not to have that which he doth not know that he hath; <hi>i. e.</hi> He hath not the comfort of it, it is to him as if he had it not: and ſo it may be with a pardoned one. The King may have Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Sealed a pardon for a Malefactor, and ſo he is really a pardoned man, yet he is going to Execution, and concludes that he muſt dy till it be produced and read to him. There may be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect act of Faith by caſting one ſelf on Chriſt, and yet the reflex act in a great meaſure be ſtopped, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10.</p>

A particular <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> is applied upon a particular <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Believing</hi>; and ſome ſay, Can a man exert a particular act of faith and repentance and not know it? and if he doth know it, he muſt know that he is forgiven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the cloſe connexion between theſe two: but it may readily be anſwered, that the man may exert a gracious act, and yet be at a loſs whether it be gracious or no; he may doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his heart were right were right in it, and ſo be afraid whether God hath accepted it; yea, be ready to draw a concluſion againſt himſelf in this reſpect; and the ſin it ſelf mean while ſtares him in the face, and terrifieth him; and indeed, if the Spirit do not afford his concurring Teſtimony, and ſet his ſeal to the truth of this, the man will not know what to make of himſelf, knowing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs and hypocriſy of his own heart: and whiles it is ſo, needs muſt the terrours of the Lord make him afraid: the Sin cannot but be very heavy and oppreſſing on his Conſcience.</p>

All the Sins of Gods Children are in a ſenſe, ſins of <hi>Infirmity,</hi> becauſe there is a party in them that conſents not, but yet there are ſome that have more of boldneſs in them, and do more nearly ſtrike the Conſcience, which are <hi>preſumptuous ſins,</hi> which he prays hard againſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.13. When prevailing Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence hurries them to do things againſt the light of Conſcience, either to ſhut their eyes, againſt it, or to be born down by the force of a luſt, to commit it, though Conſcience ſaith it ought not to be, this is a <hi>Conſcience wasting ſin</hi>: and though it looks unlike the <hi>Spot of Gods Children,</hi> yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when left to themſelves, they are thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled. <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery and Murder were ſuch, and ſuch was <hi>Solomons</hi> Building Idolatrous Houſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That God doth not ordinarily ſuffer his own to ly long under the inſenſibleneſs of ſuch ſins.</hi> How long he may, is not for us to tell, yet he is wont in due time to awaken their Conſciences, and give them the feeling of them. He ſends ſome Meſſenger or other to rouſe them; ſome <hi>Prophet,</hi> as he did to <hi>David.</hi> Either he meets them in an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and cauſeth ſome word to faſten on them, or in a <hi>Providence,</hi> as <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren; and thus God doth in faithfulneſs, becauſe whiles

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Such a ſin, of its own nature, darkens the mans evidence to his good eſtate, or ſtate of pardon.</hi> One main evidence, we obſerved, is our being without Guile; it is by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Conſcience tells him, thou haſt deſpiſed me, and put the fear of God from before thee? and how ſhall he now diſcover that in him, that may witneſs him to be a pardoned man?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>God now righteouſly withdraws the light of his Countenance from him.</hi> He witholds his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; he doth not ſpeak peace in the man as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times formerly; but is at leaſt ſilent, and lets him alone to the bitter remorces and reflections of his own Conſcience. <hi>David</hi> was ſenſible of this, and that drew thoſe petitions from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.11, 12.

But yet this is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per act of Juſtifying Faith, as Juſtifying, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that reſults from it afterwards. It doth not properly belong to Effectual Vocation, but is one of the benefits flowing from it, and appertains to the inchoate Glorification of Gods Children in this life. Our comfort indeed flows from this, and hath its meaſure according to the ſtrength of our hope on this account; and therefore no gracious ſoul can have reſt without it. But yet
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:000965_0155_0FADE663A85DD8D8"/>
there is a Faith going before it, and is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on which it is built: and that is the true <hi>Juſtifying Faith,</hi> which is accompanied with Gods forgiveneſs. I muſt firſt know that I have that Faith, before I can know that I am forgiven. The confounding then of theſe two muſt greatly damnify us in an hour of deſertion. What ſhall a Child of God do, when ſome ſin hath woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, Guilt ſtares him in the face, and his confidence is turned into doubts and fears! how forcibly muſt it ſink him into the mire, now to think, if faith were ſuch a confidence, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any, for if I had, it would not be loſt. Whereas the only ſupport of a Soul at ſuch a time, is to feel that there are the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things and goings out of the heart after Chriſt, and if that be not the acting of Faith, he hath none.</p>

If he cannot deſtroy you he will do you all the damage he can, and his great buſineſs is to make breaches between you and your God; and that by driving you into ſomething that is provoking, and when he hath ſo done, and God is angry, to accuſe you to your own Conſciences, and lay on load till he breaks your backs if poſſible; firſt to make you bold to ſin, and then make you to deſpair by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, and this calls you to be <hi>Watchful,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.</p>

God for it, wonder at the riches of his Grace in it, and ſtudy how to expreſs a Suitable holy thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for it: but do not grow ſecure, bold, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs on the account.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Beware of allowing your ſelves in any ſin.</hi> Think not of any that it is <hi>a Little One</hi>; count it not enough to ſtand off from groſs ſcandalous Sins; nor make a little matter of ſins of <hi>Omiſſion,</hi> the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this or the duty of worſhip to God, or of your relations: this heedleſsneſs hath a double danger, it will hazard Gods with-drawing from you, and expoſe you to grow bold with ſuch as are greater. And truly the more ſcandalous ſins of Gods Children uſually begin with ſuch. <hi>David</hi> gave way to a wandring heart and eye on the houſe top, and that laid the Scene for all the <hi>Tragedy</hi> that followed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Take beed of lying in a ſin, when overtaken.</hi> There are none of Gods Children but do too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fall into Sin for their humbling, but a juſt man ſhould riſe preſently; it is only for the Worlds <hi>Swine to wallow in the mire. David</hi> doubtleſs added to the bitterneſs of his trouble, in that he lay ſecure ſo long, as one aſleep. Be every day making ſearch for ſin in your ſelves, and be very inquiſitive, and as faſt as you find any, drag it to the <hi>Croſs of Christ,</hi> drive one more nail into it to faſten it there: is there a breach made by it between God and you, make it up preſently; and this is the way to prevent

theſe bitter things, which elſe are to be expected afterwards.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>To this End maintain a</hi> tender Conſcience. Let the world flout at it as much as they will, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not. Be not hard to reſent a Sin; if it may be, let it touch you in the Temptation; but be not ſo Senſeleſs as not to feel it when it hath made a Wound in your Conſcience. Keep up an heart that is afraid of any thing that looks like a Sin, and be Jealous of your ſelves, leſt you be impoſed on, and Suſpicious leſt you have ſo been?

               <p n="3">3. <hi>By flat and peremptory denials.</hi> If men know themſelves ſuſpected, and preſume it cannot be proved againſt them, they have a ly at hand to cover it withal; hoping by their impudence to gain credit: and if they may be believed, all is well.

folly in all their ſubterfuges; but thus men quiet their Conſciences, if God ſees not nor regards, why then ſhould they be troubled? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.4.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>They keep ſilence to God: i. e.</hi> They do not come before him, and make an ingenious confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſin, but rather fly from him, abſcond, and when their Conſciences ſmite them, they <hi>hide from him,</hi> as our Firſt Parents did: and either through impenitence or unbelief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they either har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themſelves in their ſin, or elſe diſcourage themſelves by entertaining thoughts of deſpair.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Whence this cometh to paſs?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In ſumme, it proceeds from the natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is in fallen man, and remains in the beſt while here: and it hath theſe things in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Carnal Concupiſcence takes pleaſure in ſin.</hi> Sin is Con-natural to the corrupt part that is in us; all the principles and powers of it are engaged that way: the <hi>Depraved Judgment</hi> approves of it, the <hi>perverſe will</hi> makes choiſe of it, the <hi>perverted affections</hi> are ſet upon it; wicked men are in their Element when they are ſinning, <hi>Job</hi> 15.16. And ſo much of fleſh as remains in Gods Children, ſo much of this inclination there is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A natural Conſcience checks men for ſin.</hi> It is its Office, according to its light, to call on men to do their duty, and reflect on and reprove them when they fail in it, and there is more or leſs of this activity in all that are not ſeared, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. And here Conſcience doth two things, it tells them
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:000965_0163_0FADE66EF88A3670"/>
that they have done amiſs, and puts them in fear by threatning them for that they have ſo done.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence there is a natural ſhame in men, that puts them upon hiding their ſin.</hi> This ſhame is a proper reſult from the act of Conſcience, telling them they have done things which ought not to have been done, and ſo have acted unbecomingly. It is natural for men to be aſhamed of what they think to be unworthy of them, and to carry mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reproach in it; ſo our firſt Parents, <hi>Gen</hi> 3.7, 9 And the operation of ſhame is to put men upon abſconding. Impudence therefore is an high degree of wickedneſs, and therefore greatly aggravateth the ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.15.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>A natural pride makes men loth to take ſhame to themſelves, by a free confeſſion.</hi> Pride is one of the leading luſts in Original Sin, and ſuch is the influence of it, that though men know they have done amiſs, and are inwardly aſhamed, yet they cannot tell how to ſtoop and abaſe themſelves low becauſe of it: ſo that all the cunning tricks, evaſions, hidings which men uſe, are nothing elſe but the breaking out of pride in them, making them count it a diſgrace to fall under Convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13 15.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>And carnal preſumption encourageth them in ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ping ſilence.</hi> And it hath its various actings in the man: he preſumes of ſecrecy, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes of mercy; he promiſeth himſelf to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape well enough; he thinks if he can but keep his own counſel there is no danger: and this
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:000965_0164_0FADE6700727B5F8"/>
vain deluſion prompts him to ſuch courſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he grows ſecure and careleſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That in thus doing, men do but lay in for the more awful diſtreſs of Conſcience afterwards.</hi> The truth of this will be made manifeſt by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That all ſins, and peculiarly more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore he cannot but abhor it whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he ſees it; it is the very thing for which he loaths wicked men; he hates them not as his Creatures, but the filthineſs they have contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Sin, procureth his anger againſt them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.17. And as for his own Children, though he hath loved their perſons in Chriſt, and is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to them in the New-Covenant, yet he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves not their Sins, but taketh them ill, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> And although he pitieth their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which unavoidably attend their beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to Serve him, yet if at any time they fall into more greſly defiling Sins, he will be angry at them. If <hi>Hezekiah</hi> grows proud and ingrateful after a ſignal deliverance, there will be <hi>Wrath</hi> come out for it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25. And there is ſomething peculiarly aggravating in ſuch Sins, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.9</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That God ſeeth, obſerveth, and keepeth a record of all the ſins that men thus commit.</hi> When it is ſaid that <hi>God cannot behold iniquity,</hi> it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his approbation; but yet, as the Sin

He looketh into the darkeſt corners, and taketh notice of what men do in the moſt ſecret <hi>Chambers of Imagery,</hi> and puts all on the file.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That all theſe ſins are alſo written down in the records of Conſcience.</hi> We obſerved this to be one of its Offices, to be a Book of Records, in which there is an exact regiſter of all the man ever did; where, though the man hath loſt many things, and hath no reſentment of them, they are in a readineſs to be produced on any occaſion: and whenſoever God ſhall lay open theſe records be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the man, he ſhall have a perfect remembrance of them. Now the Conſcience doth this, not by reaſon of any fidelity in it, for in Sinners it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and would willingly loſe all thoſe records if it could, but God hath put this nature into it, that it cannot do otherwiſe: we may therefore be ſure that there is ſome deſign in it, elſe it would be ſuperfluous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:000965_0166_0FADE67117EE7318"/>4. <hi>God will ſooner or later bear witneſs to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure that he taketh at Sin.</hi> If God be angry, he will make the Creature know it; if we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him by Sin, we muſt expect to hear of him in a way that will not be grateful to us. <hi>Anger</hi> in God is not a paſſion, as it is in us, for ſuch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not belong to him by reaſon of the Infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his nature; but it is the acting and manifeſtation of his will, in which he ſhews his diſpleaſure at ſin; and is therefore to be ſeen in the effects of it: the moving cauſe of it is ſin, but the anger it ſelf is to be read in the Efficiency of God; and that is the Teſtimony he beareth, in which he makes men to know that he will not bear ſin at their hands, but they ſhall ſmart for it: ſo that though he may keep ſilence a while, and men grow ſecure upon it, and preſume on impunity, yet he will not ſo let it paſs, but find an opportunity to let men ſee that Sin is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing but provoking to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21, 22. For this God himſelf keeps a book of records, and maketh Conſcience to keep the accounts, that in due ſeaſon he may reckon with men, and animad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vert upon them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>If God intend the man good, he will bring him to Repentance of ſuch ſins.</hi> There is but one way to forgiveneſs, and Repentance belongs to it, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. And this not only concerns ſuch as are not Juſtified in order to the Juſtification of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but the Children of God in order to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſuch ſins as they fall into after Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: for though God will forgive them, yet he
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:000965_0167_0FADE671D1BC2170"/>
will not do it in any other way but this; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Glory of God is concerned in his apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pardon to them in this way; it is in this Repentance that he makes their ſin <hi>bitter</hi> to them, and ſo they are made to ſee the rich mercy that appears to them in their forgiveneſs. In this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> they are made to juſtifie God in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgments, and ſo to aſcribe their pardon to his rich Grace. In this <hi>Repentance</hi> they are made to loath themſelves and their ſins, and are ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from them, and <hi>turned from ſin to God,</hi> and ſo fitted to live to his glory: all which tends to his honour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>In order to this Repentance, God will awaken Conſcience, and make it to charge the ſin home upon the man.</hi> For God deals with him as a reaſonable Creature: Now the very reaſon of Repentance is a diſcovery that we make of our great folly in what we have done, and the miſchief ariſing from it, which maketh us aſhamed of it, ſorry for it, loath our ſelves by reaſon of it, confeſs and bewail it to God, ask his pardon, and draw up a purpoſe to relinquiſh it, and never again to have any thing to do with it: there muſt therefore be ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery made to us, and in us, in order hereunto; for we naturally approve of ſin, and call good evil, which approbation is that which draws us to the commiſſion of it, which we muſt be made to ſee the folly of: and for this Conſcience is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, both to put us in mind of the ſins, to charge them upon us, to ſhew us the Law, and our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by it, and all the aggravations attending our

                  </gap> me offer theſe few things to your ſolemn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>All this doth not remove the Guilt contracted by ſuch ſins.</hi> There is a certain Guilt cleaves to every Sin, as it is a tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, and expoſeth us to ſuffer the evil threatned, which it highly concerns every one to get remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the man is in a woful caſe ſo long as that abideth on him, and all endeavours that will not help to take it off are unprofitable. Well, this courſe you take is not the way to remove it, but will encreaſe it, it is but to <hi>add ſin to ſin,</hi> and a new Guilt to an old one: This hiding is of it ſelf a Sin, and the means uſed for it, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sins. How deeply then do you run on the ſcore in this way? whiles you hide your ſins, you will never fly to the Blood of Chriſt to have them waſhed away, and ſo long the imputation remains, and they are your Sins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When you have done all you cannot hide them from God.</hi> What though you keep them from the ſight and knowledge of men? They believe your denials, or are ſatisfyed with your excuſes, and hereby you prevent cenſures or reproach for the preſent? How poor a thing is this? Man is not to be your Judge, but God, who knows all; your ſecrecy is to him as the Sun light; midnight and noon day are alike to his all knowledge; when no eye ſeeth, he looketh on, and maketh an entry: your denyals ſignify nothing to him, who knows and cannot be miſtaken; your fig-leaf excuſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:000965_0170_0FADE67413D729A0"/>
cover your nakedneſs, but he ſeeth through all: to what purpoſe then will this be, when he ſhall tell you, <hi>I know and am a witneſs</hi>? Believe the truth of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.8. <hi>Thou haſt ſet our ſecret Sins in the light of thy Countenance.</hi>
               </p>

And if they be ſinful, they muſt needs diſpleaſe him; but there is ſomething pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in this: there is a root of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it, for, what difference between ſaying there is no God, and thinking he may be impoſed upon, and we can hide our ſelves from his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and judgment? Hence that challenge, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24 <hi>Can any hide,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Hence as long as you thus ly, your Sin is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</hi> Not only doth not this remove the Guilt, but is an evidence that it is not taken away. If you were Unregenerate before, this proves that you are ſo ſtill; till ſuch Sins are repented of, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And if you are Regenerate, yet the ſin is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given before committed, nor then neither but in the Goſpel way, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Confeſſing</hi> and <hi>Forſaking,</hi> and ſeeking Mercy through Chriſt, which you

cannot do whiles in ſuch a frame. And how fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing is it to have Sins lying out againſt us, for which we have no Sealed pardon?</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>If therefore God lets you alone in this way, it is a fearful Judgment.</hi> It may be you pleaſe your ſelves in this, that you are not moleſted in your minds; but alas! there is nothing more tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous. As there is not a greater mercy than to make ſin too hot for us, and ſo to drive us to the refuge that is ſet before us; ſo there is not a greater witneſs of Gods wrath, than to <hi>let men alone</hi> in their ſinful courſes, to pleaſe themſelves in them, and hope to do well enough for all, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.17. It is one of the laſt ſteps God proceeds to, before he brings them to ruine.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>There is a time coming when God will bring you to a reckoning for theſe things, and then Conſcience will roar.</hi> The <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to ſee to his own Glory, and the honour of his Law: delays then are no diſcharges, nor is there any eſcaping of his righteous Judgments, but by timely betaking to his mercy, till we do ſo we ly open, and there will be no avoiding it. God hath not forgotten, though you have, and you ſhall know it too in due time: He will fall upon you, and then your drouſy Conſciences ſhall be full awake: God will ſet it upon you, and you need not have a worſe Fiend to Torment you.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>And this may poſſibly be when it is too late.</hi> It may be not before your Soul ſtealeth into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and drops into the hands of Devils. There are ſome ſuch Wretches, who dy like Lambs,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:000965_0172_0FADE6777A716530"/>
but in a moment this rending Lyon falls upon them. It may be on a death bed, when you have ſpent a life in ſin, and lived ſecure, and now time and opportunity is paſt, and God will not give you Repentance, but open your eyes to ſee what you have been doing, and then let you ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are going, and the pit into which you are entring, and what a terrour will this be?</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>And if God doth give you Repentance at length, this will wofully embitter it.</hi> If you are his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, you ſhall repent and be forgiven, becauſe your ſtate of Juſtification is ſecured: but you ſhall be brought to it by Repentance; and what deep wounds will theſe reflexions give to your Souls? Be then warned and perſwaded to beware of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging your ſelves in this courſe; and if you have done ſo already, <hi>Do ſo no more,</hi> but bitterly bewail it before God, and make haſt to get the Sin of it forgiven: and be ſure to put it into your ſelf-judging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when you aggravate your ſins in your humble acknowledgments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We now proceed to conſider the Author or Efficient cauſe of this diſtreſs, and that is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or his <hi>Hand</hi> that was upon him, and brought him into this terrible condition: and it was not an ordinary diſpenſation, he therefore ſets it forth:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the preſſure of it; <hi>it lay heavy on him.</hi>

Now our Doctrine fully reſolves this Enquiry.</p>
               <p>Three things may here be ſearched into.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God is the author of this trouble by laying of his angry hand heavy on the man?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How or after what manner he doth this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Why or for what end he doth it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God is the author of this, by laying his angry hand heavy on the man?</hi> There are two things in this Concluſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God is the author of it.</hi> It is in it ſelf a fore evil, though by the over-ruling Providence of
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:000965_0175_0FADE6795893D6F0"/>
God, it is made to iſſue in good to ſome. Now there are two ſorts of evil that the Scripture tells us of, <hi>viz</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and of <hi>Affliction.</hi> As to that of Sin, however the permiſſive Providence of God is converſant about it, and is not idle; yet we are utterly to diſclaim his being the <hi>Author</hi> of it: but as to that of <hi>Affliction,</hi> God challengeth it to himſelf univerſally, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. And looks on himſelf as diſhonoured, if we do not ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his <hi>hand</hi> in it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11. And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not only to outward and temporary trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but to all the inward anxieties and terrours of Conſcience that overtake them, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.65. God indeed many times uſeth the inſtrumentality of ſecond cauſes in the production of it, but ſtill he manageth them, and brings about the iſſue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleaſure: he terrifieth and amazeth them, hence that deprecation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Be not a terrour to me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That he doth it by laying his angry hand on the man.</hi> Here take notice of three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God is uſually provoked to anger when he doth thus.</hi> How far he may do it in Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to try his people, I ſhall not here diſpute. <hi>Job</hi> is ſuch an inſtance, who complaineth of <hi>Gods Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> and his <hi>writing bitter things againſt him.</hi> However this is one of the Judgments of God that come for Sin, and there hath been a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation offered in order to it, for the moſt part: and this the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> plainly intimates in our <hi>Text</hi>; for it was <hi>while he kept ſilence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This therefore is an effect or diſplay of his anger</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:000965_0176_0FADE67A2CC9E588"/>
God hath no affections properly; but there are the reſultances of his will in the way of his Diſpenſation to his Creatures, which carry in them a reſemblance of ſuch a thing in us, which is thus expreſſed according to our manner of conception: Afflictive Providences are therefore uſually aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his anger; holy men were wont ſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their reſentments of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This ſort of affliction is a very heavy hand of God upon a man.</hi> One way to judge of the anger, is by the diſtreſs which the effect of it puts us to; if God lay the weight on a man, till it ſinks and overwhelms him, that hand lieth heavy: and ſo it is when Conſcience is let looſe upon him, and chargeth him with Guilt, and threatens him with deſtruction, this is for the kind, the moſt inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable burden that a man can fall under in this life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. And when this laſteth long, and hath no intermiſſion, that addeth to the intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of it: when the <hi>Arrow ſticks faſt,</hi> and cannot be plucked out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How or after what manner God doth this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This may be conſidered either in reſpect of the thing it ſelf, or of the way in which God brings it about.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we look upon it in regard to the thing it ſelf. There are two things in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He awakens the mans Conſcience, and ſets his ſin before him, in the aggravations of it.</hi> Gods hand is laid on the Conſcience; it was before aſleep, and though theſe ſins ſtood upon record in it, the man
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:000965_0177_0FADE67B59EC0068"/>
took no notice of them, and ſo they gave him no moleſtation; but now when it is rouſed, and forced to do its Office, he is made to read theſe records, compare them with the <hi>Rule,</hi> and ſo make a judgement of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>I will ſet them in order before thee.</hi> And now Conſcience looks on them in ſuch circumſtances as make them have the moſt formidable and frightful aſpect: Did not <hi>Cain</hi> look on his through ſuch a glaſs? <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14. And <hi>Judas</hi> too?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He, together with this ſets home the awful ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs of his Word.</hi> There are amazing Threatnings that there ſtand upon record; there is a <hi>Flying Roll</hi> of <hi>Curſes</hi> of a great <hi>length</hi> and <hi>breadth</hi>: Now theſe God not only ſetteth before the man, but he throws them upon his Conſcience, and they fall upon him furiouſly; he is made to take them all to himſelf, and ſay, <hi>I am the man, this is my portion at the hands of God,</hi> &amp;c. And when God hath by Conſcience thus applied them, the man is in his own feeling, as if he were under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of all this Wrath; he is in an hell upon earth, and feels the miſeries of the damned upon him in great meaſure; this made <hi>Judas</hi> chuſe to go to hell, to know the worſt of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If we conſider it in reſpect of the way in which God brings it about, there are theſe things to be remarked.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sometimes he brings ſome diſtreſſing outward Providence on them, and with it troubleth their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</hi> A time of affliction, is often a time of <hi>calling ſin to remembrance,</hi> a time of <hi>adverſity</hi> is a
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:000965_0178_0FADE67BD048C708"/>
                  <hi>conſidering</hi> time, and God often ſets in with it, and maketh Conſcience charge home the ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them which they have been Guilty of; thus <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren, when they met with hard uſage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.42. And it is a thing to be obſerved, that frequently ſome frown in Providence, gives occaſion to fearful troubles of mind, which enſue thereupon; becauſe God by theſe frowns, brings them to conſider of their ſins, and giveth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience a rouſing jog upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Sometimes God cometh to them in a word, and knocks them down with it at once.</hi> One end of the Scriptures and Preaching of it, is for <hi>Conviction</hi>; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And when the Spirit of God, whoſe inſtrument it is, pleaſeth to ſet in with it, it ſhall ſo do to purpoſe. The man before ſat regardleſs under it, and though it as much concerned him, it touched him not, he ſlept under, wandred from it, or inwardly ſcoffed at it; but now it enters not his ear only, but ranſacketh his heart, divides between joynts and marrow, ſearcheth him to the bottom: Conſcience is ſtartled, and wounds his very Soul, the man quaketh as <hi>Faelix, Acts</hi> 24.25. And cries out as <hi>Peters</hi> Hearers, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.37.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God now lets Satan looſe upon them.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ready enough for this work on his own accord: for though he will keep men ſecure as long as he can, yet if God diſquiet them, and he cannot wheedle them into reſt, he now ſeeks to hurry them over the precipice of deſpair: but God governs this affair too. He muſt have leave, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in regard of Gods own, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.31. And
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:000965_0179_0FADE67E8A72F8F8"/>
when he hath, he ſhoots in his fiery <hi>darts</hi>; and though theſe Temptations are wicked, as they come from him, yet they are righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as managed by Gods permiſſive Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Now, they <hi>meditate terrours,</hi> entertain black thoughts, are full of horrours, and are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to precipitate into deſperation it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>And now God witholds from them his Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo that they cannot receive comfort or ſupport by them.</hi> There are ſuch Cordials in the Word, as are fitted for ſuch Souls, and poſſibly are offered them in the Ministry, or privately ſet before them, but they put them away as not belonging to them, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ieve them not, but rather aggravate their trouble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2. And God witholds his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from his Children, &amp; they can take hold of nothing to relieve them, can apprehend no faith in them, no love of God, no hatred of ſin, which they dare call ſo: And for others, they are as the troubled ſea, that can find no reſt: and they go a long time in this condition, God all the while appearing to them as an enemy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Why or for what end he doth it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. As God is holy in all his ways, and juſt in all his doings, ſo are all his works done in wiſdom,</hi> there is therefore a worthy deſign in it; and here we may obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the uſual provoking cauſe of this, is their ſinful Guile.</hi> The deceitfulneſs there is in Sin and Sinners, is highly diſpleaſing to God; and though God can bear with a great many infirmities in his Children, whiles they are plain and honeſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:000965_0180_0FADE67FF0BD3410"/>
103.13, 14. Yet when once they begin to pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice deceit, to hide and cover, this is extreamly diſingenuous, and he can bear no longer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God hereby lets men ſee that there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing on him.</hi> And it is high time for him ſo to do, when they grow up to ſo much of Atheiſm and impudence; men would elſe begin to argue that he either did not know, or not regard, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly that he <hi>approved</hi> of their follies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. but when he takes them in their devices, and makes their Conſciences fall on them, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify them, he giveth them an awful proof of his <hi>Omniſcience</hi>: now he makes <hi>their Sins to find them out,</hi> and they are put upon confeſſing that <hi>he is not mocked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Herein he diſcovers his juſt diſpleaſure at ſin.</hi> He hath indeed reſerved the full diſcovery of this to be made in another World; yet he will make ſome diſplays of it here. He hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his Word, that he is <hi>holy and juſt,</hi> that he <hi>cannot endure,</hi> but will puniſh <hi>Sin</hi>; but men ſcarce believe it, becauſe vile Sinners go on and proſper: but when he maketh them feel the wounds in their Souls, and <hi>they are ſnared in their own handy work</hi>; here is terrible anger in this, and to be read in the faces of ſuch; and hereby God giveth a further clear Teſtimony how hateful a thing ſin is to his Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He often doth this to give ſolemn warning to others. His Judgments are to learn men Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Iſa.</hi> 26.9. He ſometimes ſetteth up in ſight ſome Monuments of his Severity, that <hi>Iſrael
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:000965_0181_0FADE680D1570A88"/>
may hear and fear,</hi> and be cautioned. When ſuch things befal wicked men, they ſhould fright others of their Companions from their lewd courſes, and God expects it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.22. And they ſhould cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Godly men to be the more wary: and when ſuch things befall Gods Children, how loudly doth it ſpeak to the Ungodly to conſider it, <hi>if it be thus done in the green tree, what ſhall be in the dry?</hi> And either men will take warning, or their Guilt will be encreaſed by it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>He ſometimes thus prepareth Sinners for Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> The Spirit of God begins this work with <hi>Conviction of Sin, Joh.</hi> 16.8. In which he gives them a ſight of their Sins, and an apprehenſion of their woful miſery by reaſon of them; in which he uſeth their own Conſciences to amaze and terrify them; he holds the Sinner over Hell, and ſcorcheth him with the flames of it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him find himſelf ready to fall into the midſt of them, thus to prepare him to give welcome to the offers of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. And the moſt guilful Sinners uſually have deepeſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>He doth it to humble his Children for, and cure them of their Guile.</hi> Theſe are terrible temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but they are <hi>to humble them, and do them good, Deut.</hi> 8 16. There uſually is not a little of <hi>anger</hi> in this Diſpenſation, however there is <hi>love</hi> in the bottom of it. He ſeeth that in his Children that he liketh not, but his ſpirit is grieved at, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loveth them, he will heal them of it; and this is the courſe he taketh; by this they are
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:000965_0182_0FADE680D7ED9470"/>
taught what it will coſt them to indulge any ſin, and keep ſilence at it, which embitters it to them, and ſo brings them to <hi>Repentance</hi>: they humble themſelves before him, and the breach thus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be made up, and they reſtored; and ſo alſo it is a happy mean to prevent the like after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by giving them a remembrance that abideth by them, and maketh them more watchful as long as they live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE I.</hi> For <hi>INFORMATION,</hi> in two Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Learn hence the great folly of thoſe who make no great matter of ſinning againſt God.</hi> The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of mankind have low and ſlighty thoughts of ſin, and therein diſcover themſelves to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious fools: nor are the Children of God free from the remainder of this folly; but we have a clear evidence of the madneſs of it, in that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they lay themſelves open to the anger of God, and provoke him to lay his hand heavy upon them, and this is the very conſequent upon ſuch an eſteem of Sin; it is a weighty queſtion the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> propounds, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11. <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger?</hi> Surely there are very few that believe it, they would elſe alter their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and practices; <hi>The burnt Child will dread the fire,</hi> but Sinners have not felt the ſcaldings of Gods anger, the weight of his hand; and ſo they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe, otherwiſe they would think it a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing to ſin than they do. Sinners! did you but know what ſome have felt, you would

ſeal to the truth of that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.7. <hi>Who can ſtand when once thou art angry?</hi> Well look to it, if you do not know, you ſhall know, and you are in the ready way to bring it upon your ſelves. When once you come to feel how heavy his hand is, you will wiſh you had believed it, and ſought to avoid it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Learn hence how vain it is for any to live quiet and ſecure under the Guilt of any ſin.</hi> This is it that procures the heavy diſpleaſure of God, and as long as the Guilt remains, the reaſon of it abideth in us. Unleſs we can eſcape the hand of God, there is no ground for this ſecurity: as long as you have to do with God, you have no ſafety; if the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though you have health, and eaſe, and outward peace, and proſperity, and enjoy of the World <hi>more than heart can wiſh,</hi> yet a <hi>Finger</hi> of God laid on you will do this, and bring you into unconceivable diſtreſs. Beware then how you live a day under the Guilt of one ſin, leſt in a moment this Wrath fall upon you and conſume you.</p>

                  <hi>USE II. For Warning and advice to all,</hi> and that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To take heed of being drawn into ſin by any vain pretences.</hi> We are all too eaſy to hearken to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans inſinuations, and the ſolicitations of our own luſts, and a little matter will allure us to do amiſs: we therefore need ſomething to caution us, and fortify us againſt this: and what can be more uſeful on this account, than the truth before us, if throughly believed, and ſeaſonably thought on, with due ſolemnity, when the temptation offers and is urge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Heb.</hi> 10.31. How would this repel the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are you under this diſtreſs already? And do you feel it inſupportable?</p>
               <p>Be adviſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſee the hand of God in it.</hi> It may be you find diſquietment on your minds, your ſpirits make you like a troubled and tempeſtuous Sea; and you cannot tell what to make of it; you think it is ſome <hi>Melancholly</hi> that needs <hi>Phyſick,</hi> or ſome moleſtation of the Devil that gives you trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but theſe are but ſubordinate cauſes; look farther, acknowledge God, believe it to be <hi>his hand, Pſal.</hi> 17.14.

under it, or ſeek the proper remedy till you come to this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Now ſearch for the ſin that hath procured it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> It is a time to make inquiſition; all your afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to turn your eyes upon ſin, and put you on the ſearch: you may hope it is not for ſin, but trial; but you may ſo be deluded. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if now you do not ſearch for Sin, it is a ſign that there is one that you would hide; and it was becauſe you kept ſilence, that he thus touched you: it is then time to look about you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Take heed of hiding your ſin.</hi> Seek not to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or extenuate, or ſuppreſs the Conviction of it in your Conſciences. Ungodly men always thus practice; and the ſame luſt that tempts a Child of God to ſin, doth alſo put him upon ſo doing; this is the very thing that brought the trouble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, in Gods righteous Judgment, and it will continue it, if you nouriſh it; if when Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſtriveth, you ſuppreſs Convictions, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your Sins, you will but encreaſe your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: ask <hi>David</hi> how long his diſtreſs continued on him, and he will tell you, it was as <hi>long as he kept ſilence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Beware what means you uſe to get rid of it.</hi> If you be not careful, you may involve your ſelves the more, and make the hand heavier on you. If you fly to your <hi>hiding places of deceit,</hi> they will diſappoint you; if you think to cure it by diverting from it, and putting it out of your mind by other things, it will deceive you; or if you hope to do it by complaining to your accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:000965_0186_0FADE6865EB0DB78"/>
and companions in ſin, as <hi>Judas did,</hi> they will give you no help: if you hope to heal it by legal repentances, and reformations, they will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint you: if you feel ſome preſent eaſe by it, your diſtreſs will revert.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Enquire after the right way to get remedy, and practice it.</p>
               <p>And for help, Conſider;</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>As long as Gods hand abides heavy on you, your trouble will continue.</hi> It is vain to ſeek eaſe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way: the hand that wounded you muſt heal you, if ever you be healed: nothing can afford you true comfort while his anger abides, <hi>Job</hi> 34.29. There is no <hi>flying</hi> from his <hi>hand,</hi> it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you where-ever you go, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is no hope to have his hand removed ſo long as you continue under your Guilt.</hi> This is the root of it; it is only by a pardon that you can have eaſe: and the hope of a pardon is the proper relief of a burdened Conſcience: an unpardoned ſin will be heavy when God lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it on; and this is one way in which God is wont to eaſe mens Conſciences, to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs before them: till then, if you ask, <hi>is it peace</hi>? it will readily be anſwered, <hi>What peace,</hi> ſo long as ſin lies unforgiven?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is no hope of pardon ſo long as you</hi> keep ſilence. It is a ſolemn word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper.</hi> If you ſhould never commit that ſin more, yet if you hide it, it will eat out your comfort, and ly in againſt you, though you never ſo carefully abſtain from

the like. It is a duty to ſay, <hi>I will do ſo no more</hi> but it is not all your duty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There is a way to get it removed.</hi> God hath provided a remedy for afflicted Conſciences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though we have ſinned, and diſſembled, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him, and his hand be upon us, and we are in terrours by reaſon of it, yet, whether we <hi>be in the gall of bitterneſs,</hi> being Unregenerate, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are <hi>Believers,</hi> by our own folly under our fathers anger, and <hi>Chastized with ſcorpions</hi>; there is in Chriſt an hope ſet before us, do not then deſpair, nor give way to diſcouragements, but enquire and hearken, and be willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, ſo may you <hi>find reſt</hi> to your diſtreſſed minds, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28.

                  <p>
                     <hi>That which we are to make Confeſſion of,</hi> is Sin. So all the three words in the <hi>Text</hi> import. What it is to Confeſs Sin is well to be obſerved. Sin is defined to be a <hi>Tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.4. Now Sin as ſuch, will come under a double conſideration, <hi>viz. Original,</hi> and <hi>Actual</hi>; and both of theſe muſt be referred to the <hi>Law of ſpecial Government,</hi> under which man was placed by God in his <hi>Creation</hi>: for nothing can be called Sin, but as it hath a reference to the Law. Here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Original Sin</hi> hath a double reſpect, <hi>Privative</hi> and <hi>Poſitive</hi>; and both belong to the Nature of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Privative</hi>; Man in his Natural ſtate is void of <hi>Original Righteouſneſs.</hi> There was a <hi>Moral recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> put into the Nature of man at firſt, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 7.29. This is that which is moſt directly intended, by the <hi>Image of God</hi> in which man was made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. It conſiſted in thoſe Graces of Sanctification, by which man was fitted for Univerſal Perfect Obedience to the whole Will of God. Man by the Fall hath loſt this rectitude, and is Born into the World without this <hi>Image</hi>; And this is a Sinful ſtate, for the Law requires it in him, and, as he was betruſted with it, expects it of him. The
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:000965_0190_0FADE689167E8798"/>
want of it hath rendred him Impotent as to his Duty, which Impotency is put into the deſcription of the Sinful ſtate of Fallen man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. And the man cannot anſwer the Law ſo long as he is without it: and it is a Privation, for man once had the habit of it on him, and it was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſitive</hi>; Man is in his Natural ſtate filled with the evil habits of Unrighteouſneſs. When he loſt the <hi>Image of God,</hi> he contracted the <hi>Image of Sin</hi> in the room of it, which conſiſts in the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the whole Nature,</hi> as the Crooked bias which is in all his Faculties and Powers, forcibly inclining him to Tranſgreſs the Law of God, ſet forth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it hath two things in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>An utter Averſeneſs to that which is Good. i. e. Theologically</hi> ſo. Man is a Rational Creature, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth under the notion of Good, and refuſeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an opinion of Evil; but he doth this accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Corrupt reaſon, and not by the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> And though ſometimes if it be in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it right, yet he doth it not aright: hence proceeds mens refuſing Obedience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3. And this is upon Choiſe, flowing from a Curſed diſpoſition in them, and is Sinful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A violent inclination to that which is Evil,</hi> True, they <hi>call Evil Good,</hi> and under that notion they crave after it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20. But it is a Corrupt principle in them from whence they ſo do; and the inſatiable reaching of their hearts after it, is of the Sinfulneſs of their Nature. And this is
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:000965_0191_0FADE689D7266828"/>
Eminently obſervable in a Gracious Soul, by the reluctancy of it againſt the better part, of which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> maketh ſuch complaint, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Actual Sin may alſo come under a double Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, viz.</hi> the <hi>Act,</hi> and the <hi>Obliquity</hi> of it: and reſpect is to be had to both in the right ſtating of the matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of the Act it ſelf.</hi> For though no Act, as it is an Act, is Sin, but hath a natural Goodneſs; yet actual Sin hath an Act which is the ſubject in which it is, and ſo there can be no <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of Sin, without acknowledging the Act. Now in <hi>Divinity</hi> there are two ſorts of Actions in which Sin is to be obſerved;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Commiſſions; <hi>which are uſally called</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions. When the man doth ſomething that ought not to be done: and this prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ly reſpects the <hi>Negative Precepts</hi> which do prohibit the doing of them. The Law ſaith, <hi>thou ſhalt not Kill, Steal, &amp;c.</hi> when men do ſuch things, theſe are Sins of <hi>Commiſſion</hi>: theſe ought not to be done; the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them therefore is ſinful.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Omiſſions; <hi>which are comings ſhort in duty</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And are againſt the <hi>Affirmative Precepts,</hi> which require us to do this or that: when we do it not, it is an <hi>Omiſſion.</hi> Now though theſe in common account are rather a not acting than actings, yet in <hi>Divinity</hi> they come under actual ſins, becauſe there is the action of the will in them, which God hath a regard to, and is indeed the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal power in man which the Command hath to do withal: and ſo God chargeth theſe Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

or willfulneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>With reſpect to the</hi> Obliquity <hi>of the action.</hi> And this is it that rendereth it Sin. No Action can be reckoned ſinful, but as it ſwerves from the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> given unto man, for <hi>where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion, Rom.</hi> 4 15. Had there been no Law, man could no more have Sinned than Beaſts can: but, being put under a Law ſuited to his Nature, every warping from it, in exceſs or defect, becometh a Sin. Now this Obliquity is conſiderable ſeveral ways, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In the</hi> matter <hi>of the Action: i. e.</hi> When the Action it ſelf is repugnant to the Precept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the Law ſaith this thou ſhalt not do, and the man doth the very thing forbidden; or this thou ſhalt do, and he neglecteth it. Hence the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Sin is put upon ſuch actions, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> Which is to be underſtood, not <hi>abſolutely</hi> as they are actions, but <hi>relatively</hi> as they are actions which the Law prohibits: <hi>The thing that David did, diſpleaſed the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In the</hi> manner <hi>of the Action.</hi> There is not only a doing, but a ſo doing required by the Law, unto which if men give not attendance, but in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpect decline from it, Sin is imputed to them, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13. <hi>We ſought not after the due order; Luk.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Take heed how you hear.</hi>

that which was right, but not with a perfect heart</hi>; and <hi>Pſal</hi> 78.38 <hi>Their heart was not right with him.</hi> Thus are Hypocrites condemned on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their <hi>Prayers and Alms givings, Math.</hi> 6. <hi>begin.</hi> And for this reaſon all the actions of Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men are obliquities, <hi>Prov</hi> 21.4.28 9.</p>

As there is no ſin ſo great, but a true confeſſion of it may profit us, ſo there is none ſo little, but we are in danger if we confeſs it not; and indeed there is the ſame reaſon for confeſſing one or another. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Every Sin is a</hi> Tranſgreſſion of the Law of God.

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Hence every ſin brings men under the Guilt of Death.</hi> Though there be degrees in it, yet there is but one kind of puniſhment put into the threatning for Sin, and that is <hi>death,</hi> which is the wages of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

If the Guilt be not removed by a pardon, one ſin of the ſmalleſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, will caſt him at the Bar, and he cannot eſcape.</p>

There is no Religious duty done accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to God, but what hath the heart in it, the will determined about it; there are many forced confeſſions, that men are driven to in diſtreſs, when Gods hand is upon them, and Conſcience thundereth againſt them, that maketh them to <hi>vomit up</hi> their indigeſted <hi>morſels,</hi> and make a great noiſe, as thoſe that are extreamly ſick of Sin; but it is not kindly, nor will it end well. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did thus when Gods hand was heavy on him; &amp; the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſo in times of diſtreſſing Judgments: but what came it to? What a remark doth God make on it? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.37 God indeed frequently uſeth afflictive Providences as means, and Conſcience as an inſtrument for the bringing of men to a ſincere confeſſion, ſuch as <hi>Ephraims</hi> was, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19. But he cauſeth it to work ſo on the heart, as to make the man truly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Sin, and with ſelf abhorrence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It muſt be</hi> deliberate. Firſt purpoſed before it is put in Execution; &amp; there is a rational weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things proper to this purpoſe, which brings it to this reſolve in the mind: hence there are ſome things preparatory to this Confeſſion, that make way for it, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language hath one word for knowing and acknowledging, intimating that no ſound confeſſion can be made, till we know the thing. Now the knowledge of Sin is not meerly ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but practical, and belongs to the Conſcience; it is done by reflection; Conſcience tells the man that he hath done the thing, and how he hath done it, and ſhews him the Law which he hath broken, and the Righteouſneſs of that Law, and the penalty that he hath incurred hereby, and it realizeth all this to and in him: and this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Conviction of Sin, this is the Spirits work, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. And he uſeth the means for it. Thus God treated <hi>David</hi> by the Prophet, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>begin.</hi> And all to prepare him for a kindly Confeſſion; he therefore ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3. <hi>I know my tranſgreſſions, and my ſin is ever before me.</hi>

And this is a genuine fruit of the former Conviction. When the man hath a right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of his Sin on him, it appears in ſuch colours as amaze him, and make him look on himſelf as the vileſt creature living, and this embittereth Sin to him, and ſo diſpoſeth him to a free and full confeſſion of it; God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bids them to <hi>know and ſee that it is evil and bitter, Jer.</hi> 2.19.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The burdened Conſcience is now driven to ſeek eaſe by confeſſion of the ſin from which its trouble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</hi> And this a natural Conſcience doth more eaſily put men upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Pharaoh</hi> once and again is driven ſo far, as to confeſs he had <hi>Sinned in refuſing to let the people of God go.</hi> And men muſt be grown to a prodigious hardneſs of heart, if they ſuppreſs the confeſſion of a Sin ſo circumſtanced.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>When the Spirit of God deſigns the man ſaving good.</hi> This Conviction is but an introduction to farther diſcoveries; he will ſhow the man to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his true colours before he hath done with him; by this he opens the door, and leads the man into the <hi>chambers</hi> of his heart, and calls him to <hi>conſider his ways, Hag.</hi> 1.5. And this is to bring him to a ſight and ſenſe of all his ſins, in order to the drawing out a full confeſſion of them all: it is then our duty not to reſt at one, but to trace it up as far as we can. And here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There are often a great many ſins that attend the conſummation of that one; which he ought to ſee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, and confeſs ſeverally.</hi> There were ſins that gave occaſion to the temptation; though Satan tempts, yet our corruption moſtly giveth him the advantage; and that is to be lamented. <hi>David</hi> on
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:000965_0205_0FAE3754061B6678"/>
the <hi>houſe top</hi> ſuffers his eye to wander, and it is ſurprized. There were Sins in the entertaining of the temptation, ſome luſt or other not guarded againſt, but neglected, if not indulged, and that received the ſparks, and the heart took fire by it, the <hi>ſin conceived in it</hi>: when <hi>Achan</hi> ſaw the <hi>wedge of Gold, he coveted it, Joſh.</hi> 7.21. There are ſins that accompany the act it ſelf, beſides that the man doth the thing, he uſeth much fraud in doing it; yea, and he breaks a great many commands in that one act; yea, there are many vile acts in one work of Sin to the finiſhing of it: and there are Sins that adhere to or follow it when it is done: it leads to more in the covering, and keeping it from taking air: how many did <hi>David</hi> run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into upon his Adultery? and as all theſe are ſo many Sins, ſo they require a particular obſervation and acknowledgment of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a Fountain of Corruption within, from whence every actual Sin doth ſtream</hi>; and we ought to follow it up thither, and make Confeſſion of that. There is <hi>an Evil root of Bitterneſs</hi> to be diſcerned in every <hi>departure from God</hi>; and when the Spirit of God Convinceth us of any Sin, we ſhould ask our own hearts, whence cometh this? And on enquiry we ſhall find an undeniable Fountain. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.21, 22. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.7. This then muſt be Confeſſed, hither <hi>David</hi> follows his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5 and <hi>Paul</hi> his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, 24. And here we ſee a vile Nature, full of all abominations, the well head of every Iniquity, which affords matter of large and deep Confeſſion. And let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:000965_0206_0FAE3754648F92C8"/>
that <hi>that Sin is not rightly Confeſſed by us, in which we are not led from the Act to the Original, and do not acknowledge the Sin it iſſued from, as well as the Sin it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There are a Multitude of other Sins the man hath been Guilty of</hi>; and it is now a proper ſeaſon to reflect on, and make Confeſſion of them. Now all his <hi>Evil ways and doings that have not been good,</hi> ought to come into conſideration. This Sin tells us how terrible it is to have any Sin ſtand out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned; and that will put us upon calling our ſelves to an account, to enquire what we have been and done, and what hath been done in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obtaining a remiſſion: and it is uſual that old Sins do now procure new trouble to the mind, which maketh us to ſpread them before God: <hi>David</hi> runs up to the very <hi>Sins of his youth, Pſal.</hi> 25.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt confeſs them to the height, without any extenuation. Covering</hi> and <hi>Confeſſing</hi> are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. Negatives in Scripture language include and intend affirmatives; when the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> ſaith he did not <hi>hide,</hi> he intends, that he <hi>laid</hi> it open, and was very plain and full in his confeſſion. And here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt not hide the matter of fact by any ſinful Concealment. David</hi> had attempted this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and greatly encreaſed his Sin thereby; but now he will do ſo no more. There is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment from men, and Concealment from God; which men are apt to Endeavour: as to the latter, as it is in vain, for God knows us better
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:000965_0207_0FAE375588423E18"/>
than we do our ſelves, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. So it is ſinful When men think to be ſafe by keeping ſilence and ſo do not freely lay themſelves open before him, this is an <hi>Atheistical</hi> thought that God ſhall not know it, and muſt be withſtood. In refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the former; how far confeſſion is to be made to men, will be after conſidered; only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that if we cannot keep our ſin from taking air, and coming to light, but by ſome other ſin in the hiding of it, we ought not to ſuppreſs it; for this is but to <hi>add ſin to ſin</hi>; and ſometimes more neſandous ſins than the firſt that we would hide: if <hi>David</hi> had ſo done, he had not added Murder to Adultery. The telling a ly to keep a ſin ſecret by a flat denial of it, is contrary to ſincerity of heart: and if we confeſs our ſin affectionately to God, yet if we ly to men at the ſame time, our confeſſion will not profit us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt not hide the ſinfulneſs of the fact by any unjuſt pretences or excuſes.</hi> It is not enough to ſay we have done the thing, and ſinned in it, if we mince the matter, and ſeek to make it as excuſable as we can. Here obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt not go about to make any ſin little when we are confeſſing it.</hi> I did not do well, I might have done better, I was not ſo careful as I ought; but it was but a circumſtance or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable matter, I hope it will not be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; this is a vain confeſſion. All ſins indeed are not alike; but to confeſs any ſo diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, is to trifle: this is next to ſaying, <hi>ſpare it, it is a little one</hi>: It ſaith we are not convinced of the malignity there is in all ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="209" facs="unknown:000965_0208_0FAE3755DFF2FC50"/>2. <hi>We muſt not put the blame of it from our ſelves to others, and ſo make our fault the leſs.</hi> We did not well indeed, we ſhould have been more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but we were provoked, allured, the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was great; and theſe or thoſe are to blame for it, but for whom I had never done it; thus our Firſt Parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Thus <hi>Aaron, Exod.</hi> 32.22, 23. It is very common, and men think they eaſe themſelves much with it; not conſidering that others may tempt us, but if they prevail it is with our conſent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt not throw the blame upon God.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is ſo: there was a tacit reflection in that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.12. <hi>The Woman thou gavest me, &amp;c.</hi> And how ready are we to ſay, What would you have me to do? I have no ſtrength of mine own, and God left me, how ſhould I reſiſt? I am ſorry, but I could do no better: againſt this we are caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>If God by his Providence brings our ſecret ſins to light, we are to make a free Confeſſion of them.</hi> There are many ways in which God doth this. Men think their ſins ſhall never be known, being contrived ſo privately, and acted ſo ſecretly, but God revealeth them, and then it is vain for us to hide them: thus God dealt by <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. and he hath left his ſorrowful Confeſſion on record, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Hence ſometimes it is requiſite to make a publick Confeſſion, when the Sin cannot be legally proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us: Viz.</hi> When Gods Providence giveth ſo much light, as our profeſſion is ſcandalized among men, though there be not a full proof. When there are ſuch circumſtances of diſcovery, as give a moral certainty to men, and there are ſeveral things known, that render us juſtly ſuſpected: as when there is a common fame, and ſuch things as make the moſt charitable ſuſpicious of us, and force an enquiry to be made: Now we are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innocent or guilty, and the honour of God requires that we either aſſert our innocency, or acknowledge our Guilt; the Apoſtle reproved the <hi>Corinthians</hi> on a <hi>common report,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.

                  <p n="6">6. <hi>There may be ſuch a diſtreſs on Conſcience for ſome ſins, as will neceſſitate a Confeſſion to men.</hi> God ſometimes lays the burden heavy on the man, and though he confeſs to God, he findeth no eaſe; it is now proper to make uſe of ſome or other, to unburden our minds unto: which may be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly intended in, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Confeſs your faults one to another.</hi> God hath appointed his Children to be helpful each to other; only great caution is to be uſed here; we ſhould chuſe ſuch to diſcover our ſelves to, as will be faithful, and ſecret, and are capable of giving us counſel and relief; the proper deſign of it being for the eaſing of our Conſciences. But our great buſineſs is to make our Confeſſions to God, and this we muſt never forget, and there is great reaſon for this; for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God knows all our ſins, and therefore it is vain to go about to hide them from him.</hi> They all ſtand in the light of his Countenance; we may hope to eſcape from men by hiding; but to think to get any thing by not confeſſing to God, is a great folly. He doth not need our confeſſion, to give him any information, he knows them, and can <hi>ſet them in order before us,</hi> when he pleaſeth; if then he looketh for our acknowledgment, and we do not make it, this will turn to our da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, there is a threatning in that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his ſins, ſhall not proſper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>All Sin is againſt God.</hi> Men may be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it, but whether they be or no, Gods

honour is ſtricken at by every Sin; it is a <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of his Law,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. It is a <hi>coming ſhort of his glory, Rom.</hi> 3.23. And that is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front offered to him; and indeed, conſidered as Sin, it is <hi>only againſt him, Pſal</hi> 51.4. And whom ſhould we make our Confeſſion to, but him whom we have provoked by it? he is the party firſtly concerned, and muſt not be neglected.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>He only can forgive us our ſins.</hi> Our great encouragement to confeſs, is our hope to obtain mercy and pardon, and therefore the Goſpel, which made diſcovery of forgiveneſs through Chriſt, is the great motive to poor Sinners to fall down before God, and acknowledge their Sins to him. Well, this is his Prerogative, and he will not give it another, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.9. <hi>To the Lord belong mercies and forgiveneſſes.</hi> Men indeed may remit to us the injury done to them, ſo far as they are concerned; and too often that is all that we trouble our ſelves about; but the Sin may yet ly upon us: they may do their work, but they cannot do Gods work; and if he be not atoned, that Sin will undo us; but if he forgive us, all is well, and we are happy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>If we hope to obtain forgiveneſs of him, we must ſeek it in his way.</hi> As there <hi>is forgiveneſs with him, Pſal.</hi> 130.4.

will not baulk this, and for us to neglect it, is to cut our ſelves off from the Goſpel hope. Now this Confeſſing to God intends, not only a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before him in Prayer, and laying open the caſe, but a particular reflection and animadverſion on the ſin, under this conſideration, that it is <hi>againſt him:</hi> to ſee, and bewail before him, the wrong we have done to his name, the diſhonour we have brought to his declarative glory, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to his Goſpel, and the profeſſion we have made of it; theſe are the aggravations we are to put to it, and by them to lay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt weight upon it: this was doubtleſs <hi>Davids</hi> aim, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Against thee, thee only,</hi> &amp;c. Not that he had forgat the wrong he had done to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but the concern of Gods Glory went near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to him, and ſwallowed up the reſt; ſo faith the poor <hi>Prodigal,</hi> Luk. 15.18. <hi>I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It follows to ſhew how neceſſary and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſuch a Confeſſion is, for the relief of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Conſcience: Which will be evidenced by the following Concluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the great burden lying on the Conſcience that diſtreſſeth it for Sin, is the Guilt.</hi> A gracious Soul indeed is humbled and put into mourning by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the pollution that cleaveth to his Sin; and it is the principal ingredient of a kindly godly Sorrow for ſin: but, though that abaſeth the man, and makes him vile in his own ſight, yet it doth not fill him with thoſe perplexities we are now conſidering of: The terrors of Conſcience
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:000965_0218_0FAE389F32793038"/>
ariſe from the apprehenſion of Gods Wrath, and the impreſſion which the Curſes of the Law make on the Soul: he ſeeth God coming againſt him as an enemy armed with revenge, and is in fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expectation of falling into his hand; it is this <hi>anger</hi> that overwhelmeth him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.2.88.7. And it is the apprehenſion of Guilt that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth it. God appears to him terrible in his Holineſs and Juſtice, and he doth not apprehend the comfort of a Sealed Pardon, hence ariſe all his Soul agonies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That hence as long as this Guilt lieth upon the Conſcience, the diſtreſs muſt abide.</hi> A man indeed may be under Guilt, and yet have much ſeeming quiet: and how many have a ſtupendous load of Guilt lying on them, and do not groan under it, becauſe they feel it not, becauſe Conſcience is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, and ſenſeleſs: and many get eaſe again, though their Guilt abideth, becauſe they have baffled their Conſciences, and charmed them into a falſe perſwaſion; but this is certain, while the Conſcience hath the remorce of the Guilt upon it, and apprehends it, the man can have no reſt: all the diverſions he can turn to, all the carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights he ſeeks to content himſelf withal, give him no relief, the <hi>Arrow of Gods wrath</hi> abides on his Conſcience, and feſters there, his pain is not in the leaſt abated; and how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that whiles a man is dogged up and down with an accuſing, condemning Conſcience, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on him the Guilt of Death, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him with Eternal Damnation, he ſhould
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:000965_0219_0FAE389FE31F1AA8"/>
have any reſt? he cannot think it a light matter to <hi>Dwell with Everlasting Burnings,</hi> when they are realized to him, though he ſcoffed at them when he believed them not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This Guilt is not removed from the Conſcience, but by forgiveneſs.</hi> Nothing but a pardon can take it away. I know Sinners have other courſes to benumme their hearts, and ſtupify the ſenſe of their pain: and ſometimes by Gods awful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they obtain to bring themſelves into dedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, it may be carnal confidence, and vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; ſome mens Conſciences are ſtupified others ſecure under a refuge of lies: but this is a falſe peace; the wound is but skinned over, and the core will feſter within, and break out again more fearfully. That man who ſeeks to quiet his mind from the trouble which Sin hath brought him into, any other way, but by ſeeking forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, doth but cheat his own Soul, and lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for his greater ſorrow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.11. Till for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs cometh, the <hi>Wrath of God abideth him,</hi> Juſtice ſtands engaged to purſue him to death, and the irreſiſtible hand of Omnipotency is ready to do the Execution, nor can any thing remedy this but a free pardon: the man cannot expiate it, all his repentances and reformations will not ſatisfie for it; till the Blood of Chriſt be applied to it, it will certainly remain.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>That this muſt be witneſſed in the Conſcience to give it eaſe.</hi> There is <hi>peace with God</hi> upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of a pardon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. The very act of forgiveneſs paſt in the Court of Heaven, is a fruit

of Gods being reconciled, and rendereth the mans ſtate peaceable: but this peace doth not influence the Conſcience to make peace there, till it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and aſcertained of this forgiveneſs; he ſtill reads his Guilt, and that is his trouble, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ill he can get ſome good ſecurity of his pardon, he is not ſatisfied: The report indeed that there is forgiveneſs with God, and the offer of it made to him, is ſome relief, and affords him a ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hope againſt utter deſpair, but it muſt be a ſigned and ſealed pardon, read to him, that will reſtore him to real comfort; there is many a Malefactor is Executed for all the mercy of the Prince: God may be a God of forgiveneſs, and many may taſte of it, but he may periſh.

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>There is no Testimony that can ſatisfie the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in this caſe, but that of the Spirit of God.</hi> He muſt ſpeak peace to, and in the man, or it cannot be believed: Conſcience ſaith, it is God that is provoked, he is Judge, the Sentence of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hath proceeded from his mouth; and if he do not take it off again, none can.

Godly and skilful Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may inquire into the mans caſe, and give him great encouragement, judging his condition ſafe; but all will ſignifie nothing to him; they are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, and do not know him as he knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he knoweth his own ſtate better than they do; he therefore can have no quiet till there be a <hi>Divine Obſignation</hi> upon him, till it comes to that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. Faith only can receive the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and apply it, and that cannot build on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing ſhort of a Divine Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>There muſt be this forgiveneſs really paſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Spirits bearing witneſs to it.</hi> The man muſt be forgiven, at leaſt in order of nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can be aſcertained of it: for this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is to a thing that really is; and though God ſometimes doth together with pardoning the Sinner, let in this light, whereby he diſcerns it; yet he doth not always do ſo, he acts his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty in this matter, but he giveth no aſſurance of a pardon to him before hand; he indeed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth it, tells him where it is, and how to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, encourageth him to wait for it, offereth him his aſſiſtance: but all this while the matter is in ſuſpenſe as to the man; and if he comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:000965_0222_0FAE38A2221A0AA0"/>
not with theſe offers, he remaineth in a ſtate of Condemnation. God is not wont to reveal his purpoſe to the man on this account, till he hath given being to it in his Providence, and this aſſurance follows upon that faith by which he embraced the offer of Grace which had been made to him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>That this Forgiveneſs is applyed upon the plight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the New Covenant.</hi> As to the opinion of a Juſtification from Eternity, or upon Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, the miſtake of it hath been before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: the promiſe of it made unto Chriſt, and the accquittance given to Chriſt for his Redeemed, was to be applyed to them in the Goſpel way and order. The actual Forgiving their Sins, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the work of <hi>Application</hi>; and God hath in the Goſpel opened a New Covenant, in which he carrieth on the Reconciliation, ſo that after Chriſt had <hi>Reconciled God</hi> to us, we are ſent to, and entreated to be <hi>Reconciled to God.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. And there are the terms of the Covenant, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the tenour whereof it is brought about; and therefore called a <hi>Covenant of Peace, Mal.</hi> 2.5. becauſe upon the making it with the Soul, the Peace of God is brought into it, to which belongs this Forgiveneſs.

But in the New Covenant, they are acts of preventing Grace, and are not promiſed on any Condition to us: all the offers of Spiritual Good are there made to Repenting and Believing: ſo that both the Invitations of the Goſpel, and the Evangelical commmands Publiſhed in it, require this of us, though not of our ſelves, but we muſt wait for them as a Gift from God: yet this is a great Truth, that there are no other Saving benefits conferred on us without them, and there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocation in them, which is as much as is to be underſtood in calling them <hi>Conditions</hi>; viz. <hi>that without Faith and Repentance, there is no Forgiveneſs</hi>: if God giveth not this Grace, neither doth he the other, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. and that whenever God beſtows theſe upon any, he together with it brings them into a State of Pardon: true <hi>Faith</hi> hath all <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> ſecured to it, <hi>Heb</hi> 10.39.</p>

Where is intended a penitent confeſſion, ſuch as accompanieth true Repentance; elſe <hi>Pharaoh</hi> may confeſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſee how God inſiſts upon it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12, 13.

Every natural man is in love with Sin; natural corruption calls it good, approves of it; he hath choſen it, and till he hath another diſcovery made of it to him, he will hold it faſt, &amp; not let it go. In true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance there is a <hi>turning from ſin,</hi> and it is the act of a reaſonable Creature, and therefore he muſt ſee reaſon for it, elſe he will not, becauſe his heart is knit to it; and there are two things neceſſary to be ſeen in it, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>miſeries</hi> it hath expoſed him to, and the <hi>vileneſs</hi> of its nature: for though a <hi>legal</hi> Repentance may be wrought by the former, yet that which is <hi>Evangelical</hi> will not be without

the latter, hence both are put together, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. The end of Conviction is to drive the man to Repentance, and hence will naturally draw forth ſuch a Confeſſion of it.</p>

It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that the man leave off the former practice of the Sin, but Repentance requires that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs real grief of heart that ever he was guilty of ſinning, ſo <hi>Ephraim, Jer</hi> 31.18.

reaſon why it is ſo with them, which it concerns them carefully to enquire after. Here obſerve;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That God may have forgiven their ſin, and not for the preſent witneſs it in their Conſciences.</hi> As a man may be in a pardoned ſtate and yet queſtion whether he be ſo or no, by reaſon of darkneſs in his mind, and the Spirits witholding his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; ſo it may be in reſpect of the actual forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this or that ſin that he hath fallen into: he may have repented, confeſſed, ſought forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and God hath pardoned him, and yet doth not inſtantly proclaim it in his Conſcience; and he acteth much of his Holy Soveraignty herein, for reaſons known to himſelf, ſo that we have a great deal of reaſon charitably to think this of ſome that are under the hurries of ſuch perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: And let not ſuch be overborn with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings of their hearts, but ſay to themſelves as he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, &amp;c.</hi> God will have his time to let them know it, though now they are in the dark about it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>You are Sinners.</hi> That is the condition of all men by nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence you have the matter of this diſtreſs on you.</hi> And what is it that is ſo bitter and burden ſome to the Conſcience, but a Conviction of Sin, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the Guilt that attendeth it?

Remember there is none of us but is dayly liable to ſin, whiles a <hi>deceitful heart</hi> within, and a <hi>tempting Devil,</hi> and a <hi>ſinning world</hi> without, are giving us provocation: and if we are drawn into ſin, we are thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to trouble, it makes a wound, and we may look for pain. The Spirit of God will put us to trouble in order to a kindly repentance; and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will moleſt us, ſeeking to drive us to deſpair; and when it is ſo, the only way in which we can look for ſtable relief is in a right acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſins to God. And here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Keep up the exerciſe of thus confeſſing for the preventing of this diſtreſs.</hi> There are daily failings and follies in us; and theſe will ſcratch us, and eaſily feſter, if not heeded. There are that have

had much quiet and peace, and have not fallen into any ſcandalous ſin, and yet have loſt the apprehenſion of their peace, and are full of trouble; and it hath been occaſioned by a neglect of themſelves in regard of ſins of dayly infirmity. Be then adviſed,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To be calling your ſelves to a daily account.</hi> Enquire and ſee what Sins have paſt you, and with what allowance they have ſo done: it may be vain thoughts entertained, and taken too much content in: it may be ſome fooliſh or frothy communication ſported in; ſome ſinful paſſion given too much way to; ſome duty neglected; ſome diſhonour done to God by others which you have not duly witneſſed againſt; and if you enquire not, you will be at a loſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Upon diſcovery, to bring every ſuch ſin, and lay it open before God ingeniouſly.</hi> Make an humble, hearty, and diſtinct confeſſion over it, and beg of God his forgiveneſs. Out of doubt this is implyed in that petition, which Chriſt hath made one eſſential part of our daily prayer to God; <hi>Forgive us our Sins.</hi> If thus we would improve our Conſciences as our Monitors, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their fidelity in it, take their rebukes well, and ſo uſe them, it would prevent their being forced to be our accuſers; and thus addreſſing of God, would alſo be the way to keep up Communion with him, and prevent the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings of his familiar manifeſtation of himſelf to us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Let us be ſeriouſly earneſt with God that he
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:000965_0244_0FAE38BC718FC268"/>
will ſearch us.</hi> It is this hiding of ſin that uſually creates all the trouble to a Child of God; if we could fly to Chriſt preſently to have his <hi>Balm</hi> poured in, it would not likely be ſo; and becauſe we cannot of our ſelves <hi>know</hi> all our <hi>Errors,</hi> we ſhould go to him to diſcover them; thus is he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to do, <hi>Job</hi> 34.32. Thus did the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 26. <hi>begin.</hi> 139.23. And I believe there is not a better note of truth and ſincerity of heart, than an earneſt deſire to have our ſins diſcovered to us in order to our through repentance of them, and a ready entertaining of any Convictions offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us on the account; it ſaith that we are <hi>jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> of our ſelves with an <hi>holy jealouſie,</hi> and that we hate ſin as our worſt enemy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Are you under diſtreſs of Conſcience?</hi> Take this courſe for your recovery again. Encouragements to this will follow in the next Doctrine.</p>

I believe that upon due enquiry, you will ſeldom miſs of finding this to impute to your ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Be ſure now to lay your ſelves open to God, without any reſerves.</hi> Keep ſilence no longer; mince the matter no more; deal plainly and openly with that God who <hi>ſearcheth hearts and tryeth them</hi> throughly: lay your ſelves as low, and make your ſelves as vile as may be before him. Thus have Gods Children been wont to do.</p>

                  <hi>GOD is exceeding ready to Forgive the truly Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, upon their humble Confeſſion, how great ſoever their Sins have been.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here commends God to us for one wonderfully <hi>prone to pardon</hi> penitent Sinners, upon his own very large experience. What this Confeſſion is hath been already obſerved under the former Doctrine. Here therefore we may further Enquire.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What is implied in this forgiveneſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Wherin the readineſs of God to forgive is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered?</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>What is implied in this Forgiveneſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>Forgiveneſs properly ſignifieth a free remiſſion of an offence, without any ſatisfaction made by the perſon ſo forgiven.</hi> For, when a man hath fully ſatisfied for the injury, he hath bought his peace, and it would be injuſtice to purſue him for it afterwards: but <hi>Forgiveneſs is an act of free favour.</hi> Now this may be conſidered either in reſpect of <hi>perſonal

wrongs</hi> between man and man, or with regard to the <hi>Tranſgreſſion of a Law,</hi> wherein there is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty due in Juſtice, and the Judge is concerned in purſuing it: and this latter beſt reſembleth the caſe of a Sinner; and in this reſpect, ſatisfaction may be given to the Law, by the procurement of the Judge, that ſo Juſtice be not perverted, and yet a free pardon may upon it be given to the Offender, who did nothing to the procuring of that ſatisfaction; and ſuch is the caſe here. This Forgiveneſs then belongs to, and is one eſſential part of Juſtification; and therefore preſumeth ſuch a ſatisfaction made, and accepted by God, upon which, and in reſpect to which, he proceedeth to paſs an act of forgiveneſs upon the perſon who before ſtood Guilty: and it properly conſiſteth in a free and full diſcharging of him from the whole Condemnation of the Law, and putting him out of the danger of it: and hath theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it.</p>

And here he diſannuls, and makes void the Sentence, in reſpect of the Sinners per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Job</hi> 33.24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By vertue of this act, the Sinner is made as free from the Condemnation of the Law, as if he had never tranſgreſſed it.</hi> Rom. 6.14. <hi>He is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from his Judge, there is no more Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Chap 8.1.33, 34.

One Sinner pardoned, though the leaſt that ever was in the world, is a Monument of Gods wonderful Grace, and proclaimeth him to be a <hi>forgiving God.</hi> One ſuch inſtance ſaith that <hi>there is forgiveneſs with him</hi>; for it muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his own voluntary inclination, who found the Sinner to be his Enemy, and might juſtly have deſtroyed him for ever.

Yet there was that which lay in the way of it, which muſt be removed, elſe there could have been no application of it; the Juſtice of God which was concerned in, and by which the Firſt Covenant was ratified, had righteouſly doomed man to dy for ſin, and the truth of God had declared that he would ſtand by his own Law; yea, and his Holineſs, by which he is bound for his own Glory, would not admit that that Covenant ſhould be baulked, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. How then ſhall the Sentence be Executed, and yet the Sinner be pardoned? There was but one way in which this could be brought about, and that was by the interpoſition of the Eternal Son of God, undertaking to be ſubſtituted in the Sinners room, and to anſwer all the demands of the Law in his ſtead, that ſo <hi>Juſtice,</hi> being ſatisfied, might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire with <hi>Mercy</hi> in the Sinners Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That he maketh offer of, and invites Sinners to accept it.</hi> He hath ordered that man be told that he hath forgiveneſs, and that they be bidden to come for it. He doth not wait till miſerable Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners cry to him for it; which yet would be a rich favour, if ſo they might find it at his hands, but becauſe they <hi>ſought it not,</hi> nor ever would have done ſo, he ſends them an <hi>Embaſſy</hi> about it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. And would he do ſo, did he not delight in pardoning?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That he offereth it freely.</hi> And if he did not do ſo, the Sinner muſt for ever go without it, for he had nothing to purchaſe it with. The Goſpel Invitations come as <hi>freely</hi> as can be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. If it be here objected; you teach that there are <hi>Goſpel Conditions</hi> on which it is only to be had; how then can it be ſaid to be free? it may readily be replied; there are no other Conditions required in the Goſpel, but what among men are required in order to receiving and being inveſted with the freeſt gift that can be: there is nothing but acceptance of this gift, and acknowledgment of the kindneſs of the beſtower; faith is the hand that receiveth it, whereas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:000965_0255_0FAE38C8642C9EC0"/>
puts it away; and is it not meet that he who would have the benefit of a gift, do accept of it? or doth ſuch acceptance derogate from the grace of the Giver? and what is our Obedience, but our thankfulneſs to God for ſo unſpeakable a gift? and ſhall any ſay the gift was not free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was thankful for it? the Sinner was <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death,</hi> and deſerved no pardon, and yet he may have it for receiving, and is not God wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>In the urgent entreaties he uſeth with men to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this forgiveneſs.</hi> He not only offers it, but pleads and is very urgent and importunate with them, as if it were a kindneſs done him to take it of him, as well as to them in their having it; he uſeth all ſorts of arguments to perſwade them by; he tells them what need they ſtand in of it, that their eternal welfare depend upon it, that they are condemned and going to Execution, and muſt need periſh, if they be not pardoned, and therefore how much they will ſtand in their own light, and be guilty of their own blood if they refuſe it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Nor is it the moving cauſe of it.</hi> Among men indeed, a tender heart is moved by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious confeſſion, and humble ſubmiſſion, and it makes us to relent, and ſhew compaſſion to a delinquent; but though ſuch affections are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed

to God, yet it is after the manner of men, and warily to be underſtood: Affections are attributed to him in regard of the Effects which flow from his fixed and unalterable will. Confeſſion is an adjunct of true Repentance, and God is the <hi>Author</hi> of that, as well as of the <hi>pardon, Acts</hi> 5.31. To be able truly to confeſs Sin is his gift.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

                  </gap>. How God treats with Infants, is beyond our deciſion, but in regard of ſuch as are of years of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and under the Goſpel, there are two things obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God requires this Confeſſion of theſe that hope to obtain forgiveneſs of him.</hi> The influence therefore of one upon the other, is only as it is the way of Divine Appointment to obtain it; the promiſe ſo runs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. And that clauſe is inſerted, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Only acknowledge, &amp;c.</hi> God will be <hi>ſought</hi> to for pardon, and there can be no asking forgiveneſs without acknowledging Guilt. Hence, though this be Gods gift as well as the other, yet it is whiles the Guilty Sinner is proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf at the foot ſtool of Mercy, taking ſhame to himſelf, that God comes and paſſeth the act of pardon upon him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17.

So we may ſafely conclude, that he who is not brought truly to confeſs hath not truly repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his ſins: and if he be ſtill an <hi>impenitent,</hi> he is certainly an <hi>unpardoned</hi> man.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>God is holy and juſt, as well as merciful.</hi> The Divine Perfections, as they are in God, are not ſeparate one from another, though to us they are diſtinctly diſcovered, becauſe we cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe entertain the notion of them: there can therefore be no claſhing among them. Now there are other <hi>Attributes</hi> beſides <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> which God hath declared in his Word, and will diſplay in his Works; there is his <hi>Juſtice</hi> as well as his <hi>Mercy</hi>; and he will have Monuments of them both, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9 22, 23. And when he doth diſplay his mercy, it ſhall be agreeable with his Juſtice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10.

What though God is wonderfully rich in mercy? May he not appear ſo for ever in others, though you be never made ſharers of it? ſhall he not be <hi>admired in them that believe,</hi> though Unbelievers periſh for ever? may not you for all this be <hi>Veſſels of Wrath,</hi> and ſo be made foils of his mercy in others? Or do you think that God will ſtain his Holineſs, that he may magnifie his <hi>Grace?</hi> Be not de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God will certainly forgive no Sinners but in his own way.</hi> Infinite Wiſdom hath contrived a way for the exalting free grace in the Salvation of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo as with it to give luſtre to his other

Though God hath a mind to ſhew compaſſion to Sinners, yet he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſigned to ſhew any favour to Sin, but in this very way to let it be ſeen how odious it is to him. If he had indulged it in any, it had been in his own Son, when he took the imputation of it on him, being immaculate in himſelf; but <hi>he ſpared not him, Rom.</hi> 8.32. And what do you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than go about to make the Holy God a patron of ſin? as if he had found out a way to Save Sinners in their ſins, and encourage them to hold on a courſe of them: What can more dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from his Glory? needs then muſt this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you to his more exaſperated Wrath; See then what he hath to ſay to ſuch as you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.22.

                  <hi>THE inſtances of Gods forgiving any upon their hearty confeſſing their ſins to him, ſhould encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others to hope for, and ſeek it of him in the ſame way.</hi> The very ſubjoyning of this to what went before, intimates this truth; if we conſider <hi>David</hi> as turning his ſpeech to God, he doth, as it were, ſay, this is the honour thou ſhalt get, by doing thus graciouſly by me; thou ſhalt have more Cuſtomers, others when they hear of it, will be animated to ſeek to thee for mercy. The great incentive to this, is from the gracious diſcoveries that God hath made of himſelf in his Word, thoſe alluring promiſes, with which he animates deſponding Sinners to ſeek him; but yet his works alſo have a voice in them, and confirm his Word, by giving an example in which his Word is verified. Here take theſe concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>That there are many eminent inſtances of Gods pardoning mercy on Scripture record.</hi> He hath ſet up the monuments of it there, who, though they had been great Sinners, and many ways provoked his juſt diſpleaſure, yet obtained mercy of him, or their humble ſubmiſſion, and hearty bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves before him; and though there be no Saint recorded in the Book of God, who was

not an example of this, but for which they had never been ſaved, yet there are ſome who have a peculiar remark for this. What a great Sinner was <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>? how wofully did <hi>David</hi> defile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? What a <hi>Chief Sinner</hi> had <hi>Paul</hi> been?

               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the Word of God gives us a diſtinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of divers of theſe.</hi> It not only mentions them to be ſuch, but mentions the Diſpenſation towards them in the circumſtances; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It tells us how they had Sinned.</hi> Not that God delights to be raking in the kennel of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens follies, when he hath <hi>cast their iniquities into the depth of the ſea,</hi> but to ſet the examples of his Grace before others; for <hi>mans ſin is the foil of Gods Grace</hi>; and the more black that hath been, the more orient do the colours of this appear to be; their ſin therefore is declared in its aggravations: ſo <hi>Davids,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.</p>

               <p n="5">5. The Leſſons that we are to learn from ſuch Examples, as theſe refer to two heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To nouriſh hope in us againſt deſpair.</hi> When upon the apprehenſion of our Sins, and the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of them, we are ready to ſink in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, we ſhould gather hope to our ſelves, by contemplating theſe, and fetching ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of hope, and they are ſuch as theſe.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>God herein exhibits his readineſs to pardon.</hi> He hath declared it fully in his word; and if we
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:000965_0280_0FAE38E4E1E5DB40"/>
will follow him in his works of this nature, we ſhall find it plain; and there is abundant force in this way of reaſoning: if God had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in pardoning Sinners, certainly thoſe that had done ſo much to provoke him to the higheſt, would never have found favour: <hi>David</hi> therefore thus pleads, <hi>Pſal</hi> 51.13. <hi>Then I will teach Tranſgreſſors thy ways, and Sinners ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to thee.</hi>

                  </gap>giveneſs hath on our praying for it? We may take this brief account of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Gods forgiveneſs is every way free to us.</hi> We cannot deſerve it by any thing of ours. It is of the very nature of a pardon, that it is free. We muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>proviſion</hi> made in the Covenant of Redemption for our being pardoned, in which we were bought, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:000965_0289_0FAE38EDDFFD1E10"/>
was made to the Juſtice of God; and the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of it to us in the Covenant of Grace, in which it is freely beſtowed, and the meer mercy of God is celebrated. Whatever Chriſt hath done to merit it for us, we our ſelves never did nor could do any thing towards the deſerving of it: So that our prayers cannot, of their own nature, oblige God to pardon us: and therefore we are, in them to confeſs our own <hi>unworthineſs</hi> of it, <hi>Luk</hi> 15.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence all the</hi> media <hi>by which we come to obtain any favour from him, are his free gift.</hi> He hath preſcribed them, as an order in which we are to come by his benefits: yet, not only the benefits themſelves, but alſo all the grace and help where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are enabled ſo to wait upon him for them is from him. He gives <hi>Repentance,</hi> as well as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, Acts</hi> 5.31. He <hi>helps us to pray,</hi> as well as pardoneth us on prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. So that his Grace doth equally appear in the one as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that though he hath made promiſes to ſuch conditions, yet he muſt give them, or we can never work them in our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>That Faith in Chriſt is the great</hi> medium <hi>by which we apprehend Gods forgiveneſs.</hi> We cannot me it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, all that we have to do, is to receive it, which is only by an hand of Faith. Hence Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to which pardon belongs is in the Goſpel reſtrained to <hi>believing, Rom.</hi> 5.1. But this hath been already inſiſted on.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That our faith muſt be acted on Chriſt for our apprehenſion of this pardon.</hi> I here diſpute not,
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:000965_0290_0FAE38EEE9124070"/>
whether the <hi>habit of Faith</hi> doth not put us in a ſafe ſtate? We are here only conſidering the order of the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Divine diſpenſation to us. As to Gods dealing with Infants, it is dark to us: We can readily conceive them Subjects as well capable of the Sanctification of the Spirit, as of natural corruption: though how they ſhould exert acts of faith and repentance, is beyond our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. But as to others, we know that the habits of Grace are infuſed for action: and to believe in Chriſt for life is an act of the Soul, proceeding from ſuch a principle, and not meerly the principle it ſelf, though it preſumes a power put into us, elſe we could not take hold on Chriſt. Now it is <hi>actual believing</hi> to which the Goſpel promiſe is made, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3 16. And therefore it is called a <hi>coming to him, Math.</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That this faith is moſt ſuitably expreſſed in Prayer.</hi> That prayer is a duty of <hi>Natural worſhip,</hi> the light of Nature, as well as the word of God, informeth us: that we ſhould can, our wants to God in Prayer, appears from the nature of it; that all our Prayers are to be made in faith, we are aſſured, becauſe ſuch Prayers only is <hi>Effectual.</hi> We muſt ask all in the Name of Chriſt; we have no other way of acceſs to God.

               <p n="1">1 <hi>Herein we teſtify our ſelf want of it.</hi> It is ſence of need that drives men to Prayer. All formalities without this feeling, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the end of Prayer is not to acquaint him with our neceſſities, for <hi>He knows them before, Math</hi> 6.8. but to affect our ſelves with them.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>We herein alſo acknowledge God to be the author of our forgiveneſs.</hi> This he expecteth of us. It was one clauſe in his Prayer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.9. <hi>To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgiveneſſes.</hi> And if we do not believe and acknowledge it to come from him, why do we ask it of him? and here is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exerciſe of faith: we believe that he can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and we believe that if ever we be forgiven, it muſt come from him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.9.

of him, than lying proſtrate at his feet, reſigning to his mercy, ſenſible of our own unworthineſs, Juſtifying him in his ſeverity againſt us, imploring him to look upon us in tender pity? and all this belongs to the very frame of a right praying to God.

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Hereby we teſtify what an high value we have for a pardon.</hi> God expects that we place a worthy eſteem on his benefits.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Godly men do often ſtand in need of new forgiveneſs.</hi> This hath already been conſidered. There is new provocation given to God by every folly that we labour of, and defile our Conſciences wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>USE II. Here we have a Rule to judge by, in what order we are towards forgiveneſs.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is a thing very deſirable to be known; and they who have ever experienced what it is to ſtand Guilty before God, will be ſollicitous after ſatisfaction in this caſe; and the Rule is, doth the apprehenſion of our Guilt and miſery ſo affect us, as to drive us to pray to God for his pardoning mercy? if ſo, we have a good hope of obtaining it of him, for Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is of God to ſpirit us to prayer</hi>: It is one character of a natural man, <hi>that he ſeeks not God, Pſal.</hi> 14.4. A ſpirit of prayer is his gift; and there is a mighty work wrought in bringing the Sinner on his knees, and make him <hi>pour out his Soul to God,</hi> in earneſt ſupplication for mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>When God brings a Sinner thus to pray, it is that he may forgive him.</hi> There is ever a gracious deſign in it. God hath made many gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to ſuch in his Word, which he cannot deny; if it were not his deſign to bring them within the compaſs of the promiſe, he would not work the condition in them; and therefore when he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that <hi>they ſhall pray,</hi> he together engageth that <hi>he will hear, Jer</hi> 29.12. <hi>There is no greater ſign of forgiveneſs then a ſpirit of prayer for it.</hi>

we find how he remarks on it, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. <hi>Behold he prayeth; q. d.</hi> Let him have been never ſo bitter a Perſecuter heretofore, yet I will have mercy on him, for he prayeth for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE III. For Exhortation and direction.</hi> Let it call upon all, whenſoever under the ſenſe of Guilt, to betake our ſelves to praye. Do we apprehend the anger of God againſt us for any ſin? let it put us upon our making our requeſts to him for the removing of it; Conſider then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If our ſin be not forgiven us, it will undo us.</hi> Think it not of little concernment whether our ſin be pardoned or no: there needs no more but the Guilt of one unpardoned ſin to ſink you down into the pit of endleſs miſeries: that one will condemn you, and there will be no hopes of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping the Wrath of God: there is a ſentence of death upon every ſin, which muſt be taken off, or you cannot eſcape.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>You must pray for this if ever you obtain it.</hi> God ſtands on his honour in this regard: he will have Sinners to know that it is his <hi>Prerogative</hi> to forgive ſin, and will have their petition offered him in order thereto; he will elſe look upon them as obſtinate Sinners, and ſuch as deſpiſe his mercy; and if the Sinner hath deſerved to dy,, and hath his life offered him if he will ſupplicate for it, and he will not do that, he will provoke God to ſhew him no mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God is a prayer hearing God, &amp; therefore there is hope in this way.</hi> Thus the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> pleads, <hi>Pſal.</hi>

65.2. <hi>Oh thou that heareſt Prayer</hi>; he delighteth to hear the cries of diſtreſſed Souls, that feel their woful miſery, and have none to help them, and do therefore betake themſelves to him, as a <hi>God of Salvations: He delights in mercy,</hi> and therefore hearkens if there be any miſerable Sinner that will apply himſelf to him for it, that he may ſhew it him.

If when we are burdened with the Guilt of Sin, we humbly addreſs him for pardon, and he applies the promiſe, and helps us to take hold on it, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth within us his accepting us, we conclude that we have found him: and ſo in every other reſpect in which his Children call upon him. It is he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who comes in by his Spirit to the Soul, and leaveth thoſe things there which teſtify his preſence: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34 4. <hi>I ſought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>For the evidence, that he may be found.</hi> Sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath made an infinite diſtance between God and Sinners, and hath provoked him to hide from them. Every natural man is a loſt Creature, hath loſt his God, and his happineſs, and knoweth not where to find him, but wandereth in a Wilderneſs where there is no way. But for all this, ſuch is Gods rich Grace, that he hath diſcovered himſelf in the Goſpel, ſo as that he may be found again by the loſt Creature; and theſe things will evidence it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He invites men to ſeek him.</hi> This precious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is given to all where the Goſpel cometh. He would not have men to ſeek their help elſe where, but enquire after him. He gives them this call, while <hi>they are wandring from mountain to hill, ſeeking reſt, and finding none.</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.11.22.19. Now God would not invite men to ſeek him, if there were no hope that they might find him; he doth not delude them, but point them to a way of ſafety.</p>

And he who hath promiſed is faithful and will perform, and they that adventure on his word, ſhall never ſee cauſe to repent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He hath made a way for his being found by Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men.</hi> And there is nothing wherein God hath equally celebrated his goodneſs to man, as in this; that when Sin had ſhut us out of his preſence, and raiſed <hi>Mountains</hi> between him and us, he hath been at the coſt to remove them, and make a <hi>New and Living way</hi> for us to find him. For this it was that Chriſt came into the World, and made the Atonement with his own Blood, that he might <hi>pull down the wall of ſeparation</hi>: And now he tells us that <hi>he is the way, Joh.</hi> 14.6. And ſo there is <hi>a new way Conſecrated, Heb</hi> 10.20. This God would not have done, if he had not deſigned that ſome of the loſt race ſhould find him in it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He hath given us directions how we may find this way, and him in it.</hi> All the Goſpel Precepts are adapted to this end. As there could have been no way, if he had not opened it, ſo we could never have known it, if he had not ſhown it us, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8. And his Spirit is ſent to influence and guide us into it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.21. The preceptive part of the Goſpel is purpoſely given for our direction in this affair.</p>

                  <pb n="305" facs="unknown:000965_0304_0FAE3764E25F8B98"/>5. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt came to</hi> ſeek loſt Sinners, <hi>and bring them into this way</hi>; he himſelf tells us ſo, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.10. True, he had a further deſign in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, <hi>viz</hi> to make this way, by his <hi>Prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>; but yet in his <hi>Prophetical</hi> and <hi>Kingly</hi> he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth this deſign: for having <hi>purchaſed to himſelf a Church</hi> in the world, he ſends forth his Spirit to gather them to himſelf; he <hi>ſeeks them up</hi> in their loſt eſtate, and <hi>finds them,</hi> and ſo they find him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the ground of this, or how it comes to paſs, that he is willing to be found, let theſe things be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God hath purpoſed the glory of his Grace in the Salvation of Sinners.</hi> Hence ſome are ſaid to be, <hi>Choſen in Chriſt</hi> to this very end, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3.6. The foundation of all this is laid in his good will: it was becauſe he had a mind that this letter in his name ſhould be made legible, and celebrated throughout Eternal Ages.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That mans happineſs conſiſts in his ſeeing and enjoying of God.</hi> There is no other object is ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate for him: ſhould he enjoy all the goodneſs of the whole Creation, ſeparate from the favour and love of God, it would not make him better than miſerable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.27. He only is a <hi>portion</hi> that can ſatisfy the cravings of an immortal Soul; and if the man be happy, he muſt <hi>know him, Joh.</hi> 17.3. and he muſt have him to be his <hi>portion, Lam.</hi> 3.24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That man by Sin hath lost God.</hi> This is the unhappy effect of the Apoſtaſy, and is the fruit
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:000965_0305_0FAE3765A324BFF8"/>
of ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. Man was at firſt made near to God, but as ſoon as ſin came in, it ſet him at a vaſt diſtance; ſo that now he knows him not, but is a ſtranger to him; hath loſt all title to him as his God, and is become his enemy, and ſo is made miſerable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That fallen man muſt find God again, if ever he enjoy him. Viſion</hi> and <hi>Fruition</hi> go together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mans miſery is that he hath left him, his only happineſs is in finding him.

Till we ſo do, we remain in the forlorn ſtate which Sin hath caſt us into; <hi>That man that doth not find his God again, is undone for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>For this end God exhibits himſelf to man, as the object whom they are to ſeek.</hi> God hath made our ſeeking of him a <hi>medium</hi> in order to our finding him. Not but that he ſeeks us firſt by his <hi>prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace,</hi> yet in order to his diſcovering himſelf graciouſly to us, he makes us to exert this Grace, in asking after him. Hence in the Goſpel Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation theſe two are connected together, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE I. Why then do men ſit ſtill and live contentedly without him?</hi> Let this rouſe up Sinners to enquire after him; to ſeek him, that they may find him; for motive, Conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>You are ſtrangers to him in your natural ſtate.</hi> This is the condition of all men, as they derive from, and ſtand related to the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> Your condition is laid out, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. The relation you may pretend that you have to God by vertue

               <p n="2">2. <hi>You are undone without him.</hi> You muſt have him to be your God, or you periſh; as content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly as you live without him for the preſent, there is a time coming when you will be made to know, that there is no happineſs but in the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, all thoſe things whereon you now truſt, will ſhortly fail you, and if you have not a God to uphold you, you ſink into remedileſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; <hi>without God,</hi> and <hi>without hope, Eph.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He is willing to be found by you.</hi> Whence is it that he makes ſuch diſcoveries of himſelf to you in the Goſpel? that he cometh ſo near you in the means of Grace? that he ſo diſplays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the face of Chriſt? Surely all the Meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are ſent you from Sabbath to Sabbath, are to let you underſtand how ready he is to be found, why elſe doth he bid you <hi>look to him and be ſaved, Iſa</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>He now expects that you ſhould ſeek him.</hi> He hath not forbidden you, nor driven you away, but he requires it: this trouble he brings you to, is to make you feel your neceſſity; it is one way in which he is wont to fetch home his <hi>loſt ſheep, that are gone aſtray,</hi> ſo he did <hi>David, Peter, &amp;c.</hi>

refuge in him, who only can ſecure them: He would have none that know their ſins, and feel their miſery to deſpond, becauſe ſuch are nextly called to look after him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He hath provided ſufficient to remove all the cauſes of diſtance between him and you.</hi> Let your Guilt be never ſo aggravated, yet in the compleat Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, there is abundant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made, which cannot be out done by our ſins: <hi>He can ſave to the uttermoſt, Heb.</hi> 7.25.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And he will herein advance the glory of his Grace.</hi> How often doth he take an opportunity thus to do? he hath purpoſed <hi>to be admired in them that believe,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. And in this way will he promote that admiration; reſolve then to ſeek his face, <hi>for the health of his countenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conclu. 2. <hi>That the opportunity of thus finding God is limited to time.</hi> There are two ages of man, or a double ſtate to which he is appointed, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to duration, <hi>viz Time</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi>; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer whereof is limited, the latter boundleſs; the one will quickly come to an end, the other never; and where the former ends, the other begins. <hi>Time,</hi> in the general notion of it, <hi>is the boundary of the Creatures duration</hi>: and this may be conſidered generally with reſpect to the world, and ſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the firſt moment of the Creation, and ſhall laſt till the conſummation of all things, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Day of Judgment; and all this while God will be to be found by ſome: there will be a Day of <hi>Grace,</hi> the <hi>Mediators Kingdom,</hi> in which a
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:000965_0309_0FAE376AFA4ACE48"/>
treaty of Reconciliation is held up with man, will continue till the end: for it is with regard to the <hi>Elect</hi> that the World is continued, but when that ends, this will end with it; that will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the everlaſting ſtate of all men unchangeably. But then there is a more particular conſideration of time, as it reſpecteth the ſeveral Creatures which are the Subjects of it: and thus every Creature in the lower world hath its own time, or the bounds of its duration, which begins with its exiſtence, and ends with its diſſolution; thus <hi>David, Pſal</hi> 31.15. <hi>My times are in thine hand.</hi> Only this difference is to be obſerved between man, and other ſublunary beings, that when their time ends, and they are diſſolved, their exiſtence ceaſeth for ever, being reſolved into their firſt principles, never to return to their firſt individual being: Whereas man, when by his diſſolution he ceaſeth to be a Son of time, but enters upon his Eternity, in which he is to exiſt for ever: and though for a while his body muſt be reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to duſt, yet it ſhall return again by a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> to its particular exiſtence; the Soul in the mean while retaining its eſſence, faculties, &amp; activity. Now every mans particular time is the <hi>ſpot that lieth between his birth and his death</hi>; it begins with his coming into the World, and laſts till he goeth off the Stage, and there it ends; this is that to which his <hi>oppurtunity</hi> of ſeeking and finding God is <hi>limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> I do not ſay that it ſhall laſt ſo long with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, but I am aſſured that it ſhall extend no further. When once this glaſs is run it ſhall be
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:000965_0310_0FAE376D549B8B10"/>
turned no more. For the Demonſtration of this, take theſe Concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is arbitrary with God whether ever be will be found by ſinful man or no</hi> Man in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſy went away from God, <hi>bad him depart,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred other Objects before him, and renounced communion with him; how juſtly might God upon this have rejected him for ever, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he ſhould never more obtain his favour? He hath no dependance on his Creature; if he had ſaid they ſhall never ſee my face again for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he had offered them no injury at all. He therefore in this acts his Soveraignty: and it therein eminently appears, in that he thus mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth himſelf when, where, and to whom he pleaſeth; the greateſt number of mankind are groping in the dark, ſeeking an object in which to find their happineſs, and God doth not ſhew himſelf to them, than whom, they to whom he doth thus appear, are nothing better; ſo that his meer good pleaſure is herein diſplayed; hence that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25, 26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence it is at his liberty to fix the terms on which he will be found by them.</hi> If the thing it ſelf be at his liberty, he muſt needs then have the power of preſcribing. Man is a Rebel and an Out law; if God will purſue him to death, and deſtroy him, he doth him no wrong: and if he will indulge him with a treaty of reconciliation, it is at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to make the <hi>Articles</hi> of it. Now among the other terms of the treaty this is one, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſtating of the time wherein men may come in
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:000965_0311_0FAE376E8D29CBF8"/>
and find him. A Prince that proclaimeth peace to his Rebellious Subjects, may limit the day, and proclaim, that if they come in by ſuch a day, and ſue for it, they ſhall have it; but if they take not that opportunity, there ſhall be no hope; and it is a very high favour that ſuch an offer as this, though thus bounded, ſhould be ever made to any of the race of ſinful men.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>That except God reveals himſelf unto men, they may ſeek, but they ſhall not find him.</hi> There is ſuch a thing as this, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.28. And there is great reaſon for it. God indeed hath made our ſeeking of him, the way to our finding him, &amp; made a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſe that <hi>they who truly ſeek him ſhall find him</hi>; but it is a promiſe of Grace, and indeed the reaſon why any do ſeek &amp; not find him, is becauſe they do not ſeek him as they ought. However, God manifeſteth himſelf arbitrarily to men: we may be in the outward uſe of all the means of grace, and yet miſs him, &amp; never meet him there: and it will be ſo, unleſs he pleaſe to come and manifeſt himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That unleſs God giveth them his Spirit &amp; Grace, they will never ſeek him ſo as to find him.</hi> There is a <hi>ſo ſeeking him,</hi> as is ever crowned with ſucceſs, and brings us into his preſence, ſuch as that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.13. All other is either <hi>hypocritical</hi> or <hi>legal,</hi> which is not acceptable to God. Now if any of the Children of men ſo ſeek him, they muſt have the grace from him ſo to do; it is a work of his Spirit, and till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e <hi>give them a new heart,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo do: there muſt be his <hi>drawing,</hi> if ever there be their <hi>following.</hi> Now the drawing of
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:000965_0312_0FAE376EA5934EF8"/>
the Spirit is at his pleaſure: if he ſee meet to withold this grace from men, they will never ſo ſeek him, notwithſtanding all the calls and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and warnings that can be given them; and he hath no neceſſity lying upon him to beſtow this on them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>There are certain means in and with which God reveals himſelf to men, ſo as they may find him.</hi> As God is to be found, ſo there is a way for it. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men that live without the Goſpel, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find him in that condition; the meer <hi>light of nature</hi> will never lead any of mankind to God, or bring them to communion with him again: had not this been manifeſted in the Goſpel, it had never been known, and man muſt have wandred in an endleſs maze of error, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. And it is in and with this Goſpel that God is pleaſed to ſhew himſelf to the Souls of men, and therefore by ſerious attendance thereon they are to ſeek him. Where therefore theſe means are either not beſtowed, or are taken from men, or they from them, now the opportunity muſt needs ceaſe with them.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to make it appear, that if ever we find God, it muſt be during the time of our life in this world; and from the premiſes there are theſe evidences for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That God hath in his Word, limited the day of Grace to this life.</hi> The Word of God is that by which we are to acquaint our ſelves with his will; and there we are aſſured that <hi>the day of Grace is limited.</hi> When our Text ſaith, <hi>they ſhall pray in a

Nay the Scripture hath expreſly limited the time to this life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.18. And elſewhere; which intimate, that the time of Glorifying God by making our peace with him, will then be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; or that the work of providing for eternity will then be at an end; and this is the force of the wiſe mans argument, when he urgeth the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding the preſent ſeaſon of life, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9 10. <hi>There is no work, nor wiſdom, nor device, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the grave whither thou goeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the means and offers of Grace are only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded men during the time of this life.</hi> Whiles God is to be found, he affords men advantages of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and theſe are the Goſpel &amp; Ordinances, in which his Spirit is wont to come and ſtrive. As long as he continueth theſe, and cometh in and with them to the hearts of men, they have a fair opportunity for finding him: but when theſe are withdrawn and gone, he goeth with them; and it is certain that men enjoy theſe only in this life. Whether ſo long, is arbitrary, but longer they ſhall not. What ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt?

with them would be over; but while they enjoy theſe priviledges, they may be taken by them: God may ſtill ſend a word, which may ſtop them in their wicked and vain courſes, and rouſe them up to ſeek after him; though they have deſpiſed offered mercy, God can be too hard for them, and melt them.</p>

                  <hi>USE IV. Let this be to prevent deſpair in ſuch who fear they have outlived their time.</hi> God righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſuffers ſome to be hurried by this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and Satan takes advantage by it: they are under awakening terrours; they have had a long day of Grace, many calls, ſerious counſels, loud cries, potent ſtrivings of the Spirit; but they have withſtood, and refuſed to ſeek God; and now there is no more hope for them; their day is done, finding time is over with them: To ſuch let me offer theſe conſiderations; after I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that it is a dangerous thing for any to run the adventure of ſuch a preſumption. It is a wonder of grace that ever God ſhould make an offer of grace to ſuch as have deſpiſed ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand counſels, and warnings, and are now grown

old in ſin: and ſuch had need be very ſpeedy, and deeply humbled for all the affronts given to God. Yet let me ſay to ſuch.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>You are yet in the place where there is room for repentance and forgiveneſs.</hi> You are not in the pit from which there is no Redemption; if you were there, you were gone for ever; but you are alive ſtill, and within the compaſs of a treaty; you are there where proclamation is made, that if you ſeek God with all your heart, you ſhall find him. God hath no where ſaid that he will not give you the grace to ſeek him, or that you ſhall not find him if you ſo do. <hi>Secret things belong to God</hi>; but the offer of this Grace is to be made to you; and though it be admirable, yet God hath bidden ſuch a proclamation to be publiſhed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. And I am ſure that he can break your hard hearts, and give you repentance; and if he do, there is no doubt of the good ſucceſs of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>You are yet ſtriven with, and called upon.</hi> God indeed ſpeaks of a ceſſation of his Spirit ſtriving with obſtinate Sinners, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. And there are the awful inſtances of it; but the caſe is otherwiſe with you. If the means of grace are influenced ſo as to rouſe and awaken you out of your ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and make you feel your miſery, and be afraid by reaſon of it: if he preſents your ſins to you in their aggravations, and makes them evil and bitter to you, this is a work of his Spirit, and ſaith that he ſtrives ſtill; and whiles he ſtrives, there is hope that he may be found.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence theſe fears and terrours are not to drive

               <p>Conclu. 3. <hi>That there are ſpecial ſeaſons wherein God is to be found by thoſe that ſeek him.</hi> A finding time, not only intends that it muſt be done in time; but that there is a diviſion of time into that wherein God is to be found; and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is not to be found.

                  </hi> 13.46. Now, there are ſome awful ſymptoms of this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That there are ſome ſeaſons wherein there is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advantage to ſeek &amp; find God, than in other.</hi> The word, <hi>Time,</hi> in our <hi>Text,</hi> ſignifyeth an <hi>Opportunity,</hi> it intimates a fit ſeaſon. A work may be done

while there is time, but it is beſt and more readily done at ſome times. We are told that ſometimes God is near, and that it is beſt then to <hi>Call upon him, Iſa.</hi> 55.6. intimating that he may be far off, and then it will be more difficult. There are times when he is within call, and will anſwer at firſt; and times when we may call again &amp; again, before we have an anſwer from him. Here,</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What are thoſe ſeaſons wherein we are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly advantaged for the ſeeking and finding of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There are four ſeaſons more eſpecially for this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The time of Youth is a ſpecial ſeaſon for this.</hi> Young perſons put off, and think hereafter is ſoon enough; but it is their great folly, there is no ſuch ſeaſon for ſeeking, and making out after Chriſt as this. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God earneſtly calls upon ſuch to ſeek him.</hi> He doth, as it were, ſingle out ſuch, and the offer is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly made to them: the Spirit of God ſpeaks emphatically to ſuch; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.11. <hi>Come ye Children, &amp;c.</hi> Wiſdom calls them, as it were, by name, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.1.5.7.8.32. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.1. which tells us how fain God would have young ones to begin early, and how loth he is that they ſhould ſpend their firſt time in vanity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God hath testifyed how well pleaſed he is, when ſuch ſeek him.</hi> The entertainment he gives them, is a teſtimony how acceptable it is to him. What reſpect did he ſhew to young <hi>Abel? Gen.</hi> 4.4. How wonderfully did he reveal himſelf to young <hi>Samuel,</hi> who was devoted to him from his Infancy? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="unknown:000965_0331_0FAE38579949B588"/>
3.1. with <hi>verſe</hi> 19; 21. What an eminent inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reformation did he make of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who began young? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.3. And what a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony did he give to a good Child of a wicked father, when dying? 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.12, 13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Young ones have not ſo reſiſted him as others have done.</hi> Children have Original Sin in them, as ſoon as they live, and begin to diſcover it as ſoon as they are capable: but God hath taken the Children of his Servants into Covenant with him, and they have not ſo notoriouſly rejected his Covenant as thoſe have done, who withſtood him in youth, and addicted themſelves to follow folly and vanity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Their hearts are uſually more tender and eaſy to be wrought upon.</hi> Not but that natural hardneſs born with us requires Gods Almighty power to take it away, in the tendereſt Child that is. But there is a contracted obſtinacy, which grows on perſons by cuſtom, which Children do not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrive at; but are more tractible, readier to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the impreſſions of Counſels given them. And this is the reaſon why we are bidden to begin early with them in, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>They have many advantages now which they will not have afterwards.</hi> With ſuch arguments the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God pleads with young ones to husband their youth well, <hi>Eccl</hi> 12. <hi>begin</hi> There will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny encumbrances of life afterward, which now burthen them not: and when old age ſiezeth them, it will greatly unfit them for it, who did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in it before.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="333" facs="unknown:000965_0332_0FAE3858054409A8"/>2. <hi>Whiles the Goſpel is diſpenſed to them powerfully, and faithfully.</hi> This is another ſpecial ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Here obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Goſpel Miniſtry and Ordinances, are the ordinary inſtruments by which God Converteth Sinners.</hi> He hath ſeen meet to make this the appointed way of promoving the Salvation of men. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. Where he ſendeth not theſe, it is an awful ſign that he hath none of this work to do there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That they are the Goſpel truths, by the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof he uſeth them as instruments.</hi> They are moral inſtruments, and therefore their buſineſs is to treat with men: and the matter of the treaty is, theſe great truths that declare the Counſel of God, and the way wherein Sinners may come to enjoy him, in and through Jeſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence the faithful diſpenſation of theſe truths is that which gives men all the advantage to ſeek and find God.</hi> Their work is an Embaſſy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. And the buſineſs is Reconciliation; which is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by opening the terms, and urging of them ſuitably. If then they are faithful, and do ſeriouſly, and ſolemnly purſue this deſign, there is all that can be expected of inſtruments by way of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and excitation. Legal Preaching ſufficeth not for this, but Preaching Chriſt, and the way of Peace by him: and the more there is of this, the more is the advantage of ſuch a people.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Hence when theſe fail, this advantage is greatly impeded.</hi> If then the Goſpel is no longer Preached among a people, it is a Judgment, and a ſign of his

To ſee an old Sinner go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Eternity without any thoughtfulneſs, is a tremendous ſight, but to hear ſuch an one drying out of his miſerable loſs of time, and the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſe he hath led, falling down before God, and giving him glory, is an encouragement: for if <hi>God give repentance,</hi> he will <hi>give remiſſion</hi>; and there are ſome who are <hi>born out of time,</hi> to be the monuments of the admirable patience and grace of God.

and the neglect of ſo doing is an affront put upon the Spirit.

                  <hi>USE IV. This truth affords a loud cry to old Sinners to make haſte.</hi> Such as have hitherto lived under Goſpel means, ſtrangers to God, at a diſtance from him; have had many invitations and withſtood them. God came in their youth, and beſpake them, but they regarded him not; and ſince he hath addreſſed them many a time,
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:000965_0355_0FAE386F26D573B8"/>
but nothing hath moved them: as they grew in years, they grew more vile; yoked themſelves with vain companions, neglected reading the Word and praying to God, addicted themſelves to drinking and gaming, and other lewd courſes: they have been often told of it, have ſeen their aſſociates hurried out of the world by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and God hath viſited them alſo with afflictions, but they ſtill go on: and now the bloſſoms of the grave are on their heads? Let me beſeech ſuch to beware that they deſpiſe not this advice. To quicken you, Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>You have had a long day of Grace, and muſt anſwer for it all.</hi> Though you have forgotten, God hath not: <hi>Your ſins are written with a pen of iron, &amp; the point of a diamond.</hi> All the endeavours that have been uſed with you are upon record; God hath them in his book, &amp; there is a day of reckoning when he will <hi>ſet them in order before you</hi>: and how terrible muſt it be? when you ſhall be called to a very uncomfortable repetition, and told of every Sabbath you profaned, every Sermon you regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, every check of conſcience you ſtifled, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mock you made at the ſolemn warnings gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you, every neglected purpoſe, forgotten or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated promiſe; every vain meeting with your accomplices in ſin, every curſed drinking bout you had, where you ſcoffed at Godlineſs, and hardened one another in ſin: the time when, the place where, and every other circumſtance: your memories refreſhed, and conſcience made to do its office. Would you prevent this fearful reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning? Now ſeek God.</p>

                  <pb n="357" facs="unknown:000965_0356_0FAE387062A66C20"/>2. <hi>Your ſeaſon is certainly almoſt over.</hi> It may be ſo with the youngeſt Sinner, but it is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſo with you. Young ones may feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up with fond hopes by reaſon of youth, health and vigour; but you have every thing put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you in mind, that <hi>the Graves are ready for you, where there will be no working.</hi> Not only is your beſt ſeaſon gone, but your whole ſeaſon is on the turning point: you are juſt leaping into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; you are ready to ſhake hands with time, and to have done with it for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>You are not yet out of hope.</hi> You have yet one offer of a treaty left you, <hi>before you go to the Dead:</hi> and though you have grievouſly provoked God to forſake you, he is yet gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Chriſt's Blood hath vertue enough in it to expiate the guilt of all your ſins; his ſpirit wants not for power to break your hard hearts, and give you repentance: and after ſo many thouſand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials, he again accoſts you; and know it, that if after this call you periſh, it will be a witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, and aggravate your Guilt in the Great Day.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>You have a great work to do, and but little time to do it in.</hi> If ever you hope to find God propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, <hi>you muſt break off your ſins by Repentance,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake your evil ways, relinquiſh your curſed compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; turn to God, believe in Jeſus Chriſt, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy your luſts, and endeavour the <hi>perfecting of holineſs.</hi> You muſt <hi>give glory to God, before your feet ſtumble on the dark mountains</hi>; and how ſhort a time have you for this? yet deſpair not: it may be done by Gods

               <p n="5">5. <hi>A little more delay will be your utter undoing.</hi> It is not for you to ſay, go away and come to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: a few moments more, and your caſe will be determined unrepealably. You will never have an offer of Grace more, when gone to the Grave, and you are upon the brink of it: the treaty will be over, the day of Grace finiſhed, God forever departed, your Souls laid up in the <hi>Priſon from whence there is no delivery:</hi> and then you will <hi>mourn</hi> bitterly, and ſay, <hi>Oh! that I had hearkned to Counſel, and received Inſtruction</hi>! Come then juſt now; forſake your lies, and betake your ſelves to him this moment: if ſo, all ſhall be well; if you will not, God knows whether ever you ſhall have ſuch another invitation made to you, before you drop into everlaſting burnings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. I ſhould now have proceeded to the Second Propoſition in the Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That if we would ſpeed in our Prayers to God for forgiveneſs, we muſt take this time to ſeek it in.</hi> But this hath ſuperſeded in the Diſcourſe on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. That we all ſtand in need of dayly forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath been before evidenced; and that if we hope to obtain it, we muſt ſeek it of God in the way of Prayer. It is not then a matter of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency when we ſo addreſs him; but we muſt take the finding time to do it in. There are three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions which reſult from the premiſes, which give us the confirmation of this Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is vain for any to pray for forgiveneſs
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:000965_0358_0FAE3871606C2008"/>
after this life, who did not ſeek and obtain it in this life.</hi> If this be the only finding time, needs muſt it be ſo: it is now that <hi>God and we are in the way,</hi> which our Saviour aſſures us is the proper time for us to <hi>agree with him</hi> in, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.58, 59. We are given to underſtand that there will be ſome who will at laſt be importunate for admittance &amp; acceptance, but all in vain, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.25, 26, 27. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is now ready to hear prayers, will then have no ear to lend to them, nor be any whit moved by loud entreaties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Sinners may, in this life, put God off ſo long, till he reſolves to have nothing more to do with them in way of ſpecial favour.</hi> It is a truth, that <hi>at what time a ſinner truly turns, God will ſhew him mercy</hi>; but yet men may ſin themſelves into deſertion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliction, ſo that <hi>God will not give them repentance,</hi> and if ſo, he will not afford them forgiveneſs; for they are inſeparable, <hi>Acts</hi> 5 31. And yet there may be ſuch horrours and remorces, as will make them to cry fearfully for pardon; but they ſhall not be heard; hence ſuch warning, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.28. And that reaſon, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That Gods own Children may, by miſſing the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, pray a long time before God will let them know that he hears them.</hi> God makes them tarry long before he pours the balm of comfort into their Souls. Hence their complaints, that they are not heard though they cry, that they ſeek, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find him; and their Sins mean while oppreſs, and almoſt ſink them; ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.9, 10.38. <hi>begin.</hi> If when a Child of God hath been trepan'd into
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:000965_0359_0FAE38744CFF3988"/>
any ſin, he preſently reſents it with Godly ſorrow, and maketh haſt to the throne of Grace, humbling himſelf, and imploring forgiveneſs; how readily will he be accepted? whereas, how often are we remorceleſs, ſtupid, ſeek to cover our ſins, and keep ſilence; and ſo ſuffer our wounds to feſter, and <hi>grow corrupt?</hi> Now we begin to deſpond, and are afraid to come to God, and ſo ſtill hide: this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh him, and he will make us to know our folly, and accordingly to wait a great while before he will give us an anſwer of peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE. Let then the conſideration of this be for our admonition.</hi> Let us be rouſed hereby to take heed to our ſelves, how we dally in this affair. Let us not only ſeek God, but ſeek him early; that is the way to find him quickly. Let Sinners do it, and let ſinning Saints do it. And for our quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, let us call to remembrance, and be affected with all the conſiderations urged under the former Concluſion: It is the way to prevent, not only the hazard of never being forgiven, but the danger of being left under long darkneſs and diſtreſs, roaring out of our wounds, and finding no eaſe.</p>
               <p>But I paſs to the next thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have the priviledge of all ſuch as pray for forgiveneſs in a finding time: <hi>Surely in the floods of great waters they ſhall not come nigh unto him.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of Publick Calamities, and their relation to them: Obſerve two things,</p>

               <p n="2">2. They may not only ſee the common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:000965_0364_0FAE3878638C3840"/>
but ſmart by it, and that righteouſly: and there are two reaſons for this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They are members of that body against which God hath a Controverſy.</hi> That there is an external Diſpenſation of Gods Covenant, in treating with the body of a profeſſing people <hi>collectively,</hi> is a great truth: on which account the whole are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as one, and Gods <hi>Temporary Providences</hi> are accommodated to them as ſo: thus ſometimes the ſin of <hi>one</hi> may bring Gods Judgments on the <hi>whole Congregation, Joſh.</hi> 22.20. eſpecially when that one mans ſins are influential to debauch a whole people, as 2 King. 23.26, 27. compare, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.11. And when good men ſuffer on this account, it is their infelicity in ſome regard, but <hi>there is no unrighteouſneſs with God,</hi> nor may they charge iniquity on him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Their very ſins which they have repented of, and have obtained forgiveneſs for, may have given occaſion for thoſe publick calamities.</hi> Such was <hi>Davids num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the people,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. <hi>begin. Iſrael</hi> indeed had provoked Gods anger; however this act of <hi>Davids</hi> was introductory to the fearful <hi>Plague</hi> that followed; and yet he repented before the plague came, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. Nay, the Sins of Gods Children may defile a Land, and though they repent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, yet publick Guilt remains, as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Caſe: <hi>David</hi> therefore takes it to himſelf, and deprecates it from the people, in <hi>verſe</hi> 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect to the perſonal afflictions they meet with and thoſe very awful, after they are forgiven.</hi> And the conſiſtency of this with the Covenant promiſe
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:000965_0365_0FAE3878E0222688"/>
and fidelity may be conſidered: and here,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Negatively: <hi>Theſe afflictions are not properly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> puniſhments of thoſe Sins.</hi> If we take puniſhment for the execution of <hi>Vindictive Juſtice,</hi> this is not to be attributed to that: we muſt beware of their diſtinction, who ſay God forgives the Guilt, but not the puniſhment: Guilt is nothing elſe but an obligation to ſuffer puniſhment, and if the Guilt be remitted, that obligation is taken off: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing legal on this account. God doth not ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as a Judge to condemn them, for he hath already paſt an act of Grace upon them in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Poſitively; <hi>God in all this hath an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p n="1">1. <hi>God in the New Covenant hath declared that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>God uſually prepares his Children for this Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by bringing them to his foot, on which forgiveneſs follows.</hi> This is not that they ſhould eſcape the rod, but be fitted for it. A wiſe father firſt reaſons with his Child, ſheweth him his folly, makes him to ſee his deſert, and this puts him upon asking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs;
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:000965_0366_0FAE387DAC50A678"/>
and the ſame love that pardons his ſin, makes him ſmart for it, becauſe his wiſdom ſees it is moſt convenient; thus 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12 14, 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence God doth it for their Spiritual advantage. Heb.</hi> 12.9, 10. That ſin needs, not only to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, but to be mortified in them: the furtherance of their holineſs calls for this diſpenſation; thus they come to ſee more of the bitterneſs of their ſin, and be made the more watchful againſt it. <hi>David</hi> on this ſcore acknowledgeth the goodneſs of his affliction, and Gods faithfulneſs in inflicting of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.71, 75.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>God doth it for the vindication of the honour of his own Name.</hi> There is a reproach they often bring upon the Name of God, and the Religion they profeſs: the world hath been ſcandalized by ſuch ſins; and when God thus deals with them, mens mouths are ſtopt, they cannot ſay that he can allow any abominations in his own Children, hence that, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Yea he may exerciſe his people, after he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given them, for their tryal.</hi> He may exerciſe their Graces, and make proof of them, and ſo make them more fearful of ſinning, and enable them to bring forth much more fruit to his praiſe. See, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6, 7. Now all theſe things are not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to, but included in the Covenant.</p>

If his Children, whom God loves with a fathers love, may be entertained with ſuch Providences, and that although they have humbled themſelves, ſought mercy, and obtained pardon, hard hearted and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Sinners, who will not ſeek God, nor fall down before him, but go on in their Tranſgreſſions, may well expect him to fall upon them in his greateſt fury, and deſtroy them for ever from his preſence.

               <p>
                  <hi>USE. II. Let it be to caution the Children of God against miſ judging about this affair.</hi> Poſſibly you have fallen into ſome ſin, &amp; your hearts have ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you, you have been humbled, confeſſed, ſought earneſtly to be forgiven for Chriſt ſake, and had ſome inward witneſs that your prayer hath been heard: but now you meet with floods of affliction and temptation; and are particularly tempted on this to queſtion your being forgiven: but ſuffer not this Temptation to remove you from many good evidences; and that on a double account,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let it not make you to call your ſtate of forgiveneſs in doubt.</hi> Such Providences indeed call us to try our ſelves, but not to entertain ſinful doubts: ſay not that your perſons are not Juſtified, you

will ſo condemn <hi>David,</hi> and other of Gods preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Saints.</hi> Your ſtate may be good, and yet God angry at you, and there may be ſins not act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually forgiven: Juſtified perſons may be under Gods diſpleaſure, and need new forgiveneſs: if once you were Juſtified, that remains: you can never fall out of the Grace of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Neither let it make you to conclude that this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sin is not forgiven.</hi> You are ready to ſay, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God is angry, elſe he would not follow me with ſuch afflictions, &amp; if he had forgiven me, this <hi>anger had been turned away, and he pacified to me</hi>; herein you argue on a miſtaken principle. God doth not always afflict in anger: he is angry at his own, ſo long as they ly under ſin unrepented of; but he can adminiſter correction in <hi>love, Heb.</hi> 12.6. And though there be an anger of love in ſome Corrections, yet there is a Chaſtiſement which is without anger at us, in meer pitty, wiſdom, and tenderneſs toward his Children.</p>

Let us take heed of raſh judging of Gods people on this account.</hi> It may be we have known them to fall into ſome ſins, that have been ſcandalous, or we hear them complain of ſome ſins that diſtreſs them, we have ſeen their ſorrow and bitterneſs, and the moſt ſatisfying teſtimonies of their Repentance; but for all God follows them with remarkable grievous afflictions; and we are ready to think, God is ſtill angry; ſomething ſtands out againſt them, they have diſſembled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But let us take heed of this: <hi>Gods Judgments

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence if God be angry, he hath reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Calamity will reach him.</hi> Such an one may look to be diſtreſſed by the <hi>Judgments</hi> that are <hi>abroad</hi>; he cannot but know that he hath a deep hand in procuring them; the more God hath done for any, the more unreaſonable it is that they ſhould offend him; and therefore ſuch may look to ſmart for it, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>You only, &amp;c.</hi> Beſides, we know that temporary afflictions belong to the <hi>rods</hi> that God is wont to correct his wanton Children withal, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.32.

                  <hi>THey that have made God their hiding place, may and ought believingly to depend upon him to preſerve them from trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may here enquire,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What is the preſervation from trouble, which God as an hiding place affords to his people?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We have already obſerved, how God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his people in floods of great waters, from <hi>v.</hi> 6. All of which is applicable hither, this therefore may be very briefly paſt over. God then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his people from trouble, when he doth any way ſave them from harm by, and makes them
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:000965_0392_0FAE3896E08E4A20"/>
to get the benefit of their troubles. There are many ways in which he doth thus, and he reſerves to himſelf a liberty to diſplay his wiſdom, love and power herein. And here;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He ſometimes ſaves them from the trouble it ſelf.</hi> It looks in the order of ſecond cauſes, as if it would come; the Cloud riſeth, and looks black and tempeſtuous, and is juſt ready to pour down a ſtorm upon them, but God cauſeth a contrary wind to riſe and blow it away, was it not thus, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.33. <hi>with</hi> 36. And God hath unknown &amp; uncountable ways to defeat ſecond cauſes in their enterprizes; hence that challenge, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8 9, 10. The <hi>Snare</hi> is laid, but God <hi>breaks</hi> it, and they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 124.4. Thus God gets him a name, and gives his people reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He ſometimes ſaves them in their troubles.</hi> They come, but he is <hi>a preſent help, Pſal.</hi> 46.1. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he preſerves them from the utmoſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the tempeſt is <hi>in meaſure, Iſa.</hi> 27.8. He is <hi>with them</hi> in <hi>water</hi> and <hi>fire,</hi> to limit them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. So he acknowledgeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.18 And he preſerves their grace in exerciſe, and competent vigour under all; whatſoever batteries are made on the outward man, the inward man is ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the floods cannot drown their grace; it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtronger and ſtronger, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 16. <hi>Their bow abides in ſtrength,</hi> and they can <hi>truſt in God, though he ſlay them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>He many times preſerves them out of theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> They out live the flood, to enjoy a calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſerenity again in this world; they <hi>paſs
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:000965_0393_0FAE3899EF675C58"/>
through fire and water,</hi> but at length he <hi>brings them to a wealthy place, Pſal.</hi> 66.12. thus <hi>Job</hi> weathered all his calamities; thus alſo it was with the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi> Pſal. 40. <hi>begin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He preſerves them from the evil of theſe troubles, and turns them all for their good, in the winding up.</hi> He maketh a medicine of this viper, and <hi>purgeth away ſin</hi> with it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9. he <hi>humbles, and proves, and doth them good for the latter end by it, Deut.</hi> 8.16. Thus are they made meet for the Glorious Inheritance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How far they that have made him their hiding place, may ſafely depend on him for this, and why they ſhould ſo do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This will be cleared in the following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God is certainly all that to his people that he hath commended himſelf to them to be in any title of his.</hi> He could not be known to his people, did he not aſſume ſuch things to him; <hi>&amp; it is but a little portion of him that we know</hi> by them. God is all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in one undivided eſſence, but we cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover theſe perfections but ſeverally; and that he may reveal himſelf to us as an Object of truſt, he hath aſſumed ſuch <hi>Attributes</hi> as are ſuited to our underſtandings, in which he reveals nothing to us, but what he really is, and what he will be to his people. As he is their God in Covenant, ſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he tells them what a God he will be to them in his Efficiency.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>That the end of Gods diſcovering himſelf to his people by ſuch titles, is to give them advantage to take
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:000965_0394_0FAE389B4FC794D0"/>
hold of him thereby.</hi> God in his <hi>back parts</hi> is the object of his peoples faith, for <hi>none can ſee his face and live.</hi> We only have communion with him in his declarative Glory; and he hath made it his peoples duty to <hi>take hold of him, Iſa.</hi> 64.7. And the way in which we may ſo do, is in his precious <hi>Attributes,</hi> which are as ſo many <hi>handles</hi> on which our faith may faſten. Hence we read of <hi>taking hold on his ſtrength, Iſa.</hi> 27.5. It is therefore to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage this that he hath proclaimed his name in thoſe golden letters, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence God will certainly make good every</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive title <hi>for all thoſe to whom he ſtands ſo related.</hi> When he makes himſelf over to them in the New-Covenant to be their portion, he giveth all that which he hath revealed of himſelf in his Word, to be theirs, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.24. And he would never ſo give himſelf to them, if he did unchangeably pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be all that to them, which he hath entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them unto, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. For it was his own free unneceſſitated act: having therefore ſo obliged himſelf, he will never go back, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.19. <hi>I ſaid not to the houſe of Iſrael, ſeek me in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That the very end of an hiding place, is for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from trouble.</hi> When God aſſumes <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical titles</hi> to himſelf, it is that, by conſidering what of excellency there is in thoſe things, we may accordingly expect that from him which is ſhadowed out by them. Now a place to hide one ſelf in, is needful for none but thoſe that are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to trouble, and the uſe of it is to defend us from the injury threatned to us thereby. We
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:000965_0395_0FAE389C582244B8"/>
are therefore from hence, to entertain ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of God, and believe him, to be ſuch an one.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That a thing then only proves its title due to it, when it anſwers it</hi> And indeed, <hi>Metaphors,</hi> when they are uſed concerning God, do but carry a dark and faint reſemblance of his perfections, for there is nothing in the creature that may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with him: we ought therefore to reſolve that the thing ſhadowed by it, is in him after a glorious and unparallel'd manner. When God calls himſelf <hi>an hiding place,</hi> we may think of the ſtrongeſt <hi>munition of rocks,</hi> the beſt fortified <hi>strong holds,</hi> and the moſt ſecret <hi>retiring places,</hi> and then conclude them all unworthy of the name, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of him; and if he were not thus, he would never ſo ſtile himſelf.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Hence God is ſuch an Object to his people, as their faith may ſafely thus rely upon.</hi> They need not be afraid to adventure into him as an hiding place, in the greateſt trouble. He is in himſelf all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient for it; as to <hi>power,</hi> none can be too hard for him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.10. As to <hi>wiſdom,</hi> all the policy of men and Devils cannot outwit him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.30. He therefore looks on, and <hi>laughs</hi> at all their cunning contrivances, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.4. And his <hi>promiſe</hi> hath made this over to them, ſo that they may challenge a ſpecial intereſt in it; he hath not only ſaid, <hi>I am God,</hi> but <hi>I am thy God, Iſa.</hi> 41.18. And his <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> hath ſecured the performance of all the promiſed good to them. If he can, he will do it for them, <hi>his promiſes are yea and amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="397" facs="unknown:000965_0396_0FAE389CF2992FA0"/>
1.20. They are but the revelation of his purpoſes, which he can never change.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Their believing dependance on him, is the only way for them to glorify him in troubles.</hi> They ought ſo to do; and it is done only by a ſuitable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Grace, according to the condition they are in: and no grace can at ſuch a time have a right exerciſe, without this dependance, doubting, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, deſponding, fretting, fainting, in a time of trouble, is a diſhonour done to God by his people: Whereas hoping, truſting in him, daring to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all upon his word and power, giveth him his acknowledgment; and this will keep them to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in blackeſt times, <hi>Dan</hi> 3.16, 17.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>All a believers comfort and ſettlement now ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the exerciſe of this faith.</hi> Trouble is, of its own nature troubleſome, and tends to unſettle or diſquiet the man: all his conſolations muſt now come from God, and often all other doors are ſhut; and how ſhall we derive this from God, but by the exerciſe of faith; and that muſt be by believing that he is ſuch an one in himſelf, and will be ſo to us, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>TRue Faith, not only depends on God for compleat deliverance, but alſo engageth the heart to reſolve to ſignalize the ſame, when enjoyed, with ſuitable returns of praiſe.</hi> Here are two Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Prop. 1. <hi>That true faith depends on God for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat deliverance.</hi> The language of the Text is, thou ſhalt do that for me, which ſhall lay ſuch an obligation on me; Here obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That all trouble is afflictive to us, and we cannot but deſire deliverance from it. No affliction is joyous, Heb</hi> 12.11. Therefore called <hi>things hard to bear, Pſal.</hi> 60.3. So that they put us in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o fear, and ſtir us up to endeavour the avoidence or eſcaping of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The</hi> Rule <hi>of faith tells us there is no delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to be expected elſewhere.</hi> Not only our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, but our temporal troubles too are beyond the power of any to relieve us againſt, if God do not afford us ſuccour, <hi>David</hi> gives this reaſon why he will <hi>trust in God alone, Pſal.</hi> 62.6. <hi>He only is my rock and ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence it directs us to go to God in prayer for this deliverance.</hi> If we would have it, not only

muſt we go no where elſe, but we muſt repair to him, he hath appointed prayer to be a medium of obtaining, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.37. Hence that, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Is any afflicted! let him pray.</hi> Thus are we to acknowledge our dependance on him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There must be faith exerciſed in every prayer, &amp; in every petition that we offer to him.</hi> Without it there is <hi>no pleaſing God, Heb.</hi> 11.6. If we would ask and receive, we muſt <hi>ask in faith, Jam.</hi> 1.5, 6. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this ingredient, God reckons us but to <hi>howl</hi>; and there are three things in which faith is to exert it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We muſt believe that if ever we be delivered, it muſt be by God.</hi> Faith muſt keep us cloſe to this object: and we muſt dwell on this concluſion, elſe we ſhall be ready to run elſewhere: We muſt reſolve that if we look elſewhere, we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the fountain for a broken Ciſtern, and ſhall be diſappointed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt believe that he can, and if it be beſt for us, will give us temporary deliverance.</hi> We muſt not limit his wiſdom, nor ſoveraignty, but, acknowledging his power, we are to wait on him as one that is able: and not only ſo, but becauſe he hath promiſed, he therefore will perform what is beſt for us.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt alſo believe that he will give us perfect deliverance at laſt.</hi> Whether he will do it in this life, we may not determine: it may be moſt

convenient for us that it ſhould be otherwiſe: but this a Child of God ought to build upon, that he ſhall be brought out of all trouble in the winding up, and his preſent troubles ſhall contribute to the preparing of him for it: ſo the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> reſolveth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.24.</p>
               <p>Prop. 2. <hi>That true faith carrieth out the heart to reſolve, to ſignalize theſe deliverances, when receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with ſuitable returns of praiſe.</hi> Faith in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>luen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him with this purpoſe in the very praying for them. Here take theſe concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That which puts a man upon ſeeking delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is a deſire to obtain it.</hi> The end of <hi>Deſire</hi> in man, is to inſtigate him to the purſuit of his Object; and it gives riſe to all his rational actions. Now deſire is raiſed by the conſideration of the goodneſs of the Object, and his want of it, and this is the ſpring of all his endeavours to compaſs it; it will not let him ly ſtill, but pricks him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the uſe of means, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That which encourageth to uſe theſe particular means, is hope by them to obtain the thing deſired.</hi> Deſire puts men upon ſeeking means, but that which fixeth them upon theſe courſes rather than others, is an apprehenſion of the ſuitableneſs of them to the purpoſe, and the probability at leaſt of gaining the thing in the uſe of them: and this hope putteth life into endeavour: for if men did not expect ſucceſs in the undertaking, they would either not begin, or preſently tire and give out: and therefore <hi>hope deferred makes the heart to faint,
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:000965_0405_0FAE37793055C780"/>
Prov</hi> 13.12. And that which nouriſheth hope is a rational connexion between the means and the end</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence there muſt be an end aimed at, which gives motion to this deſire and hope. Philoſophers</hi> had in vain placed the end among the cauſes, if it did not influence to the producing of the effect. This cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality muſt be referred to the end in inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion, which is by the influence it hath on the Efficient to ſet him on work: and in all Rational agents this is evident, that theſe two affections are thus excited; the means are not deſired or hoped in for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but for that which is aimed at by them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That faith teacheth a believer to make Gods glory his laſt end in all things.</hi> Fallen man is <hi>come ſhort</hi> of this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. And hence hath other ends in which he cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers; but the Grace of God hath taught men to return to their great end again. They now renounce their ſinful ends, and regulate their ſubordinate ends: this is an univerſal leſſon that faith teacheth, <hi>to do all for the glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Hence every prayer of faith hath an eye to this in every petition.</hi> When we pray for any thing, we always propoſe to our ſelves, what uſe to make of it when obtained; and according to this propoſal, ſo are our prayers to be accounted ſpiritual or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; we read of ſome, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4 3. and, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.18. Theſe were not prayers of faith, but dicta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es of the fleſh. When we rightly go to God for any thing, we carry that in our aim, that we may be able to <hi>honour him with it.</hi> Not but that in its place, we may have reſpect to our deliverance, or comfort,
<pb n="407" facs="unknown:000965_0406_0FAE377AB540FAF8"/>
but we reſt not here; but would have all for our better ſerving God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Hence the right exerciſe of faith in prayer, layes a foundation for this praiſe.</hi> There is a reaſon of our hope which our faith improves; and this makes way for theſe ſongs. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith hath an eye and reſpect to the power of God.</hi> This is the firſt reaſon why we believe in God; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith applies it ſelf to his free Grace, in ſenſe of our own unworthineſs.</hi> It teacheth us to come humbly, and to acknowledge that we deſerve no help, but the contrary, and accordingly to <hi>hope in his mercy,</hi> thus <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32 10. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.8, 9. And as this helps againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies from ſenſe of our own unworthineſs, ſo it diſpoſeth us to celebrate the riches of mercy, appearing in theſe ſalvations, and to ſtudy how to <hi>render</hi> according thereto, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence faith concludes that if God will deliver us, we ſhall be laid under ſtrong obligations to him by it.</hi> Certainly kindneſs done for us will bring us under bonds of gratitude, and ſo the more that is reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſtronger hold it will have of us. This
<pb n="408" facs="unknown:000965_0407_0FAE377B66C52BC0"/>
ſenſe therefore will diſpoſe us to pay our Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of gratitude to our benefactor: and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude proceeds either from inſenſibleneſs or forgetfulneſs of this.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>This makes him to bring himſelf under obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> A Child of God never puts up a petition to him, but either expreſſeth or ſuppoſeth a promiſe made to him, in caſe he anſwers him: for all tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions between God and his people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant way.

               <p n="8">8. <hi>His hope excites in him a premeditation what to do.</hi> Hope looks out for God to come in this way, and makes him to think, if or when God anſwers my requeſts, how ſhall I beſt ſhow my ſelf grateful to him in it? hence a promiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it be enquired, what perſon <hi>David</hi> bears in this place? it may be replied; we may either conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as an <hi>Experienced Saint,</hi> who had been a ſpecial inſtance of Gods great mercy, who had heard him in his diſtreſs, and ſealed up his love to him, which in token of gratitude, he was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to impart to others for their benefit. Or we may look upon him as a <hi>Penitent,</hi> who had by his great fall diſhonoured God, and ſcandalized men, and now after his recovery, endeavours to do as much to win men to God, as he had done to prejudice them at Religion; and this he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.13. Or we may reckon him as <hi>Prophet</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo he accounted himſelf particularly engaged to promove the Salvation of others: and in nothing was he better fitted for this, than by being able to preach experiences to them. It may alſo be obſerved, whom the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> directs himſelf to: and ſome ſay, that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to impenitent ſinners; but I rather ſuppoſe that he ſpeaks both to Sinners and Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The particular caſe laid down in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> was of one that was truly Godly, but had fallen under Guilt, and ſuffered deſertion, and was now recovered; and this affords profitable inſtruction both to the Godly and Wicked. In the offer it ſelf we may obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he applies it particularly: <hi>Thee</hi>; though all be concerned; yet he addreſſeth every one, as it were one by one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The earneſtneſs of the offer, in the variation of the expreſſions urging the ſame thing.</p>

a ſpiritual illumination enabling him to diſcern them ſpiritually: this every <hi>natural man</hi> hath not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 14. And the ſo <hi>opening his eyes</hi> is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine work, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 18. Till this be done, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal teaching doth no ſaving good, whatſoever literal knowledge men gain by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That God hath no dependance on Inſtruments in producing this knowledge.</hi> The higheſt ſervice of men is only inſtrumental, and that no more than morally; and God hath no need of inſtruments, nor doth he uſe them of neceſſity, but for his pleaſure; much leſs doth he need that they be thus or ſo furniſhed, he can do it as well with the moſt unlikely, and gain glory in ſo doing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>But yet, in order to their being uſed as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, God is wont to furniſh them with a ſuitable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for it.</hi> There are thoſe <hi>gifts</hi> that he beſtows upon them, making them meet for this ſervice; theſe gifts therefore <hi>are given to men to profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. And accordingly there is a <hi>diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> both in kind and degree, which God arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>diſtributes</hi> to theſe and thoſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There are two ways in which we are to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. viz.</hi> by <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Example.</hi> In this latter Chriſtians are equally concerned; he that hath received Grace, ought to walk worthy of it, and we are told what its teachings are, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. As to the former, there is a different obligation lying upon the people of God: every one ought according to his call to teach others; but every one is not a like concerned.</p>

                  <pb n="416" facs="unknown:000965_0415_0FAE37852B07F208"/>5. <hi>Hence Chriſtians are bound to teach others, either by the obligation of their</hi> General Calling, <hi>or by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> Special Calling. The general calling of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, obligeth him to glorify God with all that he hath, ſtill reſerving the ſtation that God hath ſet him in; thus Chriſtians are bidden to teach one another, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. But there is a ſpecial calling that God hath given to ſome, who, beſides that, have gifts and abilities for it, are <hi>called by</hi> God to the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the Goſpel, theſe are of his <hi>giving, Jer.</hi> 3.15. And notwithſtanding gifts, men muſt wait for this till called to it according to the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Rule, Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How ſhall he preach, except he be ſent?</hi> Now in both theſe reſpects the Doctrine is a great truth: for though there be more than experience requiſite to fit a man for official teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet this added to thoſe qualifications is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly helpful; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Experience mightily prompts, or puts men forward to be teaching of others</hi>: It puts life into men, and quickens them to their work; and that in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It fills the heart with an ardent deſire to glorifie God.</hi> All the literal <hi>Light</hi> that men get by ſtudy, hath no <hi>heat</hi> in it; it doth not engage the heart at all in love to God; but when once the Soul hath <hi>tasted that God is gracious,</hi> hath felt the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, and been diſtreſt by reaſon of the wrath of God, and known the Grace of God in giving him Repentance and pardon; he is now filled with love to God, and thinks he can never do enough for him, never lay himſelf low enough,
<pb n="417" facs="unknown:000965_0416_0FAE3785EB095580"/>
nor ſufficiently ſet forth his praiſes: and he would have all the world to love, admire, and praiſe this God with him; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.3, 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It kindleth a longing deſire after the Salvation of Souls.</hi> By this men come to know the great worth of Souls, and their woful danger, and accordingly to have <hi>travailing pains for them, till Christ be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in them, Gal.</hi> 4 19. He that hath felt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf what an <hi>evil and bitter</hi> thing ſin is, and hath known the riches of grace in pardoning, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, cannot but compaſſionate ſuch as live in ſin, and ly under the curſe; and this will put them upon all endeavours, and make them to give warning and counſel on all occaſions, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the worth and hazard of a Soul, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſave it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Experience is a mighty help to men in teaching of others. Luther</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>Prayer and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation make a Minister fit for his work.</hi> And why temptation? but becauſe it helps to this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> applies this to Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18. And this will be evident in divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It gives them a more clear understanding of the truths which they teach. Theoretical</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> knowledge vaſtly differ; a meer diſcurſive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any <hi>Art,</hi> makes a man but a bungler, compared with one that hath been practiſed in it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>It greatly establiſheth their faith and confidence in theſe truths; and hereby they are enabled to commend them with the more authority</hi>: A man may by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be able to ſpeak largely and diſtinctly upon Scripture truths; but they can ſay nothing of their own knowledge, and poſſibly themſelves fluctuate about their credit of them: they take them only upon <hi>Tradition</hi>; whereas he that hath the record of theſe truths on his heart, and had them exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified on him, can with greateſt boldneſs aſſert them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It hath great influence on the</hi> Affections <hi>in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</hi> Indeed the main thing is <hi>information</hi>; all that doth us ſaving good, muſt come in by the Underſtanding; they that ſeek only to raiſe the <hi>affections</hi> confuſedly, do no good: but ſtill, we have to do with the affections; and the beſt way to raiſe them, is to expreſs our own: it is vain to think to make another concerned, with that which we ſhew no concernedneſs in; whereas experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſtirs theſe affections: that which one feels, he will ſpeak feelingly; he feels the miſery of the Unregenerate, &amp; ſpeaks compaſſionately to them; feels the diſtreſs of deſerted ſouls, and applies ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly; feels the wounds and broken bones of ſuch as have fallen, and handleth them with great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It furniſheth him with skill of applying to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſes.</hi> Many can diſcourſe very diſtinctly, upon a ſubject in <hi>Divinity</hi>; but when they meet

with the doubts and objections of tempted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they are meer bunglers, for want of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; <hi>Peter</hi> is <hi>winnowed,</hi> to be fitted <hi>to ſtrengthen</hi> others, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>It much helps our patience, and perſeverance in teaching.</hi> Meer ſpeculative <hi>knowledge puffs up,</hi> and makes men impatient, and preſently they deſpair of good, if they ſee not the deſired effect: if Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will not preſently hear them, they conclude them paſt hope: if troubled ones be not perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded preſently to hear them, they think them deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate; all this is for want of experience: he that hath known his own heart, and the mighty reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that it makes to the offers of grace, will learn by it, to bear, wait, and uſe endeavours, and not be weary, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Learn hence a reaſon why God uſually exerciſeth ſuch as he will uſe for the good of others, with</hi> many temptations. When God hath deſigned to make men eminently ſerviceable, he hath trained them up to it by more than ordinary trials; thus it was with <hi>Moſes, Joſeph, David,</hi> yea, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. It is not becauſe he hath leſs reſpect for them than others, but to prepare them for the better diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſuch ſervices. When therefore you ſee any of Gods Servants thus dealt withal, let it not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice

               <p n="2">2 <hi>This tells us that it is a great mercy to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with experienced Chriſtians.</hi> As God hath made man a ſociable creature, and we cannot live like men without communion one with another, ſo of all men theſe are the moſt deſirable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for communion, who are the moſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the various dealings of the Spirit of God with them: from vain men we can expect nothing by their fellowſhip, but to <hi>learn of their ways,</hi> which will harm us; but from good men we may expect to be helped in the ways o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Doctrinal</hi> and <hi>Applicatory</hi> which are not to be confounded, but put into due ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. The firſt is <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> conſiſting in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the Truth, ſo as the underſtanding may apprehend it, and be made to give its aſſent to it; we muſt have a conception and a conviction of it, and this muſt go before application, being to prepare for it: and therefore to fall to appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before the truth be explained, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="424" facs="unknown:000965_0423_0FAE37F6669745C0"/>
is to make confuſion. The ſecond is <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> which takes the Truth ſo laid open and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it for our benefit in the Service of God; and this hath to do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>With the practical understanding.</hi> For, beſides that the underſtanding is to be uſed for diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth commended to us, it is alſo to be improved in judging of the goodneſs of the Truth ſo exhibited, and accordingly commend it to the will for practice: this is made by <hi>Information,</hi> or drawing practical inferences from the general truth, which are for our <hi>Inſtruction</hi>; and this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement may be made of every Goſpel Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>With the</hi> Will <hi>and</hi> Affections; <hi>for goodneſs is the proper object of the will, which exerts it ſelf by the affections.</hi> And here Application ſerves to <hi>Reprove</hi> us for our neglects, by convincing us of them, and ſhewing the ſin and danger in them, and rouſing us to reform what is amiſs. Hence there are uſes of <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Reprehenſion.</hi> It ſerves alſo to guide us to the right doing of Duty, and keeps us from turning aſide. To <hi>Direct, quicken,</hi> and <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us</hi>; and finally to <hi>corroborate</hi> and <hi>animate</hi> us in our Serving of God, and hence <hi>Conſolation</hi> is hither to be referred: and we ſhall find all theſe in the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſuch Application is neceſſary to be uſed by ſuch as teach others</hi>; this will appear in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That all the truths of the Christian Religion are</hi> Practical. The deſign of it is to <hi>teach men to live to God</hi>; and ſo every <hi>Rule</hi> of it is a <hi>Rule of life</hi>;
<pb n="425" facs="unknown:000965_0424_0FAE37F724160598"/>
this being the end of the Goſpel, every part of it muſt lead hereunto. We have the deſign of it ſet forth, <hi>Tit</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Mans great end is to glorify God</hi>; he muſt have a <hi>Rule</hi> to direct him how to do it; and this is the <hi>Christian Religion</hi>; and that conſiſts in practice; all the <hi>Theory</hi> of Divinity leads to <hi>practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence Chriſtians are no further profited by theſe Truths, than as they apply them to practice.</hi> That they may ſo do, they muſt know them: and its vain for men to pretend that though they know leſs than others, yet they live as well; for <hi>without knowledge the mind cannot be good</hi>; but on the other hand, if men only ſtudy to know that they may talk, and be admired by their neighbours for men of underſtanding, but lead a looſe and ungirt life, they deceive themſelves, and their knowledge will aggravate their Guilt, and procure them the more wrath, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47. Hence that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence it is certainly the duty of every one that hears the Goſpel, to apply the truths of it to himſelf.</hi> It is not enough for us to receive them into our heads, but we muſt <hi>let them ſink into our hearts</hi>; there are many ſorts of hearers, but there is but one of them that get good by hearing, compared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. <hi>The end of teaching is to farther the end of the Goſpel, and that is practice.</hi> God appoints ſome to each others, becauſe he would have them Serve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>f Application as much as of Doctrine.</hi> For, not only is our underſtanding <hi>dark,</hi> and for that end needeth Illumination; <hi>erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,</hi> and therefore needs to be better informed; but our hearts alſo are <hi>corrupt,</hi> our wills <hi>dead,</hi> and our affections <hi>diſordered</hi>; yea, and our practical underſtanding is indiſpoſed to draw particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from general truths; ſo that theſe need to be rouſed, quickned and drawn to their work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is an indiſpoſition in all the parts, and they need to be excited: the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> thought it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to inculcate known truths, for this end, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Hence the Word of God is ſuited for this end.</hi> God hath not only delivered the <hi>Rule</hi> of Religion in genera] precepts, as men uſe to do in the <hi>Syſtems</hi> of other <hi>Arts,</hi> but hath accommodated the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the ends of practical Holineſs, and we are told the uſefulneſs of them, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.16, 17 The perfection there intended, conſiſts in an univerſal reſpect to the will of God, and conforming of the life according thereto, this was it that <hi>David</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Word of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Hence this was the courſe taken by Gods Servants in Scripture record.</hi> We ſhall find in all <hi>Pauls Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> that though he begin with matters <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> yet he ever deſcends to things <hi>practical</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we find that after the <hi>reading the Law</hi> in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi>
                  <pb n="427" facs="unknown:000965_0426_0FAE37FB2057F3F8"/>
there was a <hi>word of Exhortation, Acts</hi> 13.15. And Chriſt himſelf took this courſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.20, 21. And ſuch direction <hi>Paul</hi> gave to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>begin.</hi> Thus only are men like to be profitable Teachers.</p>
               <p>Prop. 2. <hi>That this Application muſt be particular: and that with reſpect to the</hi> matter <hi>that is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and the</hi> ſubject <hi>to whom the application is made.</hi> I will teach thee, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>As to the ground of particular Application re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the matter, it follows from the former Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>: For if all the Truths of Religion be for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, then every truth ought to be ſo applied: for <hi>none of the counſel of God is to be ſhunned, Acts</hi> 20.27. And conſequently all the Duties belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every part of that counſel are to be urged; there is no duty, but Chriſtians are in hazard of forgetting or neglecting; and we ſhall not be faithful to thoſe with whom we are concerned; if we neglect to ſtir them up.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As to application to particular perſons</hi>: Though in private it is proper to apply things plainly and diſtinctly as <hi>Nathan</hi> did to <hi>David</hi>; and indeed the ground of private application is mainly for this end, that without reproaching mens perſons open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we may convince them of their particular ſins; yet in publick teaching care and prudence is to be obſerved, leſt inſtead of doing them good, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>THe proper deſign of all Divine Teaching, is to guide men into and in the way they ought to go.</hi> There are two Propoſitions here to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>Prop. 1. <hi>That there is a way in which all they muſt go, that would obtain pardon, peace and bleſſedneſs.</hi> We may take notice of three things under this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is a way to bleſſedneſs, out of which it cannot be obtained.</hi> This is evident; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Scriptures often mention the way under this conſideration.</hi> Called the way of the <hi>Righteous, Pſa.</hi> 1.6. Of <hi>Righteouſneſs, Prov.</hi> 8 20. Of <hi>life, Prov.</hi> 10 17. And many other <hi>Epithets</hi> are given it, which put a peculiarity upon it, and inform us that it is the one way that leads to bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Word of God acquaints us with another way that leads to miſery, and that in contradiſtinction to

this</hi>; both are mentioned and characterized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13, 14. Called the <hi>way of the ungodly, Pſal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>A falſe way, Pſal.</hi> 119.104. A way in which is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and miſery, Rom.</hi> 3.16. And many like titles; and by theſe we are acquainted that there is a right and a wrong.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence alſo the Scriptures declare men happy or miſerable according to the way they are in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſal.</hi> 1. <hi>begin.</hi> 119. <hi>begin. Prov.</hi> 7 <hi>ult. &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That bleſſedneſs is an end, and ſo there muſt be a medium to it.</hi> All the deſires and endeavours of the Reaſonable Creature are carried forth after happineſs; this they propoſe, and are inſatiably craving of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Who will ſhew us good?</hi> And whatſoever meaſures men take, as their conceptions are variouſly perſwaded, this is it they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Now the light of nature teacheth us, that where an end is propoſed, there muſt be means uſed for the compaſſing it, and if there be no ſuch means to be found, the end is in vain deſired.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That all men do not reach to be bleſſed, and there muſt be ſome reaſon for it.</hi> If all aſpire after it, and lay themſelves out for it, and yet but ſome are crowned with it, and others finally miſs of it, they did not proſecute it alike, and hence that there is a bounded way to it; for if any way would do, why ſhould any be fruſtrated in the

end? The Apoſtle tells us why the Jews, after ſo much labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> miſſed of obtaining, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That bleſsedneſs is a reward promiſed in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> It was ſo to man in the <hi>First Covenant. Ro.</hi> 10 5. And it is ſo in the <hi>New Covenant, verſe</hi> 9. And as God is the only Author of it, ſo he never offered it to any out of the way of a Covenant; and this infers a way to it; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A Covenant promiſe is a promiſe with a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Herein it differs from an abſolute promſe, for that is inconditionat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence the promiſe is to be claimed only upon the performance of the Condition.</hi> For, though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be firm, yet it is <hi>Relative:</hi> it ſtands or falls according to the tenour of it; if we fail of doing that to which the promiſe is connected, God is faithful to his word, and there is no falſhood in the promiſe, though we never receive the good of it; there is therefore expreſly or implicitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a <hi>threatning</hi> with the promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence this performance is the very way to enjoy the performance of the promiſe.</hi> It comes in as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <hi>medium,</hi> which is <hi>Metaphorically</hi> called a <hi>way,</hi> becauſe we come to be happy, by our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to that which is required of us in order to it: and the want of this will make us to fail of that, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That man by his fail is turned out of the way of felicity.</hi> God ſat man <hi>right</hi> at firſt <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. But it is of the very nature of ſin to take a wrong courſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. Which is therefore aſſigned to the ſtate of fallen man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.3. He is a <hi>loſt thing, Luk.</hi> 19.10. Man hath not loſt his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deſire to be happy, but he is gone from the method that was given him to obtain it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>As long as he is out of the way, every ſtep he takes leads to deſtruction.</hi> There are but two ways, one <hi>leads to life,</hi> the other is the path to ruine; till then he gets into the right way again, he is purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own undoing. Every man is in ſome way, every thought, word and deed is a ſtep in that way, all the man doth hath a tendency to ſome end, and what tends not to happineſs, muſt to miſery; <hi>The wages of ſin is death, Rom.</hi> 6.23. Every man in this world is laying up treaſure for another; if not in heaven, it is in hell, which is the woful end of the Sinners way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That he cannot put himſelf into the way again, but muſt be brought into it.</hi> He loſt it by his own folly, but if ever he recover it again, God muſt

put him into it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. As he knows it not, ſo he hath no power to get into it: Such is his impotency and <hi>enmity</hi>; that he cannot take a ſtep in it; till that be removed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. And none but God can change it; how ſhould a <hi>dead</hi> man go? <hi>Eph</hi> 2.1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The man cannot be happy unleſs he holds on in this way to the end, he muſt keep in it, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it, but follow it.</hi> The Crown is hung up at the Goal, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. <hi>That he may thus hold on in his way, he muſt be kept in it.

               <p>Prop. 2. <hi>That the proper deſign of Divine Teaching, is to guide men into and in this way.</hi> By Divine teaching I underſtand all that which hath God for its author, and <hi>Divinity</hi> for its ſubject. God is the author of other Sciences, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.29. But <hi>Divinity,</hi> which is a <hi>Rule</hi> pointing man to eternal felicity, is eminently aſcribed to him, in that it not only comes from God, but leads to him: and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of fallen man, as to the main <hi>Articles</hi> of it, on which his Salvation depends, is not to be found by the light of nature, nor read in the volumes of Creation and Providence, but comes by <hi>Revelation.</hi> Now there is a double Teaching, <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ward,</hi> and both may be ſaid to be Divine. <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> which is applied by the word and ordinances, in which we are treated with by men; but theſe means are of Divine authority; theſe inſtruments muſt have a Divine call and influence, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs depends on Divine efficacy. <hi>Inward,</hi> is the Effectual operation of the Spirit of God on the hearts of men, enlightning the mind, perſwading the Soul, and cauſing the man to learn: and this muſt needs be Divine, for all ſuch are <hi>taught of God,</hi> and none elſe can ſo teach. Now the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is a truth with reſpect to both of theſe, only
<pb n="446" facs="unknown:000965_0445_0FAE380DC94663C0"/>
with this difference, that the inward teaching, which is always effectual, is deſigned infallibly to lead men into the way, and never fail; whereas the outward is never thus effectual, but when it hath the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitancy of the other; but yet the main deſign of this alſo is for this end, &amp; it always obtains in the Elect, and is in order of means accommodated thereto. That then which is before us is to ſhew that the great aim of theſe teachings is thus to guide men. Which will appear in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>

It is true, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of man upright, the Covenant of works that was made with him, and the Apoſtaſy by which he fell under the threatning of that Covenant, are comprehended within this purpoſe, and made way for the Grace of it: but we now look upon man as fallen, and ſo guilty of death; and here we find that Gods Grace appears, in that he hath told us that he will not leave that whole unhappy race to periſh in their ſins, but will bring back a number of them to the enjoyment of bleſſedneſs. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the word, and there was a <hi>promiſe</hi> of it from <hi>Eternity, Tit.</hi> 1.2.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>All mankind, in their natural ſtate are ignorant of this way. Rom.</hi> 3.17. As to the firſt way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to man in his integrity, there are ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts of that ancient Law on the conſciences of meer <hi>Heathen,</hi> which make them ſometimes <hi>excuſe,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>accuſe</hi> them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. Yet that knowledge labours of a double infelicity, for the underſtanding of it is ſo broken &amp; imperfect, that the moſt it doth is to leave <hi>men inexcuſable, Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. But they are groſly miſtaken, and miſled in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of that <hi>Rule.</hi> But beſides, that is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a way of life to fallen man, the <hi>Law</hi> is become <hi>weak,</hi> through mans ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. So that if the man knew the length and breadth of it, it would never lead him to the enjoyment of God, and bleſſedneſs; the way of peace and reconciliation is another thing, of which he hath no natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. Among all the excellent diſcourſes of morality, which ſome <hi>Ethnicks</hi> have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves famous for, there is not the leaſt footſtep of any mention of Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs; and Salvation through him.

Theſe diſcoveries are made wherever the word of God comes, and the buſineſs of the Ordinances is to point out to man the way of life, to tell miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man where Salvation is to be had, but how few embrace it and comply with it? how much cauſe of that complaint, <hi>Iſa</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> Yea this is the very <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Condemnation</hi> in places where Chriſt is Preached, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3 19 But this was not the prime reaſon of Gods making known this way to man, though it prove ſo even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to many: but it was becauſe God had a number, whom he had choſen according to his purpoſe of Grace, to be made partakers of life, and ſo to be put in the way of it, for which he would treat them according to their nature.

               <p n="7">7. <hi>Hence the primary end of all the Goſpel Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is to help men in this.</hi> And though eventually they prove a <hi>Savour of Life</hi> to ſome, and <hi>of Death</hi> to others, yet but for the former they had not been promulgated. Though Chriſt proves a <hi>corner ſtone</hi> to ſome, and a <hi>ſtumbling</hi> ſtone to others, yet the direct end of his coming into the world was the former, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. There is a powerful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ordering the coming of the Goſpel in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard both of times, and places, and we find not that God ſuffered it to come any where but where

he had ſome to bring in to Chriſt; it was that they might ſo come to know God, and the way to life. Beſides, the very nature of the Goſpel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and of the work allotted to the Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry ſhew what is the buſineſs thereof: God tells us what <hi>Pastors after his own heart</hi> are to do, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us what his Miniſtry was for, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18.

Such reflections, well reſolved, will be inſtructive to us, and help us to make a right judgment of our ſelves.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>What is that</hi> Contumacy <hi>under the means uſed by God, which we are carefully to avoid?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We may here firſt obſerve ſomething about the means themſelves, from whence we may the better judge of it. Now the means are the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that God takes to convince men of ſin, and bring them to <hi>Repentance,</hi> in order to their being pardoned, and having the comfort of it; and there are two ſorts of men to whom God thus applieth himſelf, <hi>viz Unregenerate</hi> Sinners, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Converſion, and the <hi>Regenerate,</hi> when fallen into ſuch ſins as make a breach between God and them; and the courſes that God takes are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his <hi>Ordinances</hi> or <hi>Providences.</hi> In his <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> he ſends Meſſages to them, to ſhew them their ſins, to convince them thereof, to reprove them, to diſcover their danger, and to call them to Repentance. In his <hi>Providences,</hi> eſpecially when the other do fail of the deſired Efficacy, by ſome ſore afflictions that he brings on them, as a proper chaſtiſement of their folly. Now men do ſhew their Contumacy, when their corruptions do ſo withſtand the means, as they remain impenitent under them: and this may be the caſe, as of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo of fallen Saints for a ſeaſon; and is fitly expreſt by the carriage of the <hi>Horſe and Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

them that would break them: and is diſcovered by theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When they cannot bear the means that are uſed with them, but are enraged at them.</hi> If God ſends his Servants, and they rebuke them, and give them ſerious warning, they fly out upon them, as if they had offered them the greateſt affront; thus they dealt by <hi>Jeremiah, Jer.</hi> 26.11. Thus did <hi>Aſa</hi> by the Prophet, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.10. One that is tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will take a <hi>reproof</hi> for a <hi>kindneſs, Pſal.</hi> 141.5.

Their pride makes them think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too good to be adviſed, and they ſcornfully caſt it off, ſometimes in expreſs terms, as they, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.16, 17. And oftner by contemptuous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages they <hi>ſtop their ears,</hi> and wilfully <hi>refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, Jer.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37.

Yea, thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf was treated by the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, Luk.</hi> 16.14. And we are warned that there ſhall be many ſuch <hi>in the latter days,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>When they juſtify themſelves againſt all the convictions offered them.</hi> They will not ſee, nor acknowledge that they have done amiſs: they plead their innocence, and righteouſneſs. Thus when the Prophet bore witneſs againſt their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, they vindicate themſelves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17, 18. They think that their <hi>ways are equal,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gods ways unequal, Ezek.</hi> 18.25. Whereas a ſubdued heart readily confeſſeth its Guilt, and gives God his due acknowledgment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3, 4.2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.5, 6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>When they remain inſenſible under all the means.</hi> A ſtupid frame abides: it is called a <hi>ſpiritual ſlumber, Rom.</hi> 11.3. They can ſit under the moſt awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing means, hear their ſins declaimed againſt, and their danger laid open, and are no more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it than the ſeats they ſit on, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20. Yea, though God bring fearful calamities upon them, they do not ſo much as think what is the voice thereof to them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. <hi>ult.</hi> This is from the hardneſs of their hearts: a <hi>tender heart</hi> is like that of <hi>Joſiah's,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.11.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That mans obedience to, and ſervice of God, is <hi>a reaſonable ſervice, Rom.</hi> 12.1. Not only is there nothing in it unreaſonable, but that which hath the higheſt reaſon in it; for,</p>

homage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4 11. The light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taught meer <hi>Heathen</hi> this principle, and they made it the firſt <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Morality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Duties required in the moral Law are all of them rational.</hi> The <hi>Moral</hi> Duties required are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Natural,</hi> or <hi>Poſitive.</hi> The f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Poſitive</hi> are ſuch as do add a particular reſtriction to the law of nature, or are arbitrary commands built upon it: and theſe are accommodated to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of man, and carry their reaſon in them; ſuch as Gods limiting the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to a <hi>Seventh day, &amp;c.</hi> Meer <hi>Ethnicks</hi> have made excellent diſcourſes on many moral Duties, from the reaſon they ſaw in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>And there is the higheſt reaſon for Duties purely Evangelical.</hi> God hath manifeſted his <hi>Sovereign Grace</hi> in the Goſpel, in that he will treat fallen man in a <hi>New Covenant,</hi> but the great commands of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> therein required, are moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. That God will accept of man in this way, is wonderful condeſcention: but that in order to peace and ſalvation, they turn from their ſins to God, and place their whole truſt and reliance on Chriſt, is ſo fair and convictive, that ſinners who have refuſed it, ſhall have nothing to plead for themſelves in the day of accounts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The promiſes and threatnings are ſuited to move

on a Reaſonable Creature. Affections</hi> in men are the inſtruments of the will, by which it either em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth or refuſeth a thing; and they are ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated to his <hi>Underſtanding.</hi> Now mans reaſon directs him to <hi>chuſe good, and refuſe evil:</hi> it is a note of a perſon come to the uſe of his reaſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.16. Now the <hi>Promiſes</hi> engage that which is really good, as a reward of Obedience, yea the beſt good, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting felicity; and the <hi>Threatnings</hi> denounce evil in caſe of diſobedience, and that the moſt amazing, ſeparation from God, which is the ſumm of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries: and both theſe from God, who is true, and can give being to his word: how convincing is this of the rationality of Duty, ſince mans conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate principle is, <hi>to ſeek happineſs and avoid miſery?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence it follows that all ſin is unreaſonable.</hi> For the reaſons of contraries are contrary: but ſin is contrary to obedience, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.4. And further to ſhew how unreaſonable ſin is, obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is against God, Pſal.</hi> 51.4. It oppoſeth it ſelf againſt all his revealed perfections: more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is against his</hi> Sovereignty. God muſt needs be the Creatures Sovereign, for it is entirely his; he is whole owner of it; and then he may command it; he thinks it reaſon enough to ratify any of his precepts by ſaying, <hi>I am the Lord.</hi> Now the ſinner, by every ſin, practically rejecteth this <hi>Sovereignty</hi>: hence ſin is called <hi>Rebellion Iſa.</hi> 1.2. and 63.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is against his</hi> Holineſs. All Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are the reſults of his Holineſs, <hi>the Command is

               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is againſt his</hi> Righteouſneſs. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was the <hi>Rule</hi> of Righteouſneſs which God gave man, and on which he grounded his <hi>Relative Juſtice,</hi> in that <hi>ſpecial Government</hi> which he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth over man, called therefore <hi>his righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Pſal.</hi> 119.7.62.76. Sin therefore, in viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, withſtands his Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It is against his</hi> Goodneſs. All that the man hath, flows to him from this fountain; his being, his preſervation, all the comforts of this life, all the protections and deliverances he hath, all the means of Salvation, and hopes of eternal life, are the fruits of Gods free benignity to him: &amp; his ſervice is but the acknowledgement which he requires of him, in reſpect of all this, which the Sinner denieth him, and ſo is <hi>a deſpiſer of his goodneſs, Rom</hi> 2.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is againſt <hi>himſelf</hi>: hence ſaid <hi>to wrong his own ſoul, Prov.</hi> 8.36. And how unreaſonable is that?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It</hi> defiles <hi>the man</hi>: it poyſons him, it leaves him under that filthineſs which is indeed his bane: it leaves a blot upon him, which expoſeth him to reproach: Sin is therefore in Scripture compared to all thoſe <hi>filthy things</hi> that can be thought of, and all too little to ſet forth its odiouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It robs the man of his</hi> peace. There is <hi>great peace</hi> in Obedience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.165. But ſin lays a foundation for all diſturbance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20, 21. It makes deep wounds in the Conſcience, which will

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It deprives him of his</hi> happineſs: and that both naturally, and upon the Covenant terms. Sin, if it gets into a man, is it ſelf a miſery, and lays him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the wrath of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Hence it ſubjects him to all</hi> miſery. It brings all the curſes written, on his head. The threatning runs in theſe terms, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. And all that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy is contained in that word. It <hi>ſeparates from God, Iſa.</hi> 57.2. And what but miſery awaits thats ſeparation?</p>

               <p>For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It</hi> Scandalizeth <hi>men</hi>: it often becomes a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to others to ſin, and this is the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that we can do to another, to draw him into Sin: it is to give him a ſtab at the heart; to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, Rom.</hi> 14 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It occaſions others</hi> trouble <hi>and</hi> affliction. One ſinner ſometimes, and that by one ſin, may <hi>trouble</hi> a whole nation, <hi>Joſh</hi> 7.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence untractableneſs under the means muſt needs be unreaſonable</hi>: this follows from the former; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The deſign of the means is to reclaim men from ſin.</hi> The Goſpel is a <hi>Goſpel of Salvation,</hi> and it is an eſſential part of this Salvation, <hi>to ſave men from their ſins, Joh.</hi> 1.29. And this is done, not only by

                  <hi>pardoning</hi> them, but alſo by <hi>turning them from their iniquities</hi>; hence put together, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. And to this the means are accommodated, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Mens untractableneſs wholly fruſtrates this deſign</hi>: it is the very nature of it to do ſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.5.

               <p n="1">1. Here is matter of counſel for Sinners;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Beware of confiding in your carnal reaſon: Vain man would be wiſe, &amp;c. Job</hi> 10.12. They who have the leaſt wiſdom, are moſt conceited of themſelves and think they have the greateſt reaſon for what they do. Well, you are wiſe then, but let me tell you, <hi>the worlds wiſe men go wiſely to hell.</hi> All their reaſonings for ſin are brutiſh, and are counted wiſdom only by the fleſhly part. When therefore you find that you encline to hearken to theſe, ask, but are not theſe the diſputings of the fleſh, and if ſo, they will be found folly in the end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Be then convinced of the folly that cleaves to you.</hi> God himſelf hath declared every unregenerate man to be a <hi>born fool,</hi> and gives this for the reaſon why

they will not be perſwaded, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.3, 4. If ever you become truly wiſe, you muſt be convinced of this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 17. The firſt leſſon that ſinful man is to learn in wiſdoms School, is <hi>that he himſelf is a fool</hi>; which, if any thing, will put him on enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after wiſdom. Many might have arrived at true wiſdom, but for a conceit they had that they were already wiſe. And if you will compare the ſentiments of carnal reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the dictates of the word of God, you muſt either charge them with fooliſhneſs, or confeſs your wiſdom to be ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let this conviction drive you to God, to beg of him to reſtore you to your understanding again.</hi> The direction is, <hi>if any lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God Jam.</hi> 1.5. And who is there that doth not lack it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the exhortation is nextly to ſuch whom the Spirit of God hath made to feel their want, and thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Now refer your ſelves wholly to the Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</hi> Look upon the Spirit of God to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and the word of God to be the ſtore houſe, and the Ordinances to be the <hi>Medium</hi> of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, by which you may obtain that <hi>Wiſdom that is from above,</hi> which only will <hi>make you wiſe to Salvation.</hi> Remember what that hath told you, <hi>Job</hi> 28.28. Come then to this School, and humbly wait for his teaching, and ſo may you arrive at that wiſdom which will make you happy; when the worlds wiſe man, and his wiſdom ſhall periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let this teach you to beware that you do not</hi> lean to your own underſtanding. It is the caution, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5. And the reaſon is given, <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.26. The law in our members will be very forward to give in its fooliſh arguings, and if we be not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, we ſhall be enſnared by them: they will tell us a fair ſtory, and ſo cheat us.

There is all the <hi>Strength,</hi> as well as all the <hi>Heart,</hi> to be here laid out, <hi>Matth</hi> 22, 37.

There are the troubles to which the <hi>Body</hi> it ſelf is expoſed, which is by Sin become a ſink of all diſeaſes, ſickneſſes, languiſhings, pains and torments; and the moſt skilful Phyſitians are at a loſs to number up the many ails that mans body is expoſed unto: they all wait upon the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; pining ſickneſſes, burning feavers, faintneſs, ſtrong pains, beſides violent caſualties.

<pb n="521" facs="unknown:000965_0520_0FAE379EF9C2B288"/>
and ſeparation of Soul and Body. The Contemplation of this very part of mans miſery, hath made meer <hi>Heathen</hi> to lament the unhappy ſtate that is befallen him, and determine that man and miſerable are become terms convertible; and yet if this were all, it were but little compared with that which is yet behind.

Now ſpiritual plagues, which are the greateſt plagues, belong to the Sinner; and there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe alſo: but thoſe which are moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, may be reduced to theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> there is the plague of an <hi>hard heart,</hi> which though men are not ſenſible of, becauſe of the hardneſs of it, yet is a ground of the continuance of men under the Curſe, and as it were binds them over to all the other ſorrows which they meet withal; and this is followed with <hi>Gods giving men up to their ſins,</hi> and delivering them over to their <hi>own counſels, Pſal.</hi> 81.12. Whereby they heap up plagues, and miſeries uncountable to themſelves. There is alſo an horrid <hi>reflection of Conſcience</hi> charging ſin upon them, and preſenting before them the Wrath of God, accuſing, arreigning, condemning of them, citing them to Gods <hi>Tribunal,</hi> and ſetting before them eternal vengeance, whence ariſeth <hi>amazing fear,</hi> which gives them no reſt: they are afraid

himſelf to be in all his declared perfections to believe the truth of his commands, of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and threatnings.

                  <hi>A.</hi> Rejoycing is properly an expreſſion or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Affection of joy. Now <hi>joy</hi> is placed among the <hi>cloſing Affections</hi>; deriving from <hi>love,</hi> and may be deſcribed, <hi>A delighting our ſelves in the enjoyment of an object wherein we find ſatisfaction.</hi> If the object be loved, the ſame love that carrieth deſire after it till it be enjoyed, will employ joy upon it, when it hath gotten it. Only we muſt obſerve, that there is a twofold enjoyment to be conceived; <hi>viz</hi> a man may in a ſenſe be ſaid to enjoy a thing in <hi>hope,</hi> &amp; he doth ſo in <hi>actual fruition.</hi> Hence there is a double joy: the former, <hi>viz. The joy of Hope,</hi> ariſeth on a confidence or ſecurity we have of the thing: Now the apprehenſion of the excellency of the object affords a redundant joy to the unfailing certainty that we have of being in due time poſſeſſed of it: and indeed this ſecurity is a preſent good, when the perſwaſion is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on undeceiving grounds; and this <hi>joy</hi> ſerves to quicken the <hi>deſire</hi> into a more vigorous proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the means for obtaining the thing it ſelf; and then there is the <hi>joy of fruition,</hi> when we take the comfort of the thing it ſelf, being poſſeſſed of it, compared to the <hi>joy of harveſt, Pſal.</hi> 126.5, 6. This joy conſummates and crowns the deſires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now they are come to their <hi>reſt, Pſal</hi> 116.7.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence the Creature is naturally carried out after it. Joy</hi> is an Affection to which all the other do pay a ſubſerviency, they are all at work in their place to make way for that to exert it ſelf: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are <hi>working Affections,</hi> but this is that in which they center and take their <hi>reſt</hi>; when they have done their buſineſs, thus ſits down and reaps the comfort of all. So that the Creature is reſtleſs till it comes to this: every thing would rejoyce, and is not ſatisfied till it hath ſomething to rejoyce in.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>If any in the world have cauſe to rejoyce, the Children of God have ſo.</hi> Worldly men think they have good reaſon for it; but it is certain that the Children of God have infinitely mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they have more to joy in, in their weeping time, than the other in their laughing time.</p>

But of this afterwards.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The honour of God is concerned in their rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</hi> A Godly man cannot honour God aright, unleſs he rejoyce in the Lord. For a Chriſtian to go always ſorrowful and heavy hearted, doth not only ſhew unthankfulneſs to God for his undeſerved mercy, but it prejudiceth others, and brings the profeſſion they make into diſcredit among men, and maketh them to think that ſuch ſerve an hard Maſter: whenas a Chriſtian who is holily chearful, gains credit to the ways of God. Hence the <hi>Pſalmiſts care, Pſal.</hi> 73 15.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>And their own comfort in this life depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</hi> A man no farther enjoys himſelf, than as he rejoyceth either in hope or fruition: if his joy be falſe, his life is a dream; but if that be true, his life is life indeed. The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> defines life, <hi>an act with delight</hi>; intimating that ſo much as this is wanting, there is ſo much of death in life. And as our ſpiritual life conſiſts in ſerving God, ſo we do nothing well for God but what we do chearfully.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is proper to the</hi> Affections <hi>to be moved by the object.</hi> They are powers put into the Creature, &amp; being powers, there muſt be ſomething to bring them into act; and this is by way of excitation; and that which ſo excites them, is the Object that is before them; ſo that when they have no object to move them, they have no motion. Though man hath a power of love in him, yet if there be nothing for him to love, it doth not exert it ſelf: hence no affection is mentioned but with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence the motion of the Affections is according to the apprehenſion had of the Object.</hi> Now this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion is either by the exerciſe of the <hi>ſenſes,</hi> as in bruits, or of <hi>reaſon,</hi> as in man: for though the ſenſes in man are helpful in the diſcovery of things, yet they are ſubſervient to his reaſon; which hath in him the power of judging and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of things: that therefore which moves the affections is either the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> in the Object; but not meerly as it is in it, but as the man apprehends it ſo to be; and ſo they may be led by miſtake, through a falſe opinion to call <hi>good evil, and evil good,</hi> &amp; act accordingly <hi>Iſa</hi> 5 20.</p>
