            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Books of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> are (as Expoſitors obſerve<note n="*" place="bottom">Pool, Henry.</note>) ſuppoſed on good grounds, to have been penn'd by <hi>Ezra,</hi> that ready Scribe in the law of the LORD: And the time when he wrote them, to have been after the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity. This Second Book begins with the reign of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who ſucceeded his Father <hi>David,</hi> and gives us the Hiſtory of the reigns of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> from him to the Captivity. This and the preceeding Chapter give us an account, of the reign of a very good and gracious King, viz. <hi>Joſiah.</hi> They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002847_0003_0FE64561907DBDA0"/>us, at what age he came to the Throne, what great and good things he did, after his advancement thereto, how ſuddenly he died, where he was interr'd, and how univerſally lamented by his Subjects at his Death. This good King came to the Throne, when he was young: See <hi>ver.</hi> 1. of the preceeding Chapter. <hi>Joſiah was eight years old when he began to reign &amp;c.</hi> And he was advanced thereto, after two very wicked Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> his Grand-father <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and his Father <hi>Amon:</hi> but yet he did not tread in their ſteps; for we read, <hi>that he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left:</hi> And that <hi>in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to ſeek after the God of David his father.</hi> See <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. of that Chapter. This young King then went on to purge <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from the high Places, and the groves, the carved Images, and the molten Images; he alſo cauſed the altars of <hi>Baalim</hi> to be broke down in his preſence, and the Images that were above them to be cut down; and alſo gave order, and took effectual care, for the repairing the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple &amp;c. as we may ſee by reading that Chapter. And then in this Chapter, in which is the text, we read of a <hi>Paſſover</hi> which this godly King kept in the eighteenth Year of his reign; how he encouraged, &amp; directed the Prieſts &amp; Levites in it; gave very liberally himſelf towards the charge of it; and in a word, how very ſolemnly and exactly the whole of it was performed: See <hi>ver.</hi> 1,—19.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002847_0004_0FE6760EE494A790"/>
AND now, how happy might it have been for his Subjects, could he have reigned longer over them, and have been ſpar'd, to perfect the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things he had begun? But it muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; and behold, as great and good as he is, yet he is not ſuffer'd to continue, but is cut off in the midſt of his days and uſefulneſs, and his Subjects ſurprized with the ſudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected News of it. His Death indeed was brought upon him, partly through his own raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and preſumption; for when <hi>Necho</hi> King of Egypt, came up to fight with <hi>Carchemiſh</hi> by Euphrates, <hi>Joſiah</hi> would then go out againſt him; and though the King of Egypt ſent to warn him againſt the Enterprize, yet engage he would, and in perſon fight the Egyptian Army, and in the engagement receives thoſe wounds of which he died: See <hi>ver.</hi> 20,—23. <q>But yet it was not in wrath to him, (as one obſerves,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Henry.</note>) for his heart was upright before God, but in wrath to a ſinful, and hypocritical Nation, that God ſuffered their King to act thus.</q> The King they had was a good one, and one they did not prize eno', and God would let them no longer enjoy him, but in anger takes him away from them. Now in the text we read, that <hi>he was buried in one of the ſepulchres of his fathers; and all Judah and Jeruſalem mourned for him.</hi> And juſt cauſe of mourning had they under ſuch a frown of Providence on them. The Death of ſuch a Prince, and his being taken away in the midſt of his uſefulneſs, call'd for the more general Lamentation.</p>

PROP. I. <hi>CIVIL Rule and Government among Men, is what GOD would have upheld &amp; maintained.</hi> GOD is the Maker and Governour of the World. He reigneth King for ever. <hi>The Kingdom is his, and he is governour among the Nations,</hi>

And every one do that which is right in his own eyes without any danger (I mean in this Life) of ſoffering, or being call'd to an account? Yea, without this how ſoon would the World be turned upſide down? Now that God would have Civil rule upheld among Men is plain from what we read in the Sacred Oracles.

            <p>PROP. III. <hi>THAT Kings &amp; Princes are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times removed by Death, in the midſt of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice &amp; Uſefulneſs.</hi> God, who ſets up Kings, and who has appointed rule and government among men, has done this, for the uſe and ſervice of his people. Such are to ſerve the People, over whom they are placed; and therein do they ſerve God, who has ſo dignified, and advanced them. And this God, who has ſet them up, can when he pleaſes, put them down again<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Dan. 2.21.</note>. <hi>He changeth the times and ſeaſons; he remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Kings, and he ſetteth up Kings.</hi> Now Death ſometimes calls theſe off, in the midſt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002847_0012_0FE676191B75D4B8"/>of their Service, and Uſefulneſs; and when the greateſt things are expected from them. They may ſeek the real welfare of their Subjects, and be exerting themſelves to the utmoſt, for their peace and ſecurity; and in the midſt of all theſe, Death may put an end to their purpoſes and deſigns. So have ſome of the Kings of God's ancient People been taken away, and eſpecially that good one, of whom our text ſpeaks; his Predeceſſor was his father <hi>Amon,</hi> and he did evil in the ſight of the Lord, as his father <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> before him had done, he ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to all the carved Images, which <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> his father had ſet up; But when this King <hi>Joſiah</hi> came to the throne, he quickly began a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; he repaired the Houſe of the Lord, which had lain waſte, and many other things: but yet in the midſt of all this, is he ſnatch'd away. And thus have ſome of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> been taken away. Thus was King WILLIAM the Third removed by Death, in a critical juncture, when the Nations hopes and expectations from him were greatly rais'd. But not to go back ſo far; how was our late KING, of bleſſed Memory, taken from us in the midſt of his Service and Uſefulneſs; he Died indeed in an advanced Age<note n="*" place="bottom">In the 68th Year of his Age.</note>; but yet in the midſt of his Serviceableneſs; and when his Dominions, who for near. Thirteen Years had been happy under him, hopd to have been ſo ſtill; and had their expectations in and from him greatly rais'd: How was he purſuing the Peace and Tranquility of <hi>Europe,</hi> when to our inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002847_0013_0FE675F180A8DA90"/>grief, the tydings of his deceaſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Which was on the Lord's-Day <hi>June</hi> 11th. about Three in the Morning at His Brother the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Palace at <hi>Oſnabrug</hi>
               </note> are brought to us? We ſee then that Kings and Princes may die in the midſt of their Service and Uſefulneſs? Which was the Third <hi>Propoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. IV. <hi>THAT whenever ſuch are thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by Death, it is God that in his holy, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Providence orders and appoints it.</hi> That the World is governed by God, is as true as that He made it; and nothing is there comes to paſs in it, but what is of his ordering. Chance and Fortune are but fancies and deluſions, and nothing can be more abſurd, than to ſuppoſe or imagine the World to be governed by them. And this God, who thus governs the World, is holy, juſt and wiſe, in all the diſpenſations of his Providence. Now, whatever Changes there are in Nations Kingdoms or Countries, they are all ordered by him. Indeed GOD generally makes uſe of Inſtruments and ſecond Cauſes, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about his purpoſes and deſigns; but then, he is himſelf the prime Efficient of all, and he don't reckon it beneath him, to concern himſelf even with the ſmalleſt matters: For our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our has aſſur'd us<note n="(m)" place="bottom">Mat. 10.29, 30.</note> that not ſo much <hi>as a ſparrow falls to the ground without him,</hi> and that the very <hi>hairs of our head are all numbred.</hi> God orders the time both of every ones birth, and alſo death. The times of all, of Princes and Subjects are in his hands. Kings muſt and ſhall die, but not before God's time. They
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002847_0014_0FE6761A44B32FA0"/>may die ſuddenly, in the midſt of their days, before their own, and their People's time, but not before God's. He orders their Death, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be more lingeringly, or ſuddenly, at home, or abroad, in their bed, or in the field; he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the ſickneſs, accident, or the like, by which a period is put to their lives. He ſent pining ſickneſs on <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and he directed the arrow which wounded <hi>Joſiah,</hi> ſo that he died. But this for the Fourth <hi>Propoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, is it thus, with what ſilence and ſubmiſſion doth it become both our Nation, and Land, to bear the rebuke of God's Providence, in the Death of our late rightful and lawful King? His removal is certainly an awful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke both on them and us, and will as ſuch be reſented by every true Proteſtant, — but what ſhall we ſay— Lord! thou who haſt given haſt alſo taken away; and we would be dumb, and not open our mouths to complain.</p>
            <p>I come now to</p>
            <p>PROP. V. <hi>THAT the removal by Death of ſuch Kings from a Nation or People, is what they ought duly to reſent and mourn for.</hi> Such a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion calls for ſorrow and lamentation, for weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and girding on of ſackcloth.</p>
            <p>Conſider here briefly,</p>
            <p>GOOD Kings are great Bleſſings to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and therefore their Death to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They ſeek the good of the People they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002847_0015_0FE675F1A6D786F8"/>are ſet over, and are indeed Benefactors to them. Such Kings, as they expect love, honour and loyalty from their Subjects, ſo they endeavour to be themſelves <hi>nurſing fathers</hi> unto them, which was the great bleſſing God promiſed his People of old, that they ſhould have in their Kings. <hi>Kings ſhalt be thy nurſing fathers, and Queens thy nurſing mothers &amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="(n)" place="bottom">Iſai. 49.23.</note> They are their Subjects Patrons and Protectors, always tender of their intereſts and liberties, and ready to defend them from all invaſions. And what great bleſſings are ſuch Kings to a People, and their Death of conſequence to be lamented by them?</p>
            <p>AGAIN, the Death of a good King is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a frown of Heaven on a People, and to be lamented by them. When God frowns on a People they ought to mourn: and he doth ſo in the removal of ſuch a King from their Head. At ſuch a time it is a day of darkneſs and of gloomineſs, a day of clouds and thick darkneſs with a People: and ſure not to reſent ſuch a Diſpenſation would be ſtupidity in them.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, The Death of a good King, and in the midſt of his Uſefulneſs, is ſometimes a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of ſore Judgments coming upon a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. GOD, when about to bring his Judgments upon a ſinful People, uſually gives warning, and makes to appear the evident Prognoſticks of them; and ſometimes the Death of a good King may be the forerunner of dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments coming upon a People. The Prophet ſaith<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. 57.1.</note> 
               <hi>that the Righteous one is taken away from the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002847_0016_0FE6761A6C180E30"/>evil to come.</hi> So may a good King be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and we find GOD promiſing to defer bringing on <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they deſerved. 'till that Godly King <hi>Joſiah</hi> was gathered to his Fathers. 2 Kin. 22.15. to the end of the Chap. <hi>And ſhe ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, thus ſaith the GOD of Iſrael, tell the man that ſent you to me, thus ſaith the Lord, behold. I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the King of</hi> Judah <hi>hath read. Becauſe they have forſaken me and have burnt incenſe unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands: therefore my wroth ſhall be kindled against this place, and ſhall not be quenched. But to the King of Judah, which ſent you to inquire of the Lord, thus ſhall ye ſay to him, thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael as touching the words which thou haſt heard; becauſe thine heart was tender, and thou haſt humbled thy ſelf before the Lord, when thou heardeſt what I ſpake against this place, and againſt the inhabitants thereof, that they ſhould become a deſolation and a cauſe and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me: I alſo have heard thee ſaith the Lord. Behold therefore I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou ſhalt be gathered into thy grave in peace, and thine eyes ſhall not ſee all the evil that I will bring upon this place.</hi> And one great reaſon why the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſo lamented the Death of <hi>Joſiah</hi> as we ſee he did, in the verſe following our text, was becauſe he was ſenſible of the evil which was apace haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon God's ſinful People. And it was not a great while after King <hi>Joſiah's</hi> Death, before we find Judah and Jeruſalem in ruins. There
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002847_0017_0FE675F6EE744DB0"/>were but four Kings reigned, and two of them but three months each, before Judah and Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem were deſtroyed by the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> the Houſe of God burnt with fire, and all the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of it carried into Babylon; as we may ſee by reading the 36th. Chapter of this 2d. Book of <hi>Chronicles.</hi> Thus is the Death of a good King ſometimes the preſage and forerunner of approaching Judgments and Calamities, and therefore to be Lamented.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, To mourn for and lament the Death of a good King is one mark of the Subjects love and loyalty to him. As good Kings are a great bleſſing of Heaven to a People, ſo it is no leſs a favour to a godly Prince when the Subjects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Dominion are ready on all occaſions to expreſs their love and loyalty to him; when under him they <hi>lend quiet and peaccable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty,</hi> are careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his honour and dignity, and ready to venture both their eſtates and fives, if call'd thereto in his defence. Now one mark of the Subjects love and loyalty to their Prince, is to mourn heartily at his Death.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, Thus to mourn at the Death of a good King is a piece of honour juſtly due to him. Honour is due to Kings; and we are bid to honour them in God's word. See 1 Pet. 2.17. <hi>Honour the King.</hi> And eſpecially is this honour due to ſuch as are <hi>nurſing fathers</hi> to their People. And this honour is due to them both while living, and at their death. The memory of ſuch ſhould be had in an honourable and laſting
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002847_0018_0FE67623088AB8C8"/>remembrance. When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> died, we read how his Subjects did him honour at his Death. See 2 Chron. 32.33. <hi>And Hezekiah ſlept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefeſt of the ſepulchres of the ſons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jeruſalem did him honour at his death.</hi> Doubtleſs (ſaith one on the text) <q>part of the honour which they did him then was to mourn for him.</q> Subjects honour their deceaſed King at his Death, when they mourn and lament his removal from them.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, To lament and mourn at the Death of a good King has been the practice of God's People both in former and latter ages. So have the People of God done in former times: and what an inftance of this have we in our text, and the foregoing verſe.— <hi>All Judah and Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem lamented for Joſiah; and all the ſinging men and ſinging women ſpake of Joſiah in their lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> And we find that when <hi>Abijah</hi> died, who was <hi>Jereboam's</hi> Son, and in whom there was found ſome good thing toward the Lord of Iſrael; and who was alſo heir apparent to the Crown, all Iſrael mourned for him. See 1 Kin. 14.18. <hi>And they buried him</hi> (i.e. Abijah) <hi>and all Iſrael mourned for him according to the word of the Lord &amp;c.</hi> Thus has it been the practice of God's People in ancient times. — And thus it has been in latter ages alſo. So hath the Death of a good King ſometimes put our whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Mourning, witneſs the deceaſe of that glorious King, WILLIAM the Third, of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Memory; the lamentations made at whoſe Funeral are not forgot to this day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:002847_0019_0FE675F7173018A0"/>
I might go on and ſay,</p>
            <p>THAT the Death of a good King oftentimes gives ſuch as are enemies to the State great advantages againſt them; and is therefore to be lamented. But I need not inſiſt here, theſe things conſidered, may ſerve to ſhow that it is the duty of a People to reſent and lay to heart the Death of a good King: and ſo for clearing the Fifth and laſt <hi>Propoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE then for the Uſe and Improvement of it I ſhall only ſay,</p>
            <p>USE. IS it as we have heard? <hi>THEN ſure GOD is this Day calling both our Nations at Home, and ourſelves in this Land, to lay to heart and be ſuitably affected with the Death of our late Good and Gracious</hi> KING.</p>
            <p>WE have had brought us the laſt Week, the heavy tydings of the Death of one of the beſt of Princes; our late rightful and lawful King GEORGE. News, very melancholy and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing to us, and becauſe of which we mourn this Day.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible, how vain it would be in me to imagine my ſelf capable of giving the juſt Character of ſo great a Prince, nor ſhall I attempt it; but yet I think Duty to GOD by whom he reigned, and Loyalty to my King oblige me to ſay — That doubtleſs he was a KING richly furniſhed with Princely gifts and qualifications, a true Proteſtant, and indeed a Defender of the Faith; — a KING
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002847_0020_0FE676232B91A020"/>meek and mild, wiſe and prudent, ſteddy and unwearied, of quick diſpatch in all publick Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and who ſcorned to do any thing mean, and unbecoming the high Character that he bare — a KING, who had the good and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his Subjects always near his heart, and who has many a time from the Throne (and not only in word but deed alſo) expreſs'd the ſame. — a KING, under whoſe juſt &amp; mild admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations his Subjects were all eaſy, unleſs a few unreaſonable men, whom nothing would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but ſuch things as would deſtroy the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, and bury the Nation in Popery, blood and ruin. — And ſure then the Death of ſuch a Prince is an awful frown of Heaven both on our Nation and Land; and God is this Day calling both us and them to weeping and to mourning. It is but a few Years, ſince our hearts were fill'd with gladneſs, at the joyful News of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne. And how did we then hope to ſit under his ſhadow for a long ſeaſon? But alas! our hopes are daſh'd and gone; the breath of our noſtrils is ſtopt; the anointed of the Lord taken, and conquered by Death that cruel enemy. And is he gone? Is that royal Head which once ſhin'd ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly under <hi>England's</hi> Crown, now laid in the Duſt? Can thoſe Hands and Feet which once were ſo ready to ſerve us, be no more employ'd for our welfare and good? Is that royal Body now become a lifeleſs Corpſe, and nothing but a lump of cold clay? Muſt it be laid in the Duſt, and we ſee that face no more? — Lament then and weep all ye his dutiful and loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002847_0021_0FE675F9EA8F8DB8"/>— Weep ye <hi>Britiſh</hi> Iſles, the Crown is fallen from your Head, for this let your Heart be faint, for this let your eyes be dim. — Weep alſo ye <hi>American</hi> Plantations, — and ONEW-ENGLAND! let not thy Tears be wanting on this ſolemn Occaſion. — Weep all ye who bare Rule under him. — Let the Prieſts alſo the Miniſters of the Lord be cloathed in ſackcloth on this Oceaſion. Yea let every one be ſuitably affected with this loſs, and hearken to the voice of God in this Providence which loudly utters it ſelf to us in that language, Pſal. 146.3, 4. <hi>Put not your truſt in princes, nor in the ſon of man in whom there is no help: his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts periſh.</hi> And that, Iſai. 2.22. <hi>Ceaſe from man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, for wherein is he to be accounted of.</hi> God is now ſhewing his People how vain it is to put too much confidence in the beſt of Princes, which perhaps is what we have ſometimes been ready to do. And now to ſtir up our grief, let us but conſider, what a critical Juncture of Affairs he is ſnarch'd away in. There have been of late Months great Commotions in <hi>Europe,</hi> Wars and rumours of Wars among the Nations, and dark Clouds hanging over them. This (with other things) called his Majeſty abroad; and behold, while he is in purſuit of the Peace and Tranquility of his People, is he taken away from them; and tho' he or they little thought that their parting a few days before would be a final farewel; yet ſo it proved, and well may they now ſorrow, becauſe <hi>they muſt ſee his face no more.</hi>

TO conclude then,—</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. LET us bleſs GOD for him, and the great things he has done for his People in and by him. Let us not forget how ſeaſonably God advanc'd him to the Throne; and what dark Clouds, which hung over no ſmall part of God's Church, were ſcatter'd at his happy Acceſſion thereto;— Let us bleſs God, who continued his Servant on the Throne, notwithſtanding all the curſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of ſuch as were enemies to his Perſon and Government to the contrary: and for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which we our ſelves have found before him.</item>
               <item>2. AND to have done, Let us Pray for his SUCCESSOR, our preſent rightful and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful KING. As dark a Day as it is, yet we ought not to deſpond, or be diſcouraged; yea were it darker ſtill, in this ſhould we rejoyce, that the LORD <hi>who is our Lawgiver, our Judge, and our King,</hi> yet lives, and can ſave us. We have alſo this to rejoyce in, that tho' our late moſt gracious KING is taken from our Head, yet He has left behind him a Succeſſor that is of his own illuſtrious Houſe and Family. — It was lamented over Jeruſalem of old, that ſhe had none left that had right or were fit to rule. Ezek. 19.14. <hi>Fire is gone out of a rod of her branches which has devoured her fruits, ſo that ſhe has no ſtrong rod to be a ſcepter to rule: this is a lamentation, and ſhall be for a lamentation.</hi> But bleſſed be God, it is not ſo in our Nation. We have at this day <hi>a ſtrong Rod to be a Scepter
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002847_0023_0FE675FA14909E30"/>to rule:</hi> — a Proteſtant Prince, in his full ſtrength, and the SON of our late moſt gracious Sovereign, is now Proclaimed KING over us. And now, as we in this Land have been ready on all occaſions to expreſs our duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs &amp; loyalty to his Royal FATHER, ſo let us be to him; and let our fervent Prayers be continually going up to Heaven for him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>MAY GOD then bleſs his Servant <hi>GEORGE</hi> the Second, our now rightful and lawful KING. May he be endowed from above with all Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualifications, and the Honour of Him by whom Kings reign, lie near his Heart at all times. May his reign over us be long and proſperous; and all his Dominions <hi>lead under him quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty</hi>—And as for ſuch as are either ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret or open enemies to his Perſon, Crown and Dignity, and would gladly bring in, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a Popiſh Pretender to the Throne. May they all be confounded; and O God who <hi>ſitteſt in the heavens, do thou laugh at them, have them in deriſion, and make them to know that they imagine a vain thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>MAY GOD give the King his judgments, and his righteouſneſs to his Son. May he judge the people in righteouſneſs, and break in pieces all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors — In his days may the righteous flouriſh; and there be abundance of peace — may prayers be continually made for him, and his name endure for ever.</hi>

MAY alſo his Royal Conſort, our Gracious Queen <hi>CAROLINE,</hi> be a Nurſing Mother to GOD's Church and People; and the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion abide in their Illuſtrious Houſe.

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <head type="sub">[Taken from the <hi>London Journal, June</hi> 17. 1727.]</head>
            <p>THE Mortality of Princes is a Subject that demands ſeriouſneſs from the lighteſt Minds: Who is vain and careleſs enough, to be able to expel ſadneſs from his Heart, when the ſacred Head of Majeſty is laid low in Duſt? The ordinary Conſolations of Reaſon and Philoſophy are ineffectual to chaſtiſe the firſt Tranſports of Grief in a pious People, mourning for their King and Father. All that we can think, and ſpeak, and write, is too little to expreſs the Paſſion in the Soul; and Extravagance it ſelf does not mean half enough. Thoſe Conſiderations only that are taken from the Neceſſity of Submiſſion to the Divine Will, which is eternally mov'd by infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, are of Force to reſtrain the Rage and Intemperance of the Mind, when it finds it ſelf wounded in its ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt Part, and throbs in the firſt Agonies of deſperate Sorrow. What ſtrange, what ſecret Charms are there in hopeleſs Grief, when the Heart is grown wilful to its own Affiction, and refuſes Comfort? Will the Reader therefore indulge the Paſſion of an honeſt Mind, which delights to linger on the melancholy Scene, and mingle his Affliction with that of a whole People.</p>
            <p>A Thouſand unwelcome <hi>Expreſſes</hi> have e'er this publiſh'd through all <hi>Europe,</hi> that <hi>GEORGE</hi>
               <pb facs="unknown:002847_0026_0FE676275D4A7190"/>THE GOOD AND JUST, is now no more a King; in whoſe Loſs <hi>Britain</hi> bewails her common Parent, and every Good Man a Friend and Patron. He is fallen from the moſt exalted Heighth of human Greatneſs; from the Power of redreſſing Wrongs, of protecting Innocence, and raiſing fallen Virtue; and is gone to the Tribunal of the Almighty KING, to be himſelf judg'd, and to render an exact Account of his Vicegerency on Earth: his ſacred Perſon is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready beginning to reſolve it ſelf to common Clay, its firſt Original: Who now ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in his Smiles, or ſtand ſilent in his Anger? Where is that majeſtick Face, which has ever aw'd his Foes, and chear'd his willing faithful Servants? That Scepter'd Hand, which Crowds of kneeling Subjects lately kiſs'd, how remiſs is it now in Death! How ſudden, how awful is this Change! Scarce had we paſs'd the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities for the Anniverſary of his auſpicious Birth, but we are call'd to pay our filial Sorrows o'er his Tomb. Who that had beheld the Splendor that fill'd the Court and this whole Metropolis on that happy Night, could have imagin'd ſo ſpeedy, ſo ſevere a reverſal of our Joys? We then beheld our King in a ſeeming firm Health, in full Vigour, and ſo ſanguine and florid a Complexion, as promis'd many more Years than he had yet attain'd. But we ſhall behold him now no more for ever! <hi>Vanity</hi> is the juſt Inſcription on all humane Happineſs; and the reflection of the inſpir'd Writer on the natural frailty of Princes, ought for ever to correct thoſe tow'ring and ſplendid Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which we form from their Virtue and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb facs="unknown:002847_0027_0FE6760075CC7218"/>
               <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods, and all of ye are children of the moſt high, but ye ſhall die like men, and fall like one of the Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>REST for ever Royal Spirit, and poſſeſs what thou art no longer ſenſible of, the Praiſes and Bleſſings of a grateful People, who ſhall tranſmit the Story of thy gentle clement Reign, for the Example and Inſtruction of future Kings, and the Admiration of all Poſterity.</p>
            <p>FAR be it from our preſent Deſign to draw at large the amiable Character of his late Majeſty. Alaſs! as <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> ſaid, <hi>We come to bury</hi> Caeſar, <hi>not to praiſe him.</hi> But that Writer who ſhall be honour'd with ſo great a Task hereafter, will run no hazard of offending Truth, when he ſhall enumerate the great Qualities that have diſtinguiſhed the beſt &amp; happieſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Princes, &amp; unite them in the Perſon of <hi>GEORGE</hi> the Firſt: Yet even this ſhall fall ſhort of his real Merit, and the publick Praiſe ſhall make the Panegyrick little.</p>
            <p>THERE ſeem to be four Particulars in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the late King, which diſtinguiſh him from all the Princes his Predeceſſors, and ſhall for ever endear his Memory to this Nation. The firſt was the abſolute want of all Ambition which might poſſibly endanger the Liberties of his Subjects: A Rock on which the greateſt Kings have frequently miſcarried; but which was always ſo carefully avoided by him, that in an Adminiſtration of Thirteen Years, the moſt jealous Patriots have not been able to form one
<pb facs="unknown:002847_0028_0FE6762786E526E8"/>reaſonable Fear concerning it. The ſecond was his inflexible Conſtancy and Reſolution in thoſe Meaſures, which upon mature Deliberation he had embrac'd: This added extreamly to the Importance of his Councils, by creating and ſtrengthning the Dependance and Confidence of his Allies abroad, as well as his Friends and Servants at home; and ſeems to have been, next to the diſtinguiſhing favour of Heaven, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cauſe of all that Succeſs that ever attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Affairs. The third Particular in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter was the indelible Remembrance he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd of the Services &amp; Fidelity of his Friends: He was a Maſter, that no Time, no Accidents, not ſcarce even Injuries could diſoblige; ſo that it was no wonder that he was happy in Servants, whom no Advantages, no Intereſts, no future Proſpects could ſeduce from him. The laſt that I ſhall now mention, for I haſten over ſo painful and uneaſy a Subject, was his moſt graceful and obliging Condeſcenſion to all: The King was every where to be known by his Goodneſs. Who can recollect his affable Deportment, his gracious bending to Diſtreſs, without being overwhelm'd &amp; loſt in Sorrow! — I add no more.</p>
            <p>LET us now with one Heart transfer our whole Faith and Loyalty to the Perſon of our preſent Sovereign; and paying him all that Fealty and Allegiance which is due to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Title, we may with the firmeſt Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence expect that Favour and Protection which good and gracious Princes extend to a loyal and obedient People.</p>
