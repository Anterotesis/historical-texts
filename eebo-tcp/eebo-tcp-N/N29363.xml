            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Curate of Elmwood. A TALE,</head>
            <p>IF thou art a Curate, O reader, and haſt already <hi>one</hi> pariſh in thy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, be contented, and ſeek not to have <hi>two.</hi> Be aſſured that content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is better than to have <hi>two liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many good people beſides Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, have been born upon the Av<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and one of them was the Curate of the Pariſh of Elmwood, Of a family of nine people, parents and children, only he and his daughter JULIA remained.</p>
            <p>The old parſon could do many things beſides eating his pudding, drink his October, and collect his tithes;—important qualifications, which have been, from time immemorial, annexed to the office of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>te.— He carried the ſciences in his head,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:039105_0005_10139C51466F6278"/>
and morality in his heart; I mean, ſo far as they are connected with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or ſentiment—added to this, he preached an excellent ſermon, wore his own grey hairs, and had the gout; but above all, he loved, moſt dearly loved, his beautiful daughter JULIA.</p>
            <p>And well did ſhe deſerve his love. —Sweet Maid! if ever I forget thee, may my fancy loſe her flights, and my pen its movements; if ever I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the majeſtic elegance of thy form —or the liquid blue ſwimming in thy eye—or the half roſe, half-lily colours glowing on thy cheek, like the ſtreaks of the weſt in a July eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.—</p>
            <p>Her perſon had all thoſe undeſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able points of divine beauty, which the pure imagination aſcribes to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels—her mind was faſhioned by the ſciences—her diſpoſition by charity, and her ſentiment by truth.</p>
            <p>The manſion of theſe contented re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives roſe in the centre of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh—it was neither ſtately nor proud —like its inhabitants, it was modeſt,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039105_0006_10139C53085F20A0"/>
and ſeemed to retire into an obſcure and ſilent glade, formed between va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious clumps of ſhrubbery, and a ridge of riſing ground. At a ſmall diſtance rolled the ſilver Avon, ever muſical, now mantling over a rocky channel, and now gliding through plains and fields covered with wild flowers.</p>
            <p>Through theſe fields, and along theſe ſkirted banks, full oft did the Curate and his daughter purſue their walk—in that ſweet hour of the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when the ſun ſeems dropping behind the hills, and throws a feeble but pleaſing beam over the landſcape; then might you ſee them wander, arm in arm, and ſlowly on the Avon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. "JULIA (he would ſay to his daughter) my dear JULIA, you and my pariſh are the comforts of my life. Ye are all my children—but you, JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, you are my friend—the thirſty loves not to drink, nor the weary to reſt, more than I love to look upon <hi>you</hi>—what would become of me, JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039105_0007_10139C569215F970"/>
wert thou gone? And when I am gone, my daughter, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thee?"—"I hope, father, we ſhall die both together."—"God grant it! God grant it!" anſwered the good old man.</p>
            <p>Thus peaceably glided on their lives, till an unlucky accident in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring pariſh diſturbed their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. The vicar of that pariſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—The moment our Curate was informed of this, it rouſed one of his worſt paſſions: he had now but one wiſh to be gratified in this world; and that was, to have the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vicarage in poſſeſſion. "My dear father (ſaid the unambitious JULIA) have we not competence; and does not competence afford us felicity? and is not this ſufficient?"—Aye, all that was very true: but then the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carage lay ſo ſnug—juſt at his own door; and he wanted to have it in his power to leave ſomething to his JULIA after his death.</p>
            <p>But much remained yet to be done. The Curate had talked like a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039105_0008_10139C58187B3258"/>
with calculations, and his fancy (old as it was) got the ſtart of his judgment. He did not conſider that Lord C— the patron of the living, reſided at London, and that his own limbs were too gouty to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him thither—for perſonal applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is abſolutely neceſſary in theſe caſes: beſides, the clergy, though they are continually adviſing their flocks to keep their eyes fixed upon the good things of heaven only, have an irreſiſtible propenſity to keep their own eyes uniformly fixed upon the good things of this earth—every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore, was important—to loſe a minute was to loſe a vicarage; and while he was talking, ſome other reverend brother, who had no gout in his toes, no daughter to provide for, might be poſting to his Lordſhip in Berkeley-Square.</p>
            <p>The old man became now greatly agitated; and that boſom, which ought to have been the manſion of reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and peace, was diſturbed by reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039105_0009_10139C5AA7336298"/>
wiſhes, and ill-timed deſpair. The ſympathetic ſoul of JULIA was tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous; her heart throbbed with guiltleſs pangs, and ſhe felt for the griefs of her father. She tried to ſoothe him, but tried in vain; ſhe argued againſt his wiſhes, but ſhe was arguing againſt the follies of old age, which are incurable.</p>
            <p>The evening came, but came not as uſual; this man of deſpair was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious of its charms—his ſoul was deaf to the voice of nature, even when her notes were ſweeteſt—at the cloſe of the day. He liſtened not to the minſtrelſy of the hinds, nor the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral harmony of the groves; the flocks cluſtered in the meadows unnoticed: and the ſun poured his evening glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over the hamlet unregarded— even JULIA did not charm him: he ſaw her kneel at his ſide without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, and he heard her ſighs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pity.</p>
            <p>Here a father and a friend was loſt to happineſs—the only friend too ſhe had in the world—and ſorrows much
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:039105_0010_10139C5C30A54328"/>
leſs than theſe would have murdered the peace of JULIA.—She had already knelt by the ſide of her worn parent: ſhe now claſped his hand cloſely in her own, and fixing her blue eyes pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically on his countenance, begged that he would not refuſe her one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt—"What was that?"—To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>her</hi> to go to London, and ſolicit the living.</p>
            <p>Electricity could not touch him quicker. The voice of JULIA was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic, and it awakened him—his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections returned in an inſtant: he leaned over his daughter, and gave her to underſtand, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to grant her requeſt; that he would not part with her for a biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick; and that ſhe muſt not think to part with him—ſhe replied; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; and ſhe re-anſwered; in ſhort, the conteſt was long, ſtubborn, and eloquent; and though there was not much learning in it, it abounded with nature, a richer quality—ſuffice it to ſay, that JULIA conquered; and ſhe obtained, with great difficulty, what
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:039105_0011_10139C60C60BC290"/>
ſhe called the honorable office of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her father's meſſenger.</p>
            <p>It has been obſerved already, that diſpatch is one of the few roads to preferment. As no time was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be loſt, it was agreed that ſhe ſhould ſet off the next morning. The Warwick ſtage paſſed through the neighbouring market-town, and ſhe might walk thither to meet it. The old man retired to get his letters rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and JULIA to make her little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for her calamitous journey.</p>
            <p>How they ſlept, themſelves knew beſt; but when the morning came, the Curate's opinions were entirely changed. "He had thought better upon the ſubject, and he was reſolved not to let her go—the roads were dangerous, and London was ſtill more ſo—beſides, ſhe might turn ſick—or the coach might be overturned—ſhe might be killed—and he ſhould never ſee her more." JULIA knew that theſe fears were only the tender work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of timid nature, and ſhe oppoſed them. In ſhort, the conteſt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039105_0012_10139C624BD1B220"/>
with its former warmth; and the affection of the daughter tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed once more over the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the father. He conſented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to let her go, on condition that JOE, his labourer, his gardener, his footman, his hoſtler, his every thing ſhould attend her with his friendly care—ſhould be the companion of her journey.</p>
            <p>Now this JOE was the aukwardeſt mortal—never, ſure, did a more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple 'ſquire page it at the heels of a fair lady—neither the Sancho of Don Quixote, nor the Pedrillo of Roſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, were more arrant children of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—were guided by more native ſimplicity.—He and his occupations ſeemed made for each other, ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were they reſpectively fitted. He was never famous but for two things; viz. for whiſtling, after his team, the loudeſt and moſt muſical notes of any in the village—and for knitting ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: this was all the reputation he had in this gairiſh world—on his forehead ſat candour, unprofitably
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039105_0013_10139C64D52C8458"/>
enthroned, and on his tongue truth— his viſage was the ſymbol of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—his ruddy cheek was tinted like a cloud in the weſt, at the eve of a glorious day—the ſenſations of guilt had not deranged the line of human beauty!</p>
            <p>Now, reader, ſtop a moment, and bethink thee of this plan, and of this journey—a village virgin, pure as the ſnow-drop in the valley, attended by a village boor, are ſetting out for London—for <hi>London,</hi> I ſay—in queſt of a vicarage! The thing was worthy of a village curate—the deſcent of Eneas into hell was, in compariſon of this, walking upon carpets.</p>
            <l>Facilis deſcenſus Averni,</l>
            <l>Sed revecare gradum—</l>
            <p>Our travellers were now ready to begin their walk to the market-town, which was but four miles diſtant. Without palfrey, armour, or other retinue, than the children of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood; JULIA and her father led the van, and the reſt followed—JOE, as if conſcious that he was entering
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039105_0014_10139C67C974AF50"/>
upon a ſervice or danger, aſſumed a ſtatelier port and a more auguſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion than uſual; with a clean ſhirt in his left pocket, bacon and cheeſe in his right, and an oak ſapling in his hand, he towered majeſtically in the midſt of the children, with a ſtern aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and long ſtrides.</p>
            <p>The company had now walked a mile, and were to part. On this try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſion I could ſay much, but will not—to deſcribe the glances of affection, and the looks of love, which gliſtened in every eye—which played in every feature, would be tedious: I ſhall therefore content myſelf with informing them, that in this difficult ſcene the ſimple heart of the curate failed him; his eyes confeſſed it, and he played the woman. The curate marched ſlowly back, at the head of his young flock, and our two travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſet forward to the market-town, with haſty ſtep and high expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Having now began a journey, we muſt be expeditious. They arrived

at the market-town, met the ſtage coach, and took their appropriate ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—JULIA in the inſide, and JOE, like her guardian angel, perched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove her upon the top—they went ſmoothly on, till they arrived at the lane which is three miles on the weſt ſide of Uxbridge; when a very civil gentleman came to the window, and deſired them to give him all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they had—the gentleman at the window was far from being unpolite, conſidering he had declared war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſociety—he beſpoke them very gently, beginning at the right hand, and following them all, man by man, and woman by woman, till he went round to the left ſide—a boiſterous cornet of dragoons was unhappily the firſt, and he gave his purſe with a ſullen ſilence—JULIA was next, and held her little money in her hand, but durſt not look towards the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow—a meagre cockney gave all, but begged a few ſhillings back, to carry him to St. Paul's—a little fat woman ſurrendered her purſe, with a threat;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039105_0016_10139C6D097860A0"/>
and a plain dreſſed man regretted he had not more for ſo accompliſhed a gentleman.</p>
            <p>When they arrived at the inn, each expreſſed their ſorrows as their feelings prompted; but they were now to enter upon their laſt ſtage, and none had ſuch weighty cauſe to be aggrieved as JULIA, who had not a friend before her—to go forward was madneſs, and to go backward was impoſſible—what was ſhe to do?— She called in JOE, and asked if he had provided himſelf with any money, in caſe of an emergency.—"Yes that he had—and there it was at her ſervice" throwing down his entire ſtock upon the table, which amounted to the ſum of three ſhillings and nine-pence— this made deſpair more black—it was her firſt misfortune; and ſhe thought it but an uncouth entrance into a baſe world.</p>
            <p>The officer now entered the room, and ſeeing JOE there, began to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him for ſuffering the highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to eſcape, when he was ſeated
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039105_0017_10139C6FA09F7890"/>
ſo advantageouſly at the top, with an oaken ſapling in his hand—"You ſtupid oaf! (ſaid this military hero) why did you not attack him?"— "'Caſe I had not a <hi>ſwoard</hi> by my ſide, like you (replied JOE, with the greateſt frankneſs)—he—he—he—! icod, every man to his trade, <hi>meaſter!</hi>" The argument was unanſwerable.</p>
            <p>The officer now walked up to JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, whoſe embarraſſment he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, taking her aſide, told her he gueſſed the cauſe of her ſorrow; and that he was happy he had it in his power to remove it: For (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he) I know the road too well to venture my all upon it, and leave myſelf unprovided with reſources. Here (ſaid he, untying his ſtock, and ſhaking out of it a ſlender green purſe) here is my <hi>corps de reſerve:</hi> I gave the robber a few ſhillings, and I ſecured this for your uſe." Now JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA examined the face of this affair ſimply as it ſtood—it was a caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; and ſhe thought it ridiculous for one who was many, many miles
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:039105_0018_10139C73246F3D70"/>
from Elmwood, and who had not two-pence in her pocket, to refuſe the loan of a few guineas, which would remove all her ſorrows. She might have an opportunity of hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter to Lord C— when ſhe ſaw him, who would no doubt advance the money upon the vicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and thus all would be right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain—ſhe therefore thanked him po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely, and told him that when ſhe ſaw her noble friend Lord C—, ſhe hoped to be able to repay him. "Lord C—! (ſaid he)—what—you are going to viſit him?" "Yes, Sir."— "O—a relation I preſume, madam?" "No, Sir! only a friend: his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and my father were great friends when they were young, and at ſchool." "Aye, aye—your father, I preſume, Madam, lives in the country?"— "Yes, Sir; he's Curate of Elmwood, near*****in Warwickſhire." "Your viſit, Ma'am—is it a viſit of pleaſure or buſineſs?" "Buſineſs, Sir; I am only come to town with a letter from
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:039105_0019_10139C74A9B71B90"/>
my father to Lord C—, to ſolicit the living of*****." "Oh, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you, Ma'am. Lord C—, is my particular acquaintance, and it will give me pleaſure to be your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and your guide, till I deliver you ſafely and honorably to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Would you chooſe to alight, Ma'am, at any particular place in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?" "No (ſaid the ſimple JULIA) I intend to ſtay at the inn all night, and to wait upon his Lordſhip in the morning." "Ah! Madam (replied the officer) you do not know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, the diſguſt, and danger you will meet with at the inn: I have a mother in town, who lives elegantly: be prevailed upon to be lodged this night at her houſe: ſhe will receive you with cheerfulneſs, and treat you with tenderneſs. May I periſh, Madam, may I beg the honor to know your name, Madam?" "JULIA." "May I periſh, Miſs JULIA, but I am intereſted in your caſe, as ſincerely as if you were my own ſiſter!" This laſt propoſal was better and better.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:039105_0020_10139C7776CF6328"/>
To meet ſo good a friend at once! She was ſure her father's prayers for her were heard; and ſhe thought ſhe could not be too thankful to heaven, nor to the gentleman. She accepted his offer; and they mounted the ſtage coach once more.</p>
            <p>As the ſtage-coachman was at this place paid his full demand, there was nothing to be done but to roll into town, and go where they pleaſed. The fat woman lived in Holborn, and the coach ſtopt to ſet her down. "Here too, Madam, (ſaid the officer to JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA) we may get out, for we are near our home." The artful abruptneſs and hurry of the ſummons, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of finding herſelf ſuddenly in the midſt of the immenſe metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, where ſhe already ſaw ſtrange things, and expected to ſee ſtill ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, her total ignorance of every thing around her; her hopes, her expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, her ſimplicity, all contributed to throw her mind into confuſion, and her ſpirits into a ſlutter: ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:039105_0021_10139C7939001A20"/>
every thing, ſhe forgot even JOE, and JOE, alas! forgot her; for he was exactly in the ſame predicament. He was aſtoniſhed; he was in a new world: his recollection forſook him, and a miſt wandered over his eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſat nailed to the top of the coach, with his mouth open, looking at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing and ſeeing nothing. In this cloud JULIA eſcaped; and ſhe neither ſpoke nor looked around her, till her gallant commander led her into Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln's-Inn-Fields. Now, when a young gentleman, with a young lady by his ſide, who is reſolved to follow him, finds himſelf in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, the road to Covent-Garden lies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect: 'tis only going up Queen-ſtreet, croſſing the <hi>lane</hi> and the <hi>acre,</hi> and there you are. He conducted her into a houſe in the Piazza; where the polite inhabitants received the young gentleman with all the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and civility of an old acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which convinced JULIA that he was <hi>quite at home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, gentle reader, while JULIA
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:039105_0022_10139C7D1EFAC170"/>
and her friend are ſeated at a bottle of Madeira, recollect and confeſs, whether we have not journied well; from the banks of the Avon, from the manſion of innocence, from the warm boſom of a father, to place our rural virgin on the very throne of perdition. Now, ye guardian ſpirits, whether Sylphs, Genii, or Fairies; if ye have any regard for devoted pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, now open your golden eyes, now ply your ſilver pinions, for innocence is in danger. And now, thou wrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed old man, thou ambitious Curate of Elmwood, rekindle your piety, and redouble your prayers, for your daughter, your <hi>JULIA is in a Bagnio,</hi> and without a fear!</p>
            <p>Every thing that paſſed around <hi>JULIA</hi> in this houſe appeared too plauſible for her eyes to be opened, or her ſuſpicion to be rouſed, for ſhe had never been in a tavern before: and as to the inceſſant tinkling of bells, and the inceſſant running of waiters; why, bells and ſervants muſt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:039105_0023_10139C80D6993B88"/>
be in all great families, and, no doubt, muſt be continually employed. The deception, I ſay, was good, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, appeared extremely well, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in one inſtance: it puzzled her to conceive why they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into a <hi>bed-chamber!</hi> But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps (ſhe thought) it was the faſhion in London, and faſhion is irreſiſtible.</p>
            <p>He philtered the beverage, and JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA drank ſparingly, but not ſo her companion—he was to attempt the gaining of a difficult poſt, and the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard wanted ſpirits—It is a tribute paid to Virtue, that, though it be lodged in the poſſeſſion of but a frail and weak tenement, its ſpoiler before he attempts to ruin it, muſt call to his aſſiſtance the aids of inebriety. At length his eyes gliſtened, and his cheek glowed—he ſnatched the hand of JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA—fed upon it with fury, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured it with a tumult of unholy love —if, indeed, he loved JULIA, it was with the ſenſations of a tiger. She ſtarted from his embraces, and retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome paces from her chair—he
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:039105_0024_10139C825BE51530"/>
followed, and renewed the attack, and JULIA her reſiſtance: he grew ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he grew wilder; his hand was wandering over her charms (where hand never wandered before) and he became furious—JULIA became faint —ſhe was yielding—her tender frame was exhauſted, and ſhe could only ſhriek! A ſhriek was a new thing in theſe apartments, and it alarmed a gentleman in the adjoining room, who, with his coat off, a dirty boot on oneleg, and his face beſmeared with ſweat, kicked open the door, and ruſhed violently into the room, with all the zeal of a man who was to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the diſtreſſed—the officer let go his hold of JULIA, and ſhe threw herſelf breathleſs upon a chair. The man in diſhabille ſtared at them both alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, now at JULIA, and now at the officer, and at length broke ſilence: "What! force!—Why, thou damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſilly animal, what dirty buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is this you are engaged in?— <hi>forcing</hi> a woman to your wiſhes!—To
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:039105_0025_10139C83E37E1AF8"/>
               <hi>force</hi> a woman in any place is a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that no man of honour will ſtoop to—but to force one <hi>here</hi>;—in <hi>this</hi> houſe—D-mn you; you ſcoundrel! get out—walk off, or I'll kick you." We need not be ſurpriſed that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer was mean enough to take his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice—he looked at the man in diſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile as if he had recollected ſomething, and left the room precipitately.</p>
            <p>"And now, my angel (ſaid the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in the boot to JULIA, taking her by the hand) let us drink a glaſs or two, and I dare ſay we ſhall agree bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter."—"Oh! Sir! (replied JULIA, claſping her hands and falling on her knees before him)—Have mercy on me! pity me!—or you will kill me." "Pſhaw, my dear! I never kill quite upon theſe occaſions—you will but <hi>die</hi> at the moſt.—But, child, you look dev'liſh ſerious upon this buſineſs—is any thing the matter with you?"— "Oh, Sir! (anſwered JULIA, in tears) I don't know where I am, and I don't know where to go—I am juſt come to town in the Warwick ſtage!"—
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:039105_0026_10139C88DA93F868"/>
"In the Warwick ſtage!— What, through Uxbridge?"—"Yes."— "And was that fellow one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany?" "Yes."—"Whe—w! And you met a highwayman, didn't you?"— "Yes."—"That was me, by G—d!" Here JULIA ſhrieked, terrified at the ſound of the name; but he ſtopped her in good time: "You muſt not be afraid (ſaid he) for I won't hurt you—don't be ſurpriſed, it's d—d vulgar to be ſurpriſed at any thing— tell me honeſtly, are you virtuous or not?—that is, are you a maid? — "Oh! <hi>upon</hi> my honor, Sir."—"How came you here then, in company with that fellow?—"When you took —I mean, Sir, when I loſt all my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney—he advanced ſome for me; and as I had no friends in London, prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed to take care of me, and bring me to his mother's, till to-morrow, when I could have finiſhed all my buſineſs. —"Then you are <hi>really</hi> honeſt?"— "As I love Heaven, and my father, Sir, I am." "You are a lovely girl, and it is a pity ſo ſine a woman <hi>ſhould be</hi> hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt—
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:039105_0027_10139C8B5C347D50"/>
but I believe you, and will be your friend—nay I will guard you from harm—for, by G—d, I am a man of honor! and though misfortune and my evil ſpirit force me ſometimes to the highway, I ſcorn to do a mean thing.—In the firſt place, as you loſt your money, you ſhall divide this purſe with me.—In the next place, you are now in a houſe full of proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of both ſexes—I muſt leave it myſelf in a minute, in caſe that fellow ſhould have <hi>twigg'd</hi> me, and I fancy you had better leave it too.—Truſt yourſelf with me, and I will take care of you till morning."—JULIA told him he could not ſerve her more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably than by carrying her to the inn where the ſtage and JOE were. That, he ſaid, was more than he dare do— but he would carry her to a place e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually or more ſecure. So ſaying, he returnd to his room, to throw off part of his <hi>road-dreſs,</hi> and adjuſt the reſt. If the reader has any imagination, he, will conceive how JULIA'S thoughts were employed in this interval, till
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:039105_0028_10139C8CE2209A50"/>
they were interrupted by the re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the young highwayman, who appeared now to be an elegant handſome fellow. He paid the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they departed: It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween nine and ten in the evening.</p>
            <p>They had not quitted the Piazza, when four of Sir John Fielding's men ruſhed forward, and ſeized the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman with the moſt incredible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. They ſwept him away, as the whirlwind ſweeps the leaves in autumn, and buoys them the Lord knows where—JULIA ran too nor caſt one look behind. She continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go forward (as ſhe thought) till ſhe had run a great way; and then ſtopping for breath, ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly on the ſpot from whence ſhe ſet out; ſhe had only run <hi>round</hi> the garden, not ſuſpecting but ſhe was going forward in a ſtraight line. "Madam! Madam! (ſaid an Iriſh chairman to her) do you want a chair?" "I don't know what I want." "My fait, but I do—you want to be carried to Starling's,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:039105_0029_10139C8E6A35E498"/>
my jewel, which I and Conner will do in no time." "My good friend, if you can carry me to an honeſt place, I ſhall bleſs you for ever." "Honeſt <hi>plaſe!</hi> my honey, an if I know one honeſt <hi>plaſe</hi> in the whole town. Ha, ha, ha! honeſt <hi>plaſe!</hi>— Ah, you cunning ſtrap; to be ſure you want to go to an honeſt <hi>plaſe!</hi>— Ha, ha, ha!— Here you Mr. Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, this lady wants to go to an honeſt <hi>plaſe;</hi> can't you ſhew her the way?" "Aye, that I can, (replied the watchman)—Ah, Madam, is it you? I know you of old; come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with me: you ſhall go to the honeſteſt place in all king George's dominions—the <hi>Round-Houſe.</hi>" The watchman happened juſt at that time to want a pot of beer; but JULIA not underſtanding his meaning, to the Round-Houſe he led her in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.—Poor JULIA!</p>
            <p>She had been hitherto overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a kind of inſenſibility. The ſuddenneſs and horror of the laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture were too much for her. Her
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:039105_0030_10139C90F2524B30"/>
faculties loſt their power, and her recollection was ſuſpended. She was led by the watchman without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither ſhe was going; ſhe was dragged along; without feeling that he held her by the arm. But ſhe had not been long ſeated at the top of the bench, where they placed her near the ſire, before ſhe awakened from her ſtupor. She tremulouſly looked around, and ſaw herſelf ſeated in the midſt of a horrible aſſembly, whoſe miſcreantic viſages would make angels weep and demons trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. High above the reſt, like the evil ſpirit in pandemonium, ſat the conſtable of the night, a beef-headed knave, with a pipe in his mouth, and a tankard on a ſtool before him. "Here (ſaid this man in office) you Snoring Dick, reach this-here tankard to that-there lady, and then bring her before me for examination. Oh! ſhe won't drink! well, well, that's all one if ſhe does not drink, ſhe'll pay; ſo bring her forward here."</p>
            <p>JULIA now advanced: her cheeks
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:039105_0031_10139C9590269138"/>
were ſuffuſed with tears, her breath quickened, and her whole frame trembled.</p>
            <p>"Aye, aye, (ſaid the conſtable) you may well ſhake when you look at me. Hem! what account can you give of yourſelf, Miſs?—No, that's not it neither: I'll begin with you, I think, <hi>Miſter</hi> Watchman—Where did you find this-here lady here, Snoring Dick?"</p>
            <p>"Found her! (replied Dick) why, pleaſe your worſhip, I found her picking a <hi>gemmun's</hi> pockets."</p>
            <p>"Picking a <hi>gemmun's</hi> pockets! Mercy on us!—O ho, Miſs, you may well ſhake when you look at me.— Well, Dick, go on."</p>
            <p>"And ſo, Sir, as ſhe was a picking the <hi>gemmun's</hi> pockets, as I was a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I comes cloſe behind her, and lays hold of her hand in the fact."</p>
            <p>"In the fact?"</p>
            <p>"In the fact."</p>
            <p>"Tranſportation, by the lord Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.—Well, go on, Dick."</p>
            <p>"And ſo, Sir, as I catches her hand,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:039105_0032_10139C97172110F8"/>
ſhe turns about, ſtoops down for one of her pattens, and, before you could ſay, <hi>cavy,</hi> hits me the naſtieſt blow on the ſkull I ever had in my life, ſince the great riot. You'll pleaſe to feel, <hi>Miſter</hi> Conſtable, here is the lump as big as a half gallon."</p>
            <p>"Aye, God bleſs me! ſo it is; it's a thumper, i'faith."</p>
            <p>"A thumper! it will ſtand dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages. I never had ſuch a blow in my <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>"Aye, it's a clear caſe, ſhe wanted to murder you."</p>
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            <p>"Oh, the horrid monſter! Well, Madam, have you nothing to ſay for yourſelf? Ah, you impudent— Dick, take off her patten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we may carry it before Sir John in the morning."</p>
            <p>"Aye, that I will, <hi>Miſter</hi> Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the patten will ſpeak for itſelf, and a d—d heavy patten it is."</p>
            <p>Dick ſtooped, but <hi>JULIA <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            <p>"Oh, let her alone! (ſaid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable) ſhe's a knowing one: but ſhe ſhall doll it in Bridewell to-morrow, for all that. Aye, you may well ſhake when you look at me, you bloody-minded—you may now return to your ſeat."</p>
            <p>As <hi>JULIA</hi> was returning to her bench, ſhe trembled inceſſantly, but never uttered a ſyllable. Oh, (ſaid Dick) ſhe is dumb-foundered with the heinouſneſs of her crime." "No, (replied a ſecond) ſhe is drunk." "Not ſo far gone neither (echoed a third) but a quartern of gin would recover her."</p>
            <p>"Aye, aye, (ſaid the conſtable) there's no doubt but ſhe'll drink; and it's her turn now to ſend out. Pleaſe, Madam, to give this <hi>gemmun</hi> money for a gallon of Trueman's beſt, and for half a gallon of hot, and four papers of <hi>'bacco,</hi> and a loaf, and

Here, Scout, walk over, ſirrah, to the lady, and make her your Sunday's bow—Bring every thing of the beſt, and then we'll drink to the lady's health, and to poor Snoring Dick's head; and old Ugly-Face, in the corner, yonder, will ſing us the comical ſong about the cat and the taylor, and make his wry faces, and we'll be as happy as princes."</p>
            <p>When this oration was finiſhed, Scout made his obeiſance to JULIA, —She was juſt able to aſk him what he wanted;—"Money, Madam."— "How much muſt you have?"—"Oh, you may let me have five or ſix ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and I'll make the beſt market I can, and return you the reſt faithfully Madam, upon my honour!—And if that won't be enough, I'll return for more."</p>
            <p>JULIA felt in her pocket for her purſe, (which the highwayman had given her) but ſhe could not find it —it was gone!</p>
            <p>On ſeeing this, the preſident bawled
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:039105_0035_10139C9CD85DA7D8"/>
out immediately, that it was a ſham! and JULIA proteſted in vain —The company around heard this with an arch ſmile; the watchmen ſhook their heads, and the conſtable grew noiſy; which awakened an old gentleman who had hitherto ſlept very ſoundly in a corner. Eſtimating the thing as favourably as poſſible, he had not above half the appearance of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The truth is, he was no other than the well known Mr. B—, who once had three thouſand a year, though he has not now ſixty. He had been lounging as uſual, for eight or nine hours in a coffee-houſe in the garden and then withdrew, as he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently does, to the watch-houſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſleep or drink. On this laſt account, he was regarded there with ſome degree of reſpect.</p>
            <p>He naturally inquired the cauſe of the noiſe; and the majority informed him that it was "only a <hi>Madam</hi> there who had pretended ſhe had loſt her purſe."—JULIA appealed to him in her turn; and, with that unaffected
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:039105_0036_10139CA06E575B88"/>
ſimplicity, which plays about the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of truth, informed him, that a watchman had taken hold of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly in the ſtreet:—that ſhe was poſitive ſhe had her purſe at that time, <hi>becauſe a gentleman had given it to her but two minutes before</hi>—that from that time ſhe had only walked thith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the watchman, and now ſhe miſſed her money.</p>
            <p>"Which watchman was it?" ſaid the gentleman.</p>
            <p>"Me!"—replied Snoring Dick, boldly.</p>
            <p>"Was it <hi>you?</hi> (repeated Mr. B—.) Ah, Dick! you and I, you know, are old acquaintances, and it is long ſince I have known you to be a ſcoundrel —Therefore, ſirrah, deliver the purſe."</p>
            <p>"Me! (anſwered Dick)—Have I the purſe?—I'll be d—d if I have any purſe about me."</p>
            <p>"You hav'n't?"</p>
            <p>"No."</p>
            <p>"And you won't deliver?"</p>
            <p>"No—"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:039105_0037_10139CA405F008E8"/>"Why then, Mr. Conſtable, I charge you with—"</p>
            <p>"Except indeed (interrupted Dick eagerly) ſomething that I picked up in the ſtreet, as I was coming along with that there lady."</p>
            <p>"Ah, you old fox! (ſaid the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman) I thought I ſhould unkennel you. Where is this <hi>ſomething</hi> that you <hi>picked up from the ſtreet?</hi>" "Here it is —but it does not belong to her."</p>
            <p>"Pray, Madam, (ſaid Mr.B—, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing <hi>JULIA</hi>) is this your purſe?"</p>
            <p>"If it has a gold taſſel at either end (anſwered <hi>JULIA</hi>) it is mine, Sir, upon my honour."</p>
            <p>It had ſo—was delivered to her, and Mr. B—immediately retired back into his corner to ſleep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>JULIA</hi> now willingly paid all the demands made upon her: and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident obſerved to her, that as to be ſure as how ſhe was a good natured la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and civil, and all them there things, and had <hi>given a good account</hi> of herſelf, why, to be ſure ſhe might go about her buſineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:039105_0038_10139CA7D8CBEA68"/>
               <hi>JULIA</hi> thanked him, but mentioned, that ſhe did not know whither to go till morning. "Not know! (ſaid the conſtable) —why there are five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred beds around you, where you may ſleep for half a crown."—But ſhe was a ſtranger in town, and did not chooſe to venture into ſtrange houſes.</p>
            <p>"Lord, Ma'am, (obſerved Snoring Dick) for ſix-pence I'll conduct you to a <hi>bagnio,</hi> where you will be as ſafe as if you was in the Tower."—She ſtarted at hearing a <hi>bagnio</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—"Why then, Ma'am, if ſo be as you are ſhy, and a'n't proud, hire me well, and I'll let you ſleep in my houſe.—There's nobody there but my wife—I'll ſeek but five ſhillings, and your purſe can well ſpare that."</p>
            <p>This propoſal did not require to be repeated.—JULIA took him at his word, even though he took her purſe; as he was a poor man, ſhe thought ſhe might be ſafe in his houſe for a night. Beſides, ſhe was
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:039105_0039_10139CA95E331FF8"/>
pleaſed with the thoughts of being in company with a woman once more. With Dick, therefore, ſhe went into one of the little ſtreets behind Long Acre, and followed him into a three-pair-of-ſtairs room; humble enough, indeed, but where all was ſilence. Dick awakened his wife, told her the ſtory, whiſpered her to look ſharp after her lodger, and left them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>JULIA</hi> chattered a little while with her landlady, and found her to be civil enough for a watchman's wife. The firſt thing ſhe begged of her was to be favoured with pen, ink, and paper. She got theſe readily; the landlady retired to bed; and <hi>JULIA</hi> wrote the following letter:</p>
            <p>"Ah! my dear father, ſhall we ever meet again? When ſhall we meet! Are you well? Shall I ever ſee you? and ah! ſhall you ever ſee me?</p>
            <p>"I am now—alas! I do not know where I am—nor where I have been —nor where I ſhall be to-morrow.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:039105_0040_10139CABE38A9260"/>
I ſeem an outcaſt from ſociety: I have not met one friend ſince I left you: every one deceives me—every one inſults me: they have treated me cruelly—they have broke my heart—Even JOE has forſaken me: he has deſerted me, or he is loſt—or I know not what has become of him.</p>
            <p>"Ah, my father! my dear fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er!—that Heaven which we both ſerve, let that Heaven bear witneſs, that one wiſh alone fills my whole ſoul—the wiſh to ſee you once more, to talk with you, to gaze upon you, to ſit once more by your knee.—I would ruſh into your boſom: I would wet it with my tears, but I would never forſake it—never, nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er!"</p>
            <p>Now, gentle reader, if it has been at any time your fate (as it has been mine, and as it is at this moment many a nobler fellow's) to be ſitting in that lofty habitation called a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, plunged in deep diſtreſs—no pence in your purſe, no mirth in
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:039105_0041_10139CAD6AC19650"/>
your heart, and no beef in your bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—if this has been your caſe, you muſt well know the comfort that ariſes from ſhedding your ſorrows in ſecret—the relief that flows from a ſhower of ſolitary tears. In ſuch a ſituation, next to inſtantaneous and abſolute relief, it is the firſt of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and JULIA now felt it in all its force—her heart was eaſed, and ſhe hoped for a night of reſt and better days. Having ſealed up her letter, ſhe retired to a bed ſo humble, that it kiſſed the very ground.</p>
            <p>She ſlept nine hours inceſſantly, and, when ſhe awoke, found her head reſting upon the partition wall which roſe at the back of her bed.</p>
            <p>At the expiration of this time JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA aroſe. Snoring Dick had retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for an hour, to ſleep away the fatigues of the night and of the beer pot. His wife was at breakfaſt, and invited JULIA to partake of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hea—She conſented willingly; and the woman, who had but one diſh, politely offered it to her gueſt, and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:039105_0042_10139CB01D9F6790"/>
took for her own uſe a pint-pot from which her huſband had been drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beer.</p>
            <p>This repaſt over, Dick awakened; JULIA, who was during breakfaſt time deviſing what meaſures to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, propoſed at firſt to engage him to go along with her to the inn where JOE and the ſtage-coach were; but on recollecting the dangers ſhe had already experienced in the ſtreets, ſhe reſolved not to venture upon it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, without a better guide than her friend the watchman. She therefore judged it more prudent to hire him to go to the inn, and to bring JOE along with him to the place where ſhe was. Dick readily aſſented to this propoſal for the hire of a half crown; which, he ſtipulated, ſhould be paid him before he ſet off, as well as the crown for the bed. All this he received on the ſpot, with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for her father to be put into the poſt-office. He now departed, aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, that though ſhe had not the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:039105_0043_10139CB4D52091C0"/>
name of the inn to give him, he could readily diſcover it.</p>
            <p>It was now rather more than din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner time, but neither Dick nor JOE appeared—JULIA was uneaſy. Four o'clock ſtruck, but brought no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort with it. It was five—but nobody arrived. Six, ſeven, eight—nobody. During theſe intervals ſhe paid fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits to an object in diſtreſs, in the adjoining chamber, and charged her hoſteſs with great ſincerity, at whatever time ſhe went away, to be attentive to his neceſſities till her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid it was now eight o'clock, and nobody appeared. She became very, very uneaſy. It was now half paſt eight. "Still nobody!—Good Heaven! are my misfortunes never to end?" At about a quarter before nine, two of Sir John Fielding's men entered the room, with Dick—drunk, very drunk—at their head.</p>
            <p>Now, gentle reader, whatever your thoughts may be, certain it is, that Sir John Fielding's men are come in
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:039105_0044_10139CB65C0775F8"/>
queſt of JULIA; and I'll lay you plums to pippins that you cannot conjecture their buſineſs with her.</p>
            <p>To underſtand it, your memory muſt recur to the adventures of JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA with the highwayman. He had met with her in the bagnio, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en her a purſe with money in it, and in their departare from thence, the highwayman was ſeized—JULIA fled, and was by chance conducted to the Round Houſe. The generous high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman was apprehended upon the information of the contemptible ſon of Mars, already noted. When this coxcomb arrived at the office, the fat woman of Holborn had alighted there upon the ſame buſineſs. As the highwayman therefore was ſecured, the firſt buſineſs thought neceſſary was to ſearch him, and all the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent purſes of the company were found upon him, except that of the fat wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.—It was agreed that he could not have ſpent it in ſo ſhort a time: <hi>ergo,</hi> he muſt have given it away.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:039105_0045_10139CB8E2798FC0"/>
To corroborate the ſuſpicion, the men recollected that a woman was along with him when he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and the perfumed officer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it. The caſe was therefore plain; JULIA muſt have the purſe in her poſſeſſion. Away they ſallied, with the officers at their head, through the ſtreets, bagnios, taverns, and night-houſes; but in vain: ſhe was no where to be found. The next night, between eight and nine, one of them met Dick the watchman: (Dick was at this time returning to JULIA without any anſwer or infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; for inſtead of going on her errand, he went to get drunk with her money.) The thieftaker inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him by chance, as the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happened within his circuit, if he had ſeen ſuch a lady. After deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her very minutely—"Seen her! (ſaid Dick) why, ſhe is at my houſe." This information was ſufficient for the ſervant of juſtice: he took Dick by the arm, and ſummoning one of his companions, ſet off for the lodging of JULIA.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:039105_0046_10139CBB72ACB3B8"/>We have already ſeen them intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced where ſhe was. They ſeized her without ceremony, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as uſual to ſearch her. The fatal purſe, ſo remarkable for the golden taſſel at either end, was in a moment found. This confirmed the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and ſhe was carried away as an accomplice.—When will perſecution ceaſe to follow virtue?</p>
            <p>Sir John was not that night at home, and they informed her that ſhe muſt be impriſoned till morning. —<hi>Impriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned</hi>! She ſhrieked at the very ſound. —"Pſhaw (ſaid one of them, ſeeing her confuſion) you need not be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, I aſſure you, ma'am: we are not going to a common priſon—I have a pretty little ſnug houſe, and as cloſe as a cage, where you may ſleep as ſoundly as in your own bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. No difference in the world, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, Ma'am—only that every door and window in the houſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with iron bars. —That's all I aſſure you, Ma'am, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe advantages, it will only coſt
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:039105_0047_10136E1A5178F238"/>
you a <hi>guinea</hi> for your bed—not a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, I aſſure you, Ma'am—I keeps the beſt uſage, the beſt <hi>tendance</hi> and the beſt wines in the <hi>Garden.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Eloquent and agreeable as this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage certainly was, it did not glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the heart of JULIA. But there was no choice in the caſe, and ſhe followed her guides—arrived, they led her into an upper appartment, where there was a fire and good furniture—She was left alone for ten minutes; at the end of which the landlord waited upon her, and aſked what ſhe choſe for ſupper. "Nothing."—What did ſhe chooſe to drink? "Nothing."— "Oh, oh, (replied he) an' if ſo be that you are ſo <hi>ruſty,</hi> good night to you, with all my heart." He then turned upon his heels; and pulling the door after him with fury, locked it with a key, which grated as it turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, amidſt the rattling of chains and the clanking of iron bars.</p>
            <p>Dreadful ſounds to the ear of JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA—her teeth grated, and her joints trembled—this was the ſevereſt ſtroke
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:039105_0048_10139CF5E551F098"/>
of all. To be impriſoned! and as an accomplice of a highwayman too!— But ſhe ſubmitted to Heaven.</p>
            <p>At length the ſoul, by its powerful and violent plunging, overcame the body—Wearied with affliction, her ſpirit languiſhed, and nature ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſlumber. Sleep of this kind, though not always the moſt placid, is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt—ſhe ſlept till eight in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when ſhe aroſe—at nine they paid her a viſit, and ſhe ate ſome breakfaſt; and at ten ſhe was carried, with a beating heart, in a coach to Bow ſtreet.</p>
            <p>Here ſhe did not wait long for the appearance or the juſtice, for every thing was prepared; even the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py highwayman was in waiting, as neceſſary to the examination.—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it was thought moſt proper to begin queſtioning him apart upon the ſubject, and then with examining JU<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>LIA! and by the compariſon of their reſpective evidences the truth might be eaſily diſcovered.</p>
            <p>When the highwayman had been
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:039105_0049_10139CBF1976BCE0"/>
examined upon his own account, an obſtinacy, natural to men in his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſituation, prevented him from giving any account of the purſe which was miſſing. But now when he was informed that JULIA was really in cuſtody, that honor which was not yet entirely extinguiſhed in his heart, was rouſed for her ſafety—he ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly told SIR JOHN the hiſtory of the purſe, with even its moſt minute cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; that he had robbed her among the reſt; that he afterwards met her accidentally in the bagnio, and gave her the money only with a view of reſtoring her own, that he had not been above ten minutes in her company, and that ſhe was in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery reſpect innocent of the crime with which ſhe was charged.</p>
            <p>JULIA was next examined, and her evidence moſt exactly ſquared with the former. Ingenuous as uſual, ſhe took up the ſtory at Elmwood, and carried it forward to the event of the purſe; and ſhe told her little tale with that truth and ſimplicity which can
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:039105_0050_10139CF76E4AD868"/>
never be counterfeited. She added that there was <hi>ſomewhere</hi> in town a perſon who could confirm her words beyond ſuſpicion! but alas! poor JOE! ſhe knew not where to find him.
<q>JOE! (ſaid one of the juſtice's men, who ſtood behind JULIA)—what is your name JULIA, Madam?</q>
— "Yes." (replied JULIA)—The man immediately ran out, and brought back in his hand the <hi>Daily Advertiſer,</hi> in which he read the following adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement:
<floatingText type="letter">

            </p>
            <p>This very extraordinary advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is copied <hi>verbatim et literatim</hi> from the real paper, which I have
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:039105_0051_10139CC09F244270"/>
now in my poſſeſſion—JULIA liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it with attention, and confeſſed her feelings in her eyes, which gliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with expectations. Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with aural information, ſhe ſnatched the paper, and devoured the precious morſel with her own eyes. In ſhort the ſimplicity of the thing ſpoke for itſelf, and JOE it was moſt undoubtedly.</p>
            <p>But it may be neceſſary to explain this affair. I again ſummon the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of my readers back to the time of our hiſtory when JOE and JULIA unluckily parted in Holborn—JOE did not look for her till the coach ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the inn-yard, and then he wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the door of it for her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He thought her long in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but his patience was not exhauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the reſt of the company had been out of the coach ſome minutes. At length he ventured to thruſt in his head—but ſhe was not there! He ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted back on his heel, and gazed wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly round the yard but in vain. Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to him he ſaw the door of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:039105_0052_10139CFA57A65240"/>
room open, and he ruſhed in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceremony: from thence he ſallied into the kitchen, ſtrode into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, threw his eye into the bar, and peeped into the larder. He marched into the ſtables, and in ſhort every place where he ſaw a door open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him—but all would not do: ſhe was not to be found. He returned to the coach, took one peep more into it, but all was ſolitary! "God bleſs my heart (ſaid JOE to himſelf, fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and ſcratching among his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn hair) proteſt and ſave me from all temptations and evil ſpirits! I wiſh could ſee Miſs JULIA again." Now at laſt, he bethought himſelf of what he ought to have done at firſt, viz. to queſtion the coachman concerning the affair, and the coachman infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him of the whole truth. This information in no degree abated his anxiety.—"Didn't ſhe leave no word with you for me?" (ſaid he to the coachman.) "No."—"Don't you now where ſhe went?"—"No."</p>
            <p>Don't you think ſhe'll come here
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:039105_0053_10139CC351FBD220"/>
this night?"—"I can't tell you, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my word."—JOE, with downcaſt looks and folded arms, meaſured the ſpace acroſs the yard with long and melancholy ſtrides. He walked into the paſſage of the houſe, and marked the clock—he counted the hours as they rolled, ſlow and heavy, but he ſaw not his miſtreſs—it was now ten o'clock, but no JULIA came.</p>
            <p>They are not the ſevereſt, but they are the moſt anxious moments the mind knows, when the poſſeſſor of it, ſimple, timid, and honeſt, feels him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf far from home, and forſaken, in the midſt of ſtrangers—theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments JOE now felt in all their bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs —he went to bed without hope, and he aroſe in the morning with deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair —he grieved inceſſantly, and he wiſhed for the boſom of a friend to receive his ſorrows—at length he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed his mind to the hoſtler, and the hoſtler gave him his advice— It was this: <hi>To advertiſe</hi>—"Every<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>body (he ſaid) did it, upon every ſubject. Always, when he loſt
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:039105_0054_10139CFCDD964F70"/>
               <hi>horſe,</hi> he advertiſed for it; and why might not JOE do the ſame now for <hi>JULIA</hi>?—It would certainly lay open the whole affair, for advertiſements could do any thing."</p>
            <p>At this time JOE ſtood too greatly in need of comfort, not to take any advice that was offered to him.—But he thought this advice excellent. He accordingly wrote, with great care, the advertiſement we have already repeated, and the hoſtler ſent one of his boys with him to the <hi>Daily Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſer.</hi> And this is the hiſtory of this extraordinary advertiſement.</p>
            <p>When the juſtice found ſo many circumſtances ſpontaneouſly conſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to vindicate her innocence—that her amiable ſimplicity ſubjected her to ſo many dangers, and that ſhe was the object rather of a polite humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than of perſecution, he reſolved to intereſt himſelf in her ſafety—and, in the firſt place, he ordered one of his men to go and conduct JOE to his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs —as to the fat woman, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtrate
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:039105_0055_10139CC4D85ECCD0"/>
told her that her money ſhould be taken care of; and the highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was remanded to priſon.</p>
            <p>JOE arrived—ſuffice it to ſay, that <hi>JULIA</hi> preſſed him warmly by the hand, and half cried with joy; and JOE took faſt hold of the ſkirt of her robe, as if he dreaded her running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him once more.</p>
            <p>The friends thus met, the juſtice politely aſked <hi>JULIA</hi> how he could moſt effectually ſerve her? She replied, that her only buſineſs in town was to deliver letters to Lord C—, and that if he would favour her with a guide thither, ſhe would always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him with the moſt unfeigned gratitude—this ſhe obtained; and, once more acknowledging her obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the juſtice, they all ſet off for Berkley-ſquare.</p>
            <p>Here they ſoon arrived, the guide leaving them at the door.—JOE im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately took of his hat, for he thought it high treaſon to be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within ſix yards of a <hi>Lord's</hi> door —they knocked, but were told by the

porter his Lordſhip was not at home —<hi>JULIA</hi> ſaid ſhe was ſorry for that, becauſe ſhe had <hi>letters of importance</hi> for him. "I can't help that (anſwered the porter) he's not at home; and he'll not be home—I don't know when he'll be home." "But could not you gueſs, Sir?—becauſe a <hi>great deal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it.</hi>"—"Lord Ma'am! (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the liveried Cerberus) I tell you I know nothing about it."—Sounds ſo ungentle, uttered by ſo rude a voice, frightened <hi>JULIA</hi> effectually, and ſhe haſtened away from the door; and JOE, ſorrowful enough, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to follow—when the porter beckoned him back with a <hi>hem</hi>! and the motion of his ſinger. "Pray, my lad, (ſaid this dog in office) who is that?"</p>
            <p>"My miſtreſs" (anſwered JOE.)</p>
            <p>"Aye—From the country, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?"</p>
            <p>"Yes (replied JOE:) I come from the country too.</p>
            <p>"O—ſo I ſee—ſo I ſee.—You are not

            <p>"No, Sir, (ſaid JOE)—not with <hi>all</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>"Why, then—(come hither—your ear a moment) I have the honour to be Lord C—'s porter; and my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has ordered me—that is, I and my maſter have agreed—to receive no let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters here unleſs the bearer gives me a crown.—However, as you and your miſtreſs are ſtrangers, and I am a man of honor, I'll be more merciful to you, and ſo conſent to take only half-a-crown—but mum—ſly—not a word for your life—for if my maſter was to hear I <hi>take ſo little,</hi> he'd turn me out of my place."</p>
            <p>"Sure I am, Maſter (anſwered JOE) indeed we are both very much obliged to you for being ſo kind.— But then what can you do for us, if ſo be that my Lord a'n't at home?" Pſhaw, man!

               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:039105_0058_10139D028003F7A0"/>"O—an' that be all (replied JOE) I can pay the money myſelf."</p>
            <p>He drew out his laſt half-crown and gave it. He then ran after <hi>JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA,</hi> and as he went he murmured to himſelf—"Icod tho', wern't that a <hi>Lord's</hi> houſe, it looks hugely like bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and corruption."</p>
            <p>Our travellers now returned, and were received by the porter with a more gracious complaiſance. He now informed them, that, tho' his Lordſhip was out of town, he was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his villa, and would certainly return to town to dinner; but that if they were in a hurry, the young Lord was at home, and that he had leave to open his father's letters in his abſence. JULIA delivered her pacquet to the porter, and they were ordered to walk into the anti-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The letters were ſent up to the noble youth in his dreſſing-room.</p>
            <p>Now in order to prepare my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for a very important aera in the life of my heroine, it may be neceſſary
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:039105_0059_10139CCA484464E0"/>
to relate what this noble youth was —A fooliſh grandmother had left him three thouſand a year, independent of his father, and of his age; all which, with three thouſand more, he gallantly ſpent like a man of ſpirit, long before the year was expired— He aſſerted, that every kingdom in Europe contributed to furniſh his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio: he only meant by this, that he kept in pay one French, one Spaniſh, one Italian, one Scandinavian, one German, one Iriſh, and one Britiſh nymph, all at one time; which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually did. He was deep in the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of hazard, and knew DEMOIVRE better than the Decalogue.—He had killed five waiters, and ſhot two eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics. —He boaſted too, that he had killed fifteen women, by <hi>breaking their hearts</hi> with a hopeleſs paſſion. This, however, was (to uſe an old and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Engliſh phraſe) a <hi>lie</hi>: for he never killed but one woman, and that was by <hi>breaking</hi>—not her <hi>heart,</hi> but her <hi>neck.</hi> Suffice it to ſay, that his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were elegantly infamous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:039105_0060_10139D075A829F00"/>Such was the youth to whom the letter of the father of <hi>JULIA</hi> was carried. He-opened it, and on read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the following paragraph,</p>
            <p>"I have preſumed my Lord, to ſend my DAUGHTER as the bearer of this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition," <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On reading this, he rung his bell with great haſte, and enquired if the <hi>bearer</hi> was below? Being informed that ſhe was, he flew down the ſtairs, and, looking in <hi>JULIA's</hi> face, with the moſt polite courteſy, deſired her to walk up ſtairs while he conſidered the tenor of her letter. The ſervants were ordered at the ſame time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct JOE into the hall, and be civil to him. <hi>JULIA</hi> aſcended after her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patron.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hic pauca deſunt.</hi> We muſt here paſs over the hiſtory of half an hour, becauſe it is not yet ripe for relation.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Lord C—'s Chaplain, who had been with his Lordſhip in the country, arrived at the houſe—he came home before his
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:039105_0061_10139CCCD35EE490"/>
Lordſhip, to finiſh ſome buſineſs of importance to himſelf before dinner-time —when he entered, he obſerved JOE ſtaring about in the hall, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him to be a ſtranger from the country, entered into converſation with him—he had not many queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to aſk, for JOE, with his uſual frankneſs, told him the whole hiſtory —about himſelf, about <hi>JULIA,</hi> and <hi>JULIA's</hi> buſineſs, and where ſhe was now, and with whom—now this Chaplain was plain in his manners, and equally plain in his dreſs—ſo plain, that he ſcarcely appeared to be <hi>of the cloth.</hi> Though an enemy to blood-ſhed, he was far from being a coward; though a churchman, he was no hypocrite; and though he would not ſubſcribe to the Thirty-nine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, he was allowed to be an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary man.</p>
            <p>The Chaplain having finiſhed his interview with JOE, was retiring to his own apartment. He had not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened his door, when a loud ſhriek ſaluted his ear—then another—and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:039105_0062_10139D09EAF17FF0"/>
A thouſand ideas ruſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his mind. He knew <hi>JULIA</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and he knew his young Lord by experience—there was no doubt of the buſineſs below.—He haſtened down the ſtairs, and liſtened a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the key-hole—he could only perceive that ſome perſons were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a violent ſtruggling, and that the chairs were knocked againſt each other—he tried to enter, but the door was locked.—Placing his ſhoulder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, therefore, he forced it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with gentleneſs and with eaſe. He entered; and lo! innocence was once more in diſtreſs!</p>
            <p>The hair of <hi>JULIA</hi> was diſhevelled, and a handkerchief was drawn cloſe over her mouth, which prevented her cries.—Her cloak and handkerchief lay upon the floor, and the arms of her raviſher were twined cloſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round her—a ſhoe had dropt from her foot, and many of the pins had quitted her boſom.—Unfortunate girl! continually doomed to be the prey of cowards and ſcoundrels!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:039105_0063_10139CD0B661BCD8"/>The noble youth quitted his hold when the Chaplain appeared, and, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to him, exclaimed, in a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening tone, "How dare you, Sir, force your impertinence upon <hi>me</hi> in my own dreſſing-room?"</p>
            <p>"My Lord (returned the young man, putting his left hand in his boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om, and giving him a full but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent look) —My Lord, does it ſuit your high ſpirit to be told, that you are the meaneſt—O by far the meaneſt creature in your father's houſe? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without worth—and proud, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dignity—yon are beneath the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant who caters for your appetites. —Poor, pitiful, wretched animal! I do not pull you by the noſe—I do not kick you on the breech—I do not laſh you round the room—I do not in any degree deign to chaſtiſe the wretch, who has ſtooped to inſult a beautiful, an unoffending woman—go then, you boaſter! retire into your cloſet, bluſh in private; and remember that you have reduced yourſelf to be forced to hear theſe ſtinging truths, even from
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:039105_0064_10139D0C8ED7FCE0"/>
ſo humble a man as your father's Chaplain. I ſcorn, Sir, to tell your father that you are a ſcoundrel; but do not forget that for the future I conſider you as my inferior."</p>
            <p>He finiſhed; and taking JULIA by the hand, he led her out of the room, and drew the door behind him.— The dignity of manhood is reſiſtleſs—the peerling reddened, and the paſtor tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed.</p>
            <p>He conducted her into his own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and ſympathized with her in that ſtrain of humane politeneſs which is ever inſeparable from unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched minds—after ſhe had compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed herſelf, he diſtantly enquired (as if he had not known) into her buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—this was exactly a repetition of JOE's narration.—"I thank you Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, (ſaid he) for your politeneſs. You will ſee Lord C—in about an hour; but previouſly I think it my duty to inform you of what ought not to be longer concealed from you —It is now one o'clock—Exactly at ten—about three hours ago—
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:039105_0065_10139CD35E3A4800"/>
Lord C—appointed me to the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you are come to ſolicit." This information in no degree ſtartled JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, nor unruffled her features. She obſerved, that ſince her father had not been lucky enough to obtain the vicarage, ſhe was happy the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was beſtowed upon a man who reſembled him ſo much in his virtues.</p>
            <p>At the time ſpecified Lord C— arrived. JULIA was introduced to him by the Chaplain, and he ſent to his ſon for her letters. On reading them he confirmed what the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain had mentioned.</p>
            <p>He then turned to JULIA, ſaluted her with that virtuous freedom for which he was always remarkable, and fondly converted with her about the moments he had ſpent with her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fifty years ago—he next inſiſted that ſhe ſhould ſtay with him two or three days; to which ſhe with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt difficulty aſſented, and of which ſhe informed her parent by letter. When the young Lord heard that JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA was to continue her viſit, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:039105_0066_10139D0E31F71B70"/>
ſome pretence for retiring to his father's villa till her departure.</p>
            <p>Need I mention, that the Chaplain felt the force of the eyes of JULIA! from the moment he firſt ſaw her in tears, his heart was wounded to the core—the tears of a fine woman are more eloquent than the lip of Tully,</p>
            <l>—Unſkilful they</l>
            <l>Who dreſs the Queen of Love in wanton ſmiles;</l>
            <l>Brighteſt ſhe ſhines amidſt a ſhow'r of tears:</l>
            <l>The graces that adorn her beauty moſt</l>
            <l>Are ſoftneſs, ſenſibility, and pity.</l>
            <p>It was during the ſpace allotted for dinner, that the firſt mutual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of tenderneſs took place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Chaplain and his adored JULIA: I ſay the ſpace <hi>allotted</hi> for din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as either party were too much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed in the intereſts of the heart, to fulfil the demands of hunger—he had ſcarcely performed the firſt cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the table, by invoking the bleſſing of Omnipotence upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, ere he riveted his eyes upon the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:039105_0067_10139CD5F3B30FC8"/>
harmonized viſage of his beloved maid, who ſat, unconſcious of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oration, in a ſtate half tranquilized; her delicate ſyſtem had not fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the tone of calmneſs; ſhe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yet fluttered at the remembrance of the dangers ſhe had paſſed, and would have been more than ordinary depreſſed with awe, had not the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle old Peer, as ardently exerciſed the firſt principle of politeneſs, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling her to her ſituation, through the medium of attention.</p>
            <p>There are moments when it might be imagined that inviſible ſylphs were buoyant, to direct the ſtruggles of the ſoul, and cunningly lay open the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the heart by an apparent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, when the powers of language were denied by diſcretion, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by terror: it was in one of thoſe important moments, when a recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great ſervices which had been rendered her by the young divine, came full upon her mind; and as we are ſolicitous to contemplate what we eſteem, ſhe modeſtly lifted up her eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:039105_0068_10139D1340137478"/>
to regard her preſerver, who, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her aim, collected ſuch a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fire into his viſion, that when the azure orbs of JULIA came in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect line with thoſe of the Chaplain, the lambent beam ſhot through her ſweet frame; confounded the domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of her ſenſes, and encloſed her warm heart—ſhe felt the unuſual throbbing, and ſhrunk, like a ſenſitive plant, within herſelf, as wiſhing to hide what was unavoidable, from the obſervation of her aſſociates.</p>
            <p>This occurrence emboldened her admirer to open the ſecond battery of his affection, by making the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing requeſt: "Ma—Ma—Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, will you do me the honor, to take a glaſs of wine?" to this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal the gladdening JULIA aſſented, by an inclination of her fair body; and while ſhe ſipped the roſy liquor, her cheek was more highly ſuffuſed with red, than the beverage ſhe as ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbibed—the trembling of her hand made the glaſs vibrate on her pearly teeth—ſhe panted with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:039105_0069_10139CD78C3EFAB0"/>
yet looked with celeſtial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity.</p>
            <p>For thoſe coarſe and unenviable perſons, who have never known the bewitching influence of love, and its undeſcribable movements in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, this recital can have no force: but with thoſe whoſe organization is more delicate, it will have ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt—each will conceive, in the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of feeling, what I am not able to delineate with my pen, and acquire a temporary gratification, by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all that JULIA felt, in a novel embarraſſment ſo luxuriantly painful —the Chaplain was ſcarcely leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded: he was agonized with the wiſh for an opportunity to be more explicit—the ſuppreſſion of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory ſentiments to the object of his pure regard, which were to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the tendencies of his future life, created a pain within his heart, and twice a ſigh burſt from its core, and would have iſſued from his lips, if his correct judgment had not whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, that it would be hazarding an
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:039105_0070_10139D15C7D25D78"/>
emotion, in the preſence of a third perſon, which was not ſtrictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with policy, and might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending if not injurious to his delect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able JULIA.</p>
            <p>It is on trials like theſe, that the accompliſhments ariſing from a refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed education, can meliorate the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful demands of inclination: and they are ſo highly profitable, that in proportion as we exerciſe ſelf-denial, we are but preparing the ſenſes for a richer banquet—it was not ordained that we ſhould make the overtures of love with a beſtial precipitation, and leap over that chain of progreſſive bliſſes, which emenate from the ſoft adminiſtration of ſympathy.</p>
            <p>When the mere groſs pleaſure of the table had paſſed, and the Chaplain had fervently made his acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Almighty for his great bounty, the venerable Nobleman tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towards his gentle gueſt, with a mien fraught with the ſincereſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and looking with ineffable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, aſked her how ſhe approved of
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:039105_0071_10139CDB52BE10B0"/>
the metropolis, as he underſtood that ſhe had never been in town before. —JULIA replied, with ſome heſitation, that her knowledge of London, and indeed of ſociety in general was ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry limited, that ſhe ſhould but expoſe her ignorance of both, and, perhaps, do a common wrong, by venturing her ideas upon a theme ſhe ſo ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood—that ſhe had found ſome of the beſt axioms of theory over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the practices of a buſy world, and that before ſhe preſumed to draw a final opinion, ſhe would endeavour to know more, as it were probable the baſer part of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, might be very inferior in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and influence to thoſe who were exemplary: at leaſt ſhe would indulge that hope, until conviction denied her ſuch a cheering privilege.</p>
            <p>At the concluſion of the well-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged feſtivities of the board, Lord C—requeſted the Chaplain to ſhew his fair viſitant, the pictures in the gallery, which comprehended ſome of the moſt perfect performances of the ancient and modern maſters.</p>
            <p>

of his ſon, in the inſtant that he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved— thoſe orders had not been deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered many hours before his arrival was announced—he commanded him into his preſence, and, with an air of parental dignity, addreſſed him thus: "My Son, for ſuch I am <hi>compelled</hi> to believe you are, I require you to tell me, upon what principle <hi>you think</hi> our reciprocal duties are to be maintained towards each other?"—"This queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my Lord, is ſo very ſingular and unexpected, that I ſcarcely know how to frame an anſwer, adequate to your deſires."—"Why then, Sir, I will relieve you from this embarraſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inform you, it is <hi>Juſtice</hi>;" —"Certainly my Lord."—"Then as you admit the principle, give me leave to aſk you, if you hold it as juſt, that the powerful ſhould oppreſs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs?"—"Aſſuredly not, my Lord."—"Perhaps you will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as reaſonable, that the aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be expiated by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?"—"To what do all theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual

queſtions tend?—you appear to me, my Lord, to be drawing me into a ſtate of reſponſibility in which I am not intereſted."—"Indeed you are, Sir; and intereſted in a very great degree."—"How, my Lord?"—"I will tell you Sir: you have had the meanneſs and the audacity to inſult an amiable young lady, under my roof, and I inſiſt that you immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately write her a letter of atonement, and aſk her forgiveneſs."—"My Lord, you may have been miſinform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this matter; give me permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to explain the circumſtances."— "I underſtand ſo much of the truth already, Sir, that an explanation may increaſe, but cannot do away your diſhonor, ſo, without any heſitation, take up the pen, and write to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy what I ſhall dictate."—"You will recollect, my Lord, that JULIA is not my equal."—"According to the laws of politeneſs, Sir, every woman is every man's ſuperior; and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the laws of morality, ſhe is an angel, and you are a—but I will

            <p>While the venerable old Peer was in the act of preparation to ſeal and ſubſcribe this letter, in order that it might be ſent to JULIA, the Curate entered, but, in ſeeing the object of his recent reſentment, he was going to retire, under the apprehenſion that he might be tranſacting ſome private buſineſs with his father.—"Stop, Sir, (ſaid the old nobleman,) I want you to be witneſs to an act of retribution; read this letter, and then inform me if the apology is proportioned to the offence." The manly eccleſiaſtic pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed the epiſtle with a mixture of pleaſure and aſtoniſhment, and when he had concluded, approached the young gentleman with an air of inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable kindneſs; and taking him by the hand, exclaimed, how happy would

it be for human-kind, if all tranſgreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions were thus underſtood, and thus obliterated. "You muſt not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed my Lord, (added he, turning to his patron) if I feel ſenſations near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approaching to ecſtaſy, on this theme, as the object of this letter has conſented to be my wife."—"Your wife!" ejaculated both in the ſame inſtant! "It is even ſo, (rejoined the worthy Curate) provided your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has no objection to the union." So far am I, Sir, from diſapproving your choice, that I muſt inſtantly go and give the bride elect joy; and you my ſon, ſhall go too, and prove, by your preſent demeanor, that you are aſhamed of the paſt: this is a duty that all will fulfill with cheerfulneſs: When virtue is rewarded all that think ſhould rejoice."</p>
            <p>Here let the reader ponder upon the undeſcribable emotions, which played about the ſuſceptible heart of JULIA, from the momentous period that ſhe was left with the Curate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſhe was congratulated on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

from the altar, by the man who had attempted to deſtroy her digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peace—but it was a chain of events ſo diverſified and ſo luxuriant, that no vulgar mind can accompany the progreſſion. When a man of honor ſolicits the hand of a woman of virtue, the god of marriage aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes a nobler port than uſual, and charms with a reflected grace—then his fetters are owned to be ſilken, and his influence derived from heaven.</p>
