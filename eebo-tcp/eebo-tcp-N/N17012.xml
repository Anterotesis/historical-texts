            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>To be sure I have. Let me see,—I shou'd like a woman an inch or two less than six feet high now, and thick in proportion: By my body, such a woman wou'd look noble by the side of me when she was entient.</p>

                        <stage>to Frankton</stage> I have a letter here, which announces to my father, my intention to leave the West-Indies the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of March, but I miss'd of the expected conveyance—I have half a mind to send it yet. I would not have him apprized
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021926_0010_0FB6144C1524A4B8"/>
of my arrival; for I wish to try if he would know me;—and yet I long to embrace my aged and venerable parent. Will you do me the favour to take this letter to my father, Mr. Cubb? He lives at number two hundred and fifty, in Queen-street, in a three story red brick house.—I'll reward you for it.</p>

                     <p>As for your rewards, I'm above it, d'ye see: If I do it, I'll do it without fear or reward, as the saying is; but if you think fit, you may treat a body to the valuation of a mug or so. Don't you love ale? for they says how the Yorkers is cursed fellows for strong beer.</p>

                     <speaker>Humphry.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, if I was for to have my beer a-board before I go, I shou'dn't get top-heavy, as the saying is; for I can carry as much weight in my head as e'er a he that wears a head, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out staggering.</p>

                     <p>Yes, you're right—I know what you mean; I've got it here a little, as old Mr. Scourage says. <stage>Exeunt Frankton and Loveyet.</stage> But as for what you said just now—no, no, Sir; I'll never foutre you, I warrant you—I always curses and swears in plain English, d'ye see—I—what's he gone? I hope he won't come back again for the sixth time; three times has he been in and out within the circumference of a minute. But I won't stay here no longer—I'll go and try if I can't find out where Doll lives, my old sweetheart; I an't so poor, but what I can buy her a ribbon or so; and, if all comes to all, I can get a new pair o'breeches too; for, to be sure, this one doesn't look quite so decent, and if that doesn't fetch her, the devil shall, as the old saying is. I'm cursedly afraid, I shan't be able to find out her quarters.</p>

                     <p>Yes, as my last resource, Assemblies, I should abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely be in a state of despair before Spring.—Then one may take an excursion on York or Long-Island—an agreeable sail on the East-river—a walk in the Broad-way, Pharisee like, to be seen of men, and—to see them—and then how refreshing to take a negligent stroll on the Battery, the Fort, the Mall, and from thence to Miss Such-a-one, then to Mrs. Such-a-one, then to Lady What's-her-name, and then home;—but now I am half of my time as motionless as Pitt's statue; as petrified and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate as an Egyptian mummy, or rather frozen snake, who crawls out of his hole now and then in this season to bask in the rays of the sun.</p>

If your spirits are despress'd, what so replete with that which can revive them as the laughter-loving Thalia? If the foibles and vices of human nature ought to suffer correction, in what way can they be satiriz'd so happily and successfully as on the stage;—or if elegance of language, and refinement of sentiment—</p>

                     <speaker>Harriet,</speaker>
                     <p>You dislike every good thing I have mentioned this morning, Maria,—except one.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>What's that, my dear?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>Mr. Frankton.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>Ha, ha. Why, to be sure, the good things of this life are not to be despis'd, and men are not the worst crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures belonging to this life, nor Mr. Frankton the worst of men, but—apropos, about plays—did you observe how much I was affected the other night at the tragedy of Zara?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>I really did not—I wish I had seen such a pleasing proof of your sensibility.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh, you cruel creature!—wish to see your friend in tears?</p>

                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis rather unusual to see a lady of your taste and spirit, either weep at a pathetic incident in tragedy, or laugh at a comic scene; and as for the gentlemen, your lads of spirit, such as are falsely called <hi>ladies' men,</hi> they are not so masculine as to understand, and therefore not so effeminate as to weep;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021926_0013_0FB61451B7D7F5A0"/>
tho' one would conclude, from their effeminacy in appearance and behaviour, that they would cry if you were to look at them.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>To be sure, a little matter will draw tears from the feminine part of mankind.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>For your part, you seem'd to be neither laughing nor crying, but rather displeas'd and uneasy.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh, you mistake the matter entirely, my dear; your skill in physiognomy is but indifferent, I find—why, after the tragedy was over, I laugh'd most inordinately for a considerable time.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, you must know, my dear, Mr. Frankton sat in the box opposite to the one I was in.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, I know your dear Mr. Frankton was in the opposite box.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>My dear Mr. Frankton! Did I say so? Why I could not say more of him, were he my husband.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>If you conform to custom, you would not say so much of a husband.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>But I did not say any such thing.—Says I, you must know, my dear Harriet,—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>No, no, there was no Harriet mentioned.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>But I say there was—so, as I was going to tell you, you must know, my dear Harriet, that Mr. Frankton sat oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to me at the Theatre; and as he seem'd to be very much chagrin'd at the attention which was paid me by a couple of beaux, I took some pains to mortify him a little; for, tho' he strove to hide his uneasiness by chattering, and whispering, and tittering, and shewing his white teeth, his embarrassment was very visible under his affected unconcern.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>How exactly she has described her own situation and feelings! <stage>aside</stage>—I find that you acquire <hi>your skill in physiognomy</hi> from sympathy; or from making suitable comparisons, and drawing natural inferences from them; but now for the remainder of your pleasant anecdote, Maria.</p>

                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>So, I was extremely civil to my two worshipping votaries, grinn'd when they did, and talk'd as much nonsense as either of them. During this scene of mock-gallantry, one of my love-sick swains elevated his eyes in a most languishing manner; and, clasping his sweet, unlucky hands together rather eagerly, my little dog <hi>Muff</hi> happen'd to be in the way, by which means my pet was squeez'd rather more than it lik'd, and my Adonis's finger bit by it so feelingly, that it would have

delighted you to see how he twisted his soft features about, with the excruciating anguish. Ha, ha, ha.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>Ha, ha, ha. Exceeding ludicrous indeed!—But pray, my dear careless, sprightly Maria, was you not a little nettled to see Mr. Frankton and his nymphs so great? And are you not deeply in love with each other, notwithstanding your coquetry at the Theatre, and his levity at the Assembly?—Yes, yes,—your aversion to the dancing last night was only pretence. I hope when your hearts are cemented by wedlock, you will both do better.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>It will be well if I do no worse; but, to hear you talk, one would swear you were not in love yourself.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>Love is an amiable weakness, of which our sex are peculiarly susceptible.</p>

                     <p>Ha, ha, ha; <hi>of which our sex are peculiarly susceptible</hi>—what an evasion!—and so my dear lovelorn, pensive, sentimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, romantic Harriet has never experienced that same <hi>amiable weakness</hi> which, it seems, the weaker sex is so susceptible of. But I won't teaze you about Mr. Loveyet any more; adieu.</p>

                     <p>Charming as ever! By all that's beautiful, a Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim is nothing to her! And as for Cherubims, when they compete with her.</p>

                     <p>Well, if you had let me proceed, I should have told you that if one more like them could be found in town, they would make a more beautiful triple than the three renowned
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021926_0016_0FB6145E79C8FFD0"/>
goddesses who were candidates for beauty and a golden apple long ago; but no matter now.—The account you have given of the lovely Harriet, has rekindled the flame she so early inspir'd me with, and I already feel myself all the lover; how then shall I feel, when I once more behold the dear maid, like the mother of mankind—"with grace in all her steps, heaven in her eye; in every gesture, dignity and love!"</p>

                     <speaker>Frankton.</speaker>
                     <p>Did you suppose he would object to the alliance then?</p>

                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>

                     <p>Well, I can now inform you that your hope has a better basis to rest on, and that there is as fair a prospect of its being shortly swallowed up in fruition as ever Cupid and Hymen presented to a happy mortal's view.—For your farther comfort, I have the pleasure to acquaint you, that Mr. Trueman is equally fond of the match.</p>

                     <p>Yes, she is nearly related to his family, and as the stile in which they live, corresponds with her former prosperity better than the present ineligible situation of her father does, he has granted them her valuable company, after their repeated solicitations had prov'd the sincerity of their regard.</p>

                     <p>But how do you account for Mr. Trueman's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, since fortune has lately put it so much in Harriet's power to relieve him from it? I dare not think it arises from her want of filial regard; I do not know any thing so likely to abate the ardour of my attachment as a knowledge of that; but it is an ungenerous suggestion, unworthy the benignity and tenderness of the gentle Harriet.</p>

                     <speaker>Frankton.</speaker>
                     <p>It is so.—Two things, on the part of the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, are the cause: his pride will not suffer him to be the subject of a daughter's bounty; and his regard for that daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's welfare, makes him fearful of being instrumental in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing her fortune.</p>

                     <p>I will remove your suspense.—There is a Mr. Worthnought, a thing by some people call'd a man, a beau, a fine gentleman, a smart fellow; and by others a coxcomb, a puppy, a baboon and an ass.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frankton.</speaker>
                     <p>Nothing; only he visits Miss Harriet frequently.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>
                     <p>Hah!—and does she countenance his addresses?</p>

                     <speaker>Frankton.</speaker>
                     <p>I'll explain.—He imagines she is fond of him, because she does not actually discard him; upon which presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021926_0018_0FB61461B5856A80"/>
he titters, capers, vows, bows, talks scraps of French, and sings an amorous lay—with such an irresistably languishing air, that she cannot do less than compliment him—on the fineness of his voice, for instance; the smartness of his repartees, the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy of his wit, the gaiety and vivacity of his temper, his genteel carriage, his handsome person, his winning address, his—</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frankton.</speaker>
                     <p>To be serious then,—the sum total of the affair, I take to be this.—In order to kill a heavy hour, she sometimes suffers the fool to be in her company, because the extravagance of his behaviour, and the emptiness of his upper region furnish her with a good subject for ridicule; but <hi>your</hi> presence will soon make him dwindle into his primitive insignificance.</p>

                     <p>Harkee, Mr. Loveyet, I will propound a problem to you. We will suppose there are two parallel lines drawn on this floor, which notwithstanding they may be very contiguous

my part, I know that much of the good things of this world is better than not enough—that a man can live longer upon a hundred thousand pounds than one thousand pounds—that if, the more we have the more we want, the more we have the more we make—and that it is better to make hay while the sun shines <hi>against</hi> a rainy day, when I shall be upon my last legs, than to work and toil like an ass <hi>in</hi> the rain; so it plainly appears that money is the root of all good;—that's my logic.—I long to see the young rogue tho'—I dare say he looks very like his father;—but, had I thought old Trueman wou'd have us'd me so ill, I wou'd not have wrote for him yet; for he shall not have his old sweetheart:—if he offers to disobey me in this respect, by my body, I'll disinherit the ungracious dog immediately.</p>

                     <p>I only judge of your heart, by your tongue; and the abundance of the former is generally inferred from the speech of the latter.—Yes, yes—that constant, hypocritical heart of your's is now throbbing with love, hope, curiosity, and—a thousand speechless sensations, the improper subject of which, I do not hesitate to declare, is odious man; and that man, the accomplished Mr. Loveyet.</p>

                     <p>Well, well, it shall not be serv'd like Tantalus any more: <hi>he</hi> was doom'd to behold; and, beholding, to wish and languish for the tempting draught, in vain: but a better doom awaits the happy Harriet;—what <hi>she</hi> desires is not thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, but will soon be obtain'd, and—</p>

                     <p>Well, I will not keep you in suspense any longer. Old Mr. Loveyet has received a letter from his son, signifying his intention to leave the West-Indies shortly after its date, so you may expect to see him very soon.

                     <speaker>Maria.</speaker>
                     <p>But my time is precious; I am just going to the widow Affable's:—about twelve months ago she paid me a visit, when, agreeably to the form in such cases made and provided, she beg'd I would be more sociable, and she would take it so kindly of me:—accordingly I shall step in <hi>en passant,</hi> to shew her my sociability and kindness, which I shall, perhaps, repeat at the end of another year.</p>

                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>How can you be so cruel? The pleasure I experience in your society, makes me regret that any one should be deprived of it.</p>

                     <p>That is very strange:—I should imagine, if you priz'd my company so much, you would wish me to withold it from others; because, the more I bless them with my presence, the less will come to your share, you know, my dear;—nor is it easy to conceive how you could be so found of my sweet person, without being jealous at the partiality of others;—but, after all, good people, they say, are scarce; and my humble admirers shall find the saying verified in me; because they are not fully sensible of my superior value; but, since your prove the contrary, by extolling my conversation and friendship so much, I likewise shall observe a contrary conduct, and indulge you with a <hi>tête à téte</hi> frequently, my dear.—But I have fifty places to call at

                     <p>I ever 'till now consider'd him as a respectful, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning person, as far as regarded myself; and as such, gave him a prudent share of my civilities; but I never thought either his intellects or his person sufficient to entitle him to a partial intimacy.</p>

My demeanour towards you was nothing but the effect of chearfulness and politeness; qualities which, I believe, are inherent in me, and of which, therefore, all with whom I am acquainted are the objects; but your present unmanly and insupportably impudent discourse, makes me despise myself almost as much as you, for allowing such a wretch even that small degree of attention which he so illy deserved.</p>

                     <p>It is necessary you should be made acquainted with some of his oddities: his most striking peculiarity is a desire to be thought younger than he is; and, I dare say, some remark of my father, respecting his age, is the only cause of his present ill humor.</p>

                     <p>Those fond expectations, my lovely partner in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, shall soon be realized;—this is only the momentary caprice of old age.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, my fair monitor; I shall think of that: and now permit me, in my turn, to give you a little advice.—In the first place, I would have you go to your father—fall at his feet—clasp your fair hands, thus—beseeching him in such terms as that gentle heart is so well form'd to dictate, and persuading him with the all-prevailing music of that tuneful voice, to recall his rigorous intention, nor doom such angelic goodness and beauty to despair, by persisting to oppose an alliance which alone can make you blest; and without which, the most faithful of lovers will be rendered the most wretched one on earth. I shall take a similar method with my old gentleman, and I think I can insure myself success.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>This is all very fine; but—to have the voluntary consent of the parent one loves,—how infinitely more agreeable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would not offend mine, for the world; and yet—</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>
                     <p>And yet you will be obliged to offend him, by having me, egh?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>Psha;—how strangely you misconstrue my meaning: I was going to observe, that I expect his obstinacy and pride will prove invincible, in spite of all the rhetoric you are pleased to ascribe to me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>
                     <p>Then we will employ a little rhetoric, against which another class of fathers are not quite so invincible.—Parsons are plenty, you know; and Gold and Silver are persuasive little words. <hi>Love</hi> inspires me with the spirit of prophecy, and tells me, I shall soon with propriety call the loveliest of her sex, mine.</p>

                     <p>I Sincerely lament this unfortunate dispute.—I know Harriet loves that young fellow, though he has been so long absent; and therefore I regret it; for, to what end do I live but to see her happy!—But I will not give way to his father;—perhaps he may think better of the matter, for I know him to be of a placable nature, though passionate;—and yet he seems to be inflexible in his resolution.</p>

of right, and the eternal fitness and aptitude of things, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly denominated a <hi>bona fide</hi> sight; for, as I before observed, it was <hi>ipso facto,</hi> a game, an Olympic game.—Olympic, from Olympus.</p>

                     <p>You are immensely illiterate; but I will reply to your interrogatory.—My opinion of the late war, is as follows, to wit.—<hi>Imprimis.</hi> The Americans were wise, brave and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous to struggle for that liberty, independence and happiness, which the new government will now render secure.—<hi>Item.</hi> The Americans were prodigious fortunate to obtain the said liberty, independence and happiness. A war, encounter, combat, or, if you please, fight like this, is great and glorious; it will immortalize the name of the renowned WASHINGTON,—more than that of Cincinnatus, Achilles, Aeneas, Alexander the Great, Scipio, Gustavus Vassa, Mark Anthony, Kouli Khan, Caesar or Pompey.</p>

                     <speaker>Trueman.</speaker>
                     <p>To tell you what is Latin for Constitution, will not make you a particle the wiser; I will therefore explain it in the vernacular tongue.—Constitution then, in its primary, abstract, and true signification, is a concatenation or coacerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of simple, distinct parts, of various qualities or properties, united, compounded, or constituted in such a manner, as to form or compose a system or body, when viewed in its aggregate or general nature. In its common, or generally received, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, it implies two things.—First, the nature, habit, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, organization or construction of the natural, corporeal, or animal system.—Secondly, a political system, or plan of government. This last definition, I apprehend, explains the Constitution you mean.</p>

                     <speaker>Humphry.</speaker>

                     <p>No! 'Tis not my fault then:—If plainness of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, clearness of description, and a grammatical arrangement of words will not suffice. I can do no more.</p>

                     <p>By the dignity of my profession, it must be so;—Now there's a solution to the enigma.—Mr. Loveyet, you will excuse my mistaking this business so much;—the paltry Frisieur never enter'd my head;—you recollect I gave him a little flagellation this morning.</p>

                     <p>Yes, and I recollect the occasion too:—this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded upstart Constitution, (that cause of all my crosses and troubles) is at the bottom of every mischief.</p>

counterpoised by that imaginary good; otherwise the titles of Honorable and Excellent would be always significant of his Honor's or his Excellency's intrinsic worth:—a thing "devoutly to be wish'd," but unfortunately too seldom exemplified; for, as the dramatic muse elegantly says of money,—"Who steals my purse, steals trash."</p>

                     <p>I see into the mistake; but the worst construction the affair will admit, does not justify his using you so indecently; and if it were not for the more powerful consideration of a daughter's happiness, I would make him repent it.</p>

                     <p>I have ever found my honored, my only parent, both wise in concerting plans for that daughter's happiness, and good in executing them to the utmost of his ability; and, I dare say, he does not think, her alliance with Mr. Loveyet's son, will prove unfavorable to her happiness.</p>

                     <p>Far from it, my child:—Your unusual good sense makes a common-place lecture unnecessary, Harriet; but beware of flattery and dissimulation; for the manners of the present age are so dissolute, that the young fellows of these degenerate days, think they cannot be fine gentlemen without being rakes, and—in short, rascals; for they make a merit even of debauching innocence:—indeed, that is scarcely to be wondered at, when so many of those who are called ladies of taste and fashion,

                     <p>Very true, madam:—by persons of easy notions of virtue, indeed, it would be considered a trifling <hi>faux pas,</hi> as the French call it; a perfect <hi>bagatelle;</hi> or, at most, a superficial act of incontinency; but to those who have such rigid notions of virtue as Miss Cantwell, for example, or Miss Herald, or their humble

servant; it appears quite another thing, quite another thing, ladies:—though it is one of my foibles;—I own it is a fault to be so intalerably nice about the affairs of women; but it is a laudable imperfection, if I may be allowed the phrase;—it is erring on the safe side, for women's affairs are delicate things to meddle with, ladies.</p>

                     <p>Very true, madam:—to make the matter still worse, ladies, Mr. Loveyet is just arrived from abroad to be married to her; and the old gentleman is going to ally him immediately to Miss Maria Airy in consequence of it.</p>

                     <p>I think I am even with the old gentleman now;—but I lament the necessity of this conduct; and, if a man could eat and digest matrimony, without a little matter of money, I would forgive my unreasonable father, with all my heart; and he might eat his gold himself; though, by the bye, this sum of money, in equity and good conscience, is mine.—Now he wants to cross my

                     <p>Notwithstanding the arrival of Charles, and the happy result of the interview with my father, my mind is not at ease;—these strange rumours must have some foundation;—one says he is married to Maria; another says, he is discovered to be illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; a third reports, he was found in company with a woman of ill same; and to conclude the catalogue of evil tidings, a fourth says, that old Mr. Loveyet is going to disinherit him, in consequence of his having made him a grandfather, since his arrival—But here he comes.</p>

                     <p>She seems very thoughtful;—perhaps she too has been unfortunate in her suit to her father;—or, what is far worse, perhaps,—but I will not cherish such gloomy apprehensions.—Your servant, Madam.</p>

                     <p>Good day, Mr. Loveyet.—"Your servant, Madam!"—What a stoical salutation! I fear there is too much truth in what I have heard.</p>

                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>An unlucky circumstance, indeed; but would the disappointment really be so great, if you were obliged to give up the thought of an alliance with me?</p>

                     <p>How, Miss Harriet! Give up the thought of having you!—BY heaven, it must be so!—Yes, the beau would never have presumed to say so much, if it were not so;—and Frankton's ambiguous account of them both, confirms the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion;—and then the extravagant encomiums he bestowed on her yesterday.—Confusion! my fears were just, though he ridicul'd me for exposing them.—But she must not see my anxiety.</p>

                     <p>If my doubts are well founded, he must be an adept in the art of dissimulation. I will try him a little farther.— <stage>Aside.</stage>—What think you, Mr. Loveyet, of our New-York beauties? Have not the superior charms of so many fine women, been able to overcome such old-fashioned notions as constancy and priority of affection?</p>

                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>
                     <p>I have beheld their beauty with equal pleasure and astonishment; and the understanding, the affability, and vivacity, by which strangers, with so much propriety, characterize my fair countrywomen, give them a pre-eminence over the ladies of most other countries, that is highly gratifying to a mind already so much attached to its native city, by the most endearing of all human ties;—they are all that the warmest, the most luxuriant fancy can wish; beautiful—almost beyond the possibility of an increase of charms; and—I had almost said, they furnish room for love and warm conceptions, "even to madness!"</p>

                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>I am in doubt no longer;—such passionate expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions must have Love for their prompter.</p>

                     <p>My friend Frankton extolled them highly; but his description derogates from their desort;—you too he praised;—I listened to him—with unspeakable delight, and believed him with all the ardor of faith and expectation; for I could readily believe that, which I had so often, so sweetly experienced;—but when you last blest my eyes with that enchanting form, how was the idea exceeded by the reality!—To do justice to <hi>such</hi> perfection, the praises I this minute bestowed on the ladies I have seen, would be spiritless and insufficient!—To charms like Miss Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riet's, what hermit could remain insensible!—<hi>I</hi> was not insensible;—the tender passion, I began so early to entertain; a passion, which length of absence and a succession of objects and events, had rendered too dormant, was then excited to sensations the most exquisitely sensible;—was then taught to glow with a flame, too fervent to be now suppressed!</p>

                     <p>With what indifference she hears me!—If she is so insensible to the genuine effusions of a heart like mine, I am lost indeed! But I will try a little deception to discover the truth. <stage>Aside.</stage>—What a lovely picture, Mr. Frankton drew of Miss Airy! But it was not too highly finished; for a thousand Loves and Graces have conspired, to make her the most accomplished of her sex.</p>

description of her, you say;—I dare say he did;—oh,—yes—yes— <stage>Appears disconcerted, by striving to hide her concern.</stage>—he loves her to distraction;—Mr. Frankton has doubtless made a wise choice.</p>

                     <p>By all that's false, she is concerned at Frankton's having praised his mistress! She absolutely loves him!</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>
                     <p>Forgive me, honor and veracity. <stage>Aside.</stage>—Yes, Miss Trueman; and not without a deep sense of her uncommon worth and beauty.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>I admire your discernment, sir;—Mr. Frankton too, is a very nice judge of female merit; and he cannot evince his judgment better, than by praising my friend Maria.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>
                     <p>Pardon me, madam: with submission to your friend's merit, I think his panegyric would better apply to you.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>That compliment is too great, to be meant, I fancy.</p>

                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>
                     <p>I rather think, you value the author of it so little, that you would as soon he should withold it, madam .</p>

                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>Certainly, sir, when I have reason to think there is another who has a better right to it, and for whom it is secretly intended.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>
                     <p>You wrong me much, madam;—some tatling gossip or designing knave, has whispered some falsehood to my preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice;—probably my <hi>rival,</hi>—Mr. Worthnought.</p>

                        <hi>Your</hi> duplicity, sir, both in word and action, justifies my retorting that ungenerous accusation.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>
                     <p>I entreat you to believe me, Miss Harriet, when I say, I am unconscious of having done any thing I ought to be ashamed of, since my arrival: I am so confident of this, that the circulation of a malicious rumor, however dishonorable to me, would give me little disquiet, did I not reflect, that it is the object of Harriet's credulity;—a reflection, that is the source of real unhappiness to me:—be kind then, Harriet, and tell me wherein I am guilty;—obscurity in a matter so interesting, gives more torture to the mind, than the most unwelcome truth.</p>

                     <p>He must be sincere. <stage>Aside.</stage>—Your request shall be comply'd with, sir.—The principal offence you are charged with, is your having been smitten by the lady, on whom you have bestowed such liberal commendation;—be that as it may,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:021926_0059_0FB614E4B3095690"/>
I heard Mr. Loveyet talk of such a match:—I believe it will require a more able advocate than yourself, to defend <hi>this</hi> cause.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>
                     <p>Suppose I assure you, on the sacred honor of a gentleman, that what you have heard is false;—suppose I add the more important sanction of an oath, to seal the truth.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harriet.</speaker>
                     <p>I will save you that trouble:—you have an advocate <hi>here,</hi> which has already gained your cause.</p>

                     <p>You say too much; and compel me to tell you that you merit my highest esteem.</p>

                     <speaker>Loveyet.</speaker>

                     <p>And yet I would fain attract your esteem too; for, I have heard connoisseurs in the science of love say, it is possible to <hi>love</hi> an object, and that to distraction, without having a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of <hi>esteem</hi> for it.</p>

                     <p>I have assured you that <hi>my</hi> esteem is at least equalled by a more passionate affection:—but how strangely you talk!—First you acknowledge yourself unworthy of my favor;—then you are alarmed that I should only esteem you; and when I talk of a passion, superior to mere <hi>Platonic</hi> love, you are afraid, on the other hand, it is a blind, enthusiastic impulse, not founded on <hi>esteem.</hi>—How inconsistent are lovers!</p>

                     <p>Your reasoning, like your person, surprizes, charms and subdues:—I will be more consistent;—but our contention is only for pre-eminence in love;—delightful emulation! Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inconsistency!</p>

                     <p>I am now ashamed of my childish suspicions; but I should not have been so credulous, had it not been for an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which rendered my better judgment blind to the fallacy, and made me more apprehensive of your inconstancy, than satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of your innocence; and this disposed me to misinterpret every thing you said.</p>

                     <p>And your apparent indifference, in consequence of that misinterpretation, excited similar suspicions in me; and thus, mutual distrust produced mutual misapprehension.</p>

                     <p>Were you to hear those particulars, they would only afford you pain:—'tis sufficient for me to tell you he has turned me out of his house, only because I told him, I was a friend to the new Constitution, forsooth.</p>

                     <p>He is a strange character:—when I call'd on my father, I was alarmed to find them at high words;—and he abus'd <hi>me</hi> most unmercifully.</p>
