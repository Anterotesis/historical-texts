            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following Amendment to the Bill providing the Means of Intercourſe between the United States and Foreign Nations, being under conſideration, to wit:— In the Section which provides that <q>the Preſident ſhall not allow to any Miniſter <hi>Plenipotentiary</hi> a greater ſum than at the rate of nine thouſand dollars per annum, as a compenſation for all his perſonal ſervices and other expenſes; nor a greater ſum for the ſame than four thouſand five hundred dollars per annum, to <hi>a Charge des Affaires;</hi>
               </q> ſtrike out the word <hi>"Plenipotentiary,"</hi> and inſert in lieu thereof the words <q>to Great-Britain, France or Spain;</q> ſtrike out the words <q>
                  <hi>Charge des Affaires,</hi>
               </q> and inſert in lieu thereof the words <q>any Miniſter to any other foreign nation:</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Bayard</hi> DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING SPEECH:</p>
            <p>I SHALL not follow the example of the gentleman who is juſt ſat down (Mr. R. Williams) in aſſigning reaſons againſt the vote which I deſign to give, but ſhall content myſelf in ſtating and maintaining the grounds upon which I am oppoſed to the amendment under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. I had thought and ſtill believe that the principles upon which gentlemen differ, are well underſtood. We do not deny the power of this Houſe in the appropriation of money, nor the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they may conſtitutionally exerciſe in fixing the proper amount of ſalary for a Miniſter Plenipotentiary, or for any other officer employed by the government. On the other hand, gentlemen who differ from us, do not contend that 9000 dollars per annum is too great a ſalary for a Miniſter Plenipotentiary, but they ſay that no Miniſter is neceſſary at Berlin or Liſbon, and therefore they will not appropriate for their ſupport. If this Houſe has not a right to judge of the grade of Miniſters, or of the places at which it is proper to employ them, no reaſon will remain for our refuſing to appropriate in the manner contemplated by the bill in its original ſhape.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:033383_0003_0FF6894848D8A218"/>
The firſt queſtion, therefore, which naturally preſents itſelf in this diſcuſſion, is whether the power of fixing the number and grade of foreign Miniſters, belongs in any degree to this Houſe, or exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to the Executive.</p>
            <p>By the Conſtitution, the right of receiving foreign Miniſters is given to the Preſident, nor is there any pretence under which this Houſe can claim a ſhare of that right or its incidents. The obligation to appoint foreign Miniſters may frequently ariſe from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications they make to the power which receives them. The powers therefore of appointing and receiving ſeem to me co-relative, and eſſentially to belong to the ſame branch of government.</p>
            <p>But the power of appointing is as expreſsly given to the Preſident, as the power of receiving Miniſters. As Miniſters, however, cannot be employed abroad, without money being appropriated for their ſupport, as money cannot be appropriated but by law, it is therefore ſaid we may enquire into the propriety of the appointments before we appropriate.</p>
            <p>Now, Sir, I apprehend wherever an office, created by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or by law, is legally filled by the Preſident, that we are <hi>bound</hi> to provide a reaſonable compenſation for the officer. The gentleman from Pennſylvania, however, has told us, that the office of foreign Miniſter is created by the Preſident, and does not exiſt under the Conſtitution. This is one of thoſe bold aſſertions which we ſo often hear from that quarter, and intended to impoſe upon the eaſy credulity of a part of the Houſe. I aſk the gentleman whether the power of creating offices is of an Executive nature? And, if not, I beg him to point out to me the clauſe in the Conſtitution which in any caſe gives ſuch a power to the Preſident? But in order to oppoſe the aſſertion, I will beg leave to refer to the proviſion of the Conſtitution on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>[Mr. B. here read the following paſſage from the 2d ſect. of the 2d art. of the Conſtitution:—"He," the Preſident, "ſhall nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, ſhall appoint Ambaſſadors, other public Miniſters and Conſuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States <hi>whoſe appointments are not herein otherwiſe provided for, and which ſhall be eſtabliſhed by law.</hi>"]</p>
            <p>By this clauſe it explicitly appears that the power of appointment extends only to offices provided by the Conſtitution, or which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhould be eſtabliſhed by law. The place of Miniſter, then, is an office created by the Conſtitution. But it is contended by this gentleman, that Miniſters ſtand upon the ſame ground with Judges of the Supreme Court, and, as we had limited the number of the latter, ſo we have a right to reſtrain the number of the former. Now, Sir, by referring again to the Conſtitution, I apprehend I can ſhew, that the caſes ſtand on different grounds, and that there is a power given to us to interfere in the caſe of Judges, which does not belong to us in the caſe of Miniſters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:033383_0004_0FF6894A0EA586E8"/>
[Mr. B. here cited the 3d art. of the Conſtitution, ſect. 1ſt, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
            <p>"The judicial power of the United States ſhall be veſted in one Supreme Court, and in ſuch inferior as the <hi>Congreſs may from time to time eſtabliſh.</hi>"]</p>
            <p>It appears from this clauſe, that a Supreme Court is provided, but the mode of its eſtabliſhment is expreſsly left to Congreſs. Beſide, it is evident from the Conſtitution, that the farmers of it frequently referred to things as known. As when they provide in criminal caſes that the trial ſhall be by jury, it was underſtood that the jury ſhould conſiſt of twelve men, and a verdict be the unanimous opinion of the whole. And ſo in the caſe of the Supreme Court, that the number of Judges could not be indefinite, and of conſequence muſt be limited by Congreſs. This is certainly not the caſe as to foreign Miniſters. Their number can be no more limited than the number of foreign powers. By leſſening the number of independent nations (which is a work going on very faſt) the conſtitutional power of the Preſident on this ſubject will be reſtrained.</p>
            <p>If the doctrine be founded, that this Houſe has a right to refuſe to appropriate for the ſalary of foreign Miniſters, I aſk gentlemen to reconcile it with their admiſſion that no ſuch right to refuſe exiſts in the caſe of the Preſident or Judges? A diſtinction has been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted. It is ſaid, that in the caſe of theſe officers, the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution has provided that their compenſation ſhall not be diminiſhed during their continuance in office. But it ſtrongly appears to me, and I do inſiſt, that by conceding that in the caſe of the Preſident and Judges we are <hi>bound</hi> to appropriate, the whole argument on the other ſide is given up. Becauſe it allows, that notwithſtanding we have an expreſs power on the ſubject of appropriation, that yet there are caſes in which that power muſt be paſſively exerciſed, without the uſe of the diſcretion which it is ſtrongly contended eſſentially belongs to it. And now, Sir, as to the diſtinction between Judges and Miniſters, I beg leave to remark, that in the caſe of Judges, the proviſion of the Conſtitution goes only to the <hi>quantum</hi> of the ſalary, and prohibits the <hi>diminution</hi> of it during their continuance in office. But as to the <hi>principle</hi> that a reaſonable compenſation ſhall be allowed, the caſes ſtand on the ſame footing. The only difference is, that in the caſe of the Judge we have not the power of ſaying the <hi>ſalary is too great,</hi> but we are bound to appropriate to the laſt farthing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, in the caſe of a Miniſter, we have the right at all times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the amount of his pay. I believe, Sir, it can hardly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that when the framers of the Conſtitution created an office, or gave a power to create one, and directed the office to be filled by the Preſident, that they contemplated a reaſonable compenſation being provided for the officer. It was a thing ſo well underſtood, that it would have been folly to have expreſſed it, as great folly as to have provided that it ſhould be the duty of the Judges to expound the law. And, therefore, I hold that in the caſe of Miniſters and all
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033383_0005_0FF6894C8B96FAE0"/>other officers legally appointed, that this Houſe is bound to concur in an appropriation for a reaſonable compenſation.</p>
            <p>In order to maintain their ground, gentlemen, on the other ſide, have deſcanted largely on the ſubject of checks, and perſuaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that the right to refuſe an appropriation in the preſent caſe, ſprung from the general ſpirit of the Conſtitution, which deſigned that one branch of the government ſhould operate as a check upon another.</p>
            <p>The doctrine as contended for, has emphatically been ſtiled an <hi>imported doctrine,</hi> but I hope it will not be <hi>ſmuggled</hi> into this Houſe without inſpection and examination. The caſes of checks to be derived from the Conſtitution, I apprehend may be claſſed under three heads.</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Where an expreſs power is given to one branch to control the operations of another.</item>
                  <item>2. Where a branch of the government ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds its powers.</item>
                  <item>3. Where a general power is given to one branch, and a ſubſtantive power included within the terms of it given to another.</item>
               </list>
Thus, in the firſt caſe; in the Legiſlature, the Senate is a check upon this Houſe, and this Houſe upon the Senate, and the Preſident upon both. In the Executive, the Senate on the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, as to treaties and appointments. And in the Judiciary, one Court upon another. Upon the ſecond head, a caſe mentioned by the gentleman from Virginia, and much relied on, furniſhes a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing example. Even the Judges, the gentleman ſaid, are a check upon the Legiſlature. This ariſes from the nature of the Legiſlature, the powers of which are limited. If the Legiſlature tranſgreſs the bounds of their authority, their acts are void, and neither the people nor the Judges are bound by them. So if the Preſident ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, after an appointment non-concurred by the Senate, the commiſſion would be void. And in all caſes where an act is done without power, a check may be found wherever we pleaſe to look for it. The third caſe which has been mentioned, is, where the general power of one branch is controlled by a particular power given to another branch. To this head may be aſſigned another caſe much relied on by the gentleman from Virginia. The caſe I refer to, is that of a treaty made by the Preſident having war for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Now, as the excluſive power to declare war is veſted in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, I have no heſitation in ſaying, the Preſident has not the power to make a treaty of offenſive and defenſive alliance. For though ſuch a power may be embraced in the general terms giving the power to make treaties; yet, as the right to declare war is diſtinctly given to Congreſs, it muſt operate as an exception to the general treaty-making power.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the caſes of legitimate checks which occur to me. But as to the wild doctrine which has been contended for, that wherever one branch of the government poſſeſſes any degree of power, that a diſcretion neceſſarily accompanies the exerciſe of it, nothing I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive can be more dangerous, or have a more direct tendency to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="11 letters">
                  <desc>〈11 letters〉</desc>
               </gap>. If the principle were aſſerted by each branch, the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033383_0006_0FF6894E8D427090"/>operations of the government muſt ceaſe. The Preſident might ſay, he was not bound blindly to execute laws which he conceived to be abſured or impolitic. We create offices, he refuſes to fill them; we appropriate money, he refuſes to apply it; we declare war, he refuſes to carry it on, becauſe, conſulting his own judgment, he conceives our meaſures to be unwiſe, and that it would be better for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to <hi>check</hi> us, by refuſing the aid of his conſtitutional power to carry our ſchemes into effect. I will beg leave to put a caſe which I conceive comes up to the ſtrongeſt point of the argument on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe Congreſs declare war. This can be done by a majority of both Houſes. The Preſident participates the power of appropriating money. Now ſuppoſe war actually declared, by a power competent and expreſsly allowed to judge of its expediency, and the Preſident afterwards conceiving the war to be unjuſt, or the declaration pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature, refuſes to concur in an appropriation to ſupport it. In ſuch caſe, we ſhould be conſtitutionally at war, and conſtitutionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from carrying it on.</p>
            <p>Such are the abſurdities which flow from the <hi>imported doctrine</hi> of checks. Conſequences which tend to paralize the powers of the Conſtitution, and effectually to <hi>ſtop the wheels of government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have no doubt, Sir, for my own part, that this Houſe has no right to interfere upon the principle of the amendment; but I will, notwithſtanding, conſider the expediency of the meaſure it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates.</p>
            <p>It has been contended by the gentleman from Pennſylvania, that it would be better for this country to renounce all foreign inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. This, I conceive, is going far beyond any point of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion before the Committee. The amendment is not deſigned to aboliſh foreign intercourſe. It ſuppoſes three Miniſters Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary, and as many Miniſters Reſident and Conſuls as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident ſhall think proper to appoint. Indeed it affects only the grade of the Miniſters at Liſbon and Berlin.</p>
            <p>Sir, I could have wiſhed to avoid any imputation upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which produced the preſent amendment. But it ſtrikes me as ſingular that gentlemen ſhould be ſatisfied with reſtraining its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to two characters, and that ſuch mighty efforts ſhould be made to accompliſh an object attended with ſo little ſaving to the Treaſury, and at beſt equivocal, as they muſt acknowledge, as to its operation abroad. I cannot well account for what I have ſeen, but in recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting that the Miniſter at Liſbon was formerly a diſtinguiſhed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Houſe, whoſe eminent talents having been employed in the ſupport of government, has rendered him obnoxious to the friends of the amendment; and that the Miniſter at Berlin is the ſon of the Preſident of the United States, a man as much hated by one party as venerated by the other. I ſhould have been willing to have diſcarded any ſuſpicions which theſe recollections occaſioned, had I been able to diſcover any plauſible reaſon at this time for introducing and ſo ſtrongly maintaining the amendment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:033383_0007_0FF6891D3959EA50"/>
Gentlemen have talked of annihilating foreign intercourſe. Do they call to their minds our ſea coaſt of 1700 miles? Do they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the commercial temper and habits of our people? Do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect how many imported articles, though perhaps once luxuries, are now become neceſſaries of life? Do they calculate the portion of our food and raiment which is brought acroſs the ocean? Can they ſit down to a meal in the day, or examine the cloths on their backs, without being ſenſible of the ſtrength of our foreign connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? I beg gentlemen, after having duly appreciated theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, to tell whether they ſeriouſly imagine that any force in the government could break our connection with foreign countries. I believe, for my part, that while the ocean is navigable, that our people will be commercial, and that foreign connections cannot be prevented. The only queſtion which ſeems to me to exiſt is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as there will be intercourſe with foreign countries, it does not admit of beneficial regulations from the interference of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The gentleman from Pennſylvania has conſidered this ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two heads, <hi>commercial</hi> and <hi>political,</hi> and has endeavoured to ſhew, that our connections with Europe, commercial or political, do not require a diplomatic eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>Commercial intercourſe, he continues, might be as well regulated and protected by the employment of Conſuls as of Miniſters. Very little conſideration, I apprehend, will ſatisfy gentlemen, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls are inadequate to the protection of the commerce of a great country. Conſuls are little more than private mercantile agents. They are frequently the ſubjects of the country in which they are ſtationed, ſubject to its laws, as well in civil as in criminal caſes, not privileged, and ſcarcely noticed by the law of nations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting, in no degree, the country which employs them. I will then aſk, if Conſuls are competent to inſiſt upon the rights of the nation, or its citizens, or to remonſtrate againſt their wrongs. Whether they could demand, or are ſo likely to obtain juſtice, as if they were cloathed with a repreſentative capacity of the country. Beſide, let me tell the gentleman, that if our eſtabliſhment abroad were reduced to Conſuls, in effect, they would only have foreign Miniſters under new names, for they would ſoon be employed for political, as well as commercial purpoſes. It would end in their exerciſing the powers of Miniſters, without their reſponſibility.</p>
            <p>The gentleman from Pennſylvania has ſaid, that the only uſe of Miniſters is to form treaties. This is certainly not true. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that a government is bound to extend its care and protection to its citizens abroad, as well as at home. One purpoſe, therefore, of Miniſters is, to ſecure to our citizens in foreign countries, the rights which they derived from treaties, or the law of nations. They are deſigned alſo to watch the actions of foreign governments, and to diſcover their ſchemes, and to give notice to their own govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any thing which may threaten the peace or ſafety of their country. They are again the organ of communication between go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033383_0008_0FF6895101730C48"/>by which explanations are demanded, and by which accidental differences may frequently be avoided without the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of war.</p>
            <p>When the gentleman from Pennſylvania ſpoke of our political connections he ſpoke of thoſe ariſing from treaties. He conceived that we had no occaſion for treaties with foreign countries, and of conſequence that Miniſters were not wanted to frame them. Upon this ground I will now meet him. It ſeems to have eſcaped the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the gentleman and his friends, that we have a choice only of one of two grounds upon which we will ſtand in relation to Europe. The one is the treaty, the other the law of nations. If we will not ſubject ourſelves to treaties, we muſt ſtill be bound by the law of nations. To me it appears much more rational, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould agree on the terms upon which their intercourſe ſhall be conducted, than to leave it to the determination of a law derived from authorities uncertain, ambiguous and contradictory. Treaties are deſigned to ſupply the defects, and explain the doubts of the law. They diſpenſe with a rule injurious perhaps to both countries, and introduce a regulation equally beneficial to each party. If diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes ariſe in the conſtruction of treaties, which are expreſſed with all the caution of ſtudied language, how much more contention is to be expected upon the law of nations—a law conſiſting in looſe cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, ariſing from the dicta of authors, whoſe opinions were warped by the peculiar intereſt of their country—a law, the general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of which may be perverted to juſtify every act of power how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever flagitious?</p>
            <p>The gentleman from Pennſylvania, in order to ſupport his poſition on this ſubject, has caſt his eyes upon our treaties, and ſelected thoſe parts which he thought he could reprobate with the moſt ſucceſs. And the ſubject was probably introduced for the purpoſe of giving him an opportunity of doing ſo.</p>
            <p>I am not, however, alarmed at meeting the gentleman upon this ground, and enquiring into the advantages and evils which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from treaties which we have formed.</p>
            <p>The gentleman has not given himſelf the trouble of adverting to any treaty, or to any one article in a treaty, by which the country has been benefited. It has ſerved his purpoſe to exhibit the dark ſide of the picture.</p>
            <p>The gentleman has even complained of the treaty with France, and ſpoke of the diſputes which the conſtruction of it has involved us in. Nothing could aſtoniſh me more than that that gentleman and his friends ſhould complain of this treaty. I cannot help pitying the ſhort memory which allows them to forget the language they held on a former occaſion, removed from us but by a ſmall interval of time. At the laſt ſeſſion of this Congreſs, we were told by thoſe gentlemen, that it was to our treaty with France that we owed the liberty and independence of our country, and we were ſtrongly reminded of the debt of gratitude which remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid. Will thoſe gentlemen now tell us, that the evils which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from that very treaty, overbalance its advantages? If ſo, we are to be grateful when we have been more injured than bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not be repelled by any popular prejudice from ſaying, that advantages have been derived from the Britiſh treaty. I conſider
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033383_0009_0FF688F3A18B4BA8"/>the war from which that treaty preſerved us of an importance incal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culable. A war which muſt have annihilated our commerce, deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated our ſea-port towns, ruined our finances, while it encreaſed our debt, depreſſed the value of our produce, and of the labour of our citizens, and multiplying the burthens of the government, while it diminiſhed the ability of the people to ſupport it, might have ended in the loſs of our Conſtitution, and of our unity and independence as a nation. No ſacrifice which we have made, can be put in the ſcale againſt the evils which we have eſcaped. That every treaty will be compoſed of conceſſion, as well as of acquiſition, every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man will expect. It cannot be ſuppoſed that a powerful nation will grant any thing and aſk nothing in return.</p>
            <p>[Mr. Gallatin explained by ſaying, that nothing which he ſaid, had any relation to our treaty of alliance with France, but merely to commercial treaties.]</p>
            <p>Mr. B.—I underſtood the gentleman to ſay, that he was averſe from all foreign intercourſe, and generally that our treaties had been injurious to the country. But even if his ſtrictures were confined to commercial treaties, yet as the queſtion regards generally our fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign connections, it is proper that political advantages derived from our treaties ſhould be taken into conſideration. I have ſpoken of one benefit which might be attributed to the treaty with Great-Britain. I will mention another. That treaty has given us poſſeſſion of the Weſtern Poſts, which for years have been ſo cruel a thorn in our ſide, which have coſt us ſo many millions of dollars, and ſo much blood. Again, the treaty has provided for our mercantile brethren a compenſation in caſe of illegal capture of their property by Britiſh veſſels during the preſent war, and reinſtated familes that otherwiſe would have been irreparably ruined.</p>
            <p>One proviſion in the treaty, is a ſtriking inſtance of the neceſſity of treaties. It has made proviſion that our northern boundary ſhall be amicably fixed by aſcertaining the true river St. Croix. Had we been left to the law of nations to fix this boundary, as each country would have inſiſted on its pretenſions, force muſt have ſettled the controverſy.</p>
            <p>I will next aſk, whether the country has derived no advantage from the Spaniſh treaty? Whether nothing was gained by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of ſeveral armed poſts, the eſtabliſhment of our ſouthern boundary, the ſeſſion of a large territory, and the acquiſition of the free navigation of the Miſſiſſippi? And I particularly beg gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to point out the evils which balance the benefits of this treaty?</p>
            <p>It is plain to me, that foreign intercourſe cannot be prevented, and equally plain that treaties neceſſarily ariſe out of that intercourſe. But at this moment, of all others, I conceive that the amendment to the bill, which goes to reſtrain the appointment of Miniſters Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiary to London, Paris and Madrid, is peculiarly improper. Sir, the meſſage of this day laid on our table from the Preſident, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us of the critical and dangerous ſtate of our country. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us alſo, that the intereſts of other neutral nations, are impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the injuſtice of the decree which is about to paſs the French Councils. We have ſuffered, and are ſuffering, aggreſſions from a power undoubtedly formidable, which menace the peace and ſafety of the country. We have been driven to the brink of war, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033383_0010_0FF689542D5456F0"/>ſhould the Mighty Republic (which God forbid) force us to hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, I hope we ſhall have ſenſe enough to increaſe our ſtrength by an alliance with thoſe neutral nations, with whom it may be found that we have a common intereſt. I truſt that the ſpirit of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is not ſo broken by the humiliations to which we have already ſubmitted, and that the paſſion for wealth has ſo far extinguiſhed every nobler feeling, that we are prepared tamely to ſubmit our necks to the yoke, and barter the liberty and independence of the country for a ſtate of peace, as inglorious as it is inſecure.</p>
            <p>The gentleman from Pennſylvania, in his argument againſt foreign intercourſe, alledged, that we had nothing to do with the balance of power in Europe. I believe, Sir, I can refer the Committee to caſes which will ſatisfy both ſides of the Houſe that we are intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with that balance. I will call to the recollection of gentlemen oppoſed to me, that period of the war when the Duke of Brunſwick was marching to Paris, when the rebels were ſucceſsful in La Vendee, when Toulon was in poſſeſſion of the combined powers, when vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſeemed to have declared for the allied princes, and Fate to have numbered the days of the Republic, and aſk them whether they were not then ſenſible of the balance of power in Europe being deſtroyed? Was there a gentleman among them, who did not attribute the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of England to the depreſſion of the power of France? But when the fortune of war changed—the Duke of Brunſwick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, Toulon re-captured, the Netherlands ſubdued, Holland invaded—to this change have they not ſaid it was owing that the famous decree of November, 1793, was revoked, and that the ſtorm which was gathering round us, was diſperſed?</p>
            <p>At that time, in what manner did the Republic behave towards us? Did they recal their own Miniſters, or baniſh our's? Did they invent pretences to deſtroy our commerce? On the contrary, did they not invite us to draw cloſer the bands of alliance? But, Sir, ſince the full tide of proſperity has riſen in favor of France; ſince ſhe has added millions of men to her population, and of money to her revenue; ſince ſhe has humbled the crowns of half the Potentates of Europe, and rendered many of them her tributaries; ſince ſhe has found herſelf able to break the pillars of governments which had laſted for centuries, and to erect new ſtates upon their ruins; ſince, in fine, ſhe has perceived that there is no weight in Europe to balance her power, has not this country felt the effect of the mighty change? Gentlemen cannot deny that the ſyſtem which England formerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, France has ſince adopted, with circumſtances of increaſed ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation! When I regard the facts which a ſhort period of time preſents to our eyes, I am aſtoniſhed, that any one ſhould aſſert that we have nothing to do with the balance of power in Europe.</p>
            <p>I will now call the attention of the committee to ſome points in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the diſcuſſion, which were principal grounds of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the gentleman who moved the amendment, but which have loſt much of their importance in the courſe of the debate.</p>
            <p>The firſt was Executive patronage. This was attacked on two principles.
<list>
                  <item>1. That it had increaſed, and ought to be diminiſhed.</item>
                  <item>2. That it had been, and was deſigned to be abuſed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I hope it will be remembered, that the attempt on the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is not to add to the patronage of the Preſident, but to take from the Executive a power, which it is not denied, belongs to him under the conſtitution. The gentleman from Pennſylvania not only
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033383_0011_0FF689571635C698"/>admitted that a power to fill the office belonged to the Preſident, but aſſerted that the Preſident had power to create the office itſelf; ſo that the queſtion is, as to preſerving, and not as to increaſing the conſtitutional power of the Executive.</p>
            <p>The ſame gentleman has been pleaſed to ſay, that when I expreſſed an opinion, that the Executive was the weakeſt branch of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was with <hi>regret;</hi> and thence, came to an eaſy concluſion, that it was my deſign to promote Monarchy in this country. I am at a loſs to know how that gentleman diſcovered my feelings when I delivered the opinion. But is was neceſſary to his purpoſe to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thoſe feelings to me, and that gentleman has no weak delicacy, as to the means, when he has a purpoſe to accompliſh. I did indeed ſay, that the Executive was the weakeſt branch of the Government, and this I repeat; but I neither ſaid it with joy nor ſorrow, but ſtated it as a fact. I did not ſay that the Executive was <hi>too weak,</hi> nor expreſſed any wiſh that its power ſhould be encreaſed. Suppoſe I ſhould ſay, that the Pope is the weakeſt Potentate in Europe, would it follow, from thence, that I wiſhed the territories of his Holineſs extended, or his power enlarged to a balance with that of the mighty Republic? Or, if I affirmed, of the two ſexes that the female was the weakeſt, is it to be concluded that I regret that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is not as ſtrong as man? I believe the Executive is at the mercy of this Houſe; that if the Houſe were united, and reſolved to bind the hands of the Executive, no reſiſtance could prevent them; but I do not apprehend that any effort of Executive authority could make an impreſſion on the rights of this Houſe. Nay, it is even obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that <hi>feeble minorities</hi> can ſhake the foundations of Executive au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, though ſupported by a majority of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Another gentleman from Pennſylvania (Mr. Findley) has alſo thought proper to infer, from the compariſon I made between the patronage of our Executive and that of the Crown of Great-Britain, that I am deſirous of ſeeing the patronage of the Preſident encreaſed to the magnitude of that of the Engliſh King.</p>
            <p>It is not a little ſurprizing that this gentleman, who profeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the model of candour and moderation in the opening of his ſpeech, ſhould ſuffer himſelf to be guilty of ſo groſs a miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The true inference from my argument is directly the reverſe of the one which has been made. I obſerved, that notwithſtanding all the patronage which the King of England derives from the nobility, the church, the army, navy, civil liſt, &amp;c. that the Monarchy could not be preſerved, if the principle of equal repreſentation were introduced into the Houſe of Commons. I have no objection to uſe the obnoxious expreſſion attributed to me, that if the venal boroughs were aboliſhed, there would ſoon be an end of the Monarchy.</p>
            <p>I do not believe there is a man of ſenſe on the other ſide of the Houſe of a different opinion. But this opinion is perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with a wiſh to ſee the Monarchy deſtroyed. It is an opinion ſimply upon the operation of certain cauſes, and their tendency to produce certain effects, which has no connection with the wiſhes of the perſon who forms it.</p>
            <p>I am very ready to confeſs, that I am not one of thoſe enthuſiaſts whoſe inſatiable thirſt for liberty allows them to wiſh the deſolation of a country, and the maſſacre of its inhabitants, in order to eſtabliſh in it a new form of government. If the Engliſh love their Monarch,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033383_0012_0FF688F96F8B5748"/>I have no objection to their living under Monarchy. It is enough for me, that I live in a Republic: and if the people of England will ſuffer us to live in peace, under the government of our choice, we cannot be juſtified in wiſhing to ſee the throats of half the nation cut, and their property plundered, in order that a government may be there eſtabliſhed more conformable to our taſte.</p>
            <p>As to myſelf, I have no intereſt out of the country, nor in a form of government different from what we poſſeſs. I was bred during the revolutionary war, and my firſt impreſſions were republican. No man can have leſs motive to wiſh a monarchical government; and being completely ſatisfied with the exiſting government, I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to repel every innovation upon it, from whatever quarter it comes.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, is it for thoſe gentlemen who were born under monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical, or corrupt governments of Europe, whoſe necks were early broke to the yoke, whoſe germ of republicaniſm is engrafted on a monarchical ſtock, to bring forward the charges of ariſtocracy? I think, if the ſincerity of their apoſtacy is not queſtioned, it becomes them to be ſilent as to others. I truſt, however, that the people of the United States have ſenſe enough to judge men, not by their <hi>profeſſions of faith,</hi> but by their <hi>actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs, Sir, I am ſo far from dreading Executive patronage, that I do not believe that any power which can be given to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, will render him dangerous to this Houſe, while it is compoſed of Repreſentatives equally and freely choſen by the people. Not that I ſuppoſe that a Preſident is exempt from ambition, or indifferent as to power; but while the people have the power of purging this Houſe every two years, and regard it as themſelves, there is no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage which can corrupt it, nor Executive power which can threaten it. Give to the Executive every officer of the government, and every man whom they can influence, and what is the weight in the ſcale againſt the body of the people?</p>
            <p>The charge of ariſtocracy brought againſt me, and thoſe with whom I act, I look on as a ſpectre conjured up to alarm timid ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. If, indeed, the charge had been made againſt the other ſide of the Houſe, there might be ſome ground to believe it. Againſt men born in land of ſlavery, whoſe cradles have been rocked by ſlaves, and who have been habituated, from infancy, to trample on the rights of man. Sir, when I look round this hall, and obſerve how parties are compoſed; when I ſee men who come from a land of real equality, many of whom have been educated in laborious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and none of whom can boaſt but a few paternal acres, and find that they are called Ariſtocrats, while, on the other hand, men who can count in their train a hundred ſlaves, whoſe large do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, like feudal baronies, are peopled with the humbleſt veſſels, are ſtiled Democrats, I am aſtoniſhed that the weakeſt of mankind can be impoſed on by ſuch an abuſe of words. I know that this is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate ſubject, and I wiſhed to have avoided it; but, when I ſee theſe High Prieſts of Liberty ſo zealouſly proclaiming freedom with one hand, while they are riveting the chains of ſlavery with the other, I cannot forbear tearing aſide the veil which conceals the truth from the world.</p>
            <p>The gentleman from Pennſylvania has amuſed us by deſcanting on the hiſtories of Greece and Rome, and aſſigning cauſes of the downfal
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033383_0013_0FF68958D2664BF0"/>of thoſe Republics. Theſe are diſcuſſions which, for my part, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive had better be left to the ſchools and lyceums; but ſince the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject has been introduced, I beg leave ſimply to remark, the admiſſion of the gentleman, that thoſe republics were deſtroyed, not by Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive encroachments, but by the licentiouſneſs of the people. This is an admiſſion of every thing in diſpute on the ſubject. Becauſe it proves, that the people were the inſtruments made uſe of to deſtroy republics. Were I an enemy to the free government of my country, I ſhould not ſeek to ſubvert it, by ſupporting, or in attempting by artful conſtructions of the Conſtitution to increaſe Executive power. If a project of this kind could be finally ſucceſsful, it would require centuries to accompliſh it. No, Sir, I would adopt the means which have produced the effect before. The people would be the inſtrument I ſhould make uſe of, I would addreſs myſelf to their prejudices, their follies, and their paſſions. I would tell them that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is corrupt; that it is a faction under the influence, or in the pay, of a foreign power. I would tell them, that their intereſts are neglected and deſpiſed, that hence they are burthened with grievous exciſe laws and odious ſtamp acts.</p>
            <p>I would call upon them to erect <hi>liberty poles,</hi> and refuſe obedience to a government which is adminiſtered by an <hi>ariſtocratic junto.</hi> And could I be ſucceſsful in theſe artful calumnies, and deluding a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning people, excite them to inſurrection and rebellion againſt the laws, I might hope to ſee one of the beſt governments in the world torn to pieces, and a wretched people burying their liberties in its ruins.</p>
            <p>From ancient, we were brought to the modern hiſtory of Europe, and we are told, that, except in England, from which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the germ of liberty, every ſemblance of repreſentation has been ſwallowed up in the Executive power.</p>
            <p>But I will aſk the gentleman, whether the Cortes of Spain, or the Parliaments and Councils of which he ſpoke, repreſented the people, or were not connected in intereſt with the higher claſſes of ſociety alone. Thoſe ſhadows of repreſentation were deſtroyed, becauſe the people deriving no benefit from them, had no motive to ſupport them. But in England, where the body of the people were repreſented, though imperfectly, the popular branch grew up in the very ſhade of deſpotiſm. This vital principle of liberty ſurvived the tyranny of Henry 8th, and the power of Elizabeth. It ſoon gave a weight to the Commons which balanced the power of the Crown. The Engliſh hiſtory ſtrongly proves the principle for which I contend, that the branch of government connected in intereſt with the people, and ſupported by them, has nothing to fear from Executive power.</p>
            <p>Is there any inſtance in this hiſtory, of the Houſe of Commons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboliſhed by the crown? And, on the contrary, have you not ſeen the Commons able to ſubvert the Throne and Nobility, to extort, at ſome times, from the King his moſt precious prerogatives, and at all times to force on him miniſters of their choice, or from him thoſe who were his favorites? The very corruption which the gentleman ſpoke of, proves the weakneſs of the crown, and the ſtrength of the Commons. It was not on the army, the navy, or the nobility, the crown could rely; it was obliged to purchaſe the ſupport of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. It was a purchaſe made upon the ſame principle of weakneſs, that we pay for the peace we enjoy with the weſtern ſavages, or the Barbary powers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:033383_0014_0FF6895B8F27FD58"/>
But the gentleman has gone ſo far as to contend, that from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their reſpective duties, that this Houſe is more liable to incur popular odium than the Executive. That being obliged to impoſe taxes, often of an obnoxious kind, we are peculiarly expoſed to the reſentment of the people. In making this remark, the gentleman cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly forgot, that tho' we lay the taxes, it is the Executive which col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects them. And that it is not ſo much the letter of a tax law which is offenſive to the people, as the hand of the tax gatherer, which compels them to pay. I apprehend, however, that the obſervation is wholly unfounded. The connection between this Houſe and the people is too intimate, a common intereſt binds them too cloſely toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſuffer the remark of the gentleman to be verified. I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it more than poſſible that individuals of this body may loſe their popularity by voting for meaſures from which their conſtituents are averſe; but in reprobating the conduct of a part of the Houſe, who acted againſt their wiſhes, their affections will accumulate in favor of thoſe whoſe conduct was conformable to their ſentiments. When the Senate ratified the Britiſh treaty, they were not in conſequence leſs popular as a body. For tho' a majority, perhaps, were burnt in effigy, yet the <hi>virtuous ten</hi> acquired all the favor which they loſt.</p>
            <p>The gentleman has laboriouſly provided for us an account of the amount of Executive patronage. The fees of every deputy's deputy are collected in the eſtimate, in order to increaſe the dimenſions of the phantom. The ſalaries, compenſations and fees, to perſons in ſervice of the government, are ſtated to amount to 850.000 dollars. This to be ſure, is a frightful ſum diſtributed over ſuch an immenſe country. But the fact is, that this money is hardly earned. No ſervices are ſo badly paid for as thoſe which are rendered to the public. The ſyſtem which is purſuing will ſtarve all talents and merit out of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I believe that ſeveral offices are held from patriotic principles alone. I believe that a favor is done the government by every man of talents who accepts an office, and I am convinced that no man can turn his abilities and induſtry to leſs account than in accepting of places which the government is diſpoſed to give him. The contracts of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been ſtated at 1,300 000 dollars. But the gentleman has cautiouſly concealed the idea of equivalent received by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Suppoſing a profit of 5 per cent. to the contractor, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of this branch of patronage does not exceed 65,000 dollars. And this is to compenſate an advance of capital and perſonal ſervice. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it may be ſafely affirmed, that our government derives little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from this ſource.</p>
            <p>An abuſe of Executive power has been loudly complained of, in a determination attributed to the Preſident to appoint none to office who do not profeſs his political creed. That the Preſident has determined to employ no more the enemies of the government, I think very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. Men perpetually oppoſed to the adminiſtration, who indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately condemn every meaſure adopted, who inſiduouſly labour to alienate the affections of the people from the government, who, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed in a fanatical attachment to a foreign country, have loſt all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for their own, I conceive are properly avoided as objects of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic truſt and confidence.</p>
            <p>The Preſident, on this ſubject, will act on a principle from which the people never depart. In chuſing the electors who appointed him,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033383_0015_0FF688F560E42A80"/>did they not exact, where they had not a perfect knowledge, a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the political creed of the candidate? Does not every electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bear witneſs, that the principle is ever adhered to by the people? and I will aſk gentlemen, if any officer appointed by the Preſident were left to the choice of the people; if his politics would not be the firſt object of their attention, and an invincible objection if different from their own? But, Sir, there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe that the principle is carried to the extent, ſo warmly fancied by a gentleman from Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia (Mr. Brent) "that the Executive will employ no one who will not ſing hallelujahs to every executive object." No, Sir, I ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that the determination of the Preſident reaches only to thoſe, whoſe patriotiſm conſiſt in denouncing their own government, and applauding a foreign one; who celebrates with feats and ſongs, ſucceſſes which exalts another country upon the humiliation of their own; and who, purſuing a phantom which they call liberty, forget that they poſſeſs all the freedom which rational men can wiſh, and are willing to ſubvert every thing which is valuable in ſociety, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to eſtabliſh a ſyſtem under which every thing poſſibly might be hoped for, but nothing certainly could be enjoyed.</p>
            <p>I hope I ſhall be excuſed for ſaying a word as to the reflections, it has been ſaid, we have caſt upon the foreigners who are members of the houſe. I certainly am not one of thoſe who would deny the rights of hoſpitality to any foreigners who ſhall pleaſe to come among us. I do not know that I have any objection to their acquiring the rights of citizenſhip; but I muſt be allowed to ſay, that, in my opinion, no man who was born in a foreign country, can love America equally with a native American. I do believe there is ſuch a thing as a love of our native ſoil; and a man who can diſcard a love for the land which gave him birth will never have much affection for the country which adopts him. However, if in looking round this houſe, I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a ſolitary proof againſt my poſition, I might be led to doubt it; but I am ſorry to ſay, that my obſervations on this floor have confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the opinion.</p>
            <p>The gentleman from Pennſylvania concluded, with telling us, that he had but two objects in view; the one to deſtroy foreign intercourſe, the other to ſave money. As to the firſt, were it poſſible I might join with him; and, as to the laſt, I believe I perfectly underſtand the gentleman. It was a fine declaration to tickle the ears of his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, I ſhould certainly offend thoſe of mine were I to deliver a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſentiment. But ſtill we differ on this head. I believe the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſo ſincere in what he ſaid, ſo well diſpoſed to act up to it, that he would readily agree, not only to ſave money, but to ſpend no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at all. I believe he would agree to look the doors of the treaſury, and to throw the keys into the ocean. I believe he would conſent to ſtarve every man out of office: and then, I believe, the conſequence would be, that the wheels of government would be ſtopt.</p>
            <p>For my part, tho' I value money, I certainly value the liberty and independence of the country more; and as I believe that thoſe objects cannot be better ſecured than by ſupporting the beſt government in the world; and as I know that that government cannot be ſupported with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the expenditure of money, I ſhall certainly never be ſo far carried away by the paſſion of ſaving, as to refuſe an appropriation of money required for any neceſſary purpoſe of government, and eſpecially in a caſe where I cannot refuſe without violating the Conſtitution.</p>
