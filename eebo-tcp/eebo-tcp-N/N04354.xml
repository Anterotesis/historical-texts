            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THAT Diſcourſe of our bleſſed SAVIOUR we have an Account of in this Chapter from the 17 Verſe to the End, was occaſioned by the <hi>Jews</hi> murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt him, and perſecuting him for his heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the impotent Man at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> and bidding him take up his Bed and walk on the Sabbath Day. Chriſt largely vindicates himſelf in this Diſcourſe, by aſſerting his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God the Father in Nature and Operations, and thereby implicitly ſhewing himſelf to be Lord of the Sabbath, and by declaring to the <hi>Jews</hi> that God the Father, and he with him, did <hi>work hitherto,</hi> or even to this Time; i. e. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſaid that God reſted on the ſeventh Day from all his Works, yet indeed God continues to work hitherto, even to this very Day, with Reſpect to his greateſt Work, the Work of Redemption, or new Creation, which he carries on by Jeſus Chriſt his Son. Purſuant to the Deſigns of which Work was his ſhewing Mercy to fallen Men by healing their Diſeaſes, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them from the Calamities they bro't on themſelves by Sin. This great Work of Redemption, God carries on from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World to this Time; and his Reſt from it will not come till the Reſurrection, which Chriſt ſpeaks of in the 21 and following Verſes: the finiſhing of this Redemption as to its Pocurement, being in his own Reſurrection; and as to the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the general Reſurrection and eternal Judgment, ſpoken of from V. 20. to v. 30. So that notwithſtanding both the Reſt on the ſeventh Day, and alſo the Reſt that <hi>Joſhua</hi> gave the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Canaan</hi>; yet the great Reſt of the Redeemer from his Works, and ſo of his People with him and in him, yet remains, as
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005385_0003_1017B4F5D9CA8618"/>
the Apoſtle obſerves, Heb. Chap. 4. This will be at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and general Judgment; which Chriſt here teaches the <hi>Jews,</hi> was to be brought to paſs by the Son of God, by the Father's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and ſo the Works of God to be finiſhed by him.</p>
            <p>And inaſmuch as this Vindication was ſo far from ſatisfying the <hi>Jews,</hi> that it did but further enrage them, becauſe hereby he made himſelf equal with God, Chriſt therefore refers them to the Witneſs of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>; whoſe Teſtimony they muſt acquieſce in, or elſe be inconſiſtent with themſelves; becauſe they had generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged <hi>John</hi> to be a great Prophet, and ſeem'd for a while mightily affected and taken with it, that God, after ſo long a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Spirit of Prophecy, had raiſed up ſo great a Prophet among them—and it is concerning him that Chriſt ſpeaks in this Verſe wherein is the Text; <hi>He was a burning and a ſhining Light; and ye were willing for a Seaſon to rejoice in his Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Order to a right underſtanding and Improvement of the Words of the Text, we may obſerve</p>
            <p n="1">1. What Chriſt here takes Notice of in <hi>John,</hi> and declares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, viz. That <hi>he was a burning and a ſhining Light.</hi> He was a Light to the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to reveal the Mind and Will of God to them, after a long continued dark Seaſon, and after they had been deſtitute of any Prophet to inſtruct 'em, for ſome Ages: He aroſe on <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the Morning Star, the Forerunner of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, to introduce the <hi>Day-ſpring,</hi> or Dawning of the Goſpel-Day, <hi>to give Light to them that</hi> 'till then had <hi>ſat in the Darkneſs</hi> of perfect Night, which was <hi>the Shadow of Death; to give</hi> them <hi>the Knowledge of Salvation</hi>; as <hi>Zecharias</hi> his Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares at his Circumciſion, Luke 1.76, 77, 78, 79. <hi>And thou Child ſhall be called the Prophet of the Higheſt; for thou ſhalt go before the Face of the Lord, to prepare his Ways; to give Knowledge of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto his People, by the Remiſſion of their Sins, through the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercy of our God; whereby the Day ſpring from on high hath viſited us, to give Light to them that ſit in Darkneſs, and in the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death, to guide our Feet into the Way of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he was a <hi>burning Light,</hi> as he was full of a Spirit of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Piety and Holineſs, <hi>being filled with the Holy Ghoſt from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Womb,</hi> having his Heart warm'd and enflamed with a great Love to Chriſt, being that <hi>Friend of the Bridegroom, that ſtood and heard him, and rejoiced greatly becauſe of the Bridegroom's Voice</hi>; and was glad that Chriſt <hi>increaſed,</hi> though he <hi>decreaſed,</hi> John 3.29, 30.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005385_0004_1017B511B0E5DA50"/>
And was animated with a Holy Zeal in the Work of the Miniſtry: He came in this Reſpect <hi>in the Spirit and Power of Elias</hi>; as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> was zealous in bearing Teſtimony againſt the Corruption, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacies, and Idolatries of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his Day, ſo was <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> in teſtifying againſt the Wickedneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> in his Day: As <hi>Elias</hi> zealouſly reproved the Sins of all Sorts of Perſons in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sins of the common People, but of their great ones, <hi>Ahab, Ahaziah</hi> and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and their falſe Prophets; with what Zeal did <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> reprove all Sorts of Perſons, not only the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Soldiers, but the Phariſees and Sadducees, telling them plainly that they were a Generation of Vipers, and rebuked the Wickedneſs of <hi>Herod</hi> in his moſt beloved Luſt, tho' <hi>Herod</hi> ſought his Life for it, as <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Ahaziah</hi> did <hi>Elijah</hi>'s. As <hi>Elias</hi> was much in warning the People of God's approaching Judgments, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing God's awful Wrath againſt <hi>Ahab, Jezebel</hi> and <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> and the Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> and the People in general: So was <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> much in warning the People to <hi>fly from the Wrath to come,</hi> telling them in the moſt awakening Manner, that the <hi>Ax was laid at the Root of the Tree, and that every Tree that brought not forth good Fruit ſhould be hewn down and caſt into the Fire, and that he that came after him had his Fan in his Hand, and that he would throughly purge his Floor, and gather his Wheat into the Garner, and burn up the Chaff with unquenchable Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was not only a <hi>burning,</hi> but <hi>a ſhining Light</hi>: He was ſo in his Doctrine, having more of the Goſpel in his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than the former Prophets, or at leaſt the Goſpel exhibited with greater Light and Clearneſs, more plainly pointing forth the Perſon that was to be the great Redeemer, and declaring his Errand into the World, to take away the Sin of the World, as a Lamb offered in Sacrifice to God, and the Neceſſity that all, even the moſt ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moral and religious ſtood in of him, being by Nature a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Vipers; and the ſpiritual Nature of his Kingdom, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not in Circumciſion, or outward Baptiſm, or any other external Performance or Privileges, but in the powerful Influences of the Holy Ghoſt in their Hearts, a being <hi>baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Clearneſs with which he gave Knowledge of Salvation to God's People, <hi>John</hi> was a bright Light, <hi>and among them that had been born of Women there had not ariſen a greater than he.</hi> In this Brightneſs this Harbinger of the Goſpel Day excelled all the other
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005385_0005_1017B4F9CA93F648"/>
Prophets, as the Morning Star reflects more of the Light of the Sun than any other Star, and is the brighteſt of all the Stars.</p>
            <p>He alſo ſhone bright in his Converſation, and his eminent Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and Renunciation of the Enjoyments of the World; his great Diligence and Laboriouſneſs in his Work, his Impartiality in it, declaring the Mind and Will of God to all Sorts without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction; his great Humility, rejoicing in the Increaſe of the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Chriſt, tho' his Honour was diminiſhed, as the Brightneſs of the Morning Star diminiſhes, as the Light of the Sun increaſes; and in his Faithfulneſs and Courage, ſtill declaring the Mind and Will of God, though it coſt him his own Life. Thus his Light ſhone before Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may obſerve to what Purpoſe Chriſt declares theſe Things of <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Text, viz.</hi> to ſhew how great and excellent a Perſon he was, and worthy that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould regard his Teſtimony: great are the Things which Chriſt elſewhere ſays of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> as in Matth. 11.7. to the 14. He ſpeaks of him as a <hi>Prophet; and more than a Prophet</hi>; and one, <hi>than whom, there had not riſen a greater among them that had been born of Women.</hi> He obſerves how great and excellent a Light he was in the Text, to ſhew the <hi>Jews</hi> how inexcuſable they were in not receiving the Teſtimony he had given of him; as you may ſee v. 31, 32, and 33.</p>
            <p>Therefore that which I would obſerve from the Text to be the Subject of my preſent Diſcourſe is this:</p>
            <p>'Tis the Excellency of a Miniſter of the Goſpel to be both a burning and a ſhining Light.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee it is in Chriſt's Eſteem, the great Prophet of God, and Light of the World, Head of the Church, and Lord of the Harveſt, and the great Lord and Maſter whoſe Meſſengers all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was a Miniſter of the Goſpel; and he was ſo more eminently than the antient Prophets: for though God at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Times, and in diverſe Manners, ſpake the Goſpel by them; yet <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was a Miniſter of the Goſpel in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſtinguiſhed from them: he is reckon'd in Scripture the firſt that introduced the Goſpel Day, after the Law and the Prophets, Luke 6.16. <hi>The Law and the Prophets were until</hi> John; <hi>ſince that Time the Kingdom of God is preached.</hi> And his Preaching is called
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005385_0006_1017B5139F1A5F30"/>
the <hi>Beginning of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God,</hi> Mark 1.1. He came on that Errand, <hi>to give Knowledge of Salvation to God's People, through the Remiſſion of their Sins</hi>; (as his Father <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias</hi> obſerves Luke 1.77.) and to preach theſe glad Tydings that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven was at Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> being thus eminently a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and a <hi>burning and ſhining Light</hi> being taken Notice of by Chriſt as his great Excellency, we may juſtly hence obſerve, that herein conſiſts the proper Excellency of Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I would, by divine Aſſiſtance, handle the Subject in the following Method.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would ſhew that Chriſt's Deſign, in the Appointment of the Order and Office of Miniſters of the Goſpel is, that they may be <hi>Lights</hi> to the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would ſhew what is implied in their being <hi>burning Lights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I would ſhew what is implied in their being <hi>ſhining Lights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. I would ſhew that it is the proper Excellency of Miniſters of the Goſpel to have theſe Things united in them, to be both burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhining Lights.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I would apply theſe Things to all that Chriſt has called to the the Work of the Goſpel Miniſtry, ſhewing how much it concerns them earneſtly to endeavour that they may be <hi>burning and ſhining Lights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Shew what Miniſters of the Goſpel ought to do that they may be ſo.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Say ſomething briefly concerning the Duty of a People that are under the Care of a Goſpel Miniſter, correſpondent to thoſe Things that Chriſt has taught us concerning the End and Excellency of a Goſpel Miniſter.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I would obſerve that Chriſt's Deſign in the Appointment of the Order and Office of Miniſters of the Goſpel was that they might be <hi>Lights</hi> to the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Satan</hi>'s Kingdom is a Kingdom of Darkneſs; the Devils are the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World. But Chriſt's Kingdom is a Kingdom of Light; the Deſigns of his Kingdom are carried on by Light; his People <hi>are not of the Night, nor of Darkneſs,</hi> but are <hi>the Children of the Light,</hi> as they are the Children of God, who is <hi>the Father of Lights,</hi> and as it were a boundleſs Fountain of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely pure and bright Light, 1 Joh. 1.5. Jam. 1.17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005385_0007_1017B4FD00CB2FA0"/>Man by the Fall extinguiſhed that divine Light that ſhone in this World in its firſt Eſtate. The Scripture repreſents the Wickedneſs of Man as reducing the World to that State wherein it was when it was yet <hi>without Form and void, and Darkneſs filled it.</hi> Jer. 4.22, 23. <hi>For my People is fooliſh, they have not known me: they are ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Children; and they have none Underſtanding: they are wiſe to do Evil; but to do Good they have no Knowledge. I beheld the Earth, and lo it was without Form and void; and the Heavens, and they had no Light.</hi> But God in infinite Mercy has made glorious Proviſion for the Reſtoration of Light to this fallen dark World; he has ſent him, who is the Brightneſs of his own Glory, into the World, to be the Light of the World. <hi>He is the true Light, that lighteth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man that cometh into the World,</hi> i. e. Every Man in the World that ever has any true Light. But in his Wiſdom and Mercy, he is pleaſed to convey his Light to Men by Means and Inſtruments; and has ſent forth his Meſſengers, and appointed Miniſters in his Church to be ſubordinate Lights, and to ſhine with the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his Light, and to reflect the Beams of his Glory on the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p>There is an Analogy between the divine Conſtitution and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Things in the natural and in the ſpiritual World. The wiſe Creator han't left the natural World without Light; But in this our ſolar Syſtem has ſet one great Light, immenſly exceeding all the Reſt, ſhining perpetually with a tranſcendant Fulneſs and Strength, to enlighten the whole; and he hath appointed other leſſer, ſubordinate or dependant Lights, that ſhine with the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Reflections of ſomething of his Brightneſs. So it is in the ſpiritual World; there God hath appointed Jeſus Chriſt as a Sun of Righteouſneſs: The Church of God <hi>has not the Sun to be her Light by Day; nor for Brightneſs, does the Moon give Light to her; but the Lord is her everlaſting Light, and her God her Glory. The new</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>has no Need of the Sun, nor the Moon; for the Lamb is the Light thereof.</hi> And the Miniſters of Chriſt are as it were the Stars that encompaſs this glorious Fountain of Light, to receive and reflect his Beams, and give Light to the Souls of Men. As Chriſt therefore is in Scripture called the Sun, ſo are his Miniſters called Stars. So are the twelve Apoſtles, the chief Miniſters of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, called Rev. 12.1. <hi>And there appeared a great Wonder in Heaven, a Woman cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her Feet, and upon her Head a Crown of twelve Stars.</hi> And ſo are the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005385_0008_1017B51566F8BAF8"/>
ordinary Miniſters of the Goſpel called Rev. 1.16. <hi>And he had in his Right Hand ſeven Stars.</hi> And v. 20. <hi>The Myſtery of the ſeven Stars, which thou ſaweſt in my Right Hand, and the ſeven golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks; the ſeven Stars are the Angels of the ſeven Churches.</hi> Here alſo Miniſters of the Goſpel are implicitly compared to thoſe Lamps that enlightned the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> upon the Tops of the golden Candleſticks: and more expreſly in Zech. 4.2. <hi>I have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and behold a Candleſtick, all of Gold, with a Bowl upon the Top of it, and his ſeven Lamps thereon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Lamps have all their Oil from Chriſt, and are in kindled by his Flame, and ſhine by his Beams; and being thus dependant on him, they are near to him, and held in his Right Hand, that they may receive Light from him, to communicate to others.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of a Light is threefold; to <hi>diſcover,</hi> to <hi>refreſh,</hi> and to <hi>direct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Uſe of a Light is to <hi>diſcover</hi> Things, or make them manifeſt. Without Light nothing is to be ſeen. Eph. 5.13. <hi>Whatſoever doth make manifeſt is Light.</hi> Miniſters are ſet to be Lights to the Souls of Men in this Reſpect, as they are to be the Means of imparting divine Truth to them, and bringing into their View the moſt glorious and excellent Objects, and of leading them to, and aſſiſting them in the Contemplation of thoſe Things that Angels deſire to look into; the Means of their obtaining that Knowledge is infinitely more important and more excellent and uſeful, than that of the greateſt Stateſmen or Philoſophers, even that which is ſpiritual and divine: They are ſet to be the Means of bringing Men out of Darkneſs into God's marvellous Light, and of bringing them to the infinite Fountain of Light, that in his Light they may ſee Light: They are ſet to inſtruct Men, and impart to them that Knowledge by which they may know God and Jeſus Chriſt, whom to know is Life eternal.</p>
            <p>Another Uſe of Light is to <hi>refreſh</hi> and delight the Beholders. Darkneſs is diſmal: the Light is ſweet, and a pleaſant Thing it is to behold the Sun. Light is refreſhing to thoſe who have long ſat in Darkneſs: They therefore that watch and keep awake through a dark Night, long and wait for the Light of the Morning; and the wiſe Man obſerves, Prov. 15.30. <hi>That the Light of the Eyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth the Heart.</hi> Spiritual Light is eſpecially refreſhing and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Pſ. 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and Gladneſs for the Upright in Heart.</hi> They that ſee the Light of Chriſt, <hi>the Star that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005385_0009_1017B4FE8726A0A0"/>
hath ariſen out of Jacob,</hi> are refreſhed, and do rejoice, as the wiſe Men that ſaw the Star that ſhewed them where Chriſt was, Matth. 2.10. <hi>And when they ſaw the Star, they rejoiced with exceeding great Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miniſters are ſet in the Church of God to be the Inſtruments of this Comfort and Refreſhment to the Souls of Men, to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of leading Souls to the God of all Conſolation, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their Happineſs: they are ſent as Chriſt was, and as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers with him, to <hi>preach good Tidings to the Meek, to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound,</hi> and to comfort <hi>all that mourn</hi>: They are to lead thoſe that <hi>labour, and are heavy laden</hi> to their true <hi>Reſt,</hi> and <hi>to ſpeak a Word in Seaſon to him that is weary</hi>: They are ſet to be Miniſters of the Conſolation and Joy of the Saints. 2 Cor. 1.24. <hi>We have not Dominion over your Faith; but are Helpers of your Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Uſe of Light is <hi>to direct.</hi> 'Tis by Light that we ſee where to go: <hi>he that walks in Darkneſs knows not whither he goes,</hi> and is in Danger of Stumbling and Falling into Miſchief. 'Tis by Light that Men ſee what to do, and are enabled to work; in <hi>the Night,</hi> Chriſt tells us <hi>no Man can work.</hi> Miniſters are ſet to be Lights to Men's Souls in this Reſpect alſo; as <hi>Zecharias</hi> obſerves of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> Luke 1.79. <hi>To guide our Feet in the Way of Peace.</hi> Miniſters have the Record of God committed to them that they may hold that forth, which God has given to be to Man as a <hi>Light ſhining in a dark Place,</hi> to guide them in the Way thro' this dark World to Regions of eternal Light. Miniſters are ſet to be the Inſtruments of conveying to Men that true Wiſdom ſpoken of Job 28. <hi>Which cannot be gotten for Gold, nor ſhall Silver be weighed for the Price thereof; which cannot be valued with the Gold of</hi> Ophir, <hi>with the precious Onyx, or the Sapphire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed now to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thing propoſed, viz. to ſhew what is implied in a Miniſter of the Goſpel's being a <hi>burning Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are theſe two Things that ſeem naturally to be underſtood by this Expreſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Heart be fill'd with much of the holy Ardour of a Spirit of true Piety; and that he be fervent and zealous in his Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005385_0010_1017B51B827E2730"/>1. That his Heart be full of much of the holy Ardour of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of true Piety. We read of <hi>the Power of Godlineſs.</hi> True Grace is no dull, inactive, ineffectual Principle; it is a powerful Thing; there is an exceeding Energy in it: And the Reaſon is, that God is in it; it is a divine Principle, a <hi>Participation of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and a Communication of divine Life, of the Life of a riſen Saviour, who exerts himſelf in the Hearts of the Saints, <hi>after the Power of an endleſs Life.</hi> They that have true Grace in them <hi>they live</hi>; but not by their own Life; <hi>but Chriſt lives in them</hi>: His Holy Spirit becomes in them a living Principle and Spring of divine Life: The Energy and Power of which is in Scripture compared to Fire Matth. 3.11. <hi>I indeed baptize you with Water; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whoſe Shoes I am not worthy to bear: he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire.</hi> True Piety is nothing remaining only in the Head, or conſiſting in any ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Knowledge or Opinions, or outward Morality or Forms of Religion; it reaches the Heart, is chiefly ſeated there, and burns there. There is a holy Ardour in every Thing that belongs to true Grace: True Faith is an ardent Thing, and ſo is true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; there is a holy Power and Ardour in true ſpiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Joy; yea even in true Chriſtian Humility, Submiſſion and Meekneſs. The Reaſon is that divine Love or Charity is the Sum of all true Grace, which is a holy Flame inkindled in the Soul: 'Tis by this therefore eſpecially, that a Miniſter of the Goſpel is a <hi>burning Light</hi>: A Miniſter that is ſo, has his Soul enkindled with the heavenly Flame; his Heart burns with Love to Chriſt, and fervent Deſires of the Advancement of his Kingdom and Glory; and alſo with ardent Love to the Souls of Men, and Deſires for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The inward holy Ardour of his Soul is exerciſed and manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his being <hi>zealous, and fervent in his Adminiſtrations</hi>: For, he is a <hi>burning Light</hi>; which implies that his ſpiritual Heat and holy Ardour is not for himſeif only, but is communicative, and for the Benefit of others: He is ardent, as he is <hi>a Light,</hi> or in the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the Duties of that Office wherein he is ſet to be a Light in the Church of Chriſt. His fervent Zeal, which has its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Spring in that holy and powerful Flame of Love to God and Man, that is in his Heart, appears in the Fervency of his Prayers to God, for and with his People; and in the Earneſtneſs, and Power with which he preaches the Word of God, declares to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005385_0011_1017B50019104668"/>
Sinners their Miſery, and warns them to fly from the Wrath to come, and reproves, and teſtifies againſt all Ungodlineſs; and the unfeigned Earneſtneſs and Compaſſion with which he invites the weary and heavy laden to their Saviour; and the fervent Love with which he counſels and comforts the Saints: and the holy Zeal, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Steadfaſtneſs, with which he maintains the Exerciſe of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in the Houſe of God, notwithſtanding all the Oppoſition he meets with in that difficult Part of the miniſterial Work; and in the Diligence and Earneſtneſs with which he attends every Duty of his miniſterial Function, whether publick or private.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to the</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thing propoſed in the Handling of this Subject, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew what is implied in a Miniſter's being <hi>a ſhining Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three Things that ſeem to be naturally ſignified by it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he be <hi>pure, clear and full in his Doctrine.</hi> A Miniſter is ſet to be a Light to Men's Souls, by Teaching, or Doctrine: And if he be a ſhining Light in this Reſpect, the Light of his Doctrine muſt be bright and full; it muſt be pure without Mixtures of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore he muſt be ſound in the Faith, not one that is of a reprobate Mind; in Doctrine he muſt ſhow Uncorruptneſs; otherwiſe his <hi>Light</hi> will be <hi>Darkneſs</hi>: He muſt not lead his People into Errors, but teach them the Truth only, guiding their Feet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Way of Peace, and leading them in the right Ways of the Lord.</p>
            <p>He muſt be one that is <hi>able to teach,</hi> not one that is raw, ignorant or unlearned, and but little verſed in the Things that he is to teach others; <hi>not a Novice,</hi> or one that is <hi>unſkilful in the Word of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>; he muſt be one that is well ſtudied in Divinity, well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the written Word of God, mighty in the Scriptures, and able to inſtruct and convince Gainſayers.</p>
            <p>And in Order to be a <hi>ſhining Light,</hi> he muſt be one that really knows what Religion is, one that is truly acquainted with that Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Way of Salvation, that he is to teach to others, that he may <hi>ſpeak the Things that he knows, and teſtify the Things that he has ſeen,</hi> and not be a blind Leader of the Blind: He muſt be one that is acquainted with experimental Religion, and not ignorant of the inward Operations of the Spirit of God, nor of Satan's Devices; able to guide Souls under their particular Difficulties. Thus he
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005385_0012_1017B522D6A81C20"/>
muſt be <hi>a Scribe well inſtructed in Things that pertain to the Kingdom of God</hi>; one <hi>that brings forth out of his Treaſures, Things now and old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in Order to his being a <hi>ſhining Light,</hi> his Doctrine muſt be <hi>full,</hi> he muſt not only be able to teach, but apt to teach, ready to inſtruct the Ignorant, and them that are out of the Way, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in Teaching, in publick and private; and careful and faithful to declare the whole Counſel of God, and not to keep back any Thing that may be profitable to his Hearers.</p>
            <p>Alſo his being a <hi>ſhining Light</hi> implies that his Inſtructions are <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> accommodated to the Capacity of his Hearers, and tending to convey Light to their Underſtandings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Thing requiſite in Order to a Miniſter's being a <hi>ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light,</hi> is that he be <hi>diſcreet in all his Adminiſtrations.</hi> The fervent Zeal that thus ſhould animate and actuate him in his Adminiſtrations ſhould be regulated by Diſcretion: He ſhould not only be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and able to communicate Knowledge and formed to do it; but alſo wiſe, and know how to conduct himſelf in the Houſe of God, as a wiſe Builder, and a wiſe Steward. And as he is one that God hath ſent forth to labour in his Field, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Care of his Vineyard to, ſo he ſhould conduct himſelf there as one <hi>whom his God doth inſtruct to Diſcretion</hi>: He ſhould not only be as <hi>harmleſs as a Dove,</hi> but as <hi>wiſe as a Serpent</hi>; ſhewing himſelf a <hi>Workman that needs not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth</hi>; and one that <hi>knows how to govern the Church of God,</hi> and to <hi>walk in Wiſdom towards thoſe that are without.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Thing implied in a Miniſters being a <hi>ſhining Light,</hi> is that he <hi>ſhines in his Converſation</hi>: If he ſhines never ſo much in his Doctrine and Adminiſtrations in the Houſe of God, yet if there be not an anſwerable Brightneſs in his Converſation, it will have a Tendency to render all ineffectual. Chriſt, in Mat. 5.14, 15, 16. ſays to his Diſciples (having undoubtedly a ſpecial Reſpect to thoſe of them that were to be ſent forth to preach the Goſpel) <hi>Ye are the Light of the World:—Men do not light a Candle, and put it under a Buſhel, but on a Candleſtick, and it giveth Light unto all that are in the Houſe.</hi> And how does Chriſt direct them to give Light to others? <hi>Let your Light,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſo ſhine before Men, that others ſeeing</hi> your good Works, <hi>may glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And he tells the ſame Diſciples again Joh. 15.8. <hi>Herein is my Father glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, that ye bear much Fruit.</hi> And how ſhould they bring forth
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005385_0013_1017B5038DEEF0B8"/>
Fruit? Chriſt tells them, Ver. 10. <hi>If ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall abide in my Love,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Ye are my Friends if ye do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I command you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God ſent his Son into the World to be the Light of the World theſe two Ways, <hi>viz.</hi> By revealing his Mind and Will, to the World, and alſo by ſetting the World a perfect Example. So Miniſters are fet to be Lights, not only as Teachers, but as Enſamples to the Flock, 1 Pet. 5.3.</p>
            <p>The ſame Things that Miniſters recommend to their Hearers in their Doctrine, they ſhould alſo ſhew them an Example of in their Practice. Thus the Apoſtle ſays to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.11. <hi>Theſe Things command and teach</hi>; and then adds in the next Verſe, <hi>Be thou an Example of the Believers, in Word, in Converſation, in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity.</hi> So he directs <hi>Titus,</hi> in his Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, to recommend <hi>Sobriety, Gravity, Temperance, Patience</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vertues, in the Beginning of the 2d Chapter of <hi>Titus.</hi> But then adds in the 7th v. <hi>In all Things ſhewing thy ſelf a Pattern of good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee in natural Bodies, that when Heat is raiſed in them to a high Degree, at Length they begin to ſhine: And, as I obſerved before, a Principle of true Grace in the Soul is like an inward Heat, an holy Ardour of an heavenly Fire inkindled in the Soul: This in Miniſters of the Goſpel ought to be to that Degree, as to ſhine forth brightly in all their Converſation; and there ſhould as it were be a Light about them wherever they go, exhibiting to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, the amiable, delightful Image of the Beauty and Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their glorious Maſter.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Thing propoſed, which is to ſhew that the Excellency of a Miniſter of the Goſpel conſiſts in his being thus <hi>both a burning and a ſhining Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is manifeſt in two Things;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Herein his Miniſtry is acceptable and amiable in the Sight of God and Men.</p>
            <p>When Light and Heat are thus united in a Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, it ſhews that each is genuine, and of a right Kind, and that both are divine. Divine Light is attended with Heat; and ſo, on the other Hand, a truly divine and holy Heat and Ardour is ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:005385_0014_1017B52477D59FF8"/>'Tis the Glory of the Sun that ſuch a bright and glorious Light, and ſuch a powerful, refreſhing, vivifying Heat, are both together diffuſed from that Luminary. When there is Light in a Miniſter, conſiſting in human Learning, great ſpeculative Knowledge and the Wiſdom of this World without a ſpiritual Warmth &amp; Ardour in his Heart, &amp; a holy Zeal in his Miniſtrations, his Light is like the Light of an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> &amp; ſome Kinds of putrifying Carcaſſes that ſhine in the dark, tho' they are of a ſtinking Savour. And if on the other Hand a Miniſter has Warmth and Zeal, without Light, his Heat has nothing excellent in it, but is rather to be abhor'd; being like the Heat of the bottomleſs Pit; where, though the Fire be great, yet there is no Light. To be hot in this Manner, and not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, is to be like an Angel of Darkneſs. But Miniſters by having Light and Heat united in them, will be like the Angels of Light; which for their Light and Brightneſs are called <hi>Morning Stars,</hi> Job 38.7. <hi>When the Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for Joy.</hi> And becauſe of that holy Ardour of divine Love and Zeal with which they burn, they are compar'd to a flaming Fire, Pſal. 104.4. <hi>Who maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Miniſters a flaming Fire,</hi> and are therefore called <hi>Seraphims,</hi> which is a Word that is derived from a Root that ſignifies <hi>to burn.</hi> So that by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel being <hi>burning and ſhining Lights,</hi> the <hi>Angels of the Churches</hi> will become like the <hi>Angels of Heaven,</hi> and thoſe Stars held in the right Hand of Chriſt here below, will be like thoſe Morning Stars above, &amp; which is much more, hereby Miniſters will be like their glorious Lord &amp; Maſter; who is not only the Maſter of Miniſters of the Goſpel but is the Head &amp; Lord of the glorious Angels, whom they adore, and who communicates to them the Brightneſs in which they ſhine, and the Flame with which they burn, and is the glorious Luminary and Sun of the heavenly World, from whence all the Inhabitants of that World have their Light and Life, and all their Glory. In this Sun of Righteouſneſs is that Light, whoſe Brightneſs is ſuch that the Light of the Sun in the Firmament in Compariſon of it is as Darkneſs, yea <hi>black as Sackcloth of Hair</hi>: For he is the infinite Brightneſs of God's Glory; and of him it is ſaid, Iſai. 24.23. <hi>Then the Moon ſhall be confounded, and the Sun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, when the Lord of Hoſts ſhall reign in Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>and in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>before his Antients, gloriouſly.</hi> And accompanying this bright Light in him, is the infinitely intenſe Flame of Love. There is no Love to be compared to his; nor ever was Love to both God
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005385_0015_1017B50EA77E9498"/>
and Man ſo manifeſted, as has been in what Chriſt has done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd; for <hi>herein was Love!</hi> Miniſters by being burning and ſhining Lights, become the Sons of God, of whom we read that he <hi>is Light,</hi> and that he <hi>is Love</hi>; 1 Joh. 1.5. <hi>This then is the Meſſage which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that</hi> God is Light, <hi>and in him is no Darkneſs at all</hi>; and Chap. 4.16. <hi>And we have known and believed the Love that God hath to us</hi>: God is Love, <hi>and he that dwelleth in Love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it muſt needs be that Miniſters, by being burning and ſhining Lights, are <hi>acceptable and amiable in the Sight of God,</hi> as he delights in his own Image and in the Image of his Son: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo they will be <hi>honourable and amiable in the Sight of Men,</hi> all ſuch as have any Senſe of that which is truly excellent and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful; and 'tis the Way to have their Miniſtry <hi>pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to thoſe of this Character that ſit under it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Herein a Miniſter of the Goſpel will be likely to anſwer the Ends of his Miniſtry: By this Means his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry will not only be <hi>amiable,</hi> but <hi>profitable.</hi> If a Miniſter has Light without Heat, and entertains his Auditory with learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſcourſes, without a Savour of the Power of Godlineſs, or any Appearance of Fervency of Spirit, and Zeal for God and the good of Souls, he may gratify itching Ears, and fill the Heads of his People with empty Notions; but will not be very likely to reach their Hearts, or ſave their Souls. And if, on the other Hand, he be driven on with a fierce and intemperate Zeal, and vehement Heat, without Light, he will be likely to kindle the like unhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Flame in his People, and to fire their corrupt Paſſions and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; but will make them never the better, nor lead them a Step towards Heaven, but drive them apace the other Way.</p>
            <p>But if he approves himſelf in his Miniſtry, as both a burning and a ſhining Light, this will be the Way to promote true Chriſtianity amongſt his People, and to make them both wiſe and good, and cauſe Religion to flouriſh among them in the Purity and Beauty of it.</p>
            <p>When divine Light and Heat attend each other in Miniſters of the Goſpel, their Light will be like the Beams of the Sun, that don't only convey Light, but give Life; and Converts will be like to ſpring up under their Miniſtry, as the Graſs and the Plants of the Field under the Influences of the Sun; and the Souls of the Saints will be likely to grow, and appear beautiful <hi>as the Lily,</hi> and to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005385_0016_1017B2CCC2EFDC90"/>
as the Corn, and grow as the Vine, and their Scent to be as the Wine of Lebanon</hi>; and their Light will be like the Light of Chriſt, which is the <hi>Light of Life,</hi> John 8.12.</p>
            <p>If the Sun ſhould ſhine upon the Earth, with the ſame Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that it doth now, yet if it were without any Heat, it would give Life to nothing; the World be a deſolate Wilderneſs, with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing growing in it; the Death of every living Thing muſt be the Conſequence; and the Sun's Light could be of no Service to us, but to cauſe us to ſee our own and others Miſery, without being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to help our ſelves or them. On the other Hand, if the Sun diffuſed the ſame Heat that now it does, but the World was deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute at the ſame Time of any Light, it would be equally unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: Mankind having no Light to guide them in their Buſineſs, in tilling the Field, or gathering the Produce of the Earth, we ſhould be like the Egyptians in their three Days Darkneſs, who ſaw not one another, nor roſe from their Place: And thus alſo Death would be the unavoidable Conſequence. But by Light and Heat accompanying one another, the whole Face of the Earth becomes fruitful, and is adorned, and all Things are quickened and flouriſh, and Mankind enjoy both Life and Comfort.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="5">V. Thing propoſed in handling the Doctrine, to apply theſe Things to all here preſent, that Chriſt has called to the Work of the Goſpel-Miniſtry, obſerving how much it concerns ſuch to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be burning and ſhining Lights.</p>
            <p>Our Office and Work is moſt honourable, in that we are ſet by Chriſt to be Lights or Luminaries in the ſpiritual World. Light is the moſt glorious Thing in the material World, and there are, it may be, no Parts of the natural World that have ſo great an Image of the Goodneſs of God, as the Lights or Luminaries of Heaven; and eſpecially the Sun, who is conſtantly communicating his benign Influence to enlighten, quicken and refreſh the World by his Beams; which is probably the Reaſon that the Worſhip of the Sun was (as is ſuppoſed) the firſt Idolatry that Mankind fell into. But ſo are Miniſters honoured by their great Lord and Maſter, that they are ſet to be that to Men's Souls, that the Lights of Heaven are to their Bodies; and that they might be the Inſtruments and Vehicles of God's greateſt Goodneſs, and the moſt precious Fruits of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Love to them, and Means of that Life, and Refreſhment and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005385_0017_1017B5102B4F7A88"/>
Joy, that are ſpiritual and eternal, and infinitely more precious than any Benefit received by the benign Beams of the Sun in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament. And we ſhall be likely indeed to be the Inſtruments of thoſe unſpeakable Benefits to the Souls of our Fellow-Creatures, if we have thoſe Qualifications, which have been ſhewn to be the true and proper Excellency of Miniſters of the Goſpel. Herein our Glory will anſwer the honourable Station Chriſt has ſet us in. And hereby our Miniſtry will be likely to be as beneficial as our Office is honourable: We ſhall be like Chriſt, and ſhall ſhine with his Beams; Chriſt will live in us, and be ſeen in his Life and Beauty in our Miniſtry, and in our Converſation, and we ſhall be moſt likely to be the Means of bringing others to him, and of their receiving of his Light, and being made Partakers of his life, and having his Joy fulfilled in them. And this will be the Way for us hereafter to be as much advanced and diſtinguiſhed in our Reward, as we are honoured in the Office and Buſineſs we are called to here. In this Way, thoſe whom Chriſt has ſet to be Lights in his Church, and to be Stars in the ſpiritual World here, ſhall be Lights alſo in the Church triumphant, and ſhine as Stars forever in Heaven, Dan. 12.3. <hi>And they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the Brightneſs of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, and they that turn many to Righteouſneſs, as the Stars for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we fail of the proper Excellency of Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, we ſhall not be in the Sight of God the more worthy or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for our high Office, but the more abominable and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeable; our Wickedneſs being aggravated by God's great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Condeſcention to us, and the peculiar Obligations that he laid upon us: and inſtead of being eminently beneficial and great Bleſſings as Lights to reflect the Beams of Chriſt's Glory and Love, we ſhall be ſo much the more hurtful and pernicious, for our being in ſuch a Station; and ſo ſhall be likely hereafter to ſuffer a ſo much more dreadful Puniſhment. The Devils in Hell are ſo much the more odious to God, and more the Objects of his Wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſet them in the Dignity and Glory of Angels, the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of which State they are fallen from. And 'tis likely that thoſe in Hell that will be neareſt to the fallen Angels, in their State of Miſery, will be thoſe that Chriſt once ſet to be Angels of the Churches, but through their Unfaithfulneſs, fail'd of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Excellency and End.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:005385_0018_1017B52810942BD0"/>Here I would apply my ſelf in a few Words to the Perſon whoſe intended Ordination, this Day, to the great Work of the Goſpel-Miniſtry, is the Occaſion of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>You have now, dear Sir, heard ſomething of the Nature and Deſign of that Office to which you are this Day, in the Name of Chriſt, to be ſolemnly ſet apart. You are therein called to be a Light to the Souls of Men, a Lamp in God's Temple, and a Star in the ſpiritual World. And you have heard wherein, in Chriſt's Eſteem, conſiſts the proper Excellency of one in that Office, and how in this a Miniſter of the Goſpel becomes like his glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and glorifies him, and is likely to be the Inſtrument of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Happineſs of the Souls of Men, and to receive a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reward from the Hands of God.</p>
            <p>Theſe, Sir, are the Motives that you are to be influenced by, to endeavour to be a burning and a ſhining Light in the Work of the Miniſtry. As to the Things of this World, you are not to expect outward Eaſe, Pleaſure and Plenty: Nor are you to depend on the Friendſhip and Reſpect of Men; but ſhould prepare to endure Hardneſs, as one that is going forth as a Soldier to War. But they are higher Things than theſe, more excellent Benefits than the World can afford, that Chriſt offers to thoſe that approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him in this Work.</p>
            <p>God in his Providence has brought you far from your native Land, and from your Friends and Acquaintance there; but you will have Reaſon notwithſtanding to acknowledge the good Hand of his Providence towards you, if he is pleaſed to make you a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſhining Light in this Part of his Church, and by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of your Light and Heat (or rather by his divine Influence, with your Miniſtry) to cauſe this Wilderneſs to bud and bloſſom as the Roſe, and give it the Excellency of <hi>Carmel</hi> and <hi>Sharon,</hi> and to cauſe you to ſhine in the midſt of this People with warm and lightſome, quickening and comforting Beams, cauſing their Souls to flouriſh, rejoice and bear Fruit, like a Garden of pleaſant Fruits, under the Beams of the Sun.</p>
            <p>By this Means you will be to their Souls the Vehicle of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and Bleſſings of the heavenly World which is a World of Light and Love, ſhall be ever held in Chriſt's right Hand, and ſhall be terrible to the Powers of Darkneſs; and ſhall ſee more and more of the Light of Chriſt's Glory and Grace in this Place, with you and this People, and ſhall hereafter not only ſhine your ſelf, as the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005385_0019_1017B530EA4FF090"/>
Brightneſs of the Firmament, but ſhall meet with them in Glory alſo, who ſhall ſhine there around you, as a bright Conſtellation in the higheſt Heaven; where they ſhall be your everlaſting Crown of Rejoicing.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to the</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Thing propoſed, which was to ſhew what Courſe Miniſters of the Goſpel ought to take, or what Things they ſhould do, that they may be burning and ſhining Lights.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall but juſt mention Things, without enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>And in Order to this, Miniſters ſhould be diligent in their Studies, and in the Work of the Miniſtry to which they are called; giving themſelves wholly to it; taking Heed to themſelves, that their Hearts be not engaged, and their Minds ſwallowed up, and their Time conſumed, in Purſuits after the Profits and vain Glory of the World.</p>
            <p>And particularly, Miniſters ſhould be very converſant with the Holy Scriptures; making it very much their Buſineſs, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Diligence and Strictneſs, to ſearch thoſe Holy Writings: For they are as it were the Beams of the Light of the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they are the Light by which Miniſters muſt be enlighten'd and the Light they are to hold forth to their Hearers; and they are the Fire whence their Hearts and the Hearts of their Hearers muſt be enkindl'd.</p>
            <p>They ſhould earneſtly ſeek after much of the ſpiritual Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, and that they may live in the clear Views of his Glory. For by this Means they will be changed into the Image of the ſame Glory and Brightneſs, and will come to their People, as <hi>Moſes</hi> came down to the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after he had ſeen God's Back-parts in the Mount, with his Face ſhining. If the Light of Chriſt's Glory ſhines upon them, it will be the Way for them to ſhine with the ſame Kind of Light on their Hearers, and to reflect the ſame Beams, which have Heat, as well as Brightneſs. The Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt, is the Treaſure the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, that Miniſters have as in Earthen Veſſels: 2 Cor. 4.6, 7. <hi>For God who commanded the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs hath ſhined into your Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt. But we have this Treaſure in Earthen Veſſels.</hi> This was
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005385_0020_1017B53279563900"/>
probably typified of old by the burning Lights &amp; Lamps which <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi>'s Soldiers had in one Hand in Earthen Pitchers, while they held a Trumpet in the other, with which they ſounded (typifying the Preaching of the Goſpel) And thus with the Sound of theſe Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and theſe burning Lights or Earthen Veſſels, they overcame the Enemies of God and his People.</p>
            <p>Miniſters, in Order to their being burning and ſhining Lights, ſhould walk cloſely with God, and keep near to Chriſt; that they may ever be enlighten'd and enkindled by him. And they ſhould be much in ſeeking God, and converſing with him by Prayer, who is the Fountain of Light and Love: And knowing their own Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs and Helpleſſneſs ſhould be ever dependant on Chriſt; being ſenſible with <hi>Jeremiah</hi> that they are Children, ſhould ſit as Children at Chriſt's Feet to hear his Word, and be inſtructed by him; and being ſenſible with <hi>Iſaiah</hi> that they are Men of unclean Lips ſhould ſeek that their Lips may be as it were touched with a live Coal from the Altar, as it were by the bright and burning Seraphim.</p>
            <p>I come now to the</p>
            <p n="7">VII and laſt Thing propoſed, to ſay ſomething very briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Duties of a People that are under the Care of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, correſponding with theſe Things that Chriſt has taught us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Nature and End of this ſacred Office. And here I would have a ſpecial Reſpect to the People of God in this Place, who are about to have the Care of their Souls committed to him, that is now ſolemnly to be ſet apart to the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
            <p>If it be, as you have heard, the proper Excellency of a Miniſter of the Goſpel to be a burning and a ſhining Light, then it is your Duty earneſtly to pray for your Miniſter that he may be filled with Divine Light, and with the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, to make him ſo. For herein you will but pray for the greateſt Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to your ſelves; for if your Miniſter burns and ſhines, it will be for your Light and Life. That which has been ſpoken of, as it is the chief Excellency of a Miniſter, fo it renders a Miniſter the greateſt Bleſſing of any Thing in the World that ever God beſtows on a People.</p>
            <p>And as it is your Duty, to pray that your Miniſter may by this Means become ſuch a Bleſſing to you, ſo you ſhould do your Part to make him ſo, by ſupporting him, and putting him under the beſt
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005385_0021_1017B535D5DBFE38"/>
Advantage, with a Mind free from worldly Cares, and the Preſſure of outward Wants and Difficulties, to give himſelf wholly to his Work; and by all proper Acts of Reſpect and Kindneſs and Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to encourage his Heart, and ſtrengthen his Hands: And to take Heed that inſtead of this you don't take a Courſe to obſcure and extinguiſh the Light that would ſhine among you, &amp; to ſmother and ſuppreſs the Flame, by caſting Dirt upon it; by neceſſitating your Miniſter by your Penuriouſneſs towards him, to be envolved in worldly Care; and by diſcouraging his Heart by Diſrepect and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs. And particularly when your Miniſter ſhews himſelf to be a burning Light by burning with a proper Zeal againſt any Wickedneſs that may be breaking out amongſt his People &amp; manifeſts it by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a proper Teſtimony againſt it in the Preaching of the Word or by a faithful Exerciſe of the Diſcipline of God's Houſe, inſtead of taking it thankfully, and yeiding to him in it, as you ought, don't raiſe another Fire of a contrary Nature, againſt it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fire of your unhallowed Paſſions, reflecting upon and reproaching him for his Faithfulneſs. Herein you will act very unbecoming a Chriſtian People, and ſhew yourſelves very ungrateful to your Miniſter, and to Chriſt who has beſtowed upon you ſo faithful a Miniſter, and will alſo, while you fight againſt him, and againſt Chriſt, fight moſt effectually againſt your own Souls. If Chriſt gives you a Miniſter that is a burning and ſhining Light, take Heed that you don't <hi>hate the Light, becauſe your Deeds are reproved</hi> by it; but <hi>love and rejoice in his Light</hi>; and that not only for a Seaſon, like <hi>John the Baptiſt's</hi> apoſtatizing Hearers: And <hi>come to the Light.</hi> Let your frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort be to your Miniſter for Inſtruction in Soul Caſes, and under all ſpiritual Difficulties; and be open to the Light and willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; and be obedient to it. And thus walk as the Children of the Light, and follow your Miniſter wherein he is a Follower of Chriſt, i. e. wherein he is as a burning and ſhining Light. If you continue ſo to do, your Path will be the Path of the Juſt, which ſhines more and more to the perfect Day, and the End of your Courſe ſhall be in thoſe bliſsful Regions of everlaſting Light above, where you ſhall ſhine forth with your Miniſter, and both with Chriſt, <hi>as the Sun, in the Kingdom of the Heavenly Father.</hi>
