            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE evidence that they aſſumed the term is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the 7th ſection of the ſecond article of the conſtitution of the Georgia Miſſiſippi Company.</p>

               <p>EVERY holder of Miſſiſſippi ſcript was entitled by virtue of his purchaſe and certificate to have and hold <hi>to himſelf and his heirs and aſſigns forever,</hi> his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lands in <hi>fee ſimple.</hi> All the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies aſſumed the term, <hi>fee ſimple</hi>—and the deeds to the northern purchaſers generally expreſs a convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the very words of the original deeds—but whether expreſſed or not, every purchaſer is entitled to the fee ſimple by virtue of the public declaration made to the world, that the lands were thus holden and conveyed. Whenever a ſeller conveys lands in fee ſimple, he pledges his profits, his payments and his own property on the veſting of this kind of eſtate in the grantee. If the fee ſimple fails and he has done this ignorantly, yet he muſt replace the buyer in as good a ſituation as the buyer would have been, had the fee ſimple veſted; but if he has uſed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion fraudulently to allure and deceive purchaſers, he muſt refund the money paid and reſpond in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.

               </head>
               <p>AN eſtate in fee ſimple, is the largeſt and nobleſt eſtate, that a man can have in real property. The proprietor of ſuch eſtate is inveſted with an abſolute power to improve and diſpoſe of his land as he pleaſes.<note n="*" place="bottom">Swift's Syſtem.</note> A fee is an eſtate of inheritance, being the higheſt intereſt, that a man can have in lands. When the word <hi>fee</hi> is uſed with the addition of the word <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> it denotes an unconditional, unlimited eſtate. The fee ſimple in lands being the largeſt poſſible eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, comprehends all inferior and leſſer eſtates, into which it may be divided.<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Black. 10.</note> This is the actual por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eſtate to which the northern purchaſers are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled.</p>
               <p>OF the quality and value of viſible eſtate the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may judge; but as the portion of eſtate which the ſeller has a right to convey, often depends on a long ſeries of papers in the poſſeſſion of the ſeller or on conſtruction of law, the uniform preſumption is that the ſeller knows the foundation of his title and his portion of eſtate; therefore every expreſſion uſed by the ſeller, expreſſing the kind of eſtate, is ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtrued and if he ſhould ſell the fee ſimple, when he owned but a leſſer eſtate, he muſt ſave harmleſs the buyer from all loſs, coſt and damage occaſioned by the failure of the fee ſimple. For this purpoſe the buyer has no need of covenants. His right of indemnity reſults from this principle of common equity, <q>That the ſeller ſhall cauſe the buyer to have that for which he received the money or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities of the buyer.</q>

                  <q>THE Spaniards, who made the firſt diſcovery of America, claimed a right to exclude all other nations from making eſtabliſhments in this vaſt extent of country: But other nations refuſed to admit this abſurd claim, in reſpect to ſuch parts as the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards had never even viſited. The Spaniards in 1521 diſcovered, and ſoon after made a ſettlement in Eaſt Florida. The French ſome time after this, ſettled in Canada and from thence having acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally found the great river Miſſiſippi, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing its courſe, they diſcovered Louiſiana, and in 1699 ſettled a colony at Mobile. The Engliſh, in 1607, made their firſt American ſettlement in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia—Theſe three powerful nations, having each got poſſeſſion of a part, diſputed about the extent of their ſeveral boundaries in theſe immenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, through which an almoſt infinite number of Indian tribes were diſperſed. Each claimed <hi>an excluſive right</hi> of purchaſing from the natives
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033425_0009_0FF7C43A8A7984C0"/>ſuch lands, as lay within the limits they choſe to ſet to themſelves; the ſovereignty of which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo claimed: and this right of excluding other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from purchaſing the Indian lands, within ſuch limits, is the foundation of <hi>the right of pre-emption.</hi> Theſe diſputes gave riſe to the war, that was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the treaty of Paris, between France, Spain, and Great-Britain; by which in fact the principle of the right of pre-emption is recognized, in as much as many Indian tribes were living within the limits of each, as then agreed on.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT ſeems that the Spaniards, who claim to have firſt diſcovered this country, had (as they termed it) an indiſputable right by the gift of Pope Alexander the 6th to the property and dominions of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents, iſlands and ſeas between the arctic and ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arctic poles, &amp;c.<note n="†" place="bottom">Chandler's com. debates, vol. II. page 52.</note> The French and Engliſh after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards got footing here, and theſe three powerful nations not agreeing, went to war, made a peace and then recogniſed each others rights. <hi>Their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reling created the right, their treaty confirmed it!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ON this foundation is laid the whole building of pre-emptive rights and on this is raiſed all the claim of the ſtate of Georgia to the fee-ſimple of the lands, deſcribed in the companies deeds.—The author of the State of Facts has traced the whole from this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igin and if his outſet were good, his concluſions in favor of the right of the ſtate would be plauſible at leaſt: But what are the facts?</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. THE Indians were the firſt diſcoverers of this country, and if firſt diſcovery and continued occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancy gives title according to the laws of nature and nations<note n="‡" place="bottom">The law of nature conſiſts in an application of the moral law to the condition of man. The law of nations is an adoption of the law of nature and an agreement in its application. This law, ſays Juſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian, is common to all the human race. This law guarantees to the firſt diſcoverer and occupant of any created thing an excluſive title; ſo that a forcible extermination of ſuch an one is a violence to this law. Camb. Elem.</note> they had acquired an unqueſtionable title.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033425_0010_0FF7C43D81D4CBB8"/>How many moons or centuries they had been here, when the Spaniards firſt diſcovered that they lived here, is to us wholly unknown. It is enough to the preſent purpoſe, that the Spaniards did not firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this country, and thoſe, who are very ſolicitous to decide which has the honor of <hi>diſcovering</hi> this country, Columbus or Veſpuſius or Don Juan, may more diſcerningly direct their hiſtorical reſearches to ſome tawny warrior of ſome far diſtant age.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. THE diſcovery of the Spaniards, that this country was inhabited by peaceful inoffenſive tribes, living on fiſhing and hunting, gave them no right to the ſoil, nor to the pre-emption of the ſoil; for the ſame law of nature which had given to the Indians the fee as firſt occupants, had alſo given them a right of ſelling it to whoever they pleaſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. THE gift of Pope Alexander, (being only an abridgment of his predeceſſor's proffer of all the kingdoms of the earth) partakes too much of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to be admitted as a ſerious ground of claim; yet this is as ſubſtantial, and certainly as ſanctified a claim as ever was made by any chriſtian nation to the pre-emption of Indian lands.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. THAT the French diſcovered the Indians and Spaniards in this country, and that the Engliſh found them all here, is no ſerious ground of claim againſt the Indians: for they are a party deeply intereſted in this tranſaction.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. THAT the Spaniſh, French and Engliſh could not agree in the ratio in which they might ſeverally defraud and diſpoſſeſs theſe firſt diſcoverers and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupants—and that they went to war about it—and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033425_0011_0FF7C40186DE8B80"/>that they got tired of fighting and made a treaty at Paris—and that they then agreed on this ratio, are rather arguments of the ravenous and inſatiable ſpirit of thoſe days, than of the right of either to the ſoil or pre-emption of this country.</p>
               <p n="6">6th. THAT the king of Great Britain after this treaty, granted and patented out this country to the minions of his court and officers of his army, is no argument that he owned the fee or right of pre-emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; even if conqueſt had given him title to any part, that could not extend to parts not conquered: therefore his patenting from ſea to ſea is rather to be conſidered as the vapouring of power, than as an evidence of right. But this may be otherwiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for;—the ignorance of the geography of this country, at that diſtant period, and even within the preſent century was great.—A man leſs ſubject than I am to a reverence for royalty and thrones would be apt to conceive that the kings of thoſe days conſidered this continent as ſpread from north to ſouth, like a piece of cloth upon a ſhop board, which they as arch taylors, were to cut into patterns according to the fancy of their employers: indeed a map of this country, exhibits ſuch ſlaſhing, as ſhows its having been, at ſome time or other, roughly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by the head ſervants of his Majeſty's Lords of the bed-chamber.</p>
               <p n="7">7th. FROM the farcical parade of Britiſh charters we come to the declaration of independence, at which time the author of the ſtate of facts contends, <q>that the limits of the thirteen Britiſh colonies, as fixed by the king's charters or letters patent, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as the bounds of the juriſdiction of each, without regard to the tribes of Indians living within ſuch limits.</q> This is a new way of ſliding up a title. Pray were the Indians a party to this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and confederation? Did they agree to be
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033425_0012_0FF7C43FA4BE8A38"/>ſubject to ſuch juriſdictions? Are they to ſuffer the loſs of all things to pay for the introduction of white people among them? Or are they laboring under ſome hidden curſe, which the policy of the wiſeacres of this world is forever to conceal? They have been ſuffering and retreating, till one would think that even power and avarice would ſay, it is enough. If there ever was reaſon for ſwarms to riſe from older countries and to ſettle in this, they have already more than room enough for their hives: but be that as it may, the Indians now live in the country, deſcribed in the companies deeds. Their progenitors lived there long before the days of Columbus. They have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied and improved it—they have never abandoned it, nor been driven from it, and by the United States are recogniſed in treaties. The northern people have been accuſtomed to purchaſe land of Indians willing to ſell, and the purchaſers have regarded the Indians as <hi>lords of the ſoil, till deeds were obtained from them:</hi> So ſay the deeds in the records of the ancient colony of New-Haven: There the Indians conveyed <hi>the lands</hi> not their right of hunting and fiſhing on them—but can any one contemplate the lands in queſtion and ſay that the ſtate of Georgia owned the fee, ſo that Gov. Matthews could with propriety convey the lands in fee ſimple? For ſuch is the expreſſion in the deeds, <hi>In fee ſimple as tenants in common and not as joint-tenants.</hi> There is no ſuch thing. The ſtate of Georgia do not now pretend to the fee: The above words were inſerted for the purpoſe of deluſion. Congreſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow the idea of ſtates claiming the fee of Indian lands. If the term could ever have been tolerably applied to any part of the Indian country at any period, ſince the ſettlement of this country; yet certainly the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it to lands ſituated as theſe are, is wholly abſurd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:033425_0013_0FF7C4412D8726C0"/>
By the laws of nature and nations, and by the laws of the United States the Indians have a right in fee and poſſeſſion to all the lands, deſcribed in the companies deeds, and to all the attributes of this right as fully and abſolutely as the people of Connecticut can have to their lands, and no act of diſcovery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, or occupancy, has ever veſted any white na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with any ſemblance of title to theſe lands. No act of dereliction or diſuſe on the part of the Indians has ever left a moments opening to any poſſible claim of this kind—hence <hi>the repeated declarations of the ſtate of Georgia—their negociations with Congreſs—the nature of ſovereignty—the implications of the Con. of the U. S.—the extent of boundaries claimed by the ſtate, and the treaty of peace;</hi> ſo much inſiſted on by the author of the ſtate of facts amount to nothing, becauſe they are built on nothing. Tis not enough that three powerful nations recogniſed each others right to the fee or pre-emption of Indian lands. Such a right muſt firſt have exiſted; elſe a recognition was abſurd. That it did not exiſt has been ſhewn as clearly as a negative propoſition can be ſhewn, and a plauſible affirmative on the origin of this right has never been uſhered into our world. The long continued, actual and peaceable poſſeſſion of the firſt diſcoverers is an inſtant and ample confutation of all that can be ſaid in favor of the right of the ſtate of Georgia to ſell the fee of theſe lands.</p>
               <p>I HAVE dwelt thus fully on this ſubject, becauſe the ſtate of Georgia in the granting act expreſſed a conveyance of the fee-ſimple—becauſe the grantees in their deeds to the northern purchaſers expreſſed a conveyance of the fee; becauſe the State of Facts publiſhed by the companies declares (page 12) the right of the companies to have been a <hi>right abſolute</hi> in the ſoil—and becauſe under the influence of theſe deluſions the advocates for the granting act are attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:033425_0014_0FF7C406CF1D4340"/>to confound this ſubject by applying to it all the mazy principles, which in foreign countries have been drawn from feodal ſyſtems and landed tenures.</p>
               <p>FROM the premiſes may be drawn the following concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. THE Georgia ſellers, in ſelling the fee of thoſe lands, ſold that which they did not own—the granting act was no good evidence of a title to ſell the fee—nothing has paſſed by their deeds and the conſideration of the bargains has wholly failed. I ſay <hi>wholly,</hi> becauſe from my premiſes the right of pre-emption, if it exiſted, would be as worthleſs as the claim to the fee is unfounded; but ſuppoſe that the right of pre-emption were of ſome value; yet the ſeller is not obliged to admit it even as a partial conſideration: For if a man declares to the world by an advertiſement or verbally, that he owns the fee of a houſe and land and offers them for ſale and I buy them of him, and it afterwards appears that he had only a leaſe of them, I am not obliged to open an account current with him—charging him the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe money and crediting him with the value of the leaſe; <hi>but the whole bargain is vacated, becauſe the fee, which was the eſſence of it, did not exiſt.</hi> This is good law, whether accredited by the books or not. The above caſe would be more parallel, if the leaſe were to expire the next hour after the execution of the deed; for then the value of the leaſe would be juſt paramount to the value of a right of pre-emption to the Indian lands in the preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>THE ready anſwer to this has been, You muſt have known the facts about this buſineſs, when you bought. My reply is, then we muſt have known that thoſe, who circulated theſe pamphlets and who declared to us that they owned the fee, were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors at the time of our purchaſe, which is hardly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſable. But if any one ſuppoſe it, he may be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we did not <hi>know it 'till afterwards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:033425_0015_0FF7C442B94C03B8"/>
2d. IF the fee of the lands was pretended to be conveyed; yet if in fact the fee did not paſs—clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the books on landed tenures muſt be cloſed; their principles cannot apply for reaſons before ſtated. The purchaſers are not to be driven to all circuities and formalities neceſſary for a recovery on an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded ſale of the fee, becauſe the ſellers uſed the term <hi>fee.</hi> On a conveyance of lands which do not exiſt, or of lands inacceſſible, the purchaſer need not be outed and diſſeiſed; before he can recover againſt the ſeller.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="proposition">
               <head>FOURTH PROPOSITION. <hi>All which the deeds of the northern purchaſers can poſſibly contain is the Georgia right of pre-emption.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THIS right is of ſuch deſcription, that a reſcind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act is completely fatal to it. But before we come to this act, it may not be amiſs to conſider the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous circumſtances, which render this pre-emptive right of the leaſt poſſible value.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. THE pretence of this right is a ſtanding act of rebellion againſt the law of nature, which gives lands to the firſt occupants: It is contrary to the avowed principles of our ſettlement in this country—a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant violence done to the Indians, by depriving them of an inherent right of ſelling to the higheſt bidder—and a wanton graſping for territory beyond the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of this, and probably of any future, century.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. A PRETENCE of this pre-emption, though holding its right foot on the Britiſh charters, and its left on the treaty of peace is a direct violation of the laws of nature and nations, eſpecially while ſuſtained againſt the conſent of the natives and the ſovereign will of the union. The iſſue of the queſtion, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er theſe lands are or are not, within the territory of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033425_0016_0FF7C4450EB4ADD0"/>Georgia is yet doubtful; but the exiſtence of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and the meaſures of Congreſs on this ſubject, ſhew that the concluſions in the State of Facts, drawn from the acquieſcence of Congreſs, are not correct; and that the Georgia right of pre-emption is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſed by the ſupreme power of the union. We are not to believe that Congreſs are raiſing this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the purpoſe of ſecuring to the United States a right of pre-emption; but for the better purpoſe of ſubſtantially guaranting to the Indians, that indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for wrongs and that protection from future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, which they ſo eminently deſerve from us as a nation. To calculate otherwiſe would be impeaching the juſtice of the union.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. THE numbers, characters and ſituation of the Indian nations, who poſſeſs and cultivate theſe lands, form a phalanx of arguments againſt the value of a pre-emptive right, more formidable than the laws of nature or nations—arguments wholly unaſſailable by force or fraud, and far removed beyond the power of confutation.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. THIS pre-emptive claim, unſupported by the laws of nature and nations, diſputed by the United States, unheeded by the Indians, ſtands ſolely on the declaration of the ſtate of Georgia—on the ſimple aſſertion of the only party intereſted to make it—and ſtanding thus alone was never of any value and prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably will never be of any value to the end of time.</p>
               <p>PRE-EMPTIVE rights in their beſt eſtate are miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but this ſtanding on a grant reſcinded and burnt—on a title no better at beſt, than the gift of Pope Alexander—contemplating lands never to be in market, is miſerable in the extreme: but this vain and illuſive right of pre-emption, <hi>becauſe like Pindar's razors, good for market,</hi> became an object of purchaſe. The granting act gave them a ſort of ſignificance— the parchments with the Governor's name, the ſeal
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033425_0017_0FF7C40C1D5FED90"/>of the ſtate and the words <hi>fee ſimple,</hi> all ſanctioned by the uſual formalities of ſovereign legiſlation, aided by a <hi>State of Facts,</hi> bore a very impoſing appearance.</p>
               <p>PREVIOUS to the granting act ſeveral years had elapſed, in which theſe lands had not increaſed in value or demand; but now, by the magic alchymy of ſpeculation, this ſhadowy, ambiguous right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption was commuted to a <hi>fee ſimple,</hi> and though bought at a fair price in January, had, by the Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber following riſen in market more than 400 per cent, and how high theſe productive acres would have riſen is beyond calculation, if the reſcinding act had not reſtored them to their original ſtandard. By reaſon of this act the lands have ceaſed to be of value and the eyes of the northern purchaſers have been opened to ſee the miſerable foundation of the Georgia fee and pre-emption. This mighty fabric of ſpeculation was built for tumbling and was deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to cruſh in its fall the builders or the owners. Doubtleſs the Georgians eſtimate their right as of ſome value; the glare of this ſpeculation has dazzled them—doubtleſs the purchaſers, who have paid the whole of their money, wiſh to believe better things about this Georgia right. They will not be perſuaded that fee and pre-emption can ſo ſuddenly ſink out of ſight. Will the ſame men be ſurpriſed to hear that even a palace with its magnificent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nices and entabletures has tumbled ſuddenly to ruins, after being informed that its real foundation was nothing more than <hi>painted bonnet-paper</hi> and that till the time of tumbling, it had been ſuſtained by weak temporary props?</p>
               <p>FROM the premiſes which have been preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is fair to conclude that the ſtate of Georgia did pretend to ſell the <hi>fee</hi>—that the ſtate never own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:033425_0018_0FF7C448677F2138"/>the <hi>fee</hi>—that the <hi>fee</hi> never veſted in the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies—that the northern purchaſers have never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the <hi>fee</hi> and therefore that the whole conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the bargains has failed.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="proposition">
               <p>FIFTH PROPOSITION. <hi>The fee and a right to buy the fee are widely different, and the Georgia claim to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption is peculiarly worthleſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A RIGHT to buy a fee is no part of a fee. A right of pre-emption is a meer contingent right, <hi>equally</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to real and perſonal eſtates. It is a kind of thing, about which a covenant of ſeiſin would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; a thing to which no ouſter can be applied. It may be of ſome value or of no value, according to the object of it—as in the preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>IF the king of Great-Britain had a clear right to charter to the ſtate of Georgia, an excluſive right to buy the lands in queſtion—and had actually done it —and the lands were clearly within the bounds of that charter—and the right of pre-emption was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſted—and the Indians were actually diſpoſed to ſell them for leſs than their value—and the ſtate of Georgia had fairly aſſigned over this right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption—and if there were power enough to prevent their reſcinding the aſſignment—and if no principle of law or policy could annul the aſſignment of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptive rights to individuals; then a conveyance from the aſſignees would be of ſome value: That is, of juſt as much value as the Indians were willing to ſell them, below what they could be ſold for again: Which is juſt the amount of what the Indians would ſuffer, by being confined to one ſet of purchaſers, inſtead of having all the world as bidders.</p>
               <p>BUT what a confluence of contingencies is here? Without every one of which the right of pre-emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033425_0019_0FF7C44A06586F78"/>is not worth having; and yet not one of them exiſts in the preſent caſe. Great-Britain had no right to charter the right of purchaſe—the bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the ſtate and the right of pre-emption in the premiſes are conteſted—the Indians have no diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſell at any price—the ſtate has never fairly aſſigned the right—they have reſcinded their fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aſſignment without a poſſibility of control, and both law and policy annul the aſſignment.</p>
               <p>ALL theſe propoſitions, except the laſt, are ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe numbers; and of the laſt, it is ſufficient to obſerve, that if the law of nature and the policy of nations can have ſubjected the Indians to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption of a ſingle ſtate; yet that law and policy muſt have contemplated ſtates as acting on juſt and liberal principles: But how exceſſive is the oppreſſion —when a ſtate may barter this right to individuals, and when theſe may transfer it through a great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of companies, each of which muſt, in giving an enhanced price for pre-emption, calculate on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing the fee for as much <hi>leſs</hi> than the ſtate could have given for it, as the price which they gave was <hi>more</hi> than the ſtates' price to the purchaſers! No one can fail to ſee that every progreſſion of ſales in ſuch a buſineſs is an injury to the Indians to the whole amount of the profits in each ſale. The event is that the laſt purchaſer has given ſo much, that he can afford very little for the Indian right—the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians cannot afford to ſell it at ſuch a reduced price —a war enſues, and this perſecuted people muſt be driven nearer the ſouthern ocean or the pole. Such has been too much the policy of the white people; and ſo far as the northern alienations of pre-emption have involved or induced this wrong, ſo far they have violated the laws of nature and the policy of nations.</p>
               <p>THE author of the State of Facts on this ſubject ſays, (page 12) <q>It is exclaimed, what miſchiefs
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:033425_0020_0FF7C44BAD1CEF58"/>would enſue, if individuals were allowed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Indian rights! But it is no good objection to the validity of a title to property, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor may uſe it in ſuch manner, as to become inconvenient to the public.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I AM of thoſe who adopt the exclamation and mean to include in it all which is above expreſſed —founding myſelf on an inconteſtible maxim that a law tending directly to immorality and injuſtice is void from the beginning.

               <head>SIXTH PROPOSITION. <hi>Suppoſe the ſtate of Georgia had owned the fee of the lands; yet the granting act and the companies deeds are void on principles of common law.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BY reaſon of the variety of intereſts and opinions on this ſubject many will differ from me in ſome of my premiſes and concluſions reſpecting the fee and pre-emption of theſe lands, I am therefore diſpoſed to try the ſtrength of this queſtion without the aid of them. Be it that the laws of nature and nations were made for white people, and that the Indian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions inhabiting and claiming theſe lands are to have no protection from the United States. Yet the northern purchaſers have acquired nothing by their deeds. All the money paid, the notes given and the expence and labor created have been without any conſideration; for the deeds of Governor Matthews to the companies and the granting act authorizing them are abſolutely void on a fair principle of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law. Which is, that <q>no man or body of men, not being in poſſeſſion ſhall ſell lands to another or others not in poſſeſſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS law has in ſeveral of the ſtates been erected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtatute, for the purpoſe of making it known, and of defining the penalty—it is founded on ſubſtantial reaſon and calculated to prevent diſputes, quarrels and bloodſhed. The original deeds of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies preſent to the world a higher violation of this common law, than any which has been recorded. The deeds purport to be a conveyance of the fee ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of certain tracts of land, including iſlands, &amp;c. deſcribing the very lands, owned, occupied and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed immemorially by the Indian nations, and lands, whereon the Indians were claiming at the very time when theſe deeds were ſigned, and this within the knowledge of the grantors. The author of the State of Facts, whoſe perception of difficulties appears very
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:033425_0022_0FF7C44E1232EB98"/>accurate, endeavours to obviate this by erecting two ſovereign rights on the ſame land. 1ſt. A fee ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the ſtate of Georgia or as he terms it "a right in the ſoil ſimple and abſolute in its nature." 2d. The Indians right of fiſhing and hunting, which he ſays, "is a right in the nation, as long as it continues to exiſt as a nation. It is an abſolute right, of which it cannot be deprived, without its own conſent in a fair purchaſe, by a voluntary abandonment, or by conqueſt."</p>
               <p>This Indian right is unqueſtionably a ſole right of poſſeſſion, to the excluſion of all others, and has been ſo uniformly underſtood, ever ſince the ſettlement of this country. The author calls this Indian right <hi>an uſufruct</hi> and ſays that "by long uſage and general principles of law it is no leſs alienable than any other contingent or reverſionary intereſt in lands whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever." <hi>This is good ſliding again:</hi> but where is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle inſtance, in this long uſage, of a ſtate ſelling the Indian lands in fee ſimple? Where is one general principle of law to juſtify ſuch an uſage? How come the words <hi>contingent</hi> and <hi>reverſionary</hi> to be applied to lands ſold in fee ſimple? The Indians know nothing about theſe nice diſtinctions, of right abſolute in one and right perpetual in another, that is, a fee ſimple in Georgia, which comprehends and abſorbs all leſſer eſtates, and at the ſame time an uſufruct in them, which completely abſorbs and annihilates this fee.</p>
               <p>THESE paradoxical niceties are excluſively veſted in the Georgia companies, and the uſufruct of them belongs to the author of the State of Facts.</p>
               <p>BY the conceſſion of this author the Indians own this perpetual right of uſufruct ſo abſolutely that they cannot be deprived of it, without their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in a fair purchaſe, by a voluntary abandonment or by conqueſt: Yet according to him the ſtate of Georgia owns the fee-ſimple.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:033425_0023_0FF7C45032D77CD8"/>
WE have now diſcovered what this fee-ſimple is. Inſtead of being like what the books call fee-ſimple, the <hi>greateſt</hi> poſſible eſtate in lands—comprehending all leſſer eſtates, it is the <hi>leaſt</hi> poſſible eſtate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends nothing. Inſtead of being, as other fee-ſimples are, coeval with the creation of this earth, and always veſting in ſome one, it dates its exiſtence from the date of the Georgia deeds, and never veſted in any one, till the delivery of them.</p>
               <p>THE companies deeds are made in defiance of the common law, at the very point, where the law mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals all its force: For the natural tendency of them is to produce, in a moſt aggravated degree, the very evils, the prevention of which gave exiſtence to that law.</p>
               <p>THE manner in which diſputes, quarrels and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed would naturally enſue from theſe deeds has been detailed in the laſt chapter.</p>
               <p>HAD the Indians been conquered, and were in a ſtate of rebellion againſt the ſtate of Georgia.—Had the ſtate ever poſſeſſed theſe lands, far otherwiſe might be the merits of this queſtion—but the Indians are on the lands, claiming, cultivating and acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edging no ſuperior. Not only this: But by the very conceſſion of the companies they are <hi>rightfully</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing and enjoying every privilege of a fee except the name; and the ſelling of the name is of no uſe; except the eventual intention of that ſale be, to give the purchaſers a colour of right to defraud, diſpute, quarrel with or murder the injured poſſeſſors.</p>
               <p>THE ſubject analized—ſtript of its covering, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents no other explanation: For the firſt companies cannot afford to give the Indians ſo much for their right, as the ſtate could have given: Here is the foundation of fraud laid:—the firſt grantees can afford ſtill leſs: The ſales will be continued as long as any gain can be made: The fraud becomes magnified.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:033425_0024_0FF7C41678890D90"/>Now if the Indians cannot be cheated, diſputes and quarrels will be the conſequence and <hi>murder</hi> will (as it ever has done, with thoſe injured tribes) bring up the rear. Tis enough to my preſent purpoſe, that the ſtate not being in poſſeſſion, has ſold to compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not in poſſeſſion, and this in direct violation of an acknowledged principle of common law. The ſtatutes, which in this caſe are but a tranſcript of the common law declare all conveyances of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>null and void,</hi> which terms may moſt warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be applied to the granting act and the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies deeds.</p>
               <p>SHALL it be ſaid that common law principles are not to regulate and control legiſlative acts of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign ſtates? I am ready to agree to the poſition, provided it may be conſidered as an agreed point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us—and it ſeems hardly competent that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law principles ſhould be applied to legiſlative acts, where there is no common law power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the application: But this ſalvo will not help the companies; for they, knowing themſelves not to be in poſſeſſion, and purchaſing of others who had no claim to poſſeſſion, have, by their own violation of the ſame common law, made null and void their own title.—They can claim no exemption from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law, unleſs they ſhould claim that the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the ſtate, (backed by long uſage, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the State of Facts,) can ſanctify a wrong of the moſt atrocious magnitude. Be it however, for their ſakes, that the ſtate can do this; yet their deeds to the northern purchaſers are null and void, for here both parties are ſubject to this law.</p>
               <p>HE who ſeeks equity muſt have done equity. He who ſeeks law muſt have done legally: But in this caſe they, who are claiming all the aid of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law for the recovery of their notes, have, by their own ſhewing, been guilty of ſuch a groſs vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:033425_0025_0FF7C4525AAA4B40"/>of this common law, that the very men whom they are purſuing, have, <hi>by reaſon of this very violation,</hi> loſt all title to the lands for which the notes were given.</p>
               <p>IF ever a trial about the title to this naked viſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary fee could be brought up, the objection here raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, againſt the validity of the granting act and the companies deeds, would be concluſive againſt the northern purchaſers; unleſs the court trying the queſtion, ſhould deviate from thoſe deciſions, which, I am told, have invariably prevailed on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed by a new compaſs to diſcover the fallacy of the companies pretenſions.</p>

               <p>JUDGE Blackſtone in his Com. Vol. II. Page 7, ſays, <q>So long as (colonizing) was confined to the ſtocking and cultivation of deſert uninhabited countries, it kept ſtrictly within the limits of the law of nature: But how far the ſeizing on coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries already peopled and driving out or maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring the innocent and defenceleſs natives, merely becauſe they differed from their invaders in language, religion, cuſtoms, government or colour; how far ſuch a conduct was conſonant to nature, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or chriſtianity, deſerved well to be conſidered by thoſe, who have rendered their names immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal by thus civilizing mankind.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is well known that the firſt ſettlers of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try owe no thanks to the principles accredited by this eminent writer. Whatever might have been their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for emigration; yet nature, reaſon and religion
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:033425_0026_0FF7C454047DA498"/>will put in no claim to ſerve as a baſis to our landed tenures.</p>
               <p>IN Trumbull's Hiſtory of Connecticut may be found claims of title, liveries of ſeizin, and modes of ejectment, unknown to the civil or canon law.</p>
               <p>IT is ſaid that our fore-fathers were perſecuted for their religion and forced from their native land into this, then howling wilderneſs. If hiſtory diſcovers that their tribulation had worked patience; if their conduct evinced their abhorrence of perſecution— and if the wilderneſs ceaſed to howl at their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, we ought to bleſs the event,—It is ſaid that the old world was overſtocked, and that the natives of this had more land than they wanted. If hiſtory informs that our anceſtors took their brethren of this new world by the hand and offered to give them, in exchange for the luxuries of this weſtern hemiſphere, the newly imported virtues and ſcience of the eaſt, we ought to bleſs the event. If He, whoſe is the earth, had decreed that our fore-fathers ſhould have and enjoy this portion of it—and in token of this decree had put them in poſſeſſion, we ought to cleave to this high evidence of title, and not to claim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it. <q>Pleaſed with the poſſeſſion, we ſeem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to look back to the means, by which it was acquired, as if fearful of ſome defect in our title; or at beſt we reſt ſatisfied with the deciſion of the laws in our favor, without examining the reaſon or authority upon which thoſe laws have been built.<note n="*" place="bottom">Black.

                  </q> But this ſtage of my ſubject forbids ſuch delicacy—as we actually live here and our claim is not conteſted—we muſt ſeek ſome origin of it—and that being found, we ſhall be enabled to judge, whether it ſuſtains the claim of Georgia, to the fee or pre-emption of the lands in queſtion.</p>

THE laws of nature and the ſubjects of occupan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, dereliction and diſuſe have been diſcuſſed ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to convince, that on neither of theſe is our claim to this country ſupported. No principle found in books or avowed by man ſuſtains this claim. No legal trial in this country has ever tried the ſtrength of our title or decided its operations. From new premiſes muſt be new deductions, and he who endeavours to confound titles ſuſtained by the law of nature, ſanctioned by the books, confirmed by firſt occupancy and actual poſſeſſion—with titles ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no ſuch origin, aims to pervert mankind—and turning books and principles from their natural to an unnatural uſe—proſtitutes them to the baſe purpoſes of ſeduction, impoſture and deluſion.</p>
               <p>"MIGHT OVERCOMES RIGHT" ſtands as the baſis of this new ſyſtem of landed te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, as will appear by the following hiſtorical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the diſcovery of America. <q>The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like animals on which the Spaniſh officers were mounted; the artificial thunders which iſſued from their hands; the wooden caſtles, which had waft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them over the ocean, ſtruck a panic into the natives, from which they did not recover, until it was too late. Wherever the Spaniards marched, they ſpared no age or ſex, nothing ſacred or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane. The Spaniards went out with their dogs to hunt after men. The unhappy ſavages almoſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and diſarmed, were purſued like deer into the thick of the foreſts, devoured by maſtiffs, killed with gun ſhot, or ſurpriſed and burnt in their hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itations.<note n="†" place="bottom">Guthrie's Diſcovery of America.</note>

               <p>THE poverty of the inhabitants of Bahama taught Columbus, that this was not the country, which he
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033425_0028_0FF7C41993F690B0"/>was ſeeking.—<q>But ſteering further ſouthward he found a country, abounding in all the neceſſaries of life, inhabited by a humane and hoſpitable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and what was of ſtill greater conſequence, promiſing conſiderable quantities of <hi>gold.</hi> This, therefore, he propoſed to make the centre of his diſcoveries.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT was not benevolence nor ſcience which moved Columbus to diſcover countries already diſcovered; to people regions already populated, or to moralize nations, more virtuous than his own: But <hi>auri ſacra fames,</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">The curſed thirſt of gold.</note> more powerful than Euroclydon, drove this impetuous hero upon theſe defenceleſs natives. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery new diſcovery of <hi>gold</hi> formed a new epoch in this hiſtory and added freſh laurels to Guthrie's immortal Columbus.</p>
               <p>THIS author exclaims, <q>It is impoſſible to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether the genius of this great man in firſt conceiving the idea of theſe diſcoveries, or his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity in the execution of the plan he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, moſt deſerve our admiration.</q> My admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is more ſuſpended between the baſe motives of the hero, and the unfounded panegyric of his biog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapher. He adds, <q>No one is now impoſed on by the name of Americus Veſpuſius; all the world knows that Columbus was the firſt diſcoverer.</q> I am one (of all the world) who know no ſuch thing. Becauſe this tranſaction is wholly novel, yet is lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to loſe its uſual ſignificance? Is the term, DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COVERY, ſo convertible that it can be applied with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing glory to new ſucceſſions of adventurers?</p>
               <p>AT the very time when this weight of glory devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on Columbus, the immenſe regions of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were populated by millions far exceeding the numbers now living on it. Myriads of rational, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent beings were ſcattered throughout every part,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:033425_0029_0FF7C430E3FA8A70"/>enjoying in innocence and ſimplicity the golden age of ſociety. According to the above author, <q>The empire of Mexico, at this time, rich, powerful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by millions of Indians, had ſubſiſted for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; its inhabitants were not rude and barbarous; but every thing announced a poliſhed and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent people.—Their government, founded on the ſure baſis of laws, combined with religion, ſeemed to bid defiance to time itſelf. Mexico, the capital of the empire, ſituated in the middle of a ſpacious lake, was the nobleſt monument of American in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. It communicated to the continent by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe cauſeways, carried through the lake. The city was admired for its buildings all of ſtone, its ſquares and market places, the ſhops, which glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with gold and ſilver, and the ſumptuous pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aces of Montezuma, ſome erected on columns of jaſper, and containing whatever was moſt rare, curious or uſeful.</q> 
                  <hi>This was the deſert uninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wild, deſtined for the diſcovery of that immortal brute Fernando Cortez, whoſe evidence of title was proclaimed by the groans of Guatimozin, while ſtretched on burning coals, to compel a diſcovery, where his treaſures were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANOTHER inhoſpitable wilderneſs tempted the patriotiſm of Pizarro. The Peruvian empire, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Mango Capac, had been united, civilized, ſoftened by the inſtitution of a benevolent religion. "In ſhort," ſays the above author, <q>there was no part of America, where agriculture and the arts were ſo aſſiduouſly cultivated, and where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were of ſo mild and ingenuous manners. He adds, Pizarro had no conception of dealing gently with thoſe, whom he called barbarians: But who, though leſs acquainted with the cruel art of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troying their fellow-creatures, were more civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed than himſelf.</q>

The natives of this country differed no more from us than we do from the Chineſe; they no more deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have their buildings burnt than we deſerve the ſame calamity. Of one blood are created all nations of men to dwell on the face of the earth: By the ſame laws of morality and of nature are they all bound; but manifeſtly on theſe laws our title can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand. I have introduced this diſcuſſion of the original diſcovery of this country to ſhew that in this inſtance MIGHT HAS OVERCOME RIGHT, and that we muſt reſort to a ſyſtem of landed tenures wholly unknown to the books.</p>
               <p>THE king of Great-Britain patented theſe lands; not becauſe he had any right to them;<note n="*" place="bottom">The Engliſh books declare the king to be univerſal occupant and entitled to all <hi>derelict</hi> lands: but the ſame books acknowledge this poſition to be a fiction of law. <hi>See Bacons abr. term. prerogative.</hi>
                     <p>On this fiction of law was founded the patent to the earl of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, of lands thoroughly populated and thus <hi>derelict principles</hi> were ſubſtituted in the place of <hi>derelict</hi> lands, and thus for two centuries the Indians have been ſuffering on account of the profound ignorance of this univerſal occupant and all his miniſters about this country, combined with an ignorance of the fair operation of their own FIC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS.</p>
                  </note>; but becauſe
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:033425_0033_0FF7C45C688375C0"/>he was more powerful than the inhabitants, about whoſe coaſt his ſervant Cabot had navigated.</p>
               <p>ON the idea of diſcovery, power or conqueſt, the charter of New-England, granted in 1620, could not contain much land, as but little was, at that time, conquered or diſcovered by the king's ſubjects. The ſame is true of that of Connecticut in 1631. Both are very indefinite as to the kind of right intended to be conveyed; but both manifeſtly expreſs the premiſes as extending from ſea to ſea; and by virtue of theſe and ſimilar charters the different ſtates have claimed a right of preference to purchaſe, incroach or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer within the limits of them ſeverally aſſigned.</p>
               <p>THE firſt ſpeculators in this buſineſs were the earl of Warwick and others to the number of 40, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called "The great Plymouth Company." Theſe ſold Maſſachuſetts to Sir Henry Roſwell and others—Connecticut to Viſcount Say and Seal and Co.—and thus the titles went from hand to hand, as the Georgia ſpeculation has done, <hi>neither party in poſſeſſion,</hi> and the natural conſequence was diſputes, quarrels and bloodſhed.</p>
               <p>As the principles of natural and common law are now out of the queſtion, all was well enough; there was ſubſtantial land at bottom; power enough to aſſert it; and an unlimited right to exerciſe this power was implied in the original charter; in this it differed much from the preſent ſpeculation. Hiſtory diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that what money and fair words could not effect, this power effected—and in the event we have got the lands, and in them a goodly heritage.</p>

THE divines, moraliſts and hiſtorians of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, confounded at the nothingneſs of theſe charters, and the cruelty which followed them, have endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to make up a title from a mixture of ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients.</p>
               <p>THE firſt of which is—<hi>The precedent of Moſes in driving out the heathen from the promiſed land;</hi> and under this head we are told of the barbarity and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age manners of the natives of this country. As the precedent was of divine authority, and the caſe in queſtion was not, they do not well compare.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. <hi>THAT our anceſtors were perſecuted and obliged to ſeek an aſylum here.</hi> Much pains have been taken to reſcue the characters of our perſecuted pious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors from the obloquy caſt on the firſt companies. Be it remembered that the tenure of lands, and peace of conſcience are things wholly diſtinct, and that this diſcuſſion has nothing to do with eccleſiaſtical bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and diſtances. If perſecution made an aſylum neceſſary: yet an aſylum from danger and a right to buy Indian lands, or to annoy, murder or expel quiet inhabitants are matters wholly different. If neceſſity be admitted as a fair argument; yet as that neceſſity extends not to the Georgia fee and pre-emption, its application to the preſent queſtion is wholly inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. <hi>THAT numerous treaties and purchaſes were made and Indian deeds obtained.</hi> This is the beſt evidence of title; but as theſe deeds expreſs a conveyance of <hi>lands,</hi> not of any remnant of right therein they ſhew concluſively, that thoſe, who made theſe purchaſes, did not rely on their charters. As there is no pretence that theſe Georgia lands have been bought or that any deed has been obtained, this evidence of title does not exiſt in the preſent caſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>BUT the northern ſtates have claimed a right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption, let us try the origin and application of this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE doctrine of pre-emptive right has always been underſtood with us as a mere right of a colony or ſtate to exclude other colonies or ſtates from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing lands within the limits of their charters, which underſtanding included in it a reſervation to themſelves to purchaſe whenever the natives were diſpoſed to ſell. In this was not included any idea of a right in fee veſting in a colony or ſtate, nor of any financial reſources reſulting from ſuch reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>THOUGH this reſervation followed the charter lines, it reſulted not from the charter, but from the neceſſity of the caſe.</p>
               <p>AFTER many years ſettlement in this country, it was found inexpedient to ſuffer individuals to be tampering with the natives for purchaſes of land; in conſequence of which laws were made to prevent it.</p>

               <p>THE ſame neceſſity led up a ſimilar arrangement between the colonies, and though it was an evil and a wrong to the natives; yet of two evils it was the leaſt, as a competition among the colonies, about pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes, might lead to quarrels and wars with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. At the union of the colonies, this reſervation was not thrown into common ſtock. By the treaty of peace a line between the Britiſh poſſeſſions and the United States was deſignated, which extending to the Miſſiſippi, left within our lines about 220 millions acres of territory, moſtly owned and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immemorially by the natives. In the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States, the reſervation of each was not relinquiſhed. But the reſervation thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was in no reſpect fortified.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER inventive ſpeculation had in the mean time ſuggeſted, that ſelling this reſervation to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies would obviate the evils contemplated by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering individuals to purchaſe. The idea of filling the public coffers by ſelling this indefineable ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing induced the ſale of the Cheneſſee country, and the lands ſouth of Lake Erie. By the deeds the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:033425_0037_0FF7C429E1CEE070"/>purchaſers were not inveſted with the FEE SIMPLE of the lands, nor with any attribute of real eſtate; but with a right of excluding others from purchaſing them, and of being purchaſers in their own perſons, whenever the policy of the United States and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the natives to ſell, ſhould coincide to bring them into market.</p>
               <p>IN theſe ſales the ſtates did not authorize the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers to claim any <hi>right</hi> againſt the natives, on the ground of <hi>neceſſity, religion, perſecution, treaty, purchaſe or conqueſt.</hi> All this new ſyſtem of landed tenures had wrought its perfect work. The ſtates merely withdrew themſelves from the chance ſuch as it was, and in the two firſt releaſes received leſs than a 30th part of what the lands in fee with a right of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would have been worth.</p>
               <p>IN the mean time the policy of the United States, tho' elevated above the idea of taking advantages of the Indians; yet not having power to compel ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this territory, had, by making treaties on the one hand, and on the other enacting laws, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troling the exerciſe of theſe reſervations, ſufficiently expreſſed its authority over pre-emptive rights.</p>
               <p>THIS policy was expreſſed by the law on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject paſſed March 1ſt, 1793.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>No purchaſe or grant of <hi>lands</hi> or of any title or claim thereto, from any Indians or nation or tribe of Indians within the bounds of the United States, ſhall be of any validity in law or equity, unleſs the ſame be made <hi>by</hi> a treaty or convention entered into <hi>purſuant to the conſtitution.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>WHEN ceſſions of territory have been made to the United States, the utmoſt exertions could never draw from the ſupreme legiſlature any conceſſion of the exiſtence of a pre-emptive right, or any guaranty of any part to be reſerved.<note n="*" place="bottom">See reſolutions of Congreſs when Connecticut ceſſion was made.</note>

WHAT confidence could be placed in the wiſdom, policy or good faith of a nation, which ſhould ſign treaties with one hand and with the other betray the tribes, with whom they were made? Or what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could be placed in a nation, which trampling on the laws of nature, and the ſacred doctrine of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual rights, ſhould give ſanction to charters, baſeleſs as thoſe of the ſtates, by aiding to extend their effects beyond the bounds, <hi>which even avarice and cruelty had formerly ſet to them?</hi> But this confidence remains; this policy has never been relaxed, except when the relaxation was perfectly in uniſon with the feelings and intereſts of the tribes concerned.</p>
               <p>As the purchaſers of the northern pre-emptions, have in fair market, with full conſent of all parties, bought the fee and poſſeſſion of the lands, and as no queſtion has ever been had on the merits of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it is impoſſible to draw any legal inference from our quit-claims to the Georgia conveyances.</p>
               <p>As the northern ſtates never claimed nor alienated the fee ſimple—as they alienated no right to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe—as the congreſſional power to hold a treaty alone gave the right to purchaſe, and as actual pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe northern quit-claims on this ſubject amounted to no more than a declaration on the part of the ſtates that they would never attempt to exerciſe a claim, which from my premiſes, appears to have had no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even in the <hi>baſe</hi> principles of their charters, and which exerciſe had before been controled by the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States.</p>
               <p>THESE ſtates did not pretend to any fraud and colluſion practiſed on them, and therefore did not reſcind their quit-claims: had they done this, the conſequence might have furniſhed a precedent in the preſent caſe.</p>

As the event has proved, their renunciations of claim have not been prejudicial to the intereſt nor oppoſed to the policy of the union; therefore the evils, fairly calculable, as the iſſue of abſolute claims on indian land have not occurred. But in the caſe of the Georgia ſales, no ſuch event can have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE—Whether we canvaſs the diſcovery of this country—the charters of the colonies, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their new ſyſtem of landed tenures—the practice of the northern ſtates upon this ſyſtem—or the policy of the union; every view of the ſubject preſents a more hideous conception of the daring ſwindling practiſed on the world by the Georgia granting act, and the companies deeds <hi>purporting to be conveyances of the fee-ſimple of the Indian lands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS view of our ſubject, while it excludes forev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the idea of a fee-ſimple, veſting in the ſtate of Georgia, preſents abundant reaſons why the northern people were deluded by this ſpeculation—and while it diſcloſes a new ſyſtem of landed tenures—excludes all the book principles on landed tenures—and all deciſions upon thoſe principles from any application to the preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>As the inſertion of the word FEE-SIMPLE in the companies deeds led up the whole impoſture, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that inſertion as a ſupreme inſtance of fraud, colluſion and atrocious ſpeculation, engendered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween corrupt members of a legiſlature and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purchaſers, <hi>for the expreſs purpoſe of ſwindling.</hi>

               <p>HAD the companies deeds expreſſed a conveyance of <hi>the mere right of pre-emption,</hi> the northern ſales could never have been effected. Men, alive, awake, capable of calculation as the northern people are,

               <p>THIS reſcinding act, whether regarded in a legal, equitable or moral point of view does the higheſt credit to the legiſlature which paſſed it. If it depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the northern purchaſers of momentary hopes of wealth without labor, it probably ſaved thouſands from impoſition. If it nipt in the bud a number of aſpiring ſwindlers, it exhibited to the world an act of ſovereign juſtice, which thoroughly canvaſſed, will be found to ſtand on an immoveable baſis.</p>

               <head>SECOND PROPOSITION. <hi>This reſcinding act is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely fatal to all claims on the part of the companies and the northern purchaſers.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>To try the ſtrength and equity of this act, let us firſt conſider what was in fact conveyed by the granting act and the companies deeds.</p>
               <p>NOTHING more can veſt or paſs by any convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, than what the grantor owned or had a right to convey; therefore the <hi>fee-ſimple,</hi> though expreſſed in the deeds, did not paſs; becauſe the ſtate did not
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:033425_0053_0FF74CCD26AB3B20"/>own it. The right of poſſeſſion, uſe or dominion could not paſs; becauſe the ſtate had not even a claim to it. An aſſignment of any right under the Britiſh charters could not paſs; for the lands deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed had never been altered nor affected ſince the creation of the world. No pretence under the old or new ſyſtem of landed tenures, could reach theſe lands. It could not convey a right to buy the land; for this could only be given by the United States. It could not be a right to conquer the Indians; for this either in a ſtate or an individual would have been treaſon againſt the union.</p>
               <p>THE whole extract and eſſence of the granting act and the companies deeds was a ſimple, unreſponſible declaration of the repreſentatives of the ſovereign people of Georgia, that the people after the date thereof would have no claim upon certain lands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their aſſumed limits.</p>
               <p>THIS declaration, which ought long before to have been made to the United States was made to the companies for the price of half a million dollars, and inſtead of being couched in the narrow compaſs of a due-bill, was promulgated to the world with great legiſlative formality as a bona fide conveyance of the fee-ſimple of lands within their territory.</p>
               <p>THE progreſs of this buſineſs from its riſing to its zenith and thence its falling to its original nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have been ſufficiently traced. But the people of Georgia, indignant at the granting act, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinded this declaration, and ſuch are the real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the granting act that this reſcinding is fatal to the companies.</p>
               <p>CONSIDERING the reſcinding act in this point of view, what is the condition of the northern purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers? They claim a right to purchaſe the lands, merely becauſe the repreſentatives of the ſtate of Georgia declared that after the 7th of Jan. 1795,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:033425_0054_0FF74CD433C68440"/>the ſtate would not claim ſuch a right; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in Feb. 1796, the people declared that they would claim ſuch a right, and further declared that the companies, to whom this firſt declaration was made, might take their money again: but for you, who had been defrauded by theſe companies, they made no proviſion, and you have no means to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the ſtate to withdraw their claim.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe the beſt poſſible caſe for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers, viz. that the ſtate of Georgia owned the fee: yet theſe men, who are purſuing you for money, have it completely in their power to receive back the money from the treaſury—to give up their deeds, and to ratify and confirm the act beyond all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy: for the contract was only between the ſtate and the companies—you are no parties to it. This can be done now, or at any time hereafter. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinding act has left your claim wholly in the power of your tormentors, and has given them the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of half a million dollars to exerciſe this power, and their paſt conduct has left you no room to doubt their diſpoſition to do it.</p>
               <p>SHEWING you this in the caſe of a fee, you will apprehend on what a ſlender thread your title is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, provided the granting act ſhould happen to include any eſtate leſs than a fee.</p>
               <p>'TIS true you are told by the books, that <hi>a fee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways veſts in ſome one,</hi> and from thence may infer, that in the caſe propoſed the fee would have been veſted in you, ſo that no agreement between the ſtate and the companies could be concluſive: but unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately the ſame law, which gives you this momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comfort, tells you <hi>that no fee can veſt, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party is in poſſeſſion;</hi> provided, <hi>that any is in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion claiming and holding all others out,</hi> which was true in the preſent caſe. And unfortunately the laſt clauſe of this law applies to every kind of right
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:033425_0055_0FF74A605FE93468"/>or claim in real eſtate, and when you leave real eſtate the law leaves you; ſo that however you might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your claim, it would be completely voidable by the act of the parties who made the contract.</p>
               <p>THUS, ſeparate from the ſtrength and operation of the reſcinding act in itſelf, and from all your feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and reaſonings about it, your claim is left whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the mercy of the companies, and this becauſe you have not the actual fee ſimple, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſell you.</p>
               <p>THIS conſideration, added to the <hi>worthleſſneſs</hi> of your claim, preſents, in a ſtrong point of view, the vanity of all reliance on your purchaſes.</p>
               <p>BEYOND this, by deſtroying the records of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal deeds, and cloſing the records againſt after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances, the reſcinding act has put it in the power of any perſon, intermediately claiming the lands, to break a link in the chain of title, on which you may rely; this he may do by burning his deed or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying to another and dating his deed anterior to yours. As you have no record, nor act of poſſeſſion to evidence your title, and as the proof of ſuch fraud would doubtleſs be out of your power, you ſee how eaſily your proſpects might be cut off; and this merely by the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of the reſcinding act, without any reference to its merits.</p>
               <p>BUT the actual ſtrength and operation of this act is further diſcovered, <hi>in its having actually deſtroyed the marketable quality of the lands.</hi> This ſhews that the body of mankind, whatever they may think of its equity, really conſiders it fatal to your claim; for if they judged the reſcinding act to be of no conſequence, your lands would be of as much value as ever.</p>
               <p>BUT the ſtrength of this act is further diſcovered in its having withſtood all the elements combined to defeat it, triumphant over all the paſſions, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate men diſappointed in proſpect of wealth, and
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:033425_0056_0FF74A68F2BEF780"/>equally above the fine ſpun ſophiſms of dealers in <hi>remnants</hi> of law. As the cauſes of its exiſtence and object of it formed a combination wholly new, ſo the act is itſelf without a precedent, and ſtanding thus alone, is firmly ſupported by the voice of the people, by the inherent ſovereignty of the ſtate, and by a train of argument, well calculated to enforce its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and validity upon every unprejudiced mind.</p>
               <p>THE very effects of the reſcinding act, prove that the contents of the granting were weak; they alſo prove that the reſcinding act poſſeſſes ſtamina of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence ſtronger and more durable than its enemies have been willing to allow it. This act contains in itſelf forcible reaſons why it was made; it does not deſcend to all the reaſons which might have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered —nor to any formal confutation of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt it; but as theſe arguments have been aſſiduouſly and in ſome inſtances ſucceſsfully uſed at the northward, it may be proper to try the ſtrength of them.</p>
               <p>THE firſt is, <hi>This reſcinding act is wholly unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented and unſupported by authorities, therefore good for nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ACCEDE to the premiſes; but deny the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.—It is true that the Britiſh king did not reſcind his patent to the earl of Warwick. Maſſachuſetts did not reſcind their grant of the Geneſſee country, nor Connecticut theirs of the Reſerve. But ſuppoſe that either or all theſe ſovereign powers had reſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their grants, before the lands were obtained by the grantees, what remedy would the grantees have had? As there is no precedent of the caſe, there can be no precedent of a remedy, and thoſe who uſe this argument, have never proceeded ſo far as to ſuggeſt even a plauſible remedy in the preſent caſe. But it
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:033425_0057_0FF74A70CCD362E0"/>ſo happens, there is no precedent of the fraud, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, atrocious ſpeculation and corruption, practiſed on a ſovereign legiſlature, to render ſuch an act ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and where a new caſe occurs, its merits muſt be tried by the rules of reaſon and common ſenſe.</p>
               <p>THE novelty of the caſe was created by the fraud of the companies, and it ſhould not be in their power to draw arguments, from this very novelty, againſt the reſcinding act.—The beſt, which can be ſaid of this argument is, that the very terms of the premiſes wholly forecloſe any concluſion in favor of or againſt the reſcinding act.</p>
               <p>THE ſecond argument is, <hi>that however the reſcind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act might have operated, previous to any ſales made by the companies: yet that it can have no effect on the northern purchaſers; becauſe they bought in open mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket at a fair price, ignorant of the colluſion.</hi> I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuggeſted the effects which it has had, and the impracticability of remedy; but in direct anſwer to the argument, be it remarked, that if any right ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted, it belonged to the ſovereign people of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia— that the colluſion of repreſentatives is not the colluſion of the people, and that when thoſe act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their delegated powers, their acts are voidable by the people. But when they, under the influence of bribes, agree to cheat their conſtituents and theſe bribes are given by the grantees, the contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes void on common law principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>As the king's grants proceed chiefly from his own bounty, and his letters patent are records of a high nature, they ought to contain the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt truth and certainty, and have in all times been conſtrued moſt favourably for the king contrary to the grants of common perſons; and accordingly in a great variety of caſes we find
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:033425_0058_0FF74A73E27E9CB8"/>incertainty, miſrecitals, falſe ſuggeſtions, and all ſuch matters as ſhew that the king was deceived in his grant, held ſuch reaſons as have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to vitiate the grants.<note n="*" place="bottom">Plow. 333. Co. 44.6 Co. 55.7 Co. 12.8 Co. 56.2 Co 24.8 Co. 145. Hob. 224. Pollexf. 418.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>EQUITY will relieve a man againſt a contract, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into, when he was in a ſtate of ebriety, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he were drawn into ſuch debauch by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and contrivance of him, who gained the contract.<note n="†" place="bottom">Powel on contracts, page 29.</note>
               </p>
               <p>IN the firſt quotations regarding the ſovereign people, as ſtanding in the place of the king, and their repreſentatives as the king's miniſters—the caſes will apply, and the granting act would be void, on common law principles. On the laſt quotation, let the fraud be compared to the debauch, and equity will declare the granting act void. An exception taken under this argument is, that the property is now in bona fide purchaſers, who are not partakers in the fraud:—but this exception is never admitted where a grant, deed, or contract is null and void in itſelf.</p>
               <p>THIS dark work of legiſlation partook too much of the Ethiopian huc, and the conduct of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies too much of the Leopards ſpots, ever to bring a white and unſpotted title, to the northern purchaſers.</p>
               <p>IN this caſe the ſtate has, by a ſovereign act, done no more, than what courts of law or equity would do in <hi>ſimilar</hi> contracts between individuals.</p>
               <p>THE third argument is, <hi>If the granting act was null and void in itſelf, there was no need of a reſcinding act and that if it was not thus null and void, a reſcinding act
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:033425_0059_0FF74A7D3AFA2500"/>could not make it so:—therefore that the validity of the granting act ought to have been tried by courts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF Gunn and Co. had raiſed a military force, and with colours flying, drums beating, loaded artillery and all the impoſing attitudes of hoſtile array, had procured this grant—and afterwards the ſtate of Georgia had, by armed force, overpowered theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders—and the aſſembly had afterwards convened and reſcinded the grant, and outlawed Gunn &amp; Co. would not all the world ſay they had done right— and that burning was good enough for an act thus obtained? All kings, all nations and ſovereign ſtates would do this, and the world would approve it; but their approbation would be founded on princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples broader and more enlarged than are contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the books.</p>
               <p>THE principles of the laws of nature and nations, including the laws of morality, take root deeper than the roots of ſociety—the book deciſions take root in a ſoil leſs deep than that of ſociety—the ſovereignty of the people is between them. Society is founded on firſt principles—Legiſlatures declare the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe principles—Courts apply theſe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to all the variety of caſes, which the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wickedneſs of man preſent for their deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The ſovereignty of the people never aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to its ſervants the judges of courts a right to judge of impoſitions on that ſovereignty.</p>
               <p>OF extremes of fraud or force this ſovereign peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will judge, leſſer violations are left to courts.— Once adopt as a principle that in ſuch caſes, courts may decide over the heads of legiſlatures, and you diſſeize the people of all ſovereignty and erect <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria in imperiis</hi> without end.</p>
               <p>THE confuſion of leaving a queſtion of this kind to courts would be endleſs. Without books or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:033425_0060_0FF74A8425A3D570"/>to form their deciſions, and without power to enforce them, the claimants would be led into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe expence without poſſible profit.</p>
               <p>HAPPILY the queſtion about the validity of the granting act has been decided by a power, from which there is no appeal; and the reſcinding act has pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed this deciſion in terms, liable to no miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>THE fourth argument is, <hi>That the reſcinding act is an ex poſt facto law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ALL this doctrine about ex poſt facto laws, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects this caſe, is wholly irrelevant: for though it be law and reaſon, that no man ſhall be puniſhed for the breach of a law paſſed after the commiſſion of an act, and though no law of this deſcription can alter the rights of individuals as reſpects each other: yet all this cannot apply to contracts between ſovereign and ſubject; for in the firſt caſe parties exiſt which can be called into court and compelled to anſwer: here there is but one exiſting party—the other is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of the court. It created the court, and in this creation never imparted to it a power to control itſelf in legiſlative meaſures.</p>
               <p>THE term <hi>ex poſt facto law</hi> was derived from the immorality and inexpediency of ſuch laws: but it wholly loſes its name, where it loſes its application; that is, when the after law is both moral and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and when the power making the law is in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery reſpect uncontrolable.</p>
               <p>THIS argument therefore is weak for two import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant reaſons; one, that it cannot apply to the caſe: another, that if it might apply in theory, there is no court or power on earth, mighty enough to make the application in practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:033425_0061_0FF74A8D691CA498"/>
THE fifth argument is, <hi>That a grant is ſacred and irreverſible; therefore that the reſcinding act cannot deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy the force of the granting act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF the Georgia grant is ſacred now, it would have been ſo, if the whole ſenate and houſe of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and governor had been bribed and if the land had been ſold for five dollars, inſtead of half a mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; but the fact is, nothing can make a grant <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,</hi> but the <hi>ſacred integrity</hi> of the contracting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.<note n="*" place="bottom">Truth and integrity being abſolute requiſites in contracts, falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and fraud render them poſitively void. <hi>See Hutchinſon on law of nature.</hi>
                  </note> Nothing can make a grant irreverſible, but <hi>a want of power in both parties to reverſe it.</hi> In the preſent caſe was no ſympton of integrity, and one of the contracting parties, having <hi>abundant power</hi> for the purpoſe, has actually reverſed it. Hence equity and power have been united in proving, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Georgia companies and diſappointment of the northern purchaſers, that the granting act was neither ſacred nor inviolable.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE the ſtate had received for this land 800,000 dollars, the higheſt price offered, and the aſſembly had, without any corruption, or colluſion, conſtitutionally, freely and with the full conſent of their conſtituents, granted this land and had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed full pay for it and had afterwards, on any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, reſcinded it and kept the money—all the world would have cried out <hi>ſhame!</hi> But what good would all this do to the ſuffering purchaſer? What lawyer could point to him any mode of reveſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a ſole excluſive right to buy theſe lands? Tis beyond the power of human invention.</p>
               <p>IF in ſuch caſe the ſtate had owned the fee and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and the individual had aſſerted and regained his right by force of arms—all the world might ſay,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:033425_0062_0FF74A979CDAAC48"/>he had done well in oppoſing might to might, and in redreſſing an injury: But now in order to do this he muſt firſt violate the laws of nature and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by extirpating the right owners; and they muſt expatriate every principle of decency and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty, in attempting to vindicate by force, a claim founded in fraud and iniquity; for very different from the above caſe, in point of equity and morality, has been the conduct of the ſtate of Georgia. By their reſcinding act, while they have aſſerted the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of a ſovereign people, they have exerciſed all the equity of an individual, by forgiving the wrong and offering to refund the money.</p>
               <p>THE condition of <hi>ſtatu quo</hi> propoſed by this act, though generally recogniſed among all nations, as a <hi>deſideratum</hi> between contending parties is not at all to the humor of theſe colluders. It ſevers them forever from the proſpect of immenſe wealth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labor, invention or honeſty, which was the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious boon in proſpect.</p>
               <p>HAD the ſtate confiſcated the purchaſe money, for the treachery practiſed againſt the ſovereign people, more might have been ſaid; but they have honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offered it back to thoſe who depoſited it. Try them by the law of nations for this reſcinding act and they will be honorably acquitted. Tried by the laws of nature, the ſtate of Georgia would be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
               <p>FROM all the maxims, which regulate ſovereign ſtates, the claimants fly to courts of inferior juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—courts highly reſpectable in their inſtitution— highly capable of adminiſtering juſtice between man and man; but <hi>wholly inadequate,</hi> in delegated power, for a deciſion of this queſtion; and in ſuch courts, borrowing the mantles of more honeſt ſuitors, they practically avow their deſigns of plunder, and not content with having violated the principles of fair
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:033425_0063_0FF74AA5C970FA18"/>dealing in the firſt inſtance, would under the maſk of law, <hi>pirate the world</hi> of the fair diſtinctions which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt between honeſt and diſhoneſt applicants for juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>CONTRACTS between kings and ſubjects, between ſovereign ſtates and individuals, ſtand on <hi>moral,</hi> not on legal principles.</p>
               <p>THE high approbation, with which the reſcinding act is now received by an impartial public, eſtabliſhes its conformity to the laws of morality and of nature. If the advocates of this argument could have ſhewn that this grant was fairly and ſacredly obtained, the public would have lamented that this ſovereign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had been immorally exerciſed: but the abſolute neceſſity that ſovereign power ſhould in all govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments reſide ſomewhere, has forecloſed all appeals in the preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>THE ſixth argument is, <hi>That the Indian right to part of the lands deſcribed in the granting act has been extinguiſhed—therefore that the reſcinding act could not at beſt reach the whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this my remarks on the nullity of ſale (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partly in poſſeſſion) furniſh a ſufficient anſwer.</p>
               <p>THE ſeventh argument is, <hi>That the companies are ſtill poſſeſſed of the original deeds of Governor Matthews —therefore that the reſcinding act, by deſtroying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, cannot have deſtroyed the title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT deeds are only evidences of title, and like other evidences, they may ſpeak truth or falſhood —theirs in conveying the fee violate the truth.— Deeds may be good or bad—valid or void, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:033425_0064_0FF74AB3B1DA40B8"/>to the power of the contracting parties, or the integrity and legality of their contracts. Theſe deeds were given by a party, unable to contract: they were founded on fraud, and the ſubject of them was unconſtitutional and illegal. Deeds create no fee-ſimple, nor any other quantity of eſtate in lands. The eſtate muſt firſt exiſt: but it did not exiſt in the preſent caſe. Your original deeds from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor can anſwer no other purpoſe, than as a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding memorial, that there was a time, when certain repreſentatives of a free people were guilty of moſt abandoned treachery againſt their conſtituents, and when there was a claſs of men, capable of improving the baſeſt of means for the vileſt of ends:—but the reſcinding act is to remain as an illuſtrious memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the everlaſting abhorrence with which their treachery and your corruption are to be regarded by this and future generations.</p>
               <p>THE foregoing and ſimilar arguments have been propoſed by the ſellers in every form in order to give currency to a ſecond edition of <hi>deluſions,</hi> which may be truly ſaid to be <hi>much enlarged</hi> by the authors. Every principle of law and equity has been put on the rack to compel a diſcloſure of ſomething in favor of the granting act. The books and their conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have been put in requiſition. Caſes have been nicely faſhioned to the fancy of employers, and the mighty quotient has been <hi>that the reſcinding act is good for nothing!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AMIDST the preparations for hoſtility, ſome of the northern purchaſers have been diſcomfited—ſome ſettlements have been effected; but even theſe have been magnified and multiplied, for the purpoſe of drawing others to accommodation. It was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that wretches were employed at the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:033425_0065_0FF74ABEB832CF70"/>under the maſk of purchaſers to draw in their neighbours; but pretences that theſe very impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have ſettled, have been ſince improved to draw thoſe very neigbours to a ſettlement.</p>
               <p>A THOROUGH detail of the frauds practiſed in the firſt, ſecond and laſt ſtages of this buſineſs would be voluminous, and in the preſent caſe of no other uſe than to add a new chapter to the volume of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which prove to what a depth of degradation the predominant luſt of wealth is able to ſink the character of man, and to what a boundleſs field of wickedneſs, thoſe men are introduced who leave the path of morals and integrity, and abandon their duty as men and members of ſociety.<note n="*" place="bottom">The frauds practiced in the northern ſales are within the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge and proof of the companies or individuals on whom they were practiſed.</note>
               </p>
               <p>BUT a certain portion of the fraud ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, from the following affidavits preſerved on the journals of the houſe.</p>

The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent at this time wiſhing to make further diſcovery of the conduct of the members on that ſale, and therefore affected to be inclined to come into the meaſure, and by that means kept up a converſation about it occaſionally; that on the day the bill received its firſt reading, before the houſe was convened, the ſaid Longſtreet ſpoke to the deponent, to get his approbation to the ſale. The deponent aſked him to ſhew thm what ſecurity the members had of the purchaſers, when the ſaid Longſtreet preſented a certificate, entitling the bearer to two ſhares of twenty-five thouſand acres each, ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

P. Sanders, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> another member of the ſame legiſlature, who adviſed the deponent to purchaſe ſome of the weſtern lands, which the ſaid legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had ſold, and in the purchaſe of which the deponent underſtood the ſaid R. P.

That the ſaid Gindrat, told the deponent, in a converſation upon that ſubject, that he ſhould have his, the ſaid Gindrat's ſhare, for that ſum, provided the money was paid by a certain time. That in conſequence, the deponent went to exchange ſome governors warrants for money; and when he returned, Gindrat refuſed to let him have them; having as the deponent underſtood and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, met with a better market. The deponent further ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he believes, and then underſtood, that a certain quantity was allotted to each member in the majority, who were not to pay any money therefor in advance, but were particularly indulged until the whole purchaſe money was payable at the treaſury, in conſequence of their vote and
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:033425_0068_0FF74AD22DC57BC8"/>ſupport of the law for ſelling the lands. The deponent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayeth, that R. P.

He, the ſaid R. P. Sanders, objected to giving ſo much. The ſaid M'Intoſh, however urged the completing the contract. The ſaid R. P. Sanders, further told the deponent, that the contract was broken off by reaſon of that deduction. The deponent further ſayeth, that he was preſent in company with Lachlan M'Intoſh, and others, when ſome one of the company, he thinks Mr. M'Intoſh himſelf, ſaid that he, the ſaid M'Intoſh, held ſix ſhares in the Georgia Miſſiſippi com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which he offered at three hundred dollars premium each, and on the ſame day the deponent underſtood that he did ſell them for a premium of two hundred and fifty dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars each, to one of the grantees of that company.</p>

From every circumſtance, which has come to your knowledge, do you, or do you not know or believe, that the ſaid Roberds Thomas or any of the members of the laſt legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, were abſolutely intereſted in the purchaſe of the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern lands, or did receive money or other things to induce them or him to vote for the ſale thereof?</p>
                           <p>A. I do not know, but I ſuppoſe they were from general ſuppoſition.</p>
                           <p>Q. 7. Did you, or did you not, underſtand from the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you put to Roberds Thomas, when he brought you the money, and the manner in which he anſwered it, that he had received the money for his vote in the legiſlature, or being in favor of the ſale of the land?</p>
                           <p>A. I did ſuppoſe from a knowledge of Mr. Thomas's cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that he could not have got that ſum of money, unleſs it had been in that way either directly or indirectly.</p>
                           <p>Q. 8. Do you, or do you not, know the aſſociates of the reſpective companies?</p>
                           <p>A. I do not.—Mrs. Longſtreet executed a renunciation of dower of lands, belonging to the Georgia company, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of Mr. Mather.</p>

A few evenings after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the ſaid Clayton told the deponent, that he need not be angry with him, for that it was at the requeſt of general Gunn, and he would pay the expenſe.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="unknown:033425_0072_0FF74AF0B6402348"/>while the act for the ſale of the weſtern lands was under the deliberation of the general aſſembly; that he put up with Mr. Wilkinſon, and Mr. Shepherd, two members of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemby, at M'Tiers, in Auguſta; that he frequently talked with Mr. Wilkinſon on that ſubject, and adviſed him not to agree to ſell it, for it would hurt his popularity; that the ſaid Wilkinſon ſaid, it would not, for that he thought it was beſt. That after the deponent found the land would be ſold, he was deſirous to get a part of it, and applied to Mr. Cox, one of the grantees in one company, to know if he could get a part; that Mr. Cox told the deponent he could not, for that all the ſhares were taken up; that he then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſaid Reuben Wilkinſon, to know if he could get him a part, who ſaid he could, and did let the deponent have a ſhare, which was in the name of the ſaid Reuben Wilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon, and was for about twenty-ſeven thouſand acres, or thereabout, ſubject to a deduction. The deponent further ſayeth, that he frequently heard Reuben Wilkinſon ſay, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the legiſlature roſe, that he ſhould make a great deal of money by that meaſure. That during the ſitting of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, Mr. Longſtreet frequently urged the deponent to try to prevail on Mr. Shepherd, another member, to go home; the deponent ſaid he could not influence Mr. Shepherd.

That he likewiſe had a converſation with Mr. Wilkinſon, who alſo aſked the deponent if Shepherd would not go home: The deponent anſwered he did not know; when Wilkinſon replied, "By God, I wiſh he would." The deponent further ſayeth, that before the aſſembly roſe, and before the Governor ſigned the bill, he, the ſaid Wilkinſon, ſhewed the deponent two writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten certificates, for four ſhares each, or for a certain number of acres, the deponent does not preciſely recollect which, ſaid certificate did not mention that any ſum was to be paid for them—They were ſigned by Nathanial Pendleton, chairman, he believes.

This deponent further ſayeth, that the meetings of the Georgia Miſſiſippi company were held at the deponents quarters; that he was preſent at ſome of their meetings; that during the paſſage of the act for the diſpoſal of the weſtern lands, he thinks general Gunn ſent for the deponent and aſked him if he was intimate with Henry Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a ſenator from the country of Warren, the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent anſwered he was; general Gunn then requeſted the deponent to go to him the ſaid Mitchell, and propoſe to him, to take a ſhare of ſeventy-five thouſand acres of lands, on the ſame terms of the other purchaſers, and at the ſame time to urge him to vote for ſelling the lands: The ſaid Gunn mentioned that captain Rains had a ſhare of fifty-ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand acres or thereabouts, who was a brother in law to Mr. Mitchell, but that Mr. Mitchell ſhould have a ſhare exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of that; the deponent did make ſuch a propoſal, which Mr. Mitchell refuſed: The deponent further ſayeth, that the ſaid general Gunn requeſted him at ſome time during that ſeſſion, and before the bill for ſelling the lands was paſſed, to go to Roberds Thomas, a member of the ſenate from Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock county, and know if he was earneſt in the buſineſs, for that he was fearful he did not intend to be uniform, for he was afraid the fellow was frightened, or words of that nature; that the deponent did call on Mr. Thomas for that purpoſe, who told him that he meant to be uniform: The deponent after the riſing of the legiſlature, ſaw the ſaid Thomas in the ſtreets of Auguſta, when the ſaid Thomas made this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "they blame me for ſpeculation, now I will ſpeculate, Flournoy, you have been ſpeculating all your life, and I will make more money in two years than you have made in your

And this deponent further ſaith, that ſome time on or about the firſt of Auguſt laſt, he was in Auguſta, and ſaw Richard Worſham, a member of the laſt legiſlature there, who had a ſhare in the Georgia company, commonly called Gunn's company, and was offering the ſame for ſale to Mr. Maher; that this deponent alſo ſaw Reuben Wilkinſon, a member of the laſt legiſlature, in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta, at the ſame time, who informed this deponent he had ſhares in the purchaſe of the weſtern lands, and that he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſell them.</p>

THE depoſitions here preſented need no other commentary, than the <hi>able and practical</hi> one made on them by the reſcinding act. I have endeavoured to notice ſummarily the arguments againſt this act in one or another part of theſe numbers. They have been of every deſcription. Whatever could opiate the reflections or brighten the proſpects of the Georgia ſellers has been improved; but no one has met the reſcinding act at the point, where it concentres all its ſtrength; which is in THE SOVEREIGNTY OF AN IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEPENDENT STATE. This ſtands above all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments oppoſed to it, and will continue ſo to do, till ſome one will find a power mighty enough to control it.</p>
               <p>THE reſcinding act of the United States, in reſpect to their promiſe to pay Spaniſh milled dollars for continental bills, and the acts of the ſeveral ſtates, which reſcinded their plighted faith for the payment of their notes and bills, were never called in queſtion; although theſe acts involved property to the amount of millions, and affected ſubjects, whoſe meritorious ſervices and honeſt earnings of the bills or notes were never doubted. This reſcinding reſulted from the neceſſity of the caſe, and became irreſiſtible BY REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON OF THE VERY SOVEREIGNTY, WHICH PASSED IT. But now, where neceſſity and equity were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined with this ſovereignty, a reſcinding act muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſtantly void—becauſe <hi>purchaſers of members rights</hi> are in danger of ſuffering. The firſt reſcinding acts contemplated bills, purporting to be equal to Spaniſh dollars. The laſt operated on deeds pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting to convey fee ſimples. The bills and the deeds were equally deceitful: yet the ſufferer by the firſt is left to lament that he truſted to a power beyond his control; while the <hi>purchaſers of members rights</hi> are to bid defiance to the power which has already cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>

                  <pb n="122" facs="unknown:033425_0082_0FF74B3AD30DEA18"/>
THIS vain gaſconading, theſe nice diſtinctions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult not from reaſon and nature; not from prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and principles; but from judgments perverted by money and from the miſerable items of a fee-table.</p>
               <p>NOT being ſo well verſed in the indexes of law books as the oppoſers of the reſcinding act, I beg leave to cloſe this number with a fable, the due ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of which will render further diſcuſſion of the merits of this act unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ONCE on a time, a lion and a fox entered into a treaty of mutual convenants; but the fox had craftily drawn the lion into articles, wholly foreign from the object of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and very inconvenient for the lion to perform. The lion diſcovering the treachery determined on redreſs when a fair opportunity ſhould preſent. Soon after, Reynard took the liberty of breaking a very eſſential article; upon which the lion, without ceremony, put him to death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE foxes aſſembled and complaining bitterly of cruelty and tyranny, determined,</hi> 1ſt. <hi>That the lion had no right to put Reynard to death.</hi> 2d. <hi>That the queſtion about the breach of treaty ought to have been tried by a court of foxes. And</hi> 3d. <hi>That as the lion had no right to kill Reynard, and as the queſtion ought to have been tried, therefore</hi> Reynard was not dead. <hi>Able counſellors were named to make out the caſe, and report their opinion. After much conſultation they reported as follows:</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1ſt. <hi>SUPPOSE Reynard was now alive—and ſuppoſe a lion was no ſtronger than a fox—then he could not kill a fox; therefore</hi> Reynard is ſtill alive.</item>
                  <item>2d. <hi>SUPPOSE a lion never before killed a fox for breach of treaty; then the lion had nothing to juſtify him in doing it; therefore he has not done it, and therefore</hi> Reynard is ſtill alive.</item>
                  <item>3d. <hi>As Reynard had, after making the treaty, lived for a conſiderable time—and as his breath had veſted in
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:033425_0083_0FF74B41E0B667A8"/>him; therefore the lion could not take it away and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Reynard is certainly alive. <hi>All which was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubmitted.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>As the burden of the buſineſs was</hi> Reynard's alive, <hi>and as the whole aſſembly of foxes wiſhed to believe it, the report was unanimouſly adopted; and the counſellors were re-appointed to deviſe and report ways and means for carrying this judgment into effect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THIS was an arduous taſk; but they at length reported that as this lion was very powerful aad lawleſs, it would be beſt to wait for his deceaſe, and perhaps his ſucceſſor might be as ſmall and weak as a mouſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this it was objected, that as the life of a fox was far ſhort of that of a lion, the preſent generation would not have the honor of carrying their judgment into effect. They therefore appointed a committee to wait on the lion with a copy of their judgment and to demand his aſſent to their propoſitions. This being delivered, the monarch of the foreſt replied—</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Your reaſoning may be very good; if you will appoint one of your number to enforce it upon me, I will receive him in the anti-chamber where your Reynard-alive is depoſited; and further tell your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, that when foxes deal with lions they muſt deal with good faith.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THAT</hi> Reynard was actually dead <hi>had been a ſore thing at the bottom of all their meaſures: but good reaſoning had hitherto kept them up. Now this ſevere anſwer returned to the company produced a ſadneſs, which led to the following humbling reſolves:</hi>

            <head>Georgia Speculation Unveiled. <hi>CONCLUSION.</hi> ADDRESSED TO THE NORTHERN PURCHASERS.</head>
            <p>IN theſe numbers I have endeavoured to combine, in a narrow compaſs, a variety of conſiderations, calculated to preſent this ſubject to you as wholly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from all others. My aim has been to unite you in a belief that you have obtained nothing for your money or your notes. Such an union would lead to a combination of meaſures for your relief wholly irreſiſtible.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I pledge my confidence in ſuch a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it may be prudent to conſider the different claſſes of men who are to unite—the obſtacles to this union—and to ſum up the real ſtrength of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>THE firſt claſs is of thoſe, who placed implicit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in all the ſtories of the ſellers—who had amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves with the delicious idea of immenſe wealth—and had anticipated the ſplendor of fortune. It is hard for theſe to unbelieve—to renounce their idol—to part with their phantom—to reflect that they have been duped.</p>
            <p>OF a ſecond claſs are a few, who have paid little attention to this ſubject; who have a general idea, that ſtates cannot reſcind their grants; who have
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:033425_0085_0FF74B6E704A5DA0"/>advanced but little money; who have heard much profane abuſe againſt Jackſon and his party and have been willing to receive it as argument.</p>
            <p>OF a third claſs are ſome, who partly aſſiſted by the ſellers and partly by their own hopes have made up a ſort of ſyſtem about this buſineſs, out of very mixt ingredients—and after very liberal abatements of the fraud—very high conceptions of the ſacred nature of a grant—ſome ſuggeſtions that the reſcind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act will be reſcinded and that if it is not, why it is no great matter, they believe it will all come out right in the end.</p>
            <p>OF a fourth claſs are a few, who have no opinion of their own; who aſk every man they meet, what he thinks of the Georgia buſineſs; who tremble at the ſhaking of a leaf; who feel ſome reſentment at the fraud; but dare not utter it—leſt theſe lion-like <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers of members rights</hi> ſhould eat them up; but who are willing to have a ſtout defence made in their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, if they can only keep clear of the buſtle.</p>
            <p>THE fifth and moſt numerous claſs is of thoſe, who feel indignant at the ſwindling and fraud practiſed in the ſales; who feel practically that the reſcinding act is fatal to their claim: who are willing to receive every rational propoſition in favor of a defence in their cauſes—and to unite in meaſures well adapted for that end.</p>
            <p>BUT in the ſheeps-cloathing of ſufferers are ſome who are hand and glove with the ſellers, who (though apparent purchaſers) never paid a farthing; but who are receiving commiſſions and rewards for their ſervices—and another claſs not much better, who partly bought and partly did not buy—have partly paid and partly not—who are in habits of friendſhip with the inſidious ſellers, and who by fawning and ſycophancy expect to make fair weather. Such, though they differ much in character from the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:033425_0086_0FF74B7637BC43C8"/>animal who licks the hand, juſt raiſed to ſhed his blood, will meet a ſimilar fate. There is no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on men, who have paſſed the bounds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, truth and honeſty. They who depend on them lean on <hi>the ſtaff of a bruiſed reed</hi> that will ſurely pierce them.</p>
            <p>THE firſt claſs of obſtacles to a union is, the policy of the ſellers to <hi>divide and conquer.</hi> They have ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arated companies, and have thus rendered them leſs formidable.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond is, that, <hi>what is every body's buſineſs is nobody's.</hi> Almoſt every one neglects attention to this ſubject, calculating that his ſingle exertions will not avail on a queſtion of this magnitude.</p>
            <p>THE third is, <hi>the artful impoſitions of the ſellers and their confederates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY tell you, that the legiſlature of 1795, was uniformly reſpectable; and that of 1796, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible—that the people of influence in Georgia deſpiſe the reſcinding act—that Gen. Jackſon is the mainſpring of motion, and that whenever he retires, the granting act will be reſtored. But they careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceal from you the meaſures taken to get members into the firſt legiſlature, who might be bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. They do not tell you that the offer of 800,000 dollars was a bona fide offer. They ſay nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the armed force, which came to the legiſlature to prevent the paſſing of the granting act, and that theſe were not diſperſed, till aſſurances were given, that if the act ſhould paſs, it ſhould be reſcinded. They do not tell you, that after the act paſſed, the people were aſtoniſhed to find the companies compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſome of the moſt influential men in the ſtate—nor do they tell you, that moſt of theſe men denied any knowledge of their names being improved, and indignantly refuſed to have any connection with the buſineſs: nor do they tell you, that on this diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:033425_0087_0FF74B835BE2AFE8"/>there was a general burſt of indignation from among the people againſt the granting act—that the indignation of the conſtituents of ROBERDS THOMAS was not confined to making him hug a ſapling, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laſt depoſition; but that <hi>they put him to death.</hi> They do not tell you, that all the newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, publiſhed in the ſtate, expreſſed unequivocally this indignation. They ſay nothing of the doings of the convention in May 1795; nor of the general preparations of the people of the ſtate for the reſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the grant. They cautiouſly conceal their own exertions to counteract the ſpirit of the people by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting a re-election of the members in favor of the granting act—their conviction, that they could not procure more than <hi>five</hi> to their purpoſe; the fact that they got but <hi>three;</hi> their coming to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and effecting their ſales, <hi>while knowing all theſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YET teſtimony of theſe things is now in our poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and would be publiſhed, were they not reſerved to be preſented to the public in the trial of pending cauſes.</p>
            <p>As to the character of the two legiſlatures, it is unqueſtionably true, that the characters of Mr. Watkins and ſome others in favor of the granting act are reſpectable; but no amount of individual character can waſh away the ſtain, which the reſcind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing act has indelibly fixed on the legiſlature of 1795.</p>
            <p>As to GOV. JACKSON, that he is a man of genius, reſources and patriotiſm, and that he reſigned an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent rank in the federal legiſlature, to intereſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the obnoxious act is true, and that he had influence in effecting it is equally true. But among the other names in favor of this reſcinding act are alſo others of genius, reſoures and patriotiſm.</p>
            <p>IT is beyond a queſtion that the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple approve the reſcinding act; elſe why are all the
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:033425_0088_0FF68282FAB96E98"/>Yazoo men, as they are termed, peaceably turned out of office? Why are the legiſlative, judicial and executive offices of the ſtate filled with the advocates of the reſcinding act? Why has the ſame legiſlature been continued? Are we to be told in one breath that Gen. Jackſon has no influence except among a miſerable rabble? And in the next that his influence over all the departments of government is uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and wholly irreſiſtible, and that when he is out of the way, the great men, the rich men, and the mighty captains will dare to ſhew their heads? <hi>Theſe are miſerable cobweb deceits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM the real merits of this ſubject, men are drawn by intereſt and credulity to numerous chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras—each of which, after ſerving its purpoſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, will leave them. They are told that the lands are now worth more than they coſt. Who tells this? <hi>The ſellers.</hi> Why then do not the ſellers give practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proof of this declaration by taking back the lands? They ſay they are not able; but the truth is that they would rather purſue you, through all the laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths of law, <hi>for a ſingle cent per acre,</hi> than take back the lands. They are now rending together the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of their ſhattered fortunes to pay immenſe charges in proſecuting for the recovery of ſome notes, which, if wholly undiſputed, would not bring 5<abbr>
                  <hi>ſ</hi>
               </abbr> in the pound. They are telling that the granting act is good. Any man, who really believed this, would take back the lands; for, the granting act being good, and the lands worth what they declared them to be, they are worth as much now and be they worth ever ſo little are worth more than their notes in ſuit, by the certain difference of all the coſt and charge of ſuſtaining the ſuits.</p>
            <p>MIND not their <hi>words,</hi> but look at their <hi>actions.</hi> When they tell you that others have ſettled and paid in full, deny it; for there are ten chances to one that
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:033425_0089_0FF74B9471EF4F58"/>what you would underſtand by a ſettlement has not been made. Some who were moſt powerfully under the influence of their deluſions have paid in full; that number is ſmall. Others, fearing the expenſes of law, have compromiſed and paid 5 per cent.<note n="*" place="margin">Sales to the amount of 70,000 dollars in the Georgia Miſſiſippi Co. have been vacated and the notes given up, <hi>on payment of</hi> 5 <hi>per cent.</hi> by the purchaſers, and other negociations are making to the ſame purport.</note> The great body of the purchaſers will never pay.</p>
            <p>BUT the fourth obſtacle is, <hi>The books, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of Lawyers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My ideas on the application of books to this ſubject have been already expreſſed—and as to Lawyers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, you may have obſerved, that men, who have ſuch cauſes to advocate as thoſe of the Georgia ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, generally employ a great number of Lawyers. They wiſh to monopolize the poſſeſſion. Hence you are in the way of hearing a great deal of law and a multitude of opinions, better calculated (I truſt) to alarm than to convince you. <hi>Such are the following.</hi> That you muſt certainly pay the ſcrip notes and as to negotiable notes there can be no queſtion about them, all the deciſions are that way, and to this point they will refer you to the following caſes, (Dyer 300. Hob. 62. Sid. 365. Lutw. 238. 2 Mod. 62. Carth. 413. Salk. 622. pl. 1. Comb. 443. <hi>Giles</hi> v. <hi>Hart.</hi> 3 Salk. 353. Ld. Raym. 254. S. C.) I have not been particular to ſee whether any of the books or pages quoted have even a ſpecious reference to the caſes in queſtion. That they apply as well as any other books or caſes I have no doubt. The fact is, that the books, as they are called (meaning reports of caſes, between Aplin and Booth, and Steel and Maſon, &amp;c.) are not mighty enough to decide a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depending ſolely on the law of nature and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:033425_0090_0FF74B9B716994F8"/>The writers of ſuch books never conceived of a pre-emptive right, and never heard of a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign independent ſtate reſcinding an act. Any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney's clerk may find authorities enough about FEE and GRANT and OUSTER and DISSEISIN and what the judges of Weſtminſter-Hall have ſaid about landed tenures; but what theſe have to do with a legiſlative act of a ſovereign ſtate, impowering their governor, contrary to conſtitution, to convey the <hi>fee-ſimple</hi> right of the ſtate, to buy land of the right ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is beyond my conception.</p>
            <p>THE real eſſential difference between this ſubject in every point of view and all the ſubjects in thoſe books, diſtances all application.</p>
            <p>THE introduction of Engliſh books into our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is much like our own introduction into this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In that country an enormous national debt, an expenſive army and navy, extravagant ſchemes of foreign murder and ambition, and an incalculable civil liſt, "dragging its ſlow length along," through the crooked paths of ſecret ſervice money, ſinecures and all the items of abandoned expence, rendered it neceſſary for the government to command and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the coin and to ſet up the idol paper in its ſtead. This policy rendered it neceſſary to protect and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the paper, and this neceſſity, originating with bank-bills, government ſecurities and company ſtocks, at length extended its jaws to private notes, bills and bonds and the whole became faſt bound in an imperious, unſeen and irreſiſtible policy. The king's judges were conſtrained to bend the whole practice of law, within theſe limits, to this policy. Hence come negotiable notes. Hence the nice ſubtlety, that fraud and want of conſideration ſhall not be pleadable againſt notes. Hence the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of turning men round to the chancery ſide of
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:033425_0091_0FF74BA1C0B32748"/>courts for manifeſt juſtice, or obliging them to pay their notes and ſue for the fraud.</p>
            <p>THOUGH our ſyſtem of landed tenures and our whole policy was widely variant from that of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; yet the indroduction of all theſe ſubtleties was well enough. It ſaved us from the trouble of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſyſtem of common law on common reaſon and our own circumſtances—it loaded our libraries with Engliſh books—kept us <hi>piouſly</hi> in mind of our moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er country—and increaſed the glorious uncertainty of the law. While it always furniſhed one ſide with abundance of precedents, it afforded the other a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble occaſion of ſhewing that the precedents did not apply. And thus, however barren of incident a cauſe might be; yet our juries, ſworn to judge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the evidence given them in court and the <hi>laws of the ſtate</hi> have ſeldom failed to be amuſed by the authorities; and jury-rooms have reſounded more with diſcuſſions about the comparative merit of the caſes cited from the books, than of the caſe which they had ſolemnly engaged to decide.</p>
            <p>ALL this was well enough, and if any of thoſe books declare, that <hi>notes originating out of Miſſiſippi ſcript or negotiable notes for the fee of land which does not exiſt, or of pre-emption good for nothing, or for both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a reſcinded grant</hi> ſhall be recovered; or if any caſe can be found, juſtifying ſuch a concluſion, I will freely give up the queſtion. But the impoſſibility of any fair application has been ſufficiently diſcuſſed.</p>
            <p>I ONLY add that a note is evidence of indebtedneſs and like other evidences may be deceitful. A note may have been ſigned or not ſigned by the perſon whoſe name is ſubſcribed to it—it may have been give under dureſs; and if it has been obtained by extreme force or fraud, or if the conſideration has wholly and manifeſtly failed, in innumerable inſtances the books will ſhew that negotiable bonds, bills, &amp;c.
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:033425_0092_0FF74BAA639EE198"/>have been avoided, both at law and in chancery. If then the bare exiſtence of a note is not concluſive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the maker or endorſer, your lawyers can form you a defence, combining more ſtrength, than can be found in the books.</p>
            <p>LAWYERS from their habits of thinking, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining facts and arguments, and of public diſcuſſion, are well able to raiſe a ſyſtem upon this unpreceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſubject; but meerly as lawyers, underſtanding the books, they are no more competent to manage theſe cauſes, <hi>than a maſon is competent to repair the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins of the fall or a ſurgeon to amputate a tree.</hi> But if they feel confidence in their books, let them prove by them the right of their clients to ſell the ſee of theſe lands—let them ſtorm in front the ſovereignty of the ſtate of Georgia—and batter down the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting rights of the natives to the premiſes;—then ſhall we have an argument worth a fee.</p>
            <p>BUT inſtead of this we have caſes made out of ſuppoſitions; ſuch as, <hi>ſuppoſe the fee of the lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the ſtate, and ſuppoſe the ſtate honeſtly ſold it,</hi> why then the following caſes will apply.</p>
            <p>(Comb. 403. Ld. Raym. 154. 2 Salk. 676. pl. 3. Carth. 411. Trygarn v. Fletcher.) <hi>Well ſuppoſe they did not own the fee, and ſuppoſe there was fraud in obtaining the granting act, why then the following caſes will be relevant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(Hard. 336. 2 Lev. 194. And. 307. Cro. Eliz. 352. Rol. Abr. 939. Dowſe v. Jeffries.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WELL, ſuppoſe the ſtate has reſcinded the grant: the following caſes will ſhew that they had no right to do it;</hi>

            <p>I CALCULATE that ſuch arguments will be uſed, till the money which you have advanced, ſhall be expended, and then will be an end of the bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:033425_0094_0FF74BBBB9F59DB0"/>The men, who are ſpinning ſuch fine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, would be ready to aſſiſt you <hi>without reward</hi> in extinguiſhing a fire which was conſuming your dwellings; but in a calamity more afflicting to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you in point of property, their profeſſion has ſet them againſt you, I will do them all the juſtice to believe that they heartily wiſh a more reſpectable field for the exerciſe of their talents. No man is ſo poor and humble as to be unable to wound and injure his fellow-men. No elevation in life, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, talents nor rewards can juſtify a man for abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a wrong. The advocate, who exerts himſelf to defend a felon from the puniſhment of death, acts conſiſtently with the merciful ſpirit of the penal code; but he who, in any way, aſſiſts a felon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud his neighbours—violates the principles of good faith—tears the ligaments of ſocial intercourſe, and tho' he may be treaſuring up money againſt the day of want, is treaſuring up crime againſt the day of retribution.</p>
            <p>THO' I ſhould preſs moral conſiderations into hard ſervice, were I to addreſs them to the men who have defrauded you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they are fairly applied to that claſs of men, on whoſe exertions they rely for the eventual ſucceſs of their unprincipled projections.</p>
            <p>BUT oppoſed to every obſtacle, ſtands the real ſtrength of your cauſe. In the firſt pamphlet having ſuggeſted the different conſiderations, compoſing this ſubject and in this having diſcuſſed thoſe, which were moſt important, I now proceed to preſent you the following general concluſions-</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. BY the Georgia deeds, by your own deeds, by the pamphlets and by the declarations of the ſellers, you had a right to believe that you had bought the FEE of the lands in queſtion. This was what you bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:033425_0095_0FF682896F2703B0"/>for, and what you are entitled to have; for this only have your monies been paid and your notes been given: You are not obliged to accept any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute: If the fee has failed, the whole conſideration of the bargains has failed: The bargains are wholly void, and courts of chancery will compel the holders to give up your notes and refund your money, or courts of law, exerciſing concurrent powers, will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you equal relief.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now left the field, where books and the power of courts cannot reach; but though the books cannot furniſh nor confute your premiſes, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford abundant application, as ſoon as your notes, founded on thoſe premiſes, are within the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of courts.</p>
            <p>BUT the fee has <hi>wholly failed.</hi> It is not ſuſtained by the law of nature—by the principles of our landed tenures—by any precedent, nor by the policy of the United States; but Congreſs has denied the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a fee in a ſimilar caſe. The Indians, by the very ſhewing of the State of Facts, own rightfully every thing about the lands, which conſtitutes a fee; and the ſovereign people of Georgia do not now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they ever owned the <hi>fee:</hi> and there is no perſon, who undertakes to quote any time, at which this fee veſted in Georgia, or any ſource from which they could have derived it. Every argument on the ſubject of the fee is decidedly in favor of the natives, who poſſeſs it.</p>
            <p>IT is fair therefore to conclude that you have wholly failed of that which was the ſubject of your bargains, and the conſideration of your notes; which concluſion will juſtify the relief before propoſed.</p>
            <p>THIS ſelling of a fee, which did not exiſt, is a fraud of ſufficient magnitude to exonerate you from payment, and the proof that it was thus ſold, and that it did not exiſt in the ſellers, is within the reach of
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:033425_0096_0FF74BCCD692D6D0"/>every one of you. The ſellers adroitly calculated, (as ſatan did when he propoſed the comelineſs of the fruit) that the word <hi>fee</hi> would be alluring to purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and therefore inſerted it, computing that when that failed, a decent ſubſtitute would be preferred to a breaking up of their bargains; but they relied too much on their ſucceſs in the firſt deluſions, and little imagined that the ſpirit of an independent people would reduce a <hi>majority</hi> to the number of <hi>three</hi> and that the act would be reſcinded with marks of deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>THE plauſible right of pre-emption was intended as a ſubſtitute, and this to the northern purchaſers was not without its comelineſs; the argument that the companies ſold in Georgia, and bought of, and ſold to each other, takes nothing from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This was all done with an eye to the event, which was to ſell again.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. THIS PRE-EMPTION, (as it is termed) turns out to be the moſt deluſive of all ſhadows; as unlike to a <hi>fee</hi> and as miſerable a ſubſtitute as could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of. After exploring every reſource, we at length find, that a right to purchaſe lands of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives is abſolutely involved in a right to hold a treaty with the natives, which right can alone be acquired from the Preſident of the union—that the United States are under no expreſs nor implicit obligation to grant it to a ſtate or to any individual company, in preference to another—that they have never granted it, for the purpoſe of purchaſe, except when the Indians were diſpoſed to ſell—that the native poſſeſſors of theſe lands are never likely to conſent to ſell; for the principal nation among them are <hi>very averſe to part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their lands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE therefore find, that we never had any thing more by our deeds, than a fractional part of the declaration of the repreſentatives of Georgia, that
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:033425_0097_0FF74BD3D8552810"/>they would not apply for this right to hold a treaty— which ſtate of Georgia was the leaſt likely of any in the union to obtain ſuch a permiſſion—and we find that we could never avail ourſelves of this declaration in any other way, than by application to the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (if a proper time ſhould ever arrive) ſtating as a ground of ſuperior merit, that we had bought this declaration. This time would not probably arrive, till the lapſe of many ages, and if any of our poſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity ſhould ſtate to congreſs that their anceſtors had been dupes to a ſet of ſpeculators, I truſt it would not reflect much honor on us or them.</p>
            <p>TIS true that this permiſſion to hold treaty has been ſometimes granted to the releaſees of a ſtate; but if our right of pre-emption, our <hi>ſubſtitute for a fee-ſimple,</hi> is reduced to the pitiful chance of being THE MOST MERITORIOUS BEGGARS FOR A RIGHT TO CHEAT INDIANS, it muſt be declared a moſt delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſubſtitute, and if any thing more can be made of it, it muſt be done by men more capable than I am of diſcerning its merits.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. BUT this negative, worthleſs declaration of the ſtate of Georgia, <hi>which the breath of a ſouthern ſlave might have blown into its original nothingneſs,</hi> has been cruſhed by a power mighty enough to have annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a fee-ſimple, combined with an abſolute right to deforce the occupants. The reſcinding act preſents a ſyſtem of fraud in the companies, which would been fatal to any claim of whatever nature or deſcription. Call it a fee and exclude the fraud, and the contract has been ſhewn to be void on principles of common law; but introduce the fraud, which is the principal argument in the act itſelf, and a new and concluſive defence in your favor is derived from this fraud.</p>
            <p>THAT the very men, of whom you purchaſed were guilty of this fraud, is proved by a cloud of witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:033425_0098_0FF74BDD3B6863A8"/>Nearly the whole legiſlature of 1796, acting without any bias of private intereſt in a high reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible capacity, have, by a public and ſolemn act, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their belief in this teſtimony—and the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign people, year after year, are bearing public teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the integrity of their legiſlators in this tranſaction.</p>
            <p>FRAUD cannot be more concluſively proved, and this fraud has been practiſed by the very men, who are purſuing you for payment of your notes. Can a ſtronger caſe be laid before a court?</p>
            <p>WHEN theſe frauds are thoroughly known to our courts, the books and the authorities will be of as little avail to the counſel, as the rocks and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains will be to their clients in another day.</p>
            <p>THE diſtinction, which I have taken, between that part of this ſubject, where the books cannot apply— and that part, where they may apply, is preciſely this. The ſubject matter of the granting act and the companies deeds—the means of obtaining the act—the ſovereignty of an independent ſtate—the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſuch a ſtate to the federal union—the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the policy of the union on the meaſures of the ſeparate ſtates—the reſcinding act, with its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and conſequences, are all either unprecedented or unparalled, and could not have been treated of in the books; and as all theſe depend on a ſyſtem of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, coeval only with our exiſtence as a nation, it is impoſſible that the principles in the books ſhould be able to furniſh or combat the principles on which your cauſe is ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>FRAUD of the firſt magnitude has been conceived, brought forth, matured and ſtands confeſt before the court, at the very point of theſe cauſes, where the books can be conſiſtently opened—and opened at this point, the authorities both at law and in chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery are concluſively in your favor. At my requeſt
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:033425_0099_0FF74BE850E66E68"/>they have been examined and if it was in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to introduce them, they ſhould be pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ted in this place: But in the preſent ſituation of the cauſes pending and to be commenced, I confine myſelf to remarking on the law-ſide of this queſtion—<hi>that your ſcript notes, your negotiable notes, your ſecurities of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deſcription for theſe lands, whatever may be the form of your conveyances ſtand on the ſame footing as counterfeit bank bills.</hi> There never yet was a queſtion, whether a counterfeit bill, paſſing through ever ſo many hands, ſhould or ſhould not ceaſe to be counterfeit. Can there be any more queſtion about negotiable notes for Miſſiſippi ſcript which begun in fraud, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by artifice and ended in nothing? Did ever the holder of a counterfeit bill recover the amount from the bank and turn it round to the wretch, who firſt paſſed it? Will it anſwer for the holder to ſay that he exchanged ſilver for it? No! The reply of the bank is, <hi>we received nothing for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a bill muſt be originally good, ſo muſt a nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable note be good, and if it fail in any of the <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites</hi> of a good note, in the firſt inſtance, that failure is not helped by its paſſing from hand to hand. This remark is true in a qualified ſenſe—that is, a note muſt be legally ſigned by the maker or endorſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and this not under any fear of bodily harm. It muſt be legally the act and deed of the maker or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſer. Theſe are abſolute requiſites and the want of them cannot be ſupplied by any change of owners.</p>
            <p>So a note, which, through fraud or any other cauſe, might have been avoided, had the ſuit been in the name of the party to the fraud, is not made good, by its having been paſſed from hand to hand, <hi>when that very paſſing was done for the expreſs purpoſe of aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a recovery</hi>—which is preciſely true and proveable reſpecting a great number and perhaps all the notes of this deſcription.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="unknown:033425_0100_0FF74BF0165A7D08"/>
FROM the general knowledge of this fraud which has now obtained and of the notes which have iſſued from this corrupt original, the preſumption is very ſtrong, that no man would receive theſe as he would mercantile notes—and any circumſtance, ſhewing that in the paſſing of the note, paſſed any agreement (either expreſs or implied) to reſund, in caſe a recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſhould be barred on account of the baſe origin of the note, the holder, however diſtant from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſer or deceiver, would fail of recovery; and this on the faireſt principles of common law. The means of defence on theſe and all the other notes have been preſented in the frauds, diſcoverable in an attempt to ſell the fee—in the total failure of the ſubſtitute and in the neceſſity of a reſcinding act—add to theſe the auxiliary conſiderations, ſuggeſted in theſe numbers, add to theſe your own exertions, and to all, the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of your counſel—and courts of law will ſuſtain you.</p>
            <p>ON the equity ſide of this queſtion, I confine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to preſenting you the following authorities, not as reaching the extent of your caſe; but as ſhewing the principles and practice of chancery courts on ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of fraud, <hi>far leſs aggravated,</hi> than what you have to plead for your relief.</p>

                        <p>THIS was a bill to be relieved againſt a contract in writing for the ſale of eleven ſhares in the Luſtring Company, which ſhares were never transferred, the books of the Company being ſhut up, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>FOR the defendant, it was objected, 1ſt. That though this was a hard caſe on the now plaintiff; yet that it had been likewiſe hard on the defendant, who was not a contriver of the project; but a ſufferer by it, having himſelf bought ſtocks at high rates. 2d. That equity ought, in ſuch caſes, to ſtand neuter and to let the hardſhip reſt where the law had caſt it, and at law, now the defendant had a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. 3d. Though the books had been ſhut for ſome time, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to know but that they might be open again, and that in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Maſter of the Rolls.</hi> It is againſt natural juſtice that any one ſhould pay for a bargain, which he cannot have; there ought to be <hi>quid pro
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:033425_0101_0FF74BF64EA54868"/>quo;</hi> but in this caſe the defendant has ſold the plaintiff <hi>a bubble or moonſhine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT is impoſſible that this bargain ſhould ever be made good to the plaintiff; for here is proof by the company's own ſecretary of his having adviſed with three eminent counſel, who all agreed that the company cannot juſtify accepting any more transfers, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney cannot be ſaid to be due in conſcience, <hi>ſuppoſing the plaintiff to be incapable of coming at what he contracted for and in conſideration whereof he was to pay his money.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IF I ſhould buy an houſe and before ſuch time as, by the articles I am to pay for the ſame, the houſe be burnt down by caſualty of fire, I ſhall not in equity be bound to pay for the houſe: and yet the houſe may be built up again: but I doubt it will be impoſſible to ſet up the company again, as in the other caſe the ſeller may do the houſe.</p>
                        <p>IT being four years ſince the contract; and the books having never been opened ſince, it is to be preſumed they never will.</p>
                        <p>CERTAINLY it cannot be imagined that the plaintiff would have been prevailed upon to covenant for the payment of the money at a preciſe day, had he entertained the leaſt apprehenſion, that the books would never have been opened.</p>
                        <p>As to the objection that the plaintiff here might have defended himſelf at law—Matters of fraud are cognizable in equity as well as at law. The ſeller in this caſe is the chief actor; he went to market with the bubble and ſince no transfer can be made let there be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual injunction and let the defendant, at the plaintiffs charge, enter ſatisfaction on the judgment.</p>
                        <p>ON a rehearing, it was contended for the defendant that he was not the firſt projector or inventor (of the bubble,) &amp;c. but no opinion was had—the cauſe being adjuſted by the parties.</p>

                        <p>THE plaintiffs brought their bill to be repaid the two ſeveral ſums of 120<abbr>l.</abbr> and 120<abbr>l.</abbr> which they had paid to the defendants, as mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and projectors of a bubble, called the <hi>Land Security and Oil Patent.</hi>

                        <p>IN <hi>June</hi> 1720, this <hi>Woollaſton</hi> made public this project and aſſigned his oil patent to the defendant <hi>Arnold,</hi> in truſt for all the contributors
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:033425_0102_0FF74BFC8A77A060"/>towards the project, which he divided into five thouſand ſhares, valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every ſhare at 20<abbr>l.</abbr> in order to raiſe 100,000<abbr>l.</abbr>
                        </p>
                        <p>AND as an encouragement and ſecurity for all the contributors, <hi>Woollaſton</hi> conveyed his purchaſe of <hi>Sutton Marſh</hi> to the defendant <hi>Arnold</hi> and his heirs, in truſt, in the firſt place, to pay off the two mortgages, being 28,000<abbr>l.</abbr> and afterwards to pay to himſelf (the ſaid <hi>Woollaſton</hi>) 57,000<abbr>l.</abbr> in all 85,000<abbr>l.</abbr> and as to the ſurplus which the eſtate would raiſe, it was to be for the benefit of the contributors; the project or bubble was to be called the <hi>Land Seurity and Oil Patent,</hi> and was repreſented by the defendants to be a moſt advantageous project without any hazard, there being landed ſecurity given for the benefit of the contributors.</p>
                        <p>The plaintiffs paid unto the defendant <hi>Arnold</hi> the ſeveral ſums of 120<abbr>l.</abbr> and 120<abbr>l.</abbr> for ſix ſhares a-piece, for which <hi>Arnold</hi> gave them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, and the projectors ſold about 1000 tickets amounting to 20,000<abbr>l.</abbr>
                        </p>
                        <p>IN <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1720 the project failed, no oil having ever been made, or radiſhes ſowed on the premiſes.</p>
                        <p>WHEREUPON the contributors, with ſome reſentment, called upon the projectors for their money, which occaſioned the projectors to advertiſe, that in ſix months time, they would return the money with intereſt; but afterwards this was refuſed.</p>
                        <p>INSISTED for the defendants, that the plaintiff being acquainted with this ſecurity as to the lands, they ought to reſort thither; that there could be no impoſition in this caſe, becauſe the parties had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and the extracting oil out of radiſhes having had the ſanction of a patent, could not be thought a cheat; and as to the advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it was pretended they were gained by threatnings; and that the parties admitting they were aggrieved, had their remedy at law.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Maſter of the Rolls:</hi> This is an impoſition, to propoſe the ſurplus of the value of an eſtate which coſt but 31,800<abbr>l.</abbr> after 85,000 charged upon it, which is much more than double the value) as a ſecurity to the contributors who laid out their money upon this project; it is giving them <hi>moonſhine</hi> inſtead of any <hi>thing real,</hi> and the proof is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlight, whereas it ought to have been extremely ſtrong; it is hard to believe, that any perſon would conſent to be ſo impoſed upon And what makes it worſe is, that this great ſum of 57,000<abbr>l.</abbr> is reſerved to the defendant the projector himſelf.</p>
                        <p>THE gaining the patent can be no ſanction to the cheat, becauſe the patent does not ſecure the patentee, if it is not a new invention, but others may uſe the ſame, or if it be not the firſt patent, the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entee is not ſecure from an action; and patents of new inventions, as well as grants of other things, may be obtained by ſurprize and falſe ſuggeſtions.</p>
                        <p>IF this were a fraud againſt any private or ſingle perſon, a court of equity would relieve; <hi>a fortiori,</hi> when it is a fraud againſt great numbers, againſt multitudes, where the miſchief is more extenſive, and many families thereby ruined.</p>
                        <p>IT is no objection, that the parties have their remedy at law, and may bring an action for monies had and received for the plaintiffs own uſe; for in caſes of fraud, the court of equity has a concurrent juriſdiction with the common law, matter of fraud being the great ſubject of relief here.</p>

ACCORDINGLY caſes of this nature have frequently met with relief in this court, as in <hi>Aaron Hill's</hi> caſe, which was a patent for extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oil out of beech, which was alſo divided into ſhares, (as this is) and a ſecurity propoſed and agreed to be made of lands, which came out to be <hi>terra incognita</hi> betwixt the degrees of latitude 50 and 57; and in the principal caſe, the land, after the 85,000<abbr>l.</abbr> paid, ſeems to be worth as little as <hi>Aaron Hill's.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AND as to the pretence of gaining the advertiſements by force, the contributors were angry, and had reaſon to be ſo, and one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributors (tho' it does not appear to have been either of the plaintiffs) threatened to cut the defendants throats; but this all ended in an arreſt of one of the defendants, which was a lawful proceeding, and after all theſe threatenings were over, the laſt advertiſement was given out by the defendants on the 19th of <hi>September</hi> 1720.</p>
                        <p>FURTHER it is juſt that the defendant <hi>Arnold,</hi> as well as the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>Woollaſton,</hi> ſhould be charged; for as <hi>Woollaſton</hi> was the firſt projector and procurer of the patent, and purchaſer of the land, ſo <hi>Arnold</hi> was his truſtee, accepted the conveyance, was the treaſurer, received the money, and gave the receipts, was partner in the fraud, and plainly <hi>particeps criminis.</hi>
