            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>JESUS CHRIST, the author and ſiniſher of our faith, is ſtiled, <q>the prince of peace.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa, ix. 6.</note> He left the glories of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate, and aſſumed our nature, that he might reſtore peace on earth.</p>
            <p>As the mediator between GOD and a revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world, he made ſatiſfaction for ſin by his obedience and death:—Having finiſhed the work which was given him to do, before he aſcended on high, he gave particular orders that the tidings of peace ſhould be publiſhed to every creature; and the miniſters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in all generations, are bound by the laws
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013371_0004_0F90F3DEEF67D188"/>
of their divine maſter, to beſeech the children of men to be reconciled to GOD, and be at peace with one another.—The diſciples of CHRIST are commanded to "follow after the things which make for peace";<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. XIV. 12,</note> and if it be poſſible, as much as lieth in them, to live peaceable with all men.</p>
            <p>THE text ſuppoſes indeed there may be caſes in which it is <hi>impoſſible,</hi> even for a chriſtian to live peaceably in the preſent world—There may be caſes in which the prince of peace himſelf does not require the ſubjects of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be quiet, and tamely ſubmit to inſults and abuſes.—There may be caſes in which a chriſtian ought to unſheath the ſword and <hi>reſiſt unto blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE followers of JESUS CHRIST are to be of a forgiving and peaceful temper of mind: But chriſtians have natural rights as well as other men, and it can be no leſs their duty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thoſe rights againſt the encroachments of tyrants and oppreſſors, after having profeſſed their ſubjection to the Son of GOD, than it was before. The character of a chriſtian then, and that of a ſoldier are not in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with each other.—In this world of diſorder and injuſtice, a chriſtian may, and ought to learn the art of war.</p>
            <p>IN diſcourſing from the words before us, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by divine aſſiſtance, to conſider the import of St. Paul's exhortation;—To point out ſome
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013371_0005_0F90F3E28D858088"/>
caſes in which it is impoſſible for the diſciples of CHRIST to live peaceably with <hi>all men,</hi>—And then ſhow the neceſſity of preparing for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable war.</p>
            <p>FIRST then I am to conſider the import of St. Paul's exhortation in the text.</p>
            <p>BY this exhortation we are taught, that the profeſſors of chriſtianity are not to incroach on the rights of their fellow men, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to war by injuring them in their name, their perſon, or eſtates. And farther, this exhortation teaches us to be of a patient and forgiving temper of mind, rather chooſing to ſubmit to many inconveniencies, than to ſeek the immediate deſtruction of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.—This ſelfdenying and pacific diſpoſition was diſcovered to great advantage by the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Paul. Altho' he could aſſert his rights and priviledges with firmneſs and reſolution on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per occaſions, he made it his general ſtuddy to live in peace, and repeatedly charged his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to be careful in all their behaviour, that they gave no juſt occaſion of offence.—We may not attempt to deprive our brethren of <hi>any</hi> of their rights:—We may give "<hi>none</hi> offence".<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 2. 32.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AND this doctrine is perfectly agreable to the dictates of reaſon.—I have naturally as good a right to life and liberty as my neighbour. If
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013371_0006_0F90F3E7E1CA5848"/>
he attempts to deprive me of what I have a right to, unleſs it be proved I have forfeited that right he attempts to do me an injury, and unjuſtly provokes me to war in my own defence.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Lock on Government, Chap. III. <hi>of the ſtate of war.</hi>
               </note> My neighbour can have no more right to compel me to ſerve him, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of my poſſeſſions becauſe he is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a longer ſword, or a ſtronger arm, than I have to ſeek his life in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious manner, or rob him of his ſubſtance when he is under no apprehenſions of danger.</p>
            <p>THIS reaſoning which every one ſees the force of when applied to individuals in a ſtate of nature, holds good with reſpect to the nations and kingdoms of the world.—A ſtrong nation has no more right to oppreſs a weak one, than a man of large bones and ſtrong muſcels has to beat and abuſe his brother, who happens to be of a more ſlender make.</p>
            <p>IT is then evident that offenſive war is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.—That nation which unprovoked, makes war upon others, only to inlarge its dominions, or increaſe its revenues, is a nation of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and it would be as impoſſible to juſtify their conduct by reaſon or the word of GOD, as it would be to juſtify the conduct of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic highway-man, or thoſe <hi>Arabs</hi> who make it their buſineſs to plunder ſuch unhappy travellers as fall in their way.</p>
            <p>How ſhockingly then have many famous commanders proſtituted the art of war, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013371_0007_0F90F3E8091DA228"/>
polluted their hands with blood! Alexander the great, who carried his arms through the world, though poſſeſſed of uncommon military ſkill, is a character which ought to be held in abhorrence. His ambition led him to violate the plaineſt rules of Juſtice: He ſpread deſolation through the fineſt countries, and ſlaughtered vaſt multitudes who ventured to oppoſe his arbitrary conduct.<note n="*" place="bottom">One murder made a villain, "Millions a HERO"—PORTEUS.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT however much ſome pagan monarchs, and others who have profeſſed the religion of JESUS may have abuſed their power to oppreſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave thoſe kingdoms which were unable to reſiſt them, it is certain the light of nature, and the inſpired writings teach the children of men to treat one another in a very different manner.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY teaches us to be contented with the allotments of divine providence, and forbids our looking with an envious eye on the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of others.—The doctrines of chriſtianity are oppoſed to thoſe luſts,—ſuch as pride, ambition, a deſire of large poſſeſſions and dominion over others, which are the ſource of wars and fightings.</p>
            <p>BUT although the goſpel breathes the moſt kind and benevolent ſpirit, it is plain from many paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the new-teſtament, that the ſacred writers ſuppoſed it poſſible, and very probable, that chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may be in ſuch circumſtances as would juſtify their contending with their enemies.<note n="†" place="bottom">Much to our purpoſe are thoſe words of our Lord, Luk. xxii. 36.—"He that hath no Sword, let him ſell his garment and buy one".</note> The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013371_0008_0F90F3E8C0B20E08"/>
of peace propoſed to them may be hard and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. They may be of ſuch a nature as to render it impoſſible for them to comply without tranſgreſſing the revealed will of heaven. Hence St. Paul ſays, <q>as much as <hi>lieth in you,</hi> live pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably with all men;</q> plainly ſuppoſing it may not be in our power to live peaceably with <hi>ſome</hi> men under ſome particular circumſtances without offending GOD, or greatly injuring ourſelves.—The enemies of religion may require us to deny our LORD and Maſter, or to do other things which we know are in themſelves ſinful, as the condition of life, or deliverance from oppreſſion. In ſuch caſes it would not be in our <hi>power</hi> to live peaceably; and we ſhould rather chooſe to riſque our fortunes, and all we poſſeſs in a ſtruggle with our enemies, than ſubmit to their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>BUT what we have now obſerved will be more fully illuſtrated as we proceed, according to what was propoſed in the,</p>
            <p>SECOND place, to point out ſome particular caſes in which it is impoſſible, even for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of chriſtianity, to live peaceably with <hi>all</hi> men.</p>
            <p>IN this place it may be well for us to obſerve, the kingdom of CHRIST is a kingdom of <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> as well as of Peace and Joy of the holy GHOST;<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xiv. 17.</note> and thoſe who expect, either preſent or everlaſting happineſs in the protection and friendſhip of our glorious Redeemer, muſt never think of ſecuring peace with their fellow men, at the expence of truth and Juſtice. The righteous
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013371_0009_0F90F3E97046AC50"/>
LORD loveth righteouſneſs, and hateth the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity: It is therefore much ſafer for his people to truſt in him for deliverance from their enemies, than it would be for them to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a peace on unrighteous terms.—Keeping this in view, it will no doubt appear to us all, there may be caſes, in which, ſo far from its being du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to live peaceably with our fellow men, we ought to enter into war with them.</p>
            <p>WERE we in a part of the world, where the laws of ſociety had not obtained, we might, no doubt fortify our dwellings, and defend our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and ſubſtance againſt ſuch as ſhould venture to moleſt or deſtroy us. The patriarch Abram kept up a kind of militia: He had three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty trained ſervants, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to defend his family and intereſt. Theſe faithful troops he marched againſt the four kings who had captivated his nephew <hi>Lot,</hi> and by managing them in the moſt advantageous manner, he reſcued his kinſman, and ſlew his enemies.</p>
            <p>THAT GOD approved of Abram's conduct is evident from the bleſſing of <hi>Melchizedic,</hi> who was a prieſt of the moſt high GOD. <q>And he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him and ſaid, Bleſſed be Abram of the moſt high GOD poſſeſſor of heaven and earth. And bleſſed be the moſt high GOD which hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thine enemies into thy hand.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Geneſis, xiv. 19 &amp; 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THIS inſtance may ſerve as a ſufficient proof that it is right in the ſight of GOD for indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals in a ſtate of nature, or in thoſe parts of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013371_0010_0F90568F50EEB398"/>
the world where the laws of ſociety are not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, to defend themſelves, and make war on ſuch as attempt to deprive them of their lives and fortunes.</p>
            <p>AND as the laws of reaſon and of GOD would Juſtify an individual in the caſe now ſuppoſed, who ſhould defend himſelf againſt ſuch neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as attempted eſſentially to injure him, ſo is it equally plain, that public Societies, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Kingdoms, confederated on any general plan for their ſafety and happineſs, may and ought to defend themſelves; and when their ſafety requires it, they may juſtly make war with the known enemies of their common good, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe enemies happen to be foreign or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic.</p>
            <p>WHEN people enter into ſociety the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject they have in view is the public good, which includes the good of individuals.—All the laws which they eſtabliſh, are, or ought to be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the ſecurity of the lives and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the whole community.</p>
            <p>WHEN the community therefore is attacked by other powers, or any individuals of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are injured in their perſons or properties, the laws of ſociety require them to exert the powers they have for the common ſafety, and the ſafety of individuals.</p>
            <p>BUT however Juſt and equal a right indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals in a ſtate of nature, or particular Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Kingdoms where the laws of ſociety are

            <p>So little attention has been paid to the law of righteouſneſs, which was at firſt ingraven on the human heart, that the monarchs of the earth <hi>in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> have not ſcrupled to ſeize on the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and fortunes of ſuch as were not able to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them.—Whoever looks over the hiſtory of the world, will find undeniable proof of what we have here aſſerted.</p>

            <p>WE can ſcarcely form a conception of any ſtate more completely wretched, than that of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy mortals who lie at the mercy of abſolute Sovereigns, whoſe word is the law, at whoſe nod the ſubjects tremble, and who may, when they pleaſe, take the life or property of any who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their dominions.</p>
            <p>ABSOLUTE dominion ſhould not be ſought, or if ſought, ſhould not be given to any deſcendant of Adam.—It belongs to the LORD of nature, and to him alone to rule his creatures with uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſway.</p>

BUT as long experience has effectually taught us, that the ſons of men are conſtantly ſeeking to inlarge their power and influence by oppreſſing their brethren, it becomes all public bodies, when they enter into ſociety, to fortify themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the encroachments of their neighbours. And whenever attempts are made on their lives, their properties or liberties, and they find it is not in their power, on juſt and honourable terms, to live peaceably, they may lawfully draw the ſword upon their enemies.</p>
            <p>How far one nation may puniſh the inſolence and abuſes they have received from another, it is ſomewhat difficult to ſay.—When thoſe who have received injuries, and were unwillingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to war become conquerors, they ſhow a greatneſs of mind in the exerciſe of mercy.

            <p>THERE are two more caſes, I would beg leave to mention in which wars may be juſtified on equitible terms.—The firſt is, when the ſubjects, or any conſiderable number of them rebel againſt thoſe rulers who act up to the ſpirit and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſign of the conſtitution they are under.—The ſecond is, when thoſe who are in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment violate the laws they had ſworn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and attempt to oppreſs and inſlave the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom they had ſworn to protect.</p>

CIVIL Government being founded on compact, thoſe who are inveſted with authority, have certain <hi>rights</hi> which may not be invaded, while they keep within the limits preſcribed them, and are the miniſters of GOD for good to the people who appointed them.—Such rulers have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right to an honourable ſupport.—As they devote their time to the ſervice of the people, it may reſonably be expected they will make proviſion for them ſuitable to their rank. But it muſt be remembered the <hi>people</hi> are to Judge what ſhall be given; for, although rulers may think they deſerve more than the people ſeem willing to grant, leſs damages would accrue to the public, from their withholding, in ſome caſes, thoſe grants which they <hi>ought</hi> to make, than from putting it in the power of rulers to ſeize on the property of the ſubjects at pleaſure.</p>

                  <p>When deſpotic monarchs or a few individuals, have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſlave the people in general, they have uſually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prevail with the clergy by ſmiles, and flatteries, and offers of reward, to engage in their baſe deſigns.—And not a little to the diſgrace of the <hi>ſacred order,</hi> many, in ages paſt, have lent a hand to aſſiſt the tyrant in <hi>State,</hi> in hopes, herhaps, of being authoris'd to play the tyrant in the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The clergy in any country may be ſuppoſed to have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable weight: And in days of political controverſy, all ſides no doubt, would be willing to have their influence. But if their <hi>influence</hi> cannot be obtained, the contending parties, at leaſt, will deſire their <hi>ſilence.</hi>—Hence, when any of the clergy venture to mention the duties which rulers owe the people, and give ſome <hi>broad hints</hi> that there is a deſign to deprive them of their juſt rights and liberties, the friends and abbettors of tyranny, have been ſometimes heard to lament with much affected ſeriouſneſs, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of religion become preachers of <hi>politics</hi> inſtead of the <hi>goſpel.</hi>—But it muſt be owned, ſome miniſters, in former days, who were diſtinguiſhed for their piety, and zeal for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, thought it their duty to <hi>acquaint</hi> themſelves, and invite their hearers to look into the nature and deſign of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.—Nor do I ſee, I muſt confeſs, how a miniſter can do his duty in many caſes, if he is <hi>ignorant</hi> or <hi>ſilent</hi> as to theſe matters.</p>
                  <p>There are duties which the magiſtrates owe the people, and there are duties which the people owe the magiſtrates: But a miniſter cannot be faithful, either to the <hi>one,</hi> or to the <hi>other,</hi> unleſs he is capable of judging for himſelf, whether the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates anſwer the deſign of their appointment, or the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are diſpoſed to be properly ſubordinate.</p>
                  <p>Miniſters ought to preach againſt all breaches of the moral law, and no doubt injuſtice, oppreſſion, and tyranny are moral evils, as much as riots, tumults, and licentiouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>That miniſters ought to give <hi>ſome</hi> attention to political mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will farther appear, when we conſider they have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the laws of the land, and are ſubjects of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as well as other men: And among proteſtants, where miniſters are allowed to marry, and have families, it muſt be ſuppoſed they have as tender a concern for poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and are as deſirous of leaving them <hi>free</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> as any of the community, their <hi>rulers</hi> not excepted.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, when I hear people <hi>gravely</hi> pretending that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of religion ſhould never meddle with political matters, I cannot help ſuſpecting they are engaged in ſome bad cauſe which they wiſh to carry without oppoſition.</p>

            <p>It is aſtoniſhing that the advocates for paſſive-obedience and non-reſiſtence, can, with any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable countenance, profeſs their loyalty to George the IIId, ſince they muſt know, that by oppoſing the <hi>ſtuart</hi> family, the Britiſh crown was given to the Houſe of <hi>Hanover.</hi>

            <p>THAT we may and ought, to reſiſt, and even make war againſt thoſe rulers who leap the bounds preſcribed them by the conſtitution, and attempt to oppreſs and inſlave the ſubjects, is a principle on which alone the great revolutions which have taken place in <hi>our</hi> nation can be juſtified. A principle which has been ſupported by the moſt celebrated Divines<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>This principle was adopted by <hi>Luther, Calvin Malancthon, Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglius, Auſtin,</hi> and the reformers in general. St <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> explains thoſe words of our LORD, Matth. XXVI, 52. For all <hi>they that take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword,</hi> in the following manner: <q>For a man to take the ſword, is to draw it when it is not put into his hands by the laws; therefore he who offers unjuſt violence, <hi>takes</hi> the ſword: But on the other hand, he who uſes a juſt defence does not <hi>take</hi> the ſword, but he draws a ſword which the laws put into his hands. And in his commentary on Rom. xiii. 5. <hi>Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject not only for wrath, but for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake;</hi> he ſays, Theſe words do concern not only the <hi>Subject,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> themſelves, who when they turn tyrants do overthrow the ordinance of GOD, no leſs than the ſeditious.

Nova-Scotia, Louiſburg, all Canada, and the french ſettlements on the Lakes, together with the weſtern and ſouthern Indians, ſome among them, whowere unfriendly to the popular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment eſtabliſhed by their fathers, projected a ſcheme for an American revenue, <hi>intentional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to aggrandize themſelves and their connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but <hi>expreſſly,</hi> for making a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and adequate proviſion for defreying the charge of the adminiſtration of juſtice and the ſupport of civil Government.</p>
               <p>THIS plan was laid before the Parliament of Great-Britain; and although oppoſed with great ſpirit, and the cleareſt reaſons by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral illuſtrious members of that auguſt aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,<note n="*" place="bottom">Specimens of the arguments in oppoſition to the intention of Parliament to raiſe a revenue from the Americans may be ſeen in MR.

Several experiments were made to carry this plan into execution which proved unſucceſſful.—That which bid the faireſt was a duty on the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Teas: Large quantities were therefore ſent out under the protection of the Britiſh Miniſtry. The fate which this dutied article met with was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the different colonies to which it was ſent: But the oppoſition was general. At <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> after every poſſible endeavour was uſed to ſave the property of the Eaſt-India com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, by ſending the ſeveral cargoes of tea back which arrived there, and the people

found themſelves unable to do it, unknown perſons, many of them ſuppoſed to be from the neighbouring country, under the cover of night, boarded the ſhips which had brought in the Teas, and emptied every Cheſt into the Sea.</p>
               <p>THIS act of violence on the property of the Eaſt-India company, was ſo highly reſented by the parliament of Great-Britain, that previous to making any demand on the town or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of ſatiſfaction for the Teas which were deſtroyed, an act was ſuddenly paſſed to block up the port of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and put an end to their trade; by which many thouſands of <hi>innocent</hi> people, were immediately deprived of the means of ſubſiſtance, and reduced to the utmoſt degree of poverty and diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>THIS extraordinary act of parliament for blocking up the Port of Boſton, by which moſt grievous pains and penalties were inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the inhabitants, before it was poſſible for them to obtain relief from the crown, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on ſuppoſition of their being ever ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and compliant, gave an alarm to the whole continent.—The cauſe was conſidered as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon one.—A <hi>Congreſs</hi> of the principal inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of all the colonies was held as ſoon as poſſible: The reſult of which was, a quiet and peaceable ſuſpenſion of trade to and from Great-Britain.—Many affluent merchants laid up their ſhips, and turned their attention to manufactures; and in a ſhort time the whole continent was well ſupplied with every neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

               <p>FROM that period we may date the glory of America.

               <p>THEY had indeed made ſeveral noble ſtands againſt what they conſidered as infringements of their conſtitutional rights and privileges; but at length unhappy diviſions took place among the Merchants: The lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men could agree on no plan for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral benefit; and thoſe who expected to reap advantage from the eſtabliſhment of a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, found means to create fatal jealouſies between the ſeveral colonies.—The friends of liberty who remained in thoſe days of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral corruption and venality, finding themſelves unable to ſtand againſt the torrent which bore hard againſt them, were forced to abandon the cauſe; and an oppoſition to ſuch revenue laws as the parliament of Great-Britain

                  <p>In this day of uncommon difficulty, the general enquiry ſeems to be, how ſhall we preſerve our liberties.—extricate ourſelves from our preſent troubles, and lay a foundation for future peace and happineſs?—Perhaps a full anſwer is contained in the following maxim,—SAVE YOUR MONEY, AND YOU SAVE YOUR COUNTRY.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be deemed treason or rebellion for the Americans to determine they will not make uſe of thoſe articles of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance and luxury, which for years paſt have been poured in upon us from Great-Britain.—It cannot be deemed trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or rebellion to deſpiſe the effeminacy of the preſent day, and endeavour to imitate the Patriarchs of this country, in temperance, plainneſs of dreſs, and ſimplicity of manners.—If we look into our old colony Laws we ſhall find the fathers of New-England took prudent care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent unneceſſary expences in dreſs. If any of the common people wore <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver</hi> lace, or other coſtly ornaments which were enumerated, the Select-Men of the towns in which ſuch offences were committed, had authority to aſſeſs them in the country rates at two hundred pounds.—Children or ſervants under government in families, who wore any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel exceeding the condition or quality of their perſons or eſtates, upon conviction, were, for the firſt offence, to be admoniſhed: the ſecond, to pay twenty ſhillings: the third forty ſhillings, and ſo following as the offences were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, to pay forty ſhillings a time to the treaſurer of the county.—Could thoſe venerable fathers, raiſe their heads a moment from their peaceful ſlumbers, and view their ſons and daughters, many of whom can but poorly afford it, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed in coſtly apparel, or tinſal finery of fantaſtick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, methinks, aſhamed of a ſoft &amp; profligate offſpring, they would wiſh to ſhrink back into the darkneſs of death, to hide from their ſight.—</p>
                  <p>It cannot be deemed treaſon to make our own clothes, which we can certainly do in a little time.—It cannot be deemed treaſon to ſave millions ſterling every year.—The Lord of providence has put a price into our hands, and if we are not greatly wanting to ourſelves, we may be <hi>free,</hi> we may be <hi>rich,</hi> we may be the moſt <hi>powerful</hi> people under the heavens.</p>
                  <p>It is to be wiſhed that ſocieties were formed in all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cities and towns on the continent for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of agraculture and manufactures.—Agriculture muſt be conſidered as an <hi>honorable</hi> employ: Parents muſt think more of ſending their ſons out on farms, or of bringing them up to manufactures and mechanical employmens, it they would wiſh to ſee the country rich and happy.</p>

from the beginning in our revolted world, that the art of ſlaying one another has been ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with care, and he who has beſt ſuceeded in deſtroying the enemies of his King and country, has received the higheſt applauſe.</p>
            <p>To hear the alarm of war,—to ſee armies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in battle array,—to obſerve the whole proceſs of a bloody engagement, and take a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the field after the battle is over, muſt be ſhocking to one accuſtomed to the ſweets of retirement and peace.—But on what quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the globe can we travel, without ſeeing either the trophies of war, or the bones of thoſe who were ſlain, "whitening in the Sun."? What country is there on earth unable to furniſh us with a ſtory of victories gained, or battles loſt? In this American world our peace has often been diſturbed. We have been called to fight the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of the wilderneſs. We have alſo tried our ſkill and ſtrength with the troops of France and Spain.</p>
            <p>BUT altho' the nations which gave us diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance from the firſt ſettlement of our fathers in this land are now at peace with us, we may not expect that peace will continue always.</p>
            <p>NORTH-AMERICA is of great importance. The eyes of Europe are fixed upon us, and whatever powers on the other ſide the Atlantic, are, either in alliance with us, or have the dominion over us, muſt find our trade or obedience of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſequence. As we grow into impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it is more than probable, ſome foreign

powers, either through Jealouſy of our increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing greatneſs,—a deſire to ſecure the profits of our commerce, or to draw from us a revenue by duties and taxes, in ſome future time will make war upon us.</p>
            <p>FRANCE and Spain cannot well put up with their loſſes in America the laſt war.—The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they think themſelves able they will, no doubt, endeavour to take ſatiſfaction; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps attempt to add this whole continent to their dominions.</p>
            <p>CONSIDERING the reſtleſs tempers of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, and the diſpoſition which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world have diſcovered to encroach on the rights and liberties of one another, a wiſe and prudent people, even in a time of peace, will be laying up ſtores, erecting places of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and uſing themſelves to arms and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</p>
            <p>AMERICA has every natural advantage that can be deſired. We have a <q>continent of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles in length, and of a breadth as yet unexplored, in which however it is ſuppoſed, there are five millions of people.</q>

BUT a well diſciplined militia, compoſed of men of fortunes, of education, and virtue, when called to the field of battle, feel themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to the moſt vigorous action, by motives infinitely ſuperior to the expectation of ſpoils taken from their enemies, or the wages which the maſters of mercenary troops engage to pay them.—They fight <hi>pro aris &amp; focis:</hi> They fight for their fathers and mothers,—for their wives and children,—for their private property,—for their liberty,—their religion, and the honour of their GOD.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH mercenary troops have been uſed to anſwer great purpoſes, it muſt alſo be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, they have been the inſtruments of the greateſt tyranny and oppreſſion.—A deſpotic monarch who is able to ſupport a large army of ſuch troops, may force his ſubjects to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the moſt arbitrary meaſures, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the thought of being abſolute in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>A deſpotic Prince, who has large armies at his command will find more expeditious ways of raiſing money to ſupport them, than by aſking a Parliament to grant regular ſupplies; <q>For it is as certain that an army will raiſe money, as that money will raiſe an army.—To limit a Prince with <hi>Laws</hi> where there is an army, is to bind <hi>Sampſon</hi> with his locks on.</q>

            <p>STANDING armies in general, in a time of peace, have been judged extremely dangerous to a free ſtate. And when they have been quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among people, on whom they had no
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013371_0036_0F90ECC072F42C98"/>
dependence for their ſupport, the conſequences, in many inſtances, have been intolerable.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>The ſhocking conſequences of quartering troops in <hi>this Town</hi> a few years ago, are too many to be rehearſed in a marginal note.—They came on a moſt diſagreeable buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,—They were taught to conſider us as rebels againſt the Crown and Government of Great-Britain.—This gave them a kind of licence to abuſe the inhabitants, which they did, in a variety of inſtances, and that with <hi>impunity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Grand-jury of the county, found a bill againſt one of the officers, for adviſing the negro-ſlaves to cut their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters throats, and he promiſed them protection! but howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver black the crime was, he was not ſo much as brought to a trial!—Riotous ſoldiers were apprehended, but reſcued by other parties, and the peace officers were ſcandalouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, and inſulted, in the execution of their duty!</p>
                  <p>Thus matters went on till the evening of the fifth of March 1770. when <hi>Captain Preſton</hi> led out a party of the 29th Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, who, without any orders from a Magiſtrate, fired upon a number of unarmed people in the open ſtreet, by which, five of our fellow citizens were barbarouſly ſlain, and ſeveral others badly wounded:—The inhabitants then thought it was time to have the point ſettled, whether they, or the troops, ſhould be maſters of the town; and it was happy for both, that the latter peaceably retired to the <hi>Caſtle.</hi>

            <p>THE nature of military Government is ſo different from the laws of a popular civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, that experience has ſufficiently proved, they cannot be well united together.—And thoſe princes who have attempted to inforce oppreſſive edicts with the point of the ſword, have always loſt the affections of the ſubjects, and provoked them either to <hi>reſiſt,</hi> or abandon a kind of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to which reaſon and conſcience, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them to ſubmit.</p>
            <p>As the means of defence are neceſſary in all kingdoms and ſtates, and the ſupport of large

ſtanding armies in a time of peace is not only attended with a great expence, but is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the community in general, care ſhould be taken to diſcipline the militia, and prepare them to take the field on the moſt ſudden emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies.</p>
            <p>THE neceſſity of preparing for unavoidable war, is ſufficiently evident.—</p>
            <p>BUT we cannot cloſe the ſubject without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting thoſe moral diſorders which are the ſource of wars and fightings; and expreſſing our moſt ardent wiſhes for univerſal peace.—And while we are ſtudying the art of war, and endeavouring to prepare for defence againſt a common enemy, let us ſhow to all who obſerve us, that we are the loyal ſubjects of CHRIST; and that in obedience to his precepts, we will never draw our ſword in an unrighteous cauſe, whatever promiſes of honour, preferment, or riches, may poſſibly be made us as a reward.</p>
            <p>LET us inliſt ourſelves under the banner of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, and having fought "the good fight of faith, and finiſhed our courſe," GOD grant we may be admitted into his glorious kingdom, where the laws of righteouſneſs ſhall never be violated and the children of peace ſhall never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed.</p>
