            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>YOUR deſign in the appointment of this ceremony, <hi>my Friends, and Fellow-Townſmen,</hi> cannot fail to be examined in quite different lights at this ſeaſon of political diſſention. From the principles I profeſs, and in the exerciſe of my common right to judge with others, I conclude it was <hi>decent, wiſe, and honorable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The certainty of being favoured with your kindeſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and candor, in a poor attempt to execute the part to which you have invited me, has overcome the objection of my inability to perform it in a proper manner; and I now beg the favor of your animating countenance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:012099_0005_0F89C4A6B77FEE78"/>
The horrid bloody ſcene we here commemorate, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were the cauſes which concurred to bring it on that dreadful night, muſt lead the pious and humane of every order to ſome ſuitable reflections. The pious will adore the conduct of that BEING who is unſearchable in all his ways, and without whoſe knowledge not a ſingle ſparrow falls, in permitting an immortal ſoul to be hurried by the flying ball, the meſſenger of death, in the twinkling of an eye, to meet the awful Judge of all it's ſecret actions. The humane, from having often thought with pleaſing rapture on the endearing ſcenes of ſocial life, in all it's amiable relations, will lament with heart-felt pangs their ſudden diſſolution by the indiſcretion, rage and vengeance of unruly human paſſions.</p>
            <p>But let us leave that ſhocking cloſe of one continued courſe of rancor and diſpute from the firſt moment that the troops arrived in town: that courſe will now be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by your own reflexions to much more ſolid, uſeful purpoſe than by any artful language. I hope, however, that Heaven has yet in ſtore ſuch happineſs, for this afflicted town and province, as will in time wear out the memory of all our former troubles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:012099_0006_0F89C4A7D01A21A0"/>
I ſincerely rejoice with you in the happy event of your ſteady and united effort to prevent a ſecond tragedy.</p>
            <p>Our fathers left their native land, riſqued all the dangers of the ſea, and came to this then-ſavage deſart, with that true undaunted courage which is excited by a confidence in GOD. They came that they might here enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and leave to their poſterity the beſt of earthly por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, full <hi>Engliſh Liberty.</hi> You ſhowed upon the alarming call for tryal that their brave ſpirit ſtill exiſts in vigor, tho' their legacy of rights is much impaired. The ſympathy and active friendſhip of ſome neighboring towns upon that ſad occaſion commands the higheſt gratitude of this.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen and felt the ill effects of placing ſtanding forces in the midſt of <hi>populous</hi> communities; but thoſe are only what individuals ſuffer. Your vote directs me to point out the fatal tendency of placing ſuch an order in <hi>free</hi> cities—fatal indeed! <hi>Athens</hi> once was free; a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, a favorite of the people, by an artful ſtory gained a trifling guard of fifty men; ambition taught him ways to enlarge that number; he deſtroyed the commonwealth
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012099_0007_0F89C4A809B4A650"/>
and made himſelf the tyrant of the <hi>Athenians. Caeſar</hi> by the length of his command in <hi>Gaul</hi> got the affections of his army, marched to <hi>Rome,</hi> overthrew the ſtate, and made himſelf perpetual dictator. By the ſame inſtruments, many leſs republics have been made to fall a prey to the devouring jaws of tyrants—But, this is a ſubject which ſhould never be diſguiſed with figures; it chuſes the plain ſtile of diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>The true ſtrength and ſafety of every commonwealth or limited monarchy, is the bravery of its freeholders, its mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. By brave militias they riſe to grandeur, and they come to ruin by a mercenary army. This is founded on hiſtorical facts; and the ſame cauſes will, in ſimilar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, forever produce the ſame effects. Juſtice <hi>Blackſtone,</hi> in his inimitably clear commentaries, tells us, that "it is extremely dangerous in a land of liberty, to make a diſtinct order of the profeſſion of arms; that ſuch an order is an object of jealouſly; and that <hi>the laws and conſtitution of England are ſtrangers to it."</hi> One article of the Bill of Rights is, that the raiſing or keeping a ſtanding army within the kingdom in a time of peace, unleſs it be with conſent
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012099_0008_0F89C4A8C1C2DDE0"/>
of parliament, is againſt law. The preſent army therefore, tho' called the peace <hi>eſtabliſhment,</hi> is kept up by one act, and governed by another; both of which expire <hi>annually.</hi> This circumſtance is valued as a ſufficient <hi>check</hi> upon the army. A leſs body of troops than is now maintained has, on a time, deſtroyed a King, and fought under a parliament with great ſucceſs and glory; but, upon a motion to disband them, they turned their maſters out of doors, and fixed up others in their ſtead. Such wild things are not again to happen, becauſe the parliament have power to ſtop pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment once a year: but, <hi>arma tenenti quis neget?</hi> which may be eaſily interpreted, "who will bind <hi>Sampſon</hi> with his locks on?"<note n="*" place="bottom">Trenchard.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The bill which regulates the army, the ſame fine author I have mentioned ſays, "is <hi>in many reſpects haſtily penned,</hi> and reduces the ſoldier to a ſtate of ſlavery in the midſt of a free nation. This is impolitick: for ſlaves envy the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of others, and take a malicious pleaſure in contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſtroy it."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:012099_0009_0F89C4A98DCCDE10"/>
By this ſcandalous bill a juſtice of peace is empowered to grant, <hi>without a previous oath</hi> from the military officer, a warrant to break open any (freeman's) houſe, upon <hi>pretence</hi> of ſearching for deſerters.</p>
            <p>I muſt not omit to mention one more bad tendency: 'tis this,—a ſtanding force leads to a total neglect of militias, or tends greatly to diſcourage them.</p>
            <p>You ſee the danger of a ſtanding army to the cauſe of freedom. If the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament conſents from year to year to be expoſed, it doubtleſs has good reaſons. But when did <hi>our</hi> aſſembly paſs an act to hazard all the property, the liberty and lives of their conſtituents? What check have <hi>we</hi> upon a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Army? Can <hi>we</hi> disband it? Can <hi>we</hi> ſtop it's pay?</p>
            <p>Our own aſſemblies in <hi>America</hi> can raiſe an army; and <hi>our</hi> Monarch, George the 3d. by our conſtitution takes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate command. This army can <hi>conſent</hi> to leave their native provinces. Will the royal chief commander ſend

them to find barracks at <hi>Brunſwick</hi> or <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> at <hi>Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> or <hi>the commodious hall of Weſtminſter?</hi> Suppoſe the laſt—Suppoſe this army was informed, nay <hi>thought</hi> the parliament in actual rebellion, or only on the <hi>eve</hi> of one againſt their King, or againſt <hi>thoſe who paid and cloathed them</hi>—for there it pinches:—We are <hi>rebels againſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi>—we adore the King.</p>
            <p>Where, in the caſe I have ſtated, would be the value of the boaſted <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution?</p>
            <p>Who are a free people? Not thoſe who do not ſuffer actual oppreſſion; but thoſe who have a <hi>conſtitutional check upon the power</hi> to oppreſs.</p>
            <p>We are ſlaves or freemen; if, as we are called, the laſt, where is our check upon the following powers, <hi>France, Spain,</hi> the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> or <hi>the Britiſh 'Parliament?</hi> Now if any one of theſe (and it is quite immaterial which) has right to make the two acts in queſtion operate within this province, they have right to give us up to an unlimited army, under the ſole direction of one <hi>Saracen</hi> Commander.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:012099_0011_0F89C4AAF99E5208"/>
Thus I have led your thoughts to <hi>that</hi> upon which I formed my concluſion, that the deſign of this ceremony was <hi>decent, wiſe</hi> and <hi>honorable.</hi> Make the bloody 5th of <hi>March</hi> the AEra of the reſurrection of your birthrights, which have been murdered by the very ſtrength that nurſed them in their infancy. I had an eye <hi>ſolely</hi> to parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſupremacy; and I hope you will think every other view beneath your notice in our preſent moſt alarming ſituation.</p>

her <hi>legal</hi> right over this province",<note n="‡" place="bottom">I confine myſelf to this province, partly from ignorance of other charters; but more from a deſire even to <hi>vex</hi> ſome abler pen to purſue the idea of CHECK: which an <hi>un</hi> chartered FREEMAN may do, as well as any other in <hi>America.</hi>
               </note> yet <hi>we muſt aſſert it.</hi> Thoſe I have named are mighty characters, but <hi>they</hi> wanted one advantage providence has given <hi>us.</hi> The <hi>beam</hi> is carried off from our eyes by the flowing blood of our fellow citizens, and now we may be allowed to attempt to remove the <hi>mote</hi> from the eyes of our exalted patrons. That mote, we think, is nothing but <hi>our obligation to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land firſt, and afterwards Great-Britain, for conſtant kind protection of our lives and birthrights againſt foreign dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> We all acknowledge that protection.</p>
            <p>Let us once more look into the early hiſtory of this province. We find that our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Anceſtors diſguſted in their native country at a <hi>Legiſlation,</hi> which they ſaw was ſacrificing all their rights, <hi>left its Juriſdiction</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Haec ſunt enim fundamenta firmiſſima noſtrae libertatis, ſui quemque juris et retinendi et dimittendi eſſe dominum. <bibl>Cic.</bibl>
               </note>, and ſought, like wandering birds of paſſage, ſome happier climate. Here at length they ſettled down. The King of <hi>England</hi> was ſaid to be the royal<note n="‖" place="bottom">I chuſe to bury a fruitful ſubject for any ſatyrical genius of the family of PENN.</note> landlord of this territory; with
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012099_0013_0F89C4AC765CB7B0"/>
HIM they entered into mutual ſacred compact, by which the price of tenure and the <hi>rules of management</hi> were fairly ſtated. It is in this compact that we find OUR ONLY TRUE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY.</p>
            <p>I might here enlarge upon the character of thoſe firſt ſettlers, men of whom the world was little worthy; who, for a long courſe of years, aſſiſted by no earthly power, defended their liberty, their religion and their lives againſt the greateſt inland danger from the ſavage natives:—but this falls not within my preſent purpoſe. They were ſecure by ſea.</p>
            <p>In our infancy, when not an over-tempting jewel for the <hi>Bourbon</hi> Crown the very <hi>name</hi> of ENGLAND ſaved us; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her <hi>fleets and armies.</hi> We wiſh not to depreciate the worth of that protection. Of our gold, yea of our moſt fine gold, we will freely <hi>give</hi> a part. Our fathers would have done the ſame. But, muſt we fall down and cry "let not a ſtranger rob and kill me, O my father! let
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012099_0014_0F89C4AD42C39888"/>
me rather dye by the hand of my brother, and let him <hi>raviſh</hi> all my portion?<note n="§" place="bottom">—ita vitam corpuſque ſervato, ita fortunas, ita rem familiarem, ut haec <hi>poſteriora</hi> libertate ducas,—nec pro his libertatem, ſed pro libertate haec projicias, tanquam pignora injuriae.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid that diſunited from <hi>Britain</hi> "we ſhould bleed at every vein". I cannot ſee the conſequence. The <hi>States of Holland</hi> do not ſuffer thus. But grant it true, SENACA, would prefer the LAUNCETS of <hi>France, Spain</hi> or any other power to the BOW-STRING, tho' applied by the fair hand of <hi>Britannia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The declarative vote of the <hi>Britiſh Parliament</hi> is the death-warrant of <hi>our</hi> birthrights, and wants only a Czariſh King to put it into execution. <hi>Here</hi> then a door of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is open. <hi>Great Britain</hi> may raiſe <hi>her</hi> fleets and armies, but it is only <hi>our own</hi> King that can direct their fire down upon our heads. He is gracious, but not omniſcient. He is ready to hear our APPEALS in their proper courſe; and knowing himſelf, tho' the moſt powerful prince on earth, yet, a ſubject under a divine conſtitution of LAW,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012099_0015_0F89C4AE62E10BF0"/>
that law he <hi>will</hi> aſk and receive from the twelve Judges of <hi>England.</hi> Theſe will prove that the claim of the <hi>Britiſh Parliament</hi> over <hi>us</hi> is not only ILLEGAL IN ITSELF, but A DOWN-RIGHT USURPATION OF HIS PREROGATIVE as KING OF <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A brave nation is always generous. Let us appeal therefore, at the ſame time, to the generoſity of the PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> before the tribunal<note n="*" place="bottom">I do not think the QUO WARRANTO againſt our firſt charter was tried in a proper court.</note> of <hi>Europe,</hi> not to envy <hi>us</hi> the full enjoyment of the RIGHTS OF BRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THREN.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>my Friends and Fellow Townſmen,</hi> having declared myſelf an <hi>American</hi> Son of Liberty of true charter-principles; having ſhewn the critical and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſituation of our birthrights, and the true courſe for ſpeedy redreſs; I ſhall take the freedom to recommend with boldneſs one previous ſtep.—Let us ſhow we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the true value of what we are claiming.</p>

The patriot <hi>Farmer</hi> tells us, "the cauſe of LIBERTY is a cauſe of too much dignity to be ſullied by turbulence and tumult.—Anger produces anger; and differences, that might be accommodated by kind and reſpectful behaviour, may by imprudence be enlarged to an incurable rage. In quarrels—riſen to a certain height, the firſt cauſe of diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no longer remembered, the minds of the parties being wholly engaged in recollecting and reſenting the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual expreſſions of their diſlike. When feuds have reached that fatal point, conſiderations of reaſon and equity vaniſh; and a blind fury governs, or rather confounds all things. A people no longer regard their intereſt, but a gratification of their wrath."</p>
            <p>We know ourſelves ſubjects of common LAW: to <hi>that</hi> and the worthy <hi>executors</hi> of it let us pay a ſteady and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious regard. Paſt errors in this point have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with gall by the pen of MALICE. May our future conduct be ſuch as to make even that vile IMP lay her pen aſide.</p>

The <hi>Right</hi> which impoſes <hi>Duties</hi> upon us is in diſpute: but whether they are managed by a <hi>Surveyor General,</hi> a <hi>Board of Commiſſioners, Turkiſh Janizaries</hi> or <hi>Ruſſian Coſſacks,</hi> let them enjoy, during our time of fair tryal, the common perſonal protection of the laws of our conſtitution. Let us ſhut our eyes, for the preſent, to their being <hi>executors of claims ſubverſive of our rights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Watchful hawkeyed JEALOUSY ever guards the portal of the temple of the GODDESS LIBERTY. This is known to thoſe who frequent her altars. Our whole conduct therefore, I am ſure, will meet with the utmoſt candor of her VOTARIES: but I am wiſhing we may be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert even her baſeſt APOSTATES.</p>
            <p>We are SLAVES 'till we obtain ſuch <hi>redreſs</hi> thro' the juſtice of our King as our happy <hi>conſtitution leads us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</hi> In that condition, let us behave with the propriety and dignity of FREEMEN; and <hi>thus</hi> exhibit to the world a new character of a people which no hiſtory deſcribes.</p>
