            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM fully ſenſible of the greatneſs of that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which I take with you on the preſent occaſion; a liberty which ſeemed to me ſcarcely allowable, when I reflected on that diſtinguiſhed and dignified ſtation in which you ſtand, and the almoſt general prejudice and prepoſſeſſion, which is ſo prevalent in the world againſt thoſe of my complexion.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it is a truth too well atteſted to you, to need a proof here, that we are a race of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, who have long labored under the abuſe and cenſure of the world; that we have long been
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024074_0003_0FC31B4C27315340"/>
looked upon with an eye of contempt; and that we have long been conſidered rather as brutiſh than human, and ſcarcely capable of mental en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments.</p>
            <p>Sir, I hope I may ſafely admit, in conſequence of that report which hath reached me, that you are a man far leſs inflexible in ſentiments of this nature, than many others; that you are meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably friendly, and well diſpoſed towards us; and that you are willing and ready to lend your aid and aſſiſtance to our relief, from thoſe many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and numerous calamities, to which we are reduced.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, if this is founded in truth, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend you will embrace every opportunity, to era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate that train of abſurd and falſe ideas and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which ſo generally prevails with reſpect to us; and that your ſentiments are concurrent with mine, which are, that one univerſal Father hath given being to us all; and that he hath not only made us all of one fleſh, but that he hath alſo, without partiality, afforded us all the ſame ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and endowed us all with the ſame faculties; and that however variable we may be in ſociety
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024074_0004_0FC31B4E12417A28"/>
or religion, however diverſified in ſituation or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, we are all of the ſame family, and ſtand in the ſame relation to him.</p>
            <p>Sir, if theſe are ſentiments of which you are fully perſuaded, I hope you cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it is the indiſpenſible duty of thoſe, who maintain for themſelves the rights of human nature, and who poſſeſs the obligations of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, to extend their power and influence to the relief of every part of the human race, from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever burden or oppreſſion they may unjuſtly labor under; and this, I apprehend, a full conviction of the truth and obligation of theſe principles ſhould lead all to.</p>
            <p>Sir, I have long been convinced, that if your love for yourſelves, and for thoſe ineſtimable laws, which preſerved to you the rights of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was founded on ſincerity, you could not but be ſolicitous, that every individual, of whatever rank or diſtinction, might with you equally enjoy the bleſſings thereof; neither could you reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſhort of the moſt active effuſion of your exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in order to their promotion from any ſtate
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024074_0005_0FC31B56281C0160"/>
of degradation, to which the unjuſtifiable cruelty and barbariſm of men may have reduced them.</p>
            <p>Sir, I freely and cheerfully acknowledge, that I am of the African race, and in that color which is natural to them of the deepeſt dye; and it is under a ſenſe of the moſt profound gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of the Univerſe, that I now confeſs to you, that I am not under that ſtate of tyrannical thraldom; and inhuman captivity, to which too many of my brethren are doomed, but that I have abundantly taſted of the fruition of thoſe bleſſings, which proceed from that free and unequalled liberty with which you are favored; and which, I hope, you will willingly allow you have mercifully received, from the immediate hand of that Being, from whom proceedeth every good and perfect Gift.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſuffer me to recal to your mind that time, in which the arms and tyranny of the Britiſh crown were exerted, with every powerful effort, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to reduce you to a ſtate of ſervitude: look back, I entreat you, on the variety of dangers to which you were expoſed; reflect on that time, in which every human aid appeared unavailable, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024074_0006_0FC31B5B8900C388"/>
in which even hope and fortitude wore the aſpect of inability to the conflict, and you cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> led to a ſerious and grateful ſenſe of your mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and providential preſervation; you cannot but acknowledge, that the preſent freedom and tranquility which you enjoy you have mercifully received, and that it is the peculiar bleſſing of Heaven.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, was a time when you cleary ſaw into the injuſtice of a ſtate of ſlavery, and in which you had juſt apprehenſions of the horrors of its condition. It was now that your abhorrence thereof was ſo excited, that you publicly held forth this true and invaluable doctrine, which is worthy to be recorded and remembered in all ſucceeding ages: "We hold theſe truths to be ſelf-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among theſe are, life, liberty, and the purſuit of happineſs."</p>
            <p>Here was a time, in which your tender feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for yourſelves had engaged you thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, you were then impreſſed with proper ideas of the great violation of liberty, and the free poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024074_0007_0FC31B60181ADA48"/>
of thoſe bleſſings, to which you were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled by nature; but, Sir, how pitiable is it to reflect, that although you were ſo fully convinced of the benevolence of the Father of Mankind, and of his equal and impartial diſtribution of theſe rights and privileges, which he hath conferred upon them, that you ſhould at the ſame time counteract his mercies, in detaining by fraud and violence ſo numerous a part of my brethren, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der groaning captivity and cruel oppreſſion, that you ſhould at the ſame time be found guilty of that moſt criminal act, which you profeſſedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted in others, with reſpect to yourſelves.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe that your knowledge of the ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my brethren, is too extenſive to need a recital here; neither ſhall I preſume to preſcribe methods by which they may be relieved, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by recommending to you and all others, to wean yourſelves from thoſe narrow prejudices which you have imbibed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to them, and as Job propoſed to his friends, "put your ſoul in their ſouls' ſtead;" thus ſhall your hearts be enlarged with kindneſs and benevolence towards them; and thus ſhall
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024074_0008_0FC31B6208224E50"/>
you need neither the direction of myſelf or others, in what manner to proceed herein.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, although my ſympathy and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for my brethren hath cauſed my enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus far, I ardently hope, that your candor and generoſity will plead with you in my behalf, when I make known to you, that it was not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally my deſign; but having taken up my pen in order to direct to you, as a preſent, a copy of an Almanac, which I have calculated for the ſucceeding year, I was unexpectedly and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably led thereto.</p>
            <p>This calculation is the production of my ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtudy, in this my advanced ſtage of life; for having long had unbounded deſires to become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſecrets of nature, I have had to gratify my curioſity herein, through my own aſſiduous application to Aſtronomical Study, in which I need not recount to you the many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and diſadvantages, which I have had to encounter.</p>
            <p>And although I had almoſt declined to make my calculation for the enſuing year, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024074_0009_0FC31B6A30AEE7E8"/>
of that time which I had allotted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, being taken up at the Federal Territory, by the requeſt of Mr. Andrew Ellicott, yet finding myſelf under ſeveral engagements to Printers of this ſtate, to whom I had communicated my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, on my return to my place of reſidence, I induſtriouſly applied myſelf thereto, which I hope I have accompliſhed with correctneſs and accura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; a copy of which I have taken the liberty to direct to you, and which I humbly requeſt you will favorably receive; and although you may have the opportunity of peruſing it after its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, yet I chooſe to ſend it to you in manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript previous thereto, that thereby you might not only have an earlier inſpection, but that you might alſo view it in my own hand writing.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I ſhall conclude, and ſubſcribe myſelf, with the moſt profound reſpect,</p>

No body wiſhes more than I do, to ſee ſuch proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to thoſe of the other colors of men; and that the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the want of them, is owing merely to the degraded condition of their exiſtence, both in Africa and America. I can add with truth, that no body wiſhes more ardently to ſee a good ſyſtem commenced, for raiſing the condition, both of their body and mind, to what it ought to be, as far as the imbecility of their preſent exiſtence, and other circumſtances, which cannot be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, will admit.</p>

His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to ſend him to an obſcure ſchool, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic, as far as double poſition; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has ſupported himſelf ever ſince, by means of oeconomy and conſtant labor, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a fair reputation.

not to read and acquire knowledge, from writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of genius and diſcovery, for of ſuch he had none, but to digeſt and apply, as occaſions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at ſchool. This kind of mental exerciſe formed his chief amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſoon gave him a facility in calculation that was often ſerviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Meſſrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the uſeful mechanics. It is about three years ſince Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguſon's Aſtronomy, Leadbeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Lunar Tables, and ſome Aſtronomic Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but without accompanying them with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hint or inſtruction, that might further his ſtudies, or lead him to apply them to any uſeful reſult. Theſe books and inſtruments, the firſt of the kind he had ever ſeen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his leiſure in Aſtronomical Reſearches.</p>
            <p>He now took up the idea of the calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for an Almanac, and actually completed an entire ſet for the laſt year, upon his original

ſtock of Arithmetic. Encouraged by this firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he begun and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed without the leaſt information or aſſiſtance from any perſon, or other books than thoſe I have mentioned; ſo that whatever merit is attached to his preſent performance, is excluſively and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly his own.</p>
            <p>I have been the more careful to inveſtigate thoſe particulars, and to aſcertain their reality, as they form an intereſting fact in the Hiſtory of Man; and as you may want them to gratify cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, I have no objection to your ſelecting them for your account of Benjamin.</p>
