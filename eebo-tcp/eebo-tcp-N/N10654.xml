            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>"CONSIDERATIONS ON THE PRESENT STATE OF <hi>VIRGINIA"</hi> EXAMINED.</head>
            <p>THAT the Author of <hi>this little Performance</hi> was <hi>born</hi> in <hi>Virginia,</hi> I ſhall not queſtion, ſince he has been pleaſed to tell us the Fact was <hi>really</hi> ſo. It ſeems equally immaterial whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Principles,</hi> in which he was nurtured, were of a mixed or <hi>ſimple</hi> Nature, as it muſt be obvious that <hi>one Kind</hi> of thoſe <hi>Principles</hi> ſolely predominates at preſent and has given his Mind a ſtrange and unaccountable <hi>Bias.</hi> The perfect Enjoyment of his private <hi>Freedom</hi> in thinking for himſelf, and offering his <hi>Sentiments</hi> to this Country upon every Occaſion, I wiſh not to interrupt; but he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, if I ſhould differ with him in Opinion, as to his being ſo <hi>devoted a Servant</hi> to the Welfare of this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as he profeſſes himſelf. Whether the <hi>Serenity</hi> of my Mind or the <hi>Soundneſs</hi> of my Underſtanding will juſtify me in offering myſelf a <hi>Candidate</hi> for a <hi>Seat</hi> in his <hi>excluſive Judicature,</hi> I will not determine; all I ſhall engage for is, that I will not be <hi>clamorous.</hi> The preſent diſtreſſed Situation of Virginia is what all good Men muſt heartily lament; but I hope he does not mean to inſinuate that we have <hi>wantonly</hi> drawn any of theſe Misfortunes on ourſelves. He ſhould recollect his Latin Adage, "<hi>Jus ſuum cuique tribuere,</hi>" that "<hi>Foundation of ſocial Duties,</hi>" to which, without Doubt, he hath religiouſly conformed in every Inſtance. Popular Odium, the Weight of which he is ſo very ſenſible of, it is
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013500_0004_0F90FA2F00894C70"/>
far from my Intention to excite againſt him; but I am more ſtrongly impelled to diſpute his great <hi>Indifference</hi> about an Office, "ſhould he poſſeſs one," ſo very precarious in its <hi>Tenure.</hi> My ſole View is to put my Countrymen a little more on their Guard, and to remove, if I can, thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable Impreſſions, he has laboured to make on the Minds of <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſome Men have unwarrantably and unjuſtly, in the Author's Opinion, aſſumed to themſelves that "moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and honourable Appellation" of a PATRIOT, perhaps there may be found, in the World, other <hi>Characters</hi> equally exceptionable. I do not wiſh to limit his Ardour and the Overflowings of his Zeal for the Good of his Country; but would gladly be informed to what Purpoſe, on the preſent Occaſion, the Public is entertained with ſo many <hi>trite</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the Nature of the Britiſh Conſtitution; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to give them this Name, becauſe they have been ſo repeatedly rung in our Ears, that the mereſt <hi>Scioliſt,</hi> the verieſt Smatterer in Politicks muſt long ſince have had them all by Rote. It is devoutly to be wiſhed that the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Country were aſſimilated in every eſſential Point to that of Great Britain; I mean ſo long as this can be maintained upon its juſt, original Principles. Our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, however, ſuch as it is, hath ſuffered no <hi>internal</hi> Violation, that I know of. Infringements of this Sort ſeem peculiar to <hi>another Meridian</hi>; had they gained Ground amongſt us, perhaps we might not have been left entirely without an Apology, conſidering the <hi>Force of Example,</hi> and this held out by thoſe, who affect to be ſo much our Superiors. If the <hi>uncontroulable</hi> and <hi>unlimited Power</hi> claimed by PARLIAMENT over the Colonies is diſputed on <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>conſtitutional Principles,</hi> this ſurely is exceedingly wide of what the Author would inſinuate. That the Prerogative of the King, "exiſts here in its fulleſt <hi>Luſtre</hi> and <hi>Vigour,</hi>" and that it ever ought to do ſo, is what we chearfully
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013500_0005_0F90FA2FEE116178"/>
acknowledge and earneſtly contend for; but the plain Inference which the Author would have drawn from his Obſervations, if he intends any Thing <hi>material,</hi> is that, by diſputing the <hi>Power of Parliament,</hi> we draw into Queſtion the PREROGATIVE of our moſt gracious <hi>Sovereign</hi>; than which, nothing can be more contrary to the Sentiments and Wiſhes of all America.</p>
            <p>It ſeems that every One, who doth not adopt the Author's Principles, is to be conſidered as a <hi>deſigning Man</hi> and muſt no longer expect to be honoured with any Share of his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. Hard and cruel Fate!</hi> but we muſt endeavour to bear up under it, as well as we can.</p>
            <p>That the unhappy Diſpute, now ſubſiſting between Great Britain and the Colonies, is of a very intereſting Nature muſt be acknowledged by every Well-wiſher to either Country. Viewing it in its extenſive dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, I believe few have been more affected by the gloomy Proſpect than myſelf; it hath even <hi>harrowed up my very Soul.</hi> The Reflection, that we live in a State of Diſcord with our Fellow Subjects, whom we formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and ſtill wiſh to eſteem as our deareſt Friends; and, above all, the Horrors, which every American muſt feel from an Apprehenſion that the Mind of his gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign may have been impreſſed with Ideas of a Diſrepect and Want of Loyalty in his Subjects, muſt be extremely afflicting. I will venture to expreſs it as my firm and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt Belief that there can be found in no Part of his Majeſty's Dominions a warmer and more cordial Attachment to his ſacred Perſon and Government, than prevails throughout the Continent of America; for myſelf I will ſpeak with ſtill greater Confidence and ſay that, had I a Window in my Breaſt, and his Majeſty could deign to look into it, he would there ſee a Heart glowing with the <hi>pureſt Sentiments of Duty and Affection.</hi> Oppreſſed, however, as we are by
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013500_0006_0F90FA30A607B7C0"/>
ſo weighty a Burthen, we nevertheleſs ought not, we cannot loſe Sight of what is due to our Country, ourſelves, and our Poſterity.</p>
            <p>The Author tells us of his Perſuaſion that the Diſpute may be
<q>adjuſted without Noiſe; and the public Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity again reſtored, if Gentlemen would purſue thoſe Meaſures, which are likely to effect what is every Man's Wiſh to obtain.</q>
Let him propoſe thoſe Meaſures; ſo far from being <hi>noiſy,</hi> I will become all <hi>Attention,</hi> and catch, with <hi>Avidity,</hi> the delightful Accents, as they drop from his mellifluous Tongue. If
<q>the Wiſdom of his Counſels ſhould be able to effect this deſirable End, his Memory ſhall be gratefully perpetuated in the Hearts of all his Countrymen,</q>
and, to the whole Continent of America, he ſhall become the Great Apollo. What he may have, in Reſerve to be offered, when he inclines to "deſcend to Particulars," I will not preſume to anticipate. I muſt for the preſent, take Leave to examine, a little, thoſe
<q>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Means,</q>
he has been pleaſed to recommend.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We ought, it is ſaid, in the firſt Place, to declare, in the moſt public Manner, that the Act of the Boſtonians in deſtroying the Property of the Eaſt India Company was illegal and ought not to be countenanced. This will evince our Uprightneſs and ſerve as an Admonition to thoſe headſtrong People never to go to the ſame Lengths again. Then let us petition his Majeſty; aſſure him of our inviolable Attachment to his Perſon and Government and implore his Royal Interpoſition in procuring a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of thoſe Acts, which have excited ſuch an Alarm amongſt us; and, when abrogated, will quiet the Minds of his moſt faithful Subjects in America.</q>
I never have, nor will I ever attempt to juſtify the Boſtonians or any others in Acts of Violence or Intemperance; nor can I preſume to join, in a public Condemnation of them, without being
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013500_0007_0F90FA32008FCC80"/>
convinced of their Guilt. In ſhort, I cannot form a proper Judgment without being fully poſſeſſed of their Cauſe and a thorough Knowledge of the Motives of their Conduct. <hi>Wantonly</hi> and <hi>unjuſtly</hi> to deſtroy the Property of another, I hold in utter Abhorrence; but I can eaſily ſuppoſe an Act of Oppreſſion, which will juſtify a Sufferer in the Execution of every Means neceſſary for his Security. Whether the Boſtonians were reduced to ſuch an Extremity I will not determine. Juſtifying or condemning them are very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Conſiderations from the Opinion we form of the Proceedings of Parliament. Each of theſe will be more diſtinctly and properly remarked upon, when I come to take a View of other Parts of the Work. I ſhould be glad, however, in the mean Time, to know who are particularly meant by the <hi>Boſtonians.</hi> If, when we are invited to a general <hi>Proſcription</hi> of thoſe unhappy People, it is intended that we ſhould condemn them in a <hi>Lump,</hi> the <hi>Innocent</hi> with the <hi>Guilty,</hi> the Author ſurely muſt give up every Pretence to thoſe Principles of Juſtice, he would fain have us believe him ſo much in Love with. If, on the other Hand, he means that we ſhould condemn the <hi>Guilty</hi> only, why were they not diſcriminated? This perhaps would not have laid a proper Groundwork for the Petition recommended, as it would neceſſarily imply a Cenſure of Parliament, whoſe new Mode of Puniſhment extends, not only to all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Town of Boſton, but <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> involves, either <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>immediately,</hi> moſt of the Inhabitants of the whole Province; ſuch a Petition, therefore, could hardly be conceived in <hi>agreeable</hi> LANGUAGE. I wiſh, upon ſuch Occaſions, as this eſpecially, that Gentlemen would avoid connecting the Name of his Majeſty with that of any of his Subjects, however dignified or diſtinguiſhed. We have a Maxim in our Law, which hath long ſince become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial, that the KING <hi>can do no Wrong.</hi> It is not to be ſuppoſed that his MAJESTY can HIMSELF attend to and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all the arduous Affairs of his extended Dominions.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013500_0008_0F90FA3229BD97B8"/>
The Conſtitution hath therefore aſſiſted him with a Miniſtry, who become the oſtenſible Men, and are accountable, for any Wrong or Injury, that may fall on the Subject through their Counſel and Advice. As to petitioning our moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign, I ſhould prefer a Step of this Sort, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to all others. America, I am perſuaded, would proſtrate herſelf at the Foot of his Throne and not think of any other Means, till this was tried; I would join in the moſt reſpectful Applications to both Houſes of Parliament for the Redreſs of our Grievances; but, alas! of what Avail would theſe Things be? Have they not been repeatedly attempted without the deſired Effect, as well by this, as the other Colonies? I would recommend to the Author's Peruſal and moſt ſerious Reflection the ſeveral <hi>diſregarded</hi> Petitions preferred againſt the Boſton Port Bill, and ſhould be glad to know how it could have happened, that ſuch dutiful and reſpectful Applications, and ſuch Cogency of Reaſoning were withſtood and ſurmounted, if Meaſures of the ſame Sort are now likely to ſucceed.</p>
            <p>In Exertion of what the Parliament claims as a Right of Taxation, we are reminded of the Duty impoſed upon Stamps and Tea; by which the Author would have his Readers ſuppoſe that theſe two Duties were laid by the ſame Act of Parliament. This may ſerve his Purpoſe, in the Contraſt afterwards drawn to prove that the Duty on Tea ought to be conſidered merely as a <hi>Regulation of Trade</hi>; but I beg Leave to inform him that this Tea Duty was the Offspring of another Act, which impoſed the Duties on Glaſs, Paper, &amp;c. And that this Act compared with another of the ſame Seſſion clearly evinces that it was not intended as a commercial Regulation, but originally deſigned as one Article of the American Revenue, and afterwards retained merely as a <hi>Precedent.</hi> The Stamp Act he ſays was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed; very true; and America expreſſed her Thanks for it, hoping that Concord and Harmony would be reſtored
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013500_0009_0F90FA32E53A74E0"/>
and firmly eſtabliſhed. We are told, in the next Place, that,
<q>though the Duty on Tea remained, yet all Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, on that Head, ſeemed to have ſubſided for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Time paſt; that the End of both Parties was anſwered; the Parliament's in aſſerting, and America's in denying;</q>
and why,
<q>it is aſked, ſhould not the Diſpute reſt at this Point? Freſh Clamours need not be made, until freſh Cauſes for ſuch are given; new Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances for an old Affront are neither conſiſtent with the Dictates of Policy or Prudence;</q>
all this is granted; but I find we ſhall differ, as to the recent Cauſes of Complaint, which have been unjuſtly given to the Americans. Had the Duty on Tea continued, where it was left a few Years ſince, we ſhould have troubled ourſelves very little about it; but, if arbitrary Steps have been taken to force this Tea on the Coloniſts and compel them to pay the odious Duty, the Caſe becomes quite altered. Let us examine this Part of the Subject a little more minutely.</p>
            <p>That a regular Syſtem hath been formed to ſubjugate America by eſtabliſhing that <hi>civil Liſt</hi> in the Colonies, which was planned and ſo earneſtly recommended by a certain <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi> muſt be evident to every attentive Obſerver of the Proceedings of Parliament for a Series of Years paſt. I will refer the Reader no farther back than the 4th Year of his preſent Majeſty's Reign, when the Act paſſed impoſing a Duty of £. 7 per Ton on Madeira Wine and other Duties on different Articles. Theſe were acquieſced in, as they carried with them a ſpecious Appearance of Advantage to the Colonies and bore the Semblance of Regulations of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. The Way being ſo far paved, the <hi>Miniſter</hi> then ſeized what was judged a convenient Opportunity to impoſe his Stamp Duties; the Americans were juſtly alarmed, plainly ſeeing through the whole Deſign. Upon a ſeaſonable and ſpirited Oppoſition, the Stamp Act was repealed, but
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013500_0010_0F90FA33A8EC0B30"/>
not without a Declaration of the <hi>Supremacy</hi> or rather <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence</hi> of Parliament; this gave the Coloniſts very little Concern; a Declaration nearly of the ſame Sort, though not ſo extenſive, has been made many Years before reſpecting Ireland; this declaratory Act might have remained, with the other as a dead Letter, unregarded, had there been no future Attempts to revive it. The favourite Scheme of an American Civil Liſt ſeems to have been kept in full View, and the ſucceeding Miniſter, finding that the former Attacks on the Rights of the Colonies had been made too openly, thought it moſt prudent to ſhift the Ground and endeavour to effect the ſame Purpoſe by political Fineſſe His Manoeuvres were then diſplayed in another Act impoſing Duties on Glaſs, Paper, Painter's Colours and Tea. This, at firſt, had the Appearance of a commercial Regulation; but the latent Deſign was ſoon detected and fully expoſed. The Oppoſition made to the Meaſure produced a very inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midating Addreſs of both Houſes of Parliament to the King, by which his Majeſty was deſired to have Proſecutions ſet on Foot againſt ſuch, as were deemed principal Actors, upon a <hi>ſtale</hi> Statute of King Henry the 8th; the neceſſary Conſequence would have been, that thoſe, whom the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> thought proper, were to have been <hi>ſeized</hi> and <hi>tranſported</hi> to England, there to be tried for their ſuppoſed Offences, contrary to every Principle of Law and Juſtice. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of this Addreſs with thoſe Arguments urged by the ableſt Advocates for Parliamentary <hi>Power</hi> to prove that the Colonies are ſo far a Part of the Empire of Great Britain, as to be ſubject to <hi>every</hi> Law of Parliament, is left to them and our Author to be reconciled. How could the Colonies avoid being alarmed at a Proceeding big with the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequences and utterly ſubverſive of every Thing dear and valuable to them? Theſe arbitrary Strides of Power were proteſted againſt by our Houſe of Burgeſſes in their Seſſion of 1769, and the Reſolutions, they were driven into brought on the Diſſolution of the Aſſembly. The
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013500_0011_0F90FA348DB644E8"/>
Colony being reduced to ſo diſagreeable a Situation, the firſt Aſſociation, which the Author affects to ridicule as a nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, inſignificant Act, was entered into; and, though not ſo univerſally adopted nor ſo ſcrupulouſly adhered to, as it ought to have been, yet I am perſuaded that it was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal efficient Cauſe of a ſubſequent Act of Parliament in the ſucceeding Year, by which the Duties on all thoſe Articles of Britiſh Manufacture, which included moſt that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies had Occaſion for, were repealed; the Duty on Tea, however, was ſtill continued; for what Purpoſe will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inquired. This repealing Act being attended with ſome particular Circumſtances, not very friendly to America, the Aſſociation, upon being reviſed, was continued with ſome Alterations allowing Importers a greater Latitude. The Parliament not having revived their diſagreeable Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but ſhewn <hi>ſome Diſpoſition</hi> by this Act to relieve America, at leaſt, from a Part of her Grievances, many Perſons became indifferent, as to the Aſſociation, and, at a general Meeting of the Aſſociates, the Whole was diſſolved except as to the Article of Tea, and others under the ſame Circumſtances, which they continued to protect againſt. That this was too little regarded by many muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: The Duty, merely as to the <hi>Quantum</hi> of it, might have been thought too inconſiderable to deprive them of what the Author ſuppoſes <hi>Cuſtom</hi> had made almoſt a <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of Life</hi>; ſome Men ſtill ſaw its evil <hi>political</hi> Tendency and therefore abſtained from importing or buying it, though many others did not, and, I believe, <hi>they</hi> now ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that <hi>all</hi> had not held it in equal <hi>Abhorrence.</hi> That this Duty on Tea was originally impoſed for the ſole Purpoſe of raiſing a <hi>Revenue</hi> in America, and not as a <hi>commercial</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation; and that it was afterwards retained, as a <hi>Precedent,</hi> I think, muſt be evident to every One, who conſiders the ſeveral Acts of Parliament relating to the Subject. The <hi>Act itſelf,</hi> which impoſed this Duty, declares it to be for the Purpoſe of a <hi>Revenue.</hi> We all know that Tea paid a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013500_0012_0F90FA37CEDC3300"/>
Duty in England; the Eaſt India Company found great Difficulties in diſpoſing of their Tea loaded with that Duty. The Parliament, in the very ſame Seſſion, that the American Duty was impoſed, paſſed another Act allowing a Drawback of the whole <hi>Duties</hi> payable in <hi>England</hi> on all Tea, which ſhould be exported to America in the original Packages, upon the <hi>Company's agreeing to make good any Loſs</hi> the Revenue might ſuſtain by theſe Debentures. This Act was to continue to the 5th of July 1772. In the Seſſion of the ſame Year, 1772, another Act paſſed, to continue for five Years, allowing a Drawback of three Fifths of the Duty on all Tea, which ſhould be purchaſed of the Company and exported to America. We know that, by former Statutes, the Company were obliged to ſell all their Commodities, Tea amongſt the reſt, at public Auction, by Inch of Candle, to the higheſt Bidders; and were not allowed to export <hi>any Thing</hi> on their own Account. In 1773, when it is probable the Plan was concerted for ſhipping the enormous Quantities of Tea, which have occaſioned our Diſturbances, to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, another Act paſſed authoriſing the Company, under a Licence from the Commiſſioners of the Treaſury, to export any Quantity of Tea to America, without being obliged to expoſe it at public Auction; and upon ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, the whole Engliſh Duty was to be drawn back, inſtead of the three Fifths allowed by the Act of the former Seſſion. The Queſtion I would aſk is this; if either a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial Regulation or the general Revenue, and not the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a <hi>Precedent</hi> againſt <hi>America,</hi> had been the Object of Parliament, why might not ſo much, at leaſt, of the old Duty, as was thought ſufficient to anſwer their American Purpoſe of barely raiſing Money, have been continued? This would have given no Uneaſineſs; the Expence and Trouble of collecting the Duty in America and remitting the Surplus, if any ſhould ariſe, to the <hi>Receipt of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Exchequer</hi> in England would have been ſaved. The proper Anſwer to the Queſtion will ſhew the Deſign of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013500_0013_0F90FA3914A2F580"/>
and, at, the ſame Time prove what the Company had in View by ſending the Tea to America. The large Quantity, they had on Hand made it a Drug, and they had engaged to make good to Government any <hi>Deficiency</hi> that might ariſe on the Duty. The allowing the Company to export their Tea on their own Account, juſt at this <hi>Juncture,</hi> contrary to <hi>ſtanding Regulations,</hi> which had ſubſiſted for ſo many Years, affords an additional Proof of the Point in Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whatever Loſs, therefore, the Company may have ſuſtained by the Deſtruction of the Tea, or having it returned upon their Hands, ſhould be placed to the Account of their own Imprudence, or rather, to what ſeems to have been a Co-operation with the Miniſtry to <hi>pour</hi> it down the Throats of the Americans. Suppoſe the Company had a Right to monopoliſe this Branch of Trade, to the <hi>Excluſion</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> of all <hi>other Merchants</hi>; were they not ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed how very diſagreeable and odious their ſending the Tea to America would be to the Inhabitants of all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent? Governor Johnſton, we find, declared publicly in the Houſe of Commons that he had warned their <hi>Chairman</hi> againſt ſending over the Tea and told him the bad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, that would probably attend ſuch a Step; let the Refuſal of ſeveral Captains of Ships to take it on Freight be alſo recollected. Theſe Circumſtances were ſurely enough to have convinced them that they could not expect, in a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, equal Courſe of Trade, to diſpoſe of their Tea in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Was it not the greateſt Inſult upon this whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to attempt to force upon them a Commodity, which they had ſo much Reaſon to be convinced, when introduced in this Manner, would be conſidered as bringing with it thoſe <hi>Shackles</hi> the Author ſpeaks of? If the Company ſhould pretend that they did not ſee the Matter in this Light, I would gladly know how other Men, of different Claſſes, happened to be ſo very ſagacious as to foretel what followed? I cannot but ſuppoſe that the Company had one of two Things in View. They either muſt have hoped that the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013500_0014_0F90FA39ADCBF7F0"/>
public Virtue of the Americans would not be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Temptation thrown in their Way; if they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the Tea, all would be well; both the Company's Purpoſe and that of Adminiſtration would be anſwered; the Drug would be got rid of and the Duty would be paid. If, in the ſecond Place, the Scheme ſhould be obſtructed and the Tea thereby miſcarry, their ultimate Expectation and Reliance ſeems to have been that the Miniſtry would ſupport and indemnify them.</p>
            <p>In Hopes of aggravating the Offence of the Boſtonians, the Author tells us that, by
<q>our Magna Charta, even Aliens are protected in their Commerce with us; and, had a Frenchman, the avowed Enemy of our Country, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Tea into Boſton he would have met with no Moleſtation;</q>
if this be ſo, Thanks to the Rigour of the Acts of Trade, Courts of Admiralty, &amp;c. But, ſince he has drawn the Compariſon, I would gladly know what Sort of Trade, even a Frenchman can carry on with Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, that would prove ſo injurious and deſtructive, as that which the Company endeavoured to force with the Coloniſts. I agree it is unlawful to trade with Foreigners, and that we ought, by no Means, to encourage ſuch a Practice; but I ſay the Trade attempted by the Company, <hi>all Circumſtances conſidered,</hi> was equally illegal and more unjuſt. I will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for a Moment, though the Fact is ſupported by no Sort of Evidence, which I know of, that the whole Town of Boſton had been concerned in deſtroying the Tea, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to every impartial Perſon how far they were blameable. I muſt here take Leave to remind our Author of one of his Law Maxims; <hi>Sic utere tuo, ut alienum non loedas.</hi> Make a free Uſe of your Property, but, ſo uſe it, as not to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice what belongs to another. I take it that the Freedom and Liberties of America are pretty eſſential Parts of their <hi>Property</hi>; I alſo conſider a Community was very materially intereſted in preſerving the <hi>Virtue</hi> of its <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ferent Members;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013500_0015_0F90FA3B241FCD80"/>
ſo that every Infringement or Attempt to deprive the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of either Species of this Property, I conclude comes within the prohibitory Part of this Maxim. It is alledged that the Boſtonians might have declined <hi>purchaſing this Tea</hi>; but why ſhould we expect to find a larger Portion of public Virtue amongſt theſe People, than in other Countries? Many I make no Doubt would have refrained from buying, but others, probably could not, or would not have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Temptation of purchaſing at <hi>Half Price.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Company having been diſappointed in one of their Expectations, they are now to be gratified in the other. The <hi>ſupreme,</hi> the <hi>omnipotent Power</hi> of Parliament is to be exerted to procure for them what is called Juſtice, Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, &amp;c.

                  </gap>,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> may be ſuppoſed to know more than <hi>common Men</hi>; but I incline to think him miſtaken in many eſſential Points; ſome Things, I am ſure, are unfairly repreſented.</p>
            <p>He introduces his State of Facts with the People of Rhode Iſland; the Caſe of the Gaſpée Schooner and the Court of Inquiry. Would not a Stranger ſuppoſe, from his Relation of this Affair, that not only all the Inhabitants of Rhode Iſland, but that this whole Continent was concerned either in perpetrating, abetting, or <hi>countenancing</hi> that flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wicked Act of burning his Majeſty's Schooner and maltreating the Commander? Nothing I believe was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Truth; I am ſure every Man, in this Colony, whom I heard ſpeak on the Subject, loudly condemned the Deed, and, had it been in their Power, would I believe, have conſigned the Perpetrators of it to a <hi>legal,</hi> exemplary and condign Puniſhment.
<q>Government it is ſaid, opened a Court of Inquiry and that this Mode of Proceeding was fixed on as a Teſt, from whence it might be known,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013500_0016_0F90FA3B4644FB00"/>
whether this Inſult was a general Act of the Province;</q>
if not, it was
<q>concluded that the better Claſs of People would exert themſelves in Order to bring the Offenders to Juſtice; that, no Diſcovery having been made, the Court could proceed no farther; and, though <hi>inſulted</hi> in all the public Newſpapers on the <hi>Continent,</hi> the Miniſtry were unwilling to proceed to Extremities, but ſat down ſilently under the Affront, laughed at by the Rhode Iſlanders and held in Deriſion by Foreigners.</q>
Without detaining the Reader by a minute Scrutiny into the Propriety of haſtily ſetting up this <hi>Court of Inquiry</hi> in a Country regularly eſtabliſhed, and, where I ſhould ſuppoſe, ſince we are not told the contrary, proper Juriſdictions are fixed, competent to the Examination and Puniſhment of all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences and Tranſgreſſions of the Law; without relying on the juſt Alarms, which novel Juriſdictions are apt to give a free People, I muſt remind the Reader of a few <hi>trifling Circumſtances,</hi> which ſeem to have been <hi>carefully</hi> kept behind the Scene. Will the Author allow us to recollect what was to have been done with the Culprits, had they been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. If I do not forget the Act of Parliament made on this Occaſion, all Perſons, ſuppoſed guilty of any of the Offences therein enumerated, were to be tranſported to Great Britain and there tried for their <hi>Lives.</hi> It was this, which gave the Alarm, and very juſtly to the whole Continent. I find a Diſpoſition in ſome Men to aggravate every Tranſaction of the Americans into the moſt enormous Crime, whilſt they are prepared to palliate and even juſtify every Act of the Miniſtry, however arbitrary and oppreſſive. The dragging a Man from all his Connexions into a diſtant Country to undergo the ſevereſt Trial; to ſtrip him of the glorious Privilege of being tried by his Peers of his Vicinage, the moſt valuable Birthright of every Freeman; to deprive him of the Benefit of the Teſtimony of his Witneſſes, whom he has no Means of compelling to croſs the Atlantic; of the Aſſiſtance and Comfort of his Friends, when in a State of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013500_0017_0F90FA3C20D1FA40"/>
the deepeſt Affliction, and to expoſe him to the bittereſt Perſecution of his Enemies; theſe are <hi>trivial</hi> Circumſtances, not worthy our <hi>Attention or Concern.</hi> If the Miniſtry were inſulted in the public Papers, I had no Hand in it, though I frankly acknowledge my Concurrence in condemning ſo unconſtitutional and oppreſſive a Meaſure and hope that no American will ever ſubmit to it. Odious as ſo unjuſt and arbitrary an Act of Power muſt appear in the Eyes of every Friend to Liberty, the <hi>fundamental</hi> Principles of our Laws and Conſtitution; yet the Author is pleaſed to fix it as the <hi>Baſis</hi> of his <hi>Juſtification</hi> of the Miniſtry in their Attack upon Boſton, ſtill, <hi>if poſſible,</hi> more cruel and unjuſt. As a Proof that the Miniſtry were not concerned in the Importation of the Tea, we are told that
<q>the Admiral was deſired to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere, when the Diſturbance happened,</q>
but declined doing ſo, conſidering it as a "mere mercantile Adventure." Viewing the Matter in this Light; did he not form the better Judgment? But how contrary is the Author's Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Admiral's own Letter to the Secretary of the Admiralty, in which he deſires the Lords of the Admiralty may be informed
<q>that, during the whole Tranſaction, neither the <hi>Governor, Magiſtrates, Owners</hi> or <hi>Revenue Officers</hi> called for his Aſſiſtance; if they had, that he could eaſily have prevented the Execution of the Plan, but muſt have endangered the Lives of many <hi>innocent</hi> People by firing on the Town.</q>
I cannot, conſidering what has ſince happened, ſuppoſe the <hi>Governor and the other Perſons alluded to,</hi> reſtrained from making ſuch Application to the Admiral for his Aſſiſtance, by any Motives of Regard for the Inhabitants. We know there are ſometimes Wheels within Wheels, to be put in Motion by ſecret Springs, which it is not always convenient to have expoſed to common Obſervation. It ſeems to me that even the Preſervation of their Tea, by all Accounts extremely mean in Quality, would not have anſwered the Company's Purpoſe ſo well,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013500_0018_0F90FA3CAE576F10"/>
in ſeveral Reſpects, as the Retribution now demanded on their Behalf; and the immediate Suppreſſion of what is <hi>called</hi> a Riot might have defeated the earneſt Expectations of the <hi>Governor</hi> and the <hi>Revenue Officers.</hi> The Dutch we learn deſtroy large Quantities ot their Spices, in Order to enhance the Value of what remains upon Hand. How very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient would it be to thoſe People, could they but find out a Method of being paid for what they thus deſtroy? I do not preſume to <hi>aſſert</hi> poſitively that the Miniſtry were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in planning and promoting the Scheme of ſending the Tea to America; but does it appear, in the Courſe of all the Debates, we have ſeen, that they have once denied it? Does not the Act of Parliament laſt referred to, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the ſeveral Meaſures lately adopted, furniſh a ſtrong preſumptive Proof that it was undertaken, at leaſt, with their Approbation? How could this Act have been procured without their Concurrence and Aſſiſtance? And why were not the Company allowed to export, on their <hi>own Account,</hi> other Articles beſides Tea? I ſuppoſe there can be no Queſtion made of the Advantages they would reap by monopoliſing the Exports as well as Imporrs of all the Commodities they deal in. Let the <hi>Boſton Port Act</hi> and the other <hi>Bills</hi> brought into the Houſe of Commons, by the Miniſter, which have probably been paſſed into Laws before this Time, be reviewed, and then, let thoſe doubt, who can, whether every Step taken was not with a Deſign to compel the People of Boſton, in the firſt Inſtance, and after this was done, the whole Continent to ſubmit to the Payment of Duties impoſed for the ſole Purpoſe of raiſing a Revenue in America, and, in ſo doing, to the Power of Parliament in every other Inſtance, that they may be pleaſed to exert it. As a farther corroborative Proof, I would gladly know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it appears, from any authentic Document, that the Company ever lodged a Complaint againſt the Boſtonians; they ſeem to have been either too conſcious of their Fault to do it; or the Readineſs and Alacrity, with which the Miniſtry
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013500_0019_0F90FA3D709D6F40"/>
ſeem to have engaged in the Buſineſs, might have ſuperſeded the Neceſſity of their complaining.</p>
            <p>The Miniſtry, it is ſaid, <hi>took the Matter up on two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> They conſidered, in the firſt Place, <hi>that the Idea en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the Boſtonians of this being an Act of Government, was affrontive to the Crown and therefore deſerved the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion of Parliament.</hi> The ſecond Reaſon was,
<q>that, without the Intervention of the legiſlative Authority, there muſt be a Failure of Juſtice.</q>
It ought rather to have been ſuppoſed, under the firſt Head, that the Miniſter <hi>himſelf</hi> was affronted and vexed that the Scheme had been fruſtrated; for I cannot help diſtinguiſhing between the Crown and the Miniſtry on theſe Occaſions.</p>
            <p>In Proof of his ſecond Reaſon, the Author is pleaſed to ſay,
<q>the Eaſt India Company, it is true, might have brought their Actions againſt the Offenders; but how were they to find them? The Affair of the Gaſpée afforded Proof enough that the Names of the Rioters would remain an impenetrable Secret; but, if their Names had been known, what Reaſon was there to expect on the Trial, a diſpaſſionate Judge or a diſintereſted Jury, when the Minds of the People were ſo generally impreſſed with the Notion, that, with the Tea, were imported Shackles for themſelves and their Poſterity?</q>
As to the Difficulty in diſcovering the Names of the Offenders, would this have been any Thing more than the common Caſe; when either, from not being able to find out the Authors of a Miſchief, or, from a Defect of Proof, the Perſon injured is obliged to ſit down with the Loſs? This may be a Misfortune, but, in the preſent State of human Affairs, it ſeems unavoidable. With Reſpect to the Want of a proper Judge or Jury, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, impartial Judge might ſurely have been found, either amongſt the <hi>Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms,</hi> or in one of the <hi>Courts of Admiralty</hi> on the Continent; he might have
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013500_0020_0F90FA3E294287D0"/>
been inveſted with the full Powers both of <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Jury,</hi> and ſuch a Juriſdiction would not have been a Whit more exceptionable, than the Powers given to Courts of Admiralty by this and ſeveral other Acts of Parliament. But the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry could have had no juſt Grounds to ſuſpect a Failure of Juſtice; ſeveral Inſtances had happened in <hi>that very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> ſufficient to convince them of the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This Matter was, therefore, laid before Parliament, as the only Reſource; who, in Conſequence of it, thought proper to ſend an Armament to Boſton in Order to oblige the <hi>People</hi> of that Place to make Retribution for the Injuries <hi>they</hi> had done, and to put a Check to that growing Diſorder, which appeared to them to be Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, inſtead of Freedom, and which muſt endanger the Peace of the Britiſh Empire in America, unleſs it was ſmothered in its Infancy.</q>
We are told farther that the <hi>Reſentment</hi> of Parliament was levelled only againſt the Town of Boſton and that, if it had been intended againſt the whole Province, they would have ſtopped all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with it; that this ought to convince every one that they have no Intention to injure any other Colony, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they commit the ſame Outrage, and then, it is probable, "the ſame Cauſe will produce the ſame Effect." Before the Author had ſuppoſed that only the Town of Boſton and not other Parts of the Province would be affected, I wiſh he had read the Addreſs of the Town of Salem to Governor Gage and learned their Senſe of this Matter; after repreſenting the great Injury that <hi>particular Town</hi> will ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they tell him
<q>that there is not a Town in the Province, but will feel the ill Effects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Author is pleaſed to confeſs that
<q>the Part of the Act, which relates to Wharfs is <hi>exceptionable,</hi> as it is taking private Property out of the Hands of the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſors, who <hi>may be innocent Men,</hi> and, perhaps, have
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013500_0021_0F90FA3EE8A8CC58"/>
done nothing to <hi>forfeit</hi> their Rights.</q> And <hi>is it, indeed,</hi> but barely <hi>exceptionable? Nothing more</hi> verily; ſince, in the ſucceeding Paragraph, we find an Apology ready prepared <hi>to juſtify even this Part</hi> of the Act. The Deſign of the Act, it ſeems, was only "punitory;" when that End is anſwered and Satisfaction made
<q>to the Eaſt India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he is perſuaded that the Whole will be repealed.</q>
What are we to underſtand by the Term "<hi>punitory?</hi>" It may imply <hi>confiſcating, hanging, burning</hi>; and, what not? But taking it in the moſt mollified Senſe, the Author ſurely has never read the Boſton Port Act, or muſt ſuppoſe that others have not done it, elſe he never would have given <hi>this as a true State of the Caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What can he think of the Act's declaring void <hi>Charter Parties and Bills of Loading?</hi> What of the Clauſe (which may indeed carry with it an Air of Indulgence) effectually reſtraining his Majeſty from opening the Port, till Peace and <hi>Obedience to the Laws</hi> are <hi>ſo</hi> far reſtored in the Town of Boſton, that his Majeſty's <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> may be duly collected? By <hi>Obedience to the Laws</hi> I underſtand an <hi>implicit Submiſſion</hi> to all <hi>Acts of Parliament whatever</hi>; by <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> is plainly meant <hi>all ſuch Duties,</hi> as the Parliament may think fit to impoſe. This obvious Comment may fairly be made from the Complexion of the Act itſelf, and is clearly and fully juſtified by the other Bills before alluded to.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we think of his Majeſty's being alſo reſtrained from opening any Part of the Port,
<q>till full Satisfaction is made to the Eaſt India Company for the Damages they have ſuſtained; and until it ſhall be certified to his Majeſty in Council by the Governor or Lieutenant Governour, that reaſonable Satisfaction hath been made to the <hi>Officers of the Revenue</hi> and <hi>others</hi> who ſuffered by the Riots, &amp;c?</q>
Here it is plain that theſe <hi>devoted</hi> People, and ſome of them ſuppoſed, <hi>even</hi> by the <hi>Author

He ſhould not be too precipitate in pronouncing the Sentiments of others. Many judicious, upright Men, who, I believe, are now fully convinced, had their Doubts, at firſt, upon this Point; they ſuſpended their Judgments, till they could be ſatisfied of the Motives, which actuated the Boſtonians, and of the Evidence, they might have to produce of what Part the Miniſtry took in this Buſineſs at the Beginning of it. Granting, however, for a Moment, that the People of Boſton might have acted unwarrantably; yet, what hath the Parliament done? Or rather, what hath it not done? It is much to be ſuſpected that the Author, as well as many others, in conſidering this <hi>mixed</hi> Queſtion, has attended only to one Side of it. Upon the above <hi>Conceſſion,</hi> then, ſome of the Men of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and in its Neighbourhood have acted unwarrantably in deſtroying the Property of the Eaſt India Company. In this Town live a great many Thouſand Inhabitants, amongſt whom are, probably, many Widows and Orphans deeply intereſted in the Trade of the Place, its Wharfs, Storehouſes and other Appendages. Several principal Proprietors might have been abſent, when the Fact was committed. Many of theſe muſt be preſumed entirely innocent; the Guilty however deſerve Puniſhment. The Law is open to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured; and, if the Aggreſſors can be found out, there is a proper Juriſdiction to award ſuch Puniſhment, as the Law hath preſcribed. From a <hi>groundleſs</hi> Apprehenſion (I take the Liberty of calling it ſo, till the contrary is proved) that Juſtice will not be impartially adminiſtered, the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try take the Matter up and lay it before Parliament. A Bill is brought in; the Parties accuſed, contrary to every Rule of Juſtice, are condemned, without being cited to anſwer what is laid to their Charge; a few of their Friends, who happened to be on the Spot, are refuſed to be heard, and an Act of Parliament, inflicting the ſevereſt Penalties, is paſſed with unuſual Precipitation; a Fleet and an Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are hurried acroſs the Atlantick with the utmoſt

Rapidity, as if it was intended that they ſhould be the firſt Bearers of the fatal Tidings, and the dreadful Announcers of the Doom of theſe unhappy People. So much for the Method of Proceeding. Let us attend a little more particularly to the Act itſelf and its miſchievous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
            <p>In the Author's pompous Diſplay of the Beauties of the Britiſh Conſtitution and the Laws of Parliament, he ſhould have recollected one very eſſential Point more, which ſeems to crown the Whole, and without which, the Power of Parliament would become odious to every Man of free and liberal Sentiments. What I allude to will be beſt explained by the following Obſervations.</p>
            <p>To the Parliament it, of Right, belongs to make and enact Laws for the better Government of all <hi>properly within its Juriſdiction</hi>; for the Encouragement of thoſe, who do well and the Puniſhment of all Tranſgreſſors. If Offences ſhould ariſe, not guarded againſt by Law, this Defect of Proviſion is to be aſcribed either to the Neglect of the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, or to the Imbecillity and ſhort-ſightedneſs of human Nature. Every Inſtance of this Sort ſhould point out to the Lawgiver a <hi>future</hi> Remedy, which ought to be provided with all Expedition and without <hi>Reſpect of Perſons.</hi> When general Regulations and Laws are eſtabliſhed, by which every Individual in Society is to be bound and governed, ſuch Laws are <hi>equal</hi>; the Legiſlature acts upon truly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical and conſtitutional Principles, uninfluenced by Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, <hi>Reſentment</hi> or the Temper of the Times. Of ſuch Laws, as theſe, or rather, the <hi>Mode of enacting them,</hi> none can with Reaſon complain. But we ſhould be careful never to loſe Sight of the material Difference between the <hi>legiſlative,</hi> the <hi>judicial,</hi> and <hi>executive</hi> Parts of our Conſtitution; ſince, upon a due Attention to and Obſervance of theſe Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Preſervation of the Whole ſo very materially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013500_0025_0F90FA45198E57D8"/>
Occurrences prejudicial to Society may happen, which have not yet been provided againſt by any Law; but theſe cannot be puniſhed, without a groſs Infringement of the vital Principles of the Britiſh Conſtitution, and a direct Oppugnation to a ſuperior Authority; by which we are taught, <hi>that, where there is no Law, there can be no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi> We know very well that, by the moſt juſt and invariable Rules of judging, penal Laws are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued <hi>ſtrictly</hi>; ſo that no One accuſed can be ſubjected to a Penalty, unleſs he falls expreſsly within it. Upon what is this Rule founded? but the Reaſon and Principles of eternal Juſtice (which Legiſlatures as well as Judges ſhould have imprinted on their Hearts in indelible Characters) that penal Laws ought never to be calculated, like Snares, to catch Men; on the contrary, that no One ſhould be ſubjected to the Pains of them, unleſs clearly and fully convicted. Again; we have another Maxim in our Conſtitution, namely, that it is better many <hi>guilty Perſons</hi> ſhould eſcape Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than that one Innocent ſhould ſuffer. We know <hi>ten</hi> righteous Perſons would <hi>once</hi> have ſaved a whole City; but this it ſeems is an <hi>antiquated</hi> Doctrine, extracted from a <hi>ſtrange old Hiſtory</hi>; and the Reverſe is now to take Place in the Syſtem of modern Politicks. Let theſe Obſervations be applied to the Caſe in Hand. The Perſons actually guilty of the ſuppoſed Offences at Boſton were ſubject to <hi>the Penalties,</hi> and <hi>thoſe only,</hi> of the Laws then in Force; if there were no ſuch Laws, I ſay they were not liable to any Penalty at all. Shew me the Law enacted by <hi>proper Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> or ſubmitted to by immemorial Uſage, declaring that the Port of Boſton or any other Town ſhould be blocked up and the Trade, almoſt, of a whole Country deſtroyed, even ſuppoſing all the Inabitants of the Town guilty, which is not pretended in the preſent Caſe, and I will agree that the Penalty might be legally infflicted. There are many Perſons confeſſed to be grievouſly oppreſſed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013500_0026_0F90FA45BAF473F8"/>
by this Act, who are perfectly innocent. Let a Law enacted by <hi>proper</hi> Authority be produced, which declares that all the Inhabitants ot Boſton or any other Town, whether inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or guilty, ſhall be puniſhed moſt ſeverely for the Acts of Violence or Intemperance of Individuals committed either in their own Town or its Neighbourhood, and I will kiſs the <hi>legal Rod,</hi> and yield up the Argument; but, if no ſuch Law can be produced, I take the Liberty to pronounce that the Boſton Port Act, conſidering it in a judicial Point of View, is <hi>unconſtitutional</hi>; that, as an Act of <hi>legiſlative Power,</hi> it is entirely <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> in the moſt odious Senſe of the Words; and that, with Reſpect to all thoſe eſpecially, who were confeſſedly innocent, it conſtitutes a new Crime and inflicts a Puniſhment, which cannot be juſtified. Here, I ſuppoſe, will be called into the Author's Aid, the Precedents urged on the other Side of the Water. I ſhall not, for Brevity's Sake, quote them all; but refer my Readers to the reſt, with the Anſwers given to them, contenting myſelf, with mentioning only two, the moſt capital.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of King Charles the ſecond, when Dr. Lamb was killed by unknown Perſons, the City of London was fined; and, in Captain Portius's Affair, a Fine was ſet upon the whole City of Edinburgh. I take the Liberty of referring for an Anſwer to theſe Examples, in Part, to what was urged, with much Propriety, by a few worthy, patriotic Americans in their Petition againſt the Boſton Port Bill. I give it in their own Words, as I would by no Means mutilate that Part of a Petition, which muſt for ever endear them to all their Countrymen.
<q>The Caſe of the King againſt the City of London, ſay they, was for a Murder committed within its <hi>Walls</hi> by its Citizens in open Day. But, even then, <hi>arbitrary</hi> as the Times were, the Trial was public in a Court of Common Law; the Party heard and the Law, laid down by the Judges, was,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013500_0027_0F90FA4734973608"/>
that it was an Offence, at Common Law, to ſuffer ſuch a Crime to be committed in a walled Town, <hi>Tempore diurno,</hi> and none of the Offenders to be known or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. The Caſe of Edinburgh, in which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment interfered, was the Commiſſion of an atrocious Murder within her Gates, and aggravated by an overt Act of High Treaſon, in executing, againſt the expreſs Will of the Crown, the King's Laws. They obſerved that theſe Cities had, by Charter, the whole executive Power within themſelves, ſo that a Failure of Juſtice neceſſarily enſued from their Connivance. In both Caſes, however, full <hi>Time</hi> was allowed them to diſcharge their Duty, and they were heard in their own Defence. But Time was not allowed to the Boſtonians, nor were they heard. Boſton is not a walled Town, nor is the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power in their Hands, but in the Governor's; nor was the Fact committed within it.</q>
Theſe Reaſons I ſhould have thought ſufficient to diſcriminate the different Caſes; but my Objection is laid ſtill deeper, as I am for reducing Things to their proper Principles. Shew me the Law, <hi>ſubſiſting</hi> at the <hi>Time</hi> theſe Offences were ſaid to have been committed, impoſing the Penalties inflicted, and I will agree that ſuch Proceedings, before a <hi>proper Judicature,</hi> might have been right; otherwiſe, from the eſtabliſhed Principles of the Conſtitution, I ſhall not ſcruple to declare them arbitrary Exertions of deſpotick Power. Admit but an <hi>Authority</hi> in Parliament, not only to <hi>create new Offences, after</hi> they are ſuppoſed to have been committed, but to inflict what Puniſhments they pleaſe for the ſame, and I would gladly know what will become of that Security for their Properties, their Liberties and Lives, which Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men boaſt of, as derived from the Independence of their Judges and the Permanency of Tenure, by which they enjoy their Offices. Let the Author diſprove my Poſitions, and he will make Room for <hi>conſtructive Treaſons and Felonies</hi>; (a Doctrine long ſince exploded by all judicious, good Men,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013500_0028_0F90FA480AE137A0"/>
as replete with Horror;) he will repeal the famous Statute of Edward the III. long ago eſtabliſhed by other Acts of Parliament, as a Criterion and Teſt not to be departed from; and, above all, he will prove IRREFRAGABLY that a Man may tranſgreſs a Law, which never had Exiſtence. If he ſhould tell me of the Power, or rather <hi>Omnipotence</hi> of Parliament and the Neceſſities of State, I have to remind him that ſuch a Power is inadmiſſible, ſince it contradicts a more tranſcendent Authority; and that no Exigency of Government can commute for ſo flagrant a Violation of the firſt and fundamental Principles of the Conſtitution and the ſacred Laws of Juſtice. If, in attempting to reaſon on theſe Principles, I am drawn back to the State of Nature, where, according to the old Vulgariſms, <hi>Might</hi> was ſure to overcome <hi>Right,</hi> and, where the <hi>weakeſt</hi> always <hi>went to the Wall,</hi> I muſt drop my Pen, and go in Queſt of a new Topick.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There is nothing, we are told, ſo likely to enforce the Act, as Violence. Reparation will ever be demanded, when an Injury is received. In eſtimating the Damages, there will always be <hi>an Article in the Account relative to that, which is wiſhed to be enforced</hi>; and, if we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to pay the one, what will prevent our being forced to diſcharge <hi>the other?</hi>
               </q> Here the whole Secret tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. What is <hi>that Article,</hi> which is wiſhed to be <hi>enforced,</hi> but the <hi>deteſtable Duty on Tea?</hi> This we will agree was the <hi>primary,</hi> the <hi>principal</hi> Object. The Author ſpeaking here of Force, recalls my Attention to a former Part of his Work, which I, by no Means, intended to neglect. There we are told the "moſt ſtubborn (by which are plainly meant the unhappy Americans) muſt" yield to ſuperior "Force." This without Queſtion is a moſt <hi>powerful and irreſiſtible</hi> Argument. A Man of ſuperior Strength it would be imprudent in me wantonly to provoke. But, if he treats me ill; if he irritates and oppreſſes me; am I
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013500_0029_0F90FA48B56F6D98"/>
bound by any Laws, human or divine, to continue my good Offices towards him, ſo as to increaſe his Power of doing me farther Miſchief? Prudence adviſes that I ſhould leſſen my Connexions with him; and, if he proceeds to Acts of open Violence againſt me, Self Preſervation, the very firſt Law of Nature, demands that I ſhould defend myſelf to the utmoſt of my Power.</p>
            <p>The Author's Aphoriſm that
<q>Friendſhip ſometimes gathers new Force and Vigour, after an Interruption of its Intercourſe,</q>
may be true enough; though I think he had better have ſet it to the Tune of <hi>Amantium Irae Amoris, &amp;c.</hi> than attempted to prove it, by his ſubſequent Prophecy; which ſeems rather intended to keep up the alarm in Great Britain, than to anſwer any other Purpoſe. Peeping into the Womb of Time, he has diſcovered and foretold that America will, one Day, become independent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>principal, avowed Cauſe</hi> of the preſent rigorous Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures againſt America ſeems to ariſe from a Jealouſy excited by an Apprehenſion that we affect and aim at Independency; and we cannot gain Credit, notwithſtanding our explicit and moſt ſolemn Aſſurances of the contrary. For myſelf, I do proteſt before God and the World, that the utmoſt of my Wiſh is, that Things may return to their old Channel, when we lived a free and happy People. This obtained, I would, with Pleaſure, ſay to each Country, ESTO PERPETUA. He had before given it as his Opinion that <hi>the Americans might argue till Doomſday,</hi> but that he was afraid they would find the
<q>Parliament <hi>deaf</hi> to their Reaſoning and their Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence unavailing;</q>
what can he now mean by Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Rigour</hi> on their Part, and <hi>Relaxation</hi> on ours; unleſs it is, that America ſhould offer a <hi>Carte blanche,</hi> in Hopes of prevailing with Parliament to deſiſt from Puniſhment?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:013500_0030_0F90FA49AA483030"/>The great Pains he has taken to <hi>diſcourage Strangers</hi> from migrating to America affords another ſtrong Proof of his Regard for this Country. For my Part, I am ſo thoroughly perſuaded of the JUSTICE OF OUR CAUSE, that I have no Doubt of eſtabliſhing our Liberties upon ſo <hi>ſure</hi> a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Strangers will applaud our generous Struggles to preſerve thoſe precious Enjoyments and become the more anxious to ſettle in America, as in a Land of Freedom.</p>
            <p>The Aſſociation entered into, upon the Diſſolution of our Aſſembly, I find hath afforded the Author a Subject for Mirth and Pleaſantry. Whether this is a Seaſon for ſuch delicious Entertainments, others will judge. Upon me they are entirely loſt. I had before heard this Aſſociation found Fault with, as not being extenſive enough; ſo that I could little expect to ſee it ranked by any one amongſt violent Meaſures; much leſs, that ſo reſpectable a Number of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen would be ridiculed for that Moderation, which, to all impartial Perſons, muſt afford the cleareſt Proof of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to live on the moſt friendly Terms with their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects in Great Britain. However, when theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions were entered into, it was uncertain what Meaſures the other Colonies would adopt; we did not know how far the Miniſtry had been inſtrumental in bringing ſuch exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Miſchiefs on our Siſter Colony; nor could we foreſee what farther Steps the Parliament would take. The Eaſt India Company was conſidered as extremely culpable, and therefore it was reſolved that they ſhould reap as little Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from us, as poſſible. All their Commodities were proteſted againſt, except Saltpetre and Spices. Theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions were not made, from an Opinion that we could not <hi>poſſibly</hi> do without thoſe Articles. Saltpetre and Spices were conſidered not only as uſeful for various Purpoſes of Life, but many of them, as neceſſary in Medicine, Cordials and other Nouriſhments required by ſick Perſons. None of the Aſſociates, I believe, had Reſpect to their Palates; and, had
<pb n="31"
                   facs="unknown:013500_0031_0F90FA4A2DCCAF88"

theſe been their Object, I am apt to think it would have been a Foible common to them with <hi>ſome others,</hi> and ſhould have ſuppoſed that the <hi>Author,</hi> at <hi>leaſt,</hi> would have looked on it as a venial Error and treated it with greater Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. A Reſolution to aboliſh Tea, <hi>even that on Hand,</hi> totally, was prudent and neceſſary; as the Stocks of ſome People, to whoſe Happineſs it ſeems ſo very eſſential, would probably never have been exhauſted. Great as my Fondneſs for this delightful Herb once was, I am now taught to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as the <hi>very accurſed Thing,</hi> that ought to be baniſhed, with Diſdain and Horror, from every American Society.</p>
            <p>The future Aſſociations, as propoſed by many of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, as well as moſt, I believe, of our Inhabitants, become the next Objects of the Author's Animadverſion. With Reſpect to ſtopping our Exports, there ſeems to be a Variety of Opinions, as to the Propriety and Juſtice of this Meaſure; though few, whom I have converſed with, doubt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedience and Neceſſity of the other. Theſe Matters, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, will ſoon be determined at a general Meeting of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties from the different Counties; when I make no Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every Subject will be diſcuſſed with that Calmneſs and Deliberation, which its Importance may demand. Thoſe Gentlemen, who incline to adopt both Schemes, I dare ſay, are actuated by the <hi>pureſt</hi> Motives to the public Good. The Parliament they conſider as having ſet the Example in ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Imports and Exports to and from the Town of Boſton. If the Parliament conſiders the Advantages of Trade to that Town in ſo very intereſting a Light, as to ſuppoſe that, rather than forego ſuch great Emoluments, the Inhabitants will ſubmit to any Acts of Oppreſſion; the Advocates for promoting both theſe Meaſures, knowing the almoſt unſpeakable Benefits, which Great Britain derives from her Trade with the Colonies, give it, as their Opinion, that ſhe will be equally attentive to her own Intereſt and the ſooner prevailed with to ſhorten her outſtretched Arm, and

do the Americans Juſtice. Stopping of Exports from one Country indebted to another, where ſhe has uſually traded, may lay individual Creditors under temporary Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Hardſhips, and can be juſtified only in Caſes of the extremeſt Neceſſity. If, however, the Safety of a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity depends upon its being done, the <hi>Salus Populi</hi> then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>ſuprema Lex.</hi> Thoſe, who think their Liberties, their Properties, their every Thing, dear and valuable, at Stake, and in the moſt imminent Danger of being wreſted from them, can have but little <hi>Spirit</hi> or Inclination to labour and toil for their Creditors, eſpecially, if they with-hold their <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> in endeavouring to relieve them from Oppreſſion. They ought however, in Juſtice, to pay their Debts with Intereſt, ſo ſoon as it may be in their Power; and they ſhould be ready and willing to give up ſo much of their Property, if required, as will diſcharge them <hi>immediately.</hi> It is, after all that can be ſaid, a very delicate Point. The Honour of the Country, which ought ever to be held ſacred, may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be impeached and reflected upon by ſuch, as are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the governing Motives; but, as a Man is ſatisfied or not of the Purity and Uprightneſs of his <hi>own</hi> Intentions, his Conſcience will either acquit or condemn him. What I ſhould think might, in a great Meaſure, ſatisfy the moſt rigid Caſuiſt, that nothing baſe can lie at the Bottom of ſuch a Scheme, if it is adopted, is, that the engaging in and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to it muſt require the greateſt Sacrifice of private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and the moſt vigorous Exertions of public Virtue.</p>
            <p>The Non-importation Plan, no One can with Reaſon object to; not even the warmeſt and moſt virulent Advocate for miniſterial Meaſures. As a free Man, I ſurely have a Right to <hi>buy</hi> or <hi>import,</hi> and <hi>refrain</hi> from both, if I pleaſe; in the Exerciſe of this Privilege I ſhall tranſgreſs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Declarations of a late <hi>unprecedented Proclamation,</hi> no Law divine or human. If ſuch a Proclamation, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the heavieſt Pains and Penalties, can be juſtified; I

ſhould not be ſurpriſed to ſee a peremptory Mandate ſent over to America, commanding every Man to plant ſo many Thouſand Tobacco Hills, &amp;c. &amp;c. for the Enhancement of the Revenue, the Encouragement and Advancement of the Shipping and Trade of Great Britain.</p>
            <p>Stoping of Imports only I am hopeful might have all the good Effects, we wiſh for; but, ſhould I be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in this, and our Exports be ſtill continued, as uſual; I ſhall have to lament moſt ſeverely that both Meaſures were not adopted. The Schemes united moſt certainly would, and it is probable that either of them will affect the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Great Britain of every Claſs, in a moſt ſenſible Manner. Thoſe, who think the Tradeſmen and Mechanicks only will ſuffer, ſeem to have taken but a partial View of the Caſe. There is ſo intimate and nice a Connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the different Branches of Trade and Buſineſs of every Kind in that Country, that few of them can be affected without the Whole bearing ſome Proportion of whatever Loſs may be ſuſtained. The <hi>Landholder,</hi> and the <hi>Merchant</hi> will feel the Inconvenience, as well as the Tradeſman and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick. When the Intereſt of all <hi>theſe</hi> comes to be worked upon, <hi>they</hi> will be convinced that the oppreſſive Schemes of the Miniſtry could not be enforced without the Concurrence of <hi>their</hi> Repreſentatives in Parliament; they will, it is hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be excited, not to Acts of Violence, but to a <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> Exertion of that <hi>conſtitutional Influence</hi> and <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> which they have a Right to exerciſe. Should their Endeavours to relieve America from her Diſtreſſes be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, whatever Inconveniencies they may be put to, the Colonies muſt ſurely be acquitted by every impartial Judge. Much leſs Reaſon can they have to complain, if ſtoping Exports to Great Britain is poſtponed to a diſtant, future Day; this will give ſufficient Notice of what they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; a great Part of the American Debts will certainly be
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013500_0034_0F90FA4C6993B8F8"/>
diſcharged, and the Reſources the Colonies will have left, if they are <hi>permitted</hi> to draw from them, will, in all Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, enable them to pay off the full Balance in a reaſonable Time. Let America but ſtop her <hi>importing Hand</hi>; apply a proper Share of her Induſtry to Manufactures, and the reſt of her Labour to cultivating and raiſing ſuch Articles, as ſhe is allowed to export to other Markets, and I have the moſt ſanguine Expectations that ſhe will, not only very ſpeedily extricate herſelf from Debt, but find the Balance conſiderably in her Favour. Should ſhe, by the <hi>Hand of Power,</hi> be laid under farther Reſtrictions in her Trade, and by this Means any Part of her Debt remain unſatisfied, the Fault will not be <hi>her</hi>'s. So that every Suggeſtion of a Deſign in the Coloniſts to <hi>extinguiſh</hi> the ſmalleſt Portion of their Debts muſt appear groundleſs and unjuſt. I know it has been inſinuated, with a View to fix an Odium on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, that they have failed in former Engagements to ſatisfy their Creditors; but this, conſidered as an Accuſation on the whole Continent, as it muſt have been intended, I am convinced is without Foundation. That ſome Individuals may have remained in Debt for a Number of Years and that Inſolvencies may have happened in America, as well as <hi>Great Britain,</hi> I will not deny; but chief of the old Balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I make no Doubt, have been long ſince paid off, and that the Debts, now due, have been moſtly contracted ſince in a Courſe of Trade <hi>equally,</hi> if not <hi>more,</hi> advantageous to the Britiſh Merchants and Traders, than to the Coloniſts. For the Truth, at leaſt Probability of this, I appeal to the various Solicitations and <hi>Allurements</hi> held out, particularly to <hi>my Countrymen,</hi> to engage and continue in this Trade. The Balance againſt America proves clearly on which Side the Advantage has been.</p>
            <p>Unleſs the Author is prepared for a Diſappointment, I would not have him depend too much on his preſent Opinion of the propoſed Aſſociation compared with <hi>that</hi> entered into

ſome Years ago. I have already hinted ſome of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why <hi>this</hi> was neglected; but I am convinced he will find a quite different Spirit prevailing throughout America at this Time. Thoſe <hi>Diverſities</hi> of Opinions and <hi>Differences</hi> of Intereſt, which formerly ſubſiſted, will now, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, be ſacrificed to the Good of the Whole. Whether the Duty on Tea was, at firſt, conſidered as an internal Tax or not, is now quite immaterial. The Deſigns of the Miniſtry were not then ſeen through by many; but I think I have ſhewn clearly that this Duty had originally every <hi>odious Feature</hi> of ſuch a Tax. Can a Doubt now remain, when we find an <hi>Armament</hi> ſent either to enforce the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it or to puniſh moſt ſeverely thoſe, who refuſe to do it? Such a Refuſal, as this, the Author would conſtrue into a Reſiſtance of the Authority of Parliament to lay Duties on their <hi>own Commodities,</hi> which we do not wiſh to queſtion, when it is <hi>really</hi> done as a <hi>commercial Regulation.</hi> I grant, it makes no Difference to me, <hi>as to the Quantum of the Tax,</hi> whether it is paid in Great Britain or the Colonies; whether my Merchant pays it for me, or whether I do it myſelf; but Circumſtances will make that oppreſſive in one Caſe, which would be almoſt indifferent in another. I have neither paid this Tax myſelf nor allowed my Merchant to do it for me, ſince the Uſe of Tea was reſolved againſt in America; and, which is ſtill more, I never will pay it.</p>
            <p>The Mention of a Precedent, our Author, in the Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Politeneſs, tells us is <hi>ridiculous</hi>; and we are referred to the Liſt of his <hi>favourite Duties</hi> to ſee whether there has been any Want of Examples. That America hath acquieſced in and paid former <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Why muſt the Mention of <hi>Precedents</hi> be ridiculous, when we find they were ſtrenuouſly relied on by the Miniſter, and all

his Advocates, to juſtify the Stamp Act, and are <hi>ſtill quoted</hi> as <hi>Authorities</hi> to rivet Chains about our Necks? Is it not high Time for America to look about her and not ſuffer ancient <hi>Precedents</hi> to acquire additional Weight from others more recent? We are again reminded of the <hi>Power</hi> of Parliament to enforce ſuch Duties, as they may think expedient; and are told that America will refuſe the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, <hi>whenever ſhe is able.</hi> Is it not ſtrange that a Gentleman, who profeſſes himſelf ſo great a Friend to lenient Meaſures, ſhould, at every Turn, take ſo much Pains to remind Parliament of its ſuperior Power, and <hi>flatter</hi> America that ſhe will, one Day, be able, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will reſiſt it? Is not this the moſt direct and ſureſt Method of ſowing the Seeds of perpetual Diſcord? We are adviſed <hi>truly</hi> for the <hi>preſent,</hi> to <hi>affect</hi> a Submiſſion; but ſtill are to harbour in <hi>our</hi> Breaſts the Poiſon of Diſcontent and Animoſity, which muſt feſter and rankle to ſuch a Degree, that they will, at a future Day, moſt aſſuredly burſt forth with redoubled Violence and Fury. Whether ſuch Sentiments, as theſe, are likely to prove inimical or friendly to either Country, let them both judge. The Author widely miſtakes what the true and real Friends of America hope to have done. They do not deſire to leave every Thing to Poſterity, but rather wiſh to have Matters <hi>now</hi> ſettled upon ſuch Principles, as will lay a ſtrong and broad Foundation of Concord and reciprocal Friendſhip, never more to be interrupted.</p>

If, however, the Magiſtrates, who act on Oath, think they cannot proceed in Buſineſs without a Fee Bill, what would the Author have them do more, than exerciſe that Part of their Office, which is neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Peace and good Order of Society? This I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand is univerſally reſolved on throughout the Country.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013500_0037_0F90FA4EA6450710"/>
That the Fee Bill has expired is a Circumſtance we lament and ought not to be blamed for. Before he cenſured the Magiſtates ſo very ſeverely for declining to ſit, he would have done well to conſider how far he <hi>himſelf</hi> coincided. If I am not miſtaken, this Gentleman holds a Seat in one or more Courts of Juſtice; he ſhould let us know what Part he took to prevent the Occluſion of thoſe Courts, and then, perhaps, his Arguments would have more Weight.</p>
            <p>The Aſſociation he would recommend is that we ſhould all unite in <hi>Virtue; public Virtue,</hi> he is careful to tell us he <hi>means,</hi> leſt, I ſuppoſe, we ſhould put too great a Value on the other. <hi>Public Virtue</hi> is what we earneſtly wiſh to <hi>rouſe</hi> and <hi>excite</hi> in every American Breaſt; ſince, without it, we may probably ſuffer in the very beſt of Cauſes. But why is private Virtue ſo low in his Eſteem? Without this, the other, in my Judgment, is like the <hi>baſeleſs Fabrick of a Viſion.</hi> If a Man is not <hi>juſt to himſelf,</hi> I can hardly ſuppoſe he will be ſo to others, upon any trying Emergency. What is called <hi>public Virtue,</hi> unleſs built on <hi>private Virtue,</hi> will become too precarious and unſtable to be relied on. A Man, with a ſmall Stock of private Virtues, may, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as his Intereſt governs, do a Thing, from which the Public may reap Advantage; ſhift but the Scene; let his Intereſt draw in a different Direction, and we ſhall find him, <hi>Proteus like,</hi> put on a new Livery. It may be relied on as a certain Truth, exemplified by the moſt extenſive Experience, that no Man can be ſafely truſted, who does not act upon <hi>ſolid, virtuous</hi> Principles. We are adviſed to apply ourſelves <hi>quietly</hi> to the Cultivation of our Soil; but how can this be done without the <hi>Permiſſion</hi> of a <hi>ſuperior</hi> Power? How can it with Reaſon, be expected that we ſhould labour, unleſs we are <hi>kindly</hi> allowed to reap and enjoy the Fruits of our Toil?</p>

               <q>Our public Happineſs, we are told, depends on the People;</q>
granted that it does in a great Meaſure. Had the Author added to his Liſt of Qualifications neceſſary to make a proper Repreſentative, that he ought to be a Man of <hi>private</hi> as well <hi>as public Virtue</hi>; One who <hi>really loves his Country,</hi> and would ſupport her true Intereſt, even though he ſhould be forced to ſacrifice <hi>every ſiniſter, ſelfiſh Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it would have made the Catalogue nearly <hi>complete</hi>; but I ſhould like it ſtill better, if a proper <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for Religion</hi> were required as an eſſential Part of the Character.</p>
            <p>I am now led to take a View of the Author's very curious and decent Strictures on the Faſt, which was recommended by the late Houſe of Burgeſſes to the Members. Upon this Subject, he ſeems to have opened every Vein of paltry Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule; but ſurely he hath either ſtrangely miſtaken, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely applied his Talent. He might have learned from one of thoſe great Maſters, under whoſe Auſpices he probably was <hi>nurtured,</hi> that <hi>Ridicule is the Teſt</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and thought this a fit Opportunity to diſplay it with Advantage. A Stranger, from his Repreſentation, would ſuppoſe that we had acted a <hi>ridiculous Farce,</hi> inſtead of what was ſo ſolemnly recommended. Though the Author had loſt Sight of all Decorum, he ſhould, at leaſt, have confined himſelf to the Rules of Juſtice. I beg to know of him in whoſe Houſes thoſe <hi>ſumptuous Suppers,</hi> he alludes to, were ſerved up at Night. I am ſure I neither ſaw nor heard any Thing of the Sort. Thoſe, who had faſted through the Day, it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed would refreſh themſelves in the Evening. Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and Decency did not forbid it. It could hardly have been expected, even by the moſt <hi>indigent,</hi> (who it ſeems have <hi>ſuddenly</hi> become Objects of his <hi>great Care</hi>) that the Calls and Cravings of Nature ſhould have remained unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Savings, indeed, in Inſtances of Superfluity and <hi>pompous Parade,</hi> may properly be expected, as well towards
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013500_0039_0F90FA53034DE2E0"/>
their Relief, as the Satisfaction of all other juſt Demands. He has exceedingly miſtaken the Matter, in ſuppoſing that the <hi>Authors</hi> of the Meaſure either wiſhed for his <hi>Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> or to be tickled by his <hi>Flatteries.</hi>
            </p>

               <q>Faſting, we are told, when obſerved and repeated in a proper Manner, may be ſalutary to the natural Body;</q>
(thus much no Doubt he collected from Experience;)
<q>but how the political body can be benefited by changing the Hour of dining and making the Repaſt in the Evening, inſtead of the Afternoon (which was all that was required on the late Occaſion, except the Circumſtances of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public Worſhip, in which, inſtead of a Form compoſed for the Purpoſe, the ordinary Service of the Day was read) is what he cannot account for.</q>
Not to be tedious in uſeleſs Quotations, I muſt refer the Reader to ſome other of his very <hi>pretty</hi> Obſervations that follow. As he ſeems little acquainted with the Reaſons for ſetting apart particular Days for ſolemn <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> on any Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Motives, which governed on a late one, I will take the Liberty to expreſs my Senſe of both.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>many,</hi> it is to be hoped, (<hi>would</hi> GOD there were <hi>more</hi>) who do not conſider this as a poor, <hi>Orphan World,</hi> diſcharged, ſo ſoon as it was called into Being, from the <hi>Care, Superintendence,</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> of its <hi>all-wiſe, and bountiful</hi> CREATOR. Things, in <hi>general,</hi> they know are left to purſue their ordinary Courſe, in Conformity to the Laws of their Nature; but ſtill, they conſider the whole World as under the Direction of PROVIDENCE. They have been taught that not even a <hi>Sparrow falleth to the Ground,</hi> without the <hi>Permiſſion</hi> of their <hi>heavenly</hi> FATHER. They are enjoined not only to pray, but to be <hi>inſtant in Prayer,</hi> for his <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Protection.</hi> Upon theſe Principles is founded and eſtabliſhed, by <hi>Authority,</hi> the Service of our excellent Church, which I would recommend to the Author's <hi>more</hi>

ſerious Conſideration. Not only Individuals, but, in a more eſpecial Manner, <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Countries,</hi> as having their Exiſtence <hi>ſolely</hi> in this Life, have been conſidered by all Ages, and particularly by all good Chriſtians, as under the Guidance of Heaven. In Caſes of general Calamity, either already felt or apprehended, what can be more decent and proper than to look up to that Providence, who we are inſtructed to believe ruleth the <hi>Hearts of Kings</hi> and <hi>Governors,</hi> according to his good Pleaſure, and to implore the Aſſiſtance and Bleſſings of his <hi>fatherly Goodneſs</hi>; at the ſame Time making Uſe of all thoſe <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>proper Means,</hi> which he either hath been, or may be pleaſed to afford us for our Protection. Previous, however, to <hi>this,</hi> we ſhould be extremely careful to examine our Hearts; to endeavour at a Reformation of whatever may be found amiſs; to repent <hi>heartily</hi> of all our Sins and to prepare our Minds for the Reception of the Influences of his GOOD SPIRIT. Can any Means be better adapted to this End, than withdrawing our Attention, for a Seaſon, from the Buſineſs and Cares of the World, and mortifying all our <hi>corrupt Affections</hi> by FASTING and PRAYER? To ſuppoſe that any good Effect could have been expected from the <hi>mere poſtponing a Dinner,</hi> to uſe the Author's polite Phraſe, would have been <hi>ridiculous.</hi> I have too much Reaſon to believe that the Deſign of this <hi>Faſt</hi> was either miſunderſtood or miſrepreſented from the firſt, having been informed that it was ſpoke of by ſome as a Scheme calculated to <hi>inflame</hi> and excite an <hi>enthuſiaſtic</hi> Zeal in the Minds of the People, under a Cloak of Religion; than which nothing could be more <hi>calumnious</hi> and <hi>unjuſt.</hi> The Author muſt know that the Reſolution was not <hi>ſmuggled,</hi> but propoſed in a very <hi>full Houſe,</hi> not above one Diſſentient appearing amongſt near an Hundred Members. He, himſelf, I believe was preſent, and ſhould be glad to know whether he opened his Mouth againſt the Meaſure? Surely he could not want that <hi>Reſolution,</hi> he ſo earneſtly recommends, to have
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013500_0041_0F90FA53E818FBF0"/>
avowed his <hi>Diſapprobation.</hi> The mixing of Religion with civil Matters, merely to inflame People's Minds, I know has been practiſed on ſome Occaſions, but I have ever conſidered it not only as culpable, but extremely wicked. It gave me Pain to find that the <hi>Reſolution</hi> of the Houſe was conſidered as reflecting upon our gracious Sovereign. Nothing, I hope and believe, was farther from the Intention of thoſe, who voted for the Faſt, than this. I ſpeak poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively for myſelf.</p>
            <p>The Minds of many People, eſpecially of their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, were a good Deal agitated, at a former Seſſion upon receiving an Account of the Act of Parliament reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rhode Iſland, and for the Reaſons before given. When the Boſton Port Act appeared at the laſt Seſſion, the general Uneaſineſs, that prevailed muſt be remembered. Many Expedients were thought of and the Meaſure propoſed was the Reſult of much Deliberation. Its primary Object I have endeavoured to explain; but there were others of a ſecondary Nature. So far from deſigning to inflame, I believe it was expected that the Generality of People would be brought to a <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> Senſe of their Danger; the Conduct they ought to hold; and, at the ſame Time, that it would be a Means of reſtraining them from Acts of Violence and Intemperance. It was, with much Pleaſure, I obſerved that theſe Effects were produced. Another good Influence it might have been expected to have, was, that certain GREAT MEN of this Earth might be brought to a proper Senſe of that Juſtice, which is due to all their <hi>Fellow Subjects,</hi> by reminding <hi>them</hi> that there is a <hi>ſuperior Power, even a</hi> GOD IN HEAVEN, to whom they will be one Day accountable for all their Actions. As to the ordinary Service of the Church being only performed on the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; the late Houſe of Burgeſſes muſt think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves peculiarly unfortunate in fallling under the Author's
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013500_0042_0F90FA54A7129810"/>
Cenſure for this. They did not <hi>preſume</hi> to deſire that any <hi>Additions</hi> ſhould be made to that <hi>ſacred Office,</hi> which they knew was properly adapted to every Purpoſe. They did not wiſh that any Thing particularly <hi>pointed</hi> or <hi>inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> ſhould fall from the Pulpit. A general Diſplay of the Superintendence of Providence, and the <hi>Influence,</hi> which a thorough <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Remembrance</hi> of <hi>this,</hi> ought to have, together with an implicit Reliance on his Goodneſs, were the Doctrines, which they deſired to have inculcated, leaving the Congregation to their own Reflections in making proper Applications. The People of Boſton will have no Reaſon to ſuppoſe that it was our Deſign to <hi>fob them off, in their unhappy Situation, with Faſting and Prayer.</hi> They will <hi>ſoon</hi> be informed, if they have not heard it already, how very cordially we ſympathiſe with them in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and that we are exerting every Means, in our Power, for their Relief. Should we, indeed, purſue his Advice, it would be <hi>fobbing them off</hi> with a <hi>Witneſs.</hi> The Author, not having profeſſedly entered upon that long agitated <hi>Queſtion,</hi> reſpecting the <hi>Authority</hi> of Parliament to tax the Colonies, I am very willing to reſt the Point upon what <hi>hath</hi> been already written by abler Pens, much to my Satisfaction, and to my thorough Conviction that they have <hi>no ſuch Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length he draws to a Concluſion and tells us that he has
<q>ſpoke pretty much in Generals, but, if called upon, can deſcend to Particulars.</q>
It would have been obliging to the Public, if he had favoured them with any farther <hi>material</hi> Obſervations; but what can he have left unſaid, that would anſwer his Purpoſe? That he is determined to act with <hi>Caution,</hi> none, I believe, will doubt; but I have lived to ſee ſome very <hi>cautious</hi> Perſons fall through their <hi>deepeſt Schemes.</hi> Could the Author ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that thoſe ſervile, dangerous Doctrines, he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, would remain unnoticed? With what Juſtice or

Propriety could he preſume to cenſure what he is pleaſed to call the <hi>Severity of ſome Men's Tempers,</hi> when he ſo roundly charges thoſe, who differ from him in Sentiments, with Want of "Integrity;" with the "Arts of <hi>Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>" and almoſt every Species of Baſeneſs? Could he flatter himſelf that "<hi>Men of Senſe</hi>" would not eaſily ſee through his "Deception," and, as eaſily, diſtinguiſh it from "<hi>Reality,</hi>" notwithſtanding the ſolemn Appeal he makes to that <hi>great</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is more than probable that a Reply will be attempted to what I have written. Should it contain any Species of Reaſoning, worthy of Conſideration, perhaps it may engage my farther Attention; otherwiſe, I ſhall indulge a ſilent, contemptuous Indifference; quite impregnable to every Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of <hi>affected</hi> Wit or Ridicule; thoſe very <hi>deſpicable Things,</hi> for which I acknowledge myſelf to have neither Taſte nor Talents, eſpecially in a Cauſe of ſo ſerious and important a Nature.</p>
