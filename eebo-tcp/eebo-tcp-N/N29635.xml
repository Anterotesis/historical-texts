            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>May 28th. 1706. To my Worthy Friend, Mr. James Bayley, Living (if Living) in Roxbury, A POEM.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>MY Old Companion! and my Friend!</l>
               <l>I cannot Come, and therefore send.</l>
               <l>Some pity should be shown to One</l>
               <l>That's heavy laden with the Stone;</l>
               <l>That's wearied out with fits of pain</l>
               <l>Returning like Clouds after Rain.</l>
               <l>Alas! my Brother, what can I</l>
               <l>Do for thee, more than Pray and Cry,</l>
               <l>To Counsel, and to comfort try,</l>
               <l>And bear a part by Sympathy?</l>
               <l>Excuse me, though I Write in Verse,</l>
               <l>It's usual on a Dead mans Hearse:</l>
               <l>Thou many a Death hast under-gone,</l>
               <l>And Elegies made of thine own.</l>
               <l>Our Saviours Funeral Obsequies,</l>
               <l>One Celebrates before His eyes;</l>
               <l>And He the Oyntment kindly takes,</l>
               <l>That for His Burial she makes.</l>
               <l>Two Saints array'd in glorious dress,</l>
               <l>Appear, and talk of His Decease;</l>
               <l>Whose Death from thine did take the Sting,</l>
               <l>And wholsome make that Poyson thing.</l>
               <l>And I have seen thine hand, and Pen,</l>
               <l>Play on that Cockatrices den</l>
               <l>In measur'd Lines, as if inspir'd,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Paroxisms</hi> had only fir'd</l>
               <l>An holy Soul with flaming zeal,</l>
               <l>That flesh-pains it could scarcely feel.</l>
               <l>What, in one breath, both Live and Dye,</l>
               <l>Groan, Laugh, Sigh, Smile, Cry, Versifie?</l>
               <l>Is this the Stone? are these the pains</l>
               <l>Of that Disease that plagues the Reins?</l>
               <l>That slyly steals into the bladder?</l>
               <l>Then bites, and stings like to the Adder.</l>
               <l>Is this the Scourge of Studious men?</l>
               <l>That leaves unwhipt scarce five of ten</l>
               <l>And Whips them once, and over again.</l>
               <l>In Christs School there's smart Discipline,</l>
               <l>To make His Scholars more divine;</l>
               <l>Blest they who do not take offence,</l>
               <l>Whose joy lyes in the Future Tense;</l>
               <l>Who when they are in most distress,</l>
               <l>Love Christ the more, and not the less.</l>
               <l>His Yoke is easy, burthen light,</l>
               <l>To them that understand things right;</l>
               <l>And none will afterward complain,</l>
               <l>Who Hell escape, and Heaven obtain.</l>
               <l>Well! if this Stone should do its worst,</l>
               <l>It cannot make thee be accurst:</l>
               <l>For if thou shouldst be Ston'd to Death,</l>
               <l>And this way Pelted out of Breath,</l>
               <l>Thou wilt like <hi>Stephen</hi> fall asleep,</l>
               <l>And free from pain for ever keep.</l>
               <l>Great Pains, with as great Patience, may</l>
               <l>Fall little short of <hi>Martyrs</hi> Pay:</l>
               <l>For Christs Rewards are all of Grace,</l>
               <l>No Merit but His, in either case.</l>
               <l>Our Lord thee good Example offer'd,</l>
               <l>Who learn'd Obedience while He suffer'd,</l>
               <l>Who for the joy was set before Him,</l>
               <l>Endur'd the Cross He bore, and bore Him,</l>
               <l>Who though He Pray'd it might be gone,</l>
               <l>Yet also said, Thy will be done.</l>
               <l>That Stone which builders did refuse,</l>
               <l>For thy Foundation choose, and use.</l>
               <l>Think also when thine Agonies</l>
               <l>Are most intense, and force loud cryes;</l>
               <l>They are not worthy to compare</l>
               <l>With those that Christ for thee did bear:</l>
               <l>Yea, think what Christ for thee hath done,</l>
               <l>Who took an harder, heavyer Stone</l>
               <l>Out of thine <hi>Heart;</hi> and it is gone.</l>
               <l>Who did thy Wounded <hi>Spirit</hi> cure</l>
               <l>Of Soul-pains, that none can endure,</l>
               <l>And this is easyer to be borne,</l>
               <l>For in the <hi>Flesh</hi> abides this thorne:</l>
               <l>And if Christ do not it remove,</l>
               <l>Sufficient is His Grace, and Love,</l>
               <l>To give thee comfort, and Support,</l>
               <l>Because this pain is light, and short;</l>
               <l>And works for thee the Glory great,</l>
               <l>That doth exceed in length, and weight.</l>
               <l>Besides, these Torments cant compare,</l>
               <l>With Torments that <hi>Eternal</hi> are:</l>
               <l>For they are utterly undone,</l>
               <l>That rowl the <hi>Sisypean</hi> Stone;</l>
               <l>Not they whose pains are limited,</l>
               <l>And are releas'd, as soon as dead.</l>
               <l>Add one thought more; that this distress</l>
               <l>Makes thee partake of <hi>Holiness:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The more the flesh is hack'd, and hew'd,</l>
               <l>The more Corruption is subdu'd.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Life</hi> is to thee the less endear'd,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Death</hi> by <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the less fear'd:</l>
               <l>For it's but once thou hast to dye,</l>
               <l>And then Live to Eternity.</l>
               <l>Thy weary Body shall have Rest,</l>
               <l>Thy Soul from thence forth shall be blest;</l>

               <l>One Stone Gold's truth doth bring to light;</l>
               <l>Another makes Iron sharp, and bright:</l>
               <l>A third our grain doth Pulverize,</l>
               <l>And Separate the chaff likewise.</l>
               <l>Thine, all these profits bring to thee,</l>
               <l>In nobler sense than th' other three.</l>
               <l>Thine proves thy Grace to be Sincere;</l>
