            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>DR. JOHN LINING having proſecuted a courſe of <hi>ſtatical experiments,</hi> for the ſpace of one year at Charleſtown, the authour of the following ESSAY, became, afterwards, ſo cloſely connected with him, both by mutual intereſt and friendſhip, as gave him an opportunity to be fully informed of all he deſired to know, relating to the perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and other natural diſcharges in each ſeaſon. By thoſe means, he hath been led to judge otherwiſe than <hi>Sanctorius</hi> did; and it is difficult to conceive on what grounds the <hi>latter</hi> founded his notions, with reſpect to the numerous ill conſequences he imputes to an abatement of the perſpiration alone; nor is it leſs ſurpriſing, that ſo many great men, ſhould have ſo implicitly adopted his miſtakes.</p>
            <p>The authour hath ſuppoſed, that <hi>a ſpaſmodical contraction of the arteries and other muſculous mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, is the immediate cauſe of ſeveriſh diſorders,</hi> in whatever way this may be brought on; but
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010575_0005_0F80D15EE145E9F0"/>
ſhould that term diſpleaſe, another of the ſame meaning may be uſed in its ſtead; for all the ſymptoms in acute diſeaſes ſhow ſomething of this ſort, the ſeverity or mildneſs of thoſe diſtempers, for the moſt part keeping pace with the degree of that <hi>conſtriction,</hi> and the number of veſſels it affects.</p>
            <p>Having oftentimes been diſappointed in his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, though he followed the methods recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the beſt writers, ſo far as they were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by him, he undertook a journal of the weather and the diſeaſes alſo that accompanied its changes, in the ſeveral ſeaſons, and kept the ſame for many years in hopes of improvement. For however ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it may be, to examine our patients with great exactneſs at all times, it is more particularly ſo during a purſuit of this ſort, as well as to note every favourable and unfavourable circumſtance. This ſoon diſcovered, that when certain ſymptoms occurred at the beginning of a fever, the complaint, generally, was mild and of ſhort continuance; nor would the patient be ſeized with any inflammatory diſeaſe, though ſuch did not fail to attack others, who ſickened at the ſame time, but without the like propitious incidents. After carefully attending to this, in great numbers of caſes, the hint was not ſlighted, for what happened of its own accord, and
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:010575_0006_0F80D15FA469DE70"/>
prevented ſuch diſtempers, was brought on by art to remove them, after they were fixed.</p>
            <p>Nothing was more wanted, than a ſafe, ſpeedy, and, as far as the nature of things will permit, a certain method to remove fevers, within the firſt or ſecond day: This ſurely would well deſerve the name of a cure; but when they are allowed to run through the ſeveral ſtages, into which they would paſs, were they left to their own courſes, and the patients recover at laſt, all the merit that then can be pleaded is, that nothing improper had been done; and happy would it be, could this be ſaid on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, for indeed there is much merit in it.</p>
            <p>Were it granted, that inflammatory and other common fevers, may probably yield to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treatment, in warm but not in cold countries, the inſinuation is more ſpecious than true; for the human body is of the ſame conſtruction every where, differing only in being more braced in one climate, and laxer in another. And, truly, the inhabitants of <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> vary as much in thoſe reſpects, during the winter and ſummer, as if they dwelt in climates the moſt oppoſite in temperature. Beſides, the ſame diſtemper will be much alike in its ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:010575_0007_0F80D160767EF550"/>
and events, and, therefore, muſt require the ſame management, or nearly ſo, in all places.</p>
            <p>The authour hath practiſed in the way hereafter laid down, for many years, and with ſuch ſucceſs, that he is under no apprehenſions of its failing often, provided his directions be but duly followed. And having dealt candidly in publiſhing it, in hopes it may be of ſome uſe to the people of this province, candour requires that it ſhould not be judged of, by the fallacious rules either of prepoſſeſſion or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, but fair experiments only. He warns the reader however, that neither this nor any other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod will at all times cure; for every one of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, muſt have found in the courſe of his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that ſomewhat of a hidden nature now and then occurs, even in the complaints he thought himſelf beſt acquainted with, which, in ſpite of his boaſted ſagacity, diſappointed him. Whether this depended on certain ſingularities in the conſtitutions of individual perſons, the nature of the diſtemper itſelf, or his own overſights, it might not be poſſible for him to diſcover; or even if he could, it might not then be in his power to remedy it.</p>
            <p>It was deemed ſufficient to point out the method, and mention the medicines to be uſed, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining their proportions, or when it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:010575_0008_0F80D16121F2AC80"/>
either to omit, or prefer any one of them to another; for every practitioner ought to know, how they ſhould be adjuſted to the different ages and conſtitutions of his patients.</p>
            <p>At the end of this is another ESSAY on the <hi>Criſes</hi> of Fevers, which is intended to confirm the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contained in the former; by ſhowing that a <hi>criſis</hi> could not happen, unleſs the fluids had firſt been too much accumulated, in or near the places, whence the diſcharges called <hi>critical</hi> proceed, in conſequence of ſome hinderance to a free circulation in other parts.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> In which we propoſe to enquire, whether an abatement of the perſpiration be, indeed, the cauſe of ſo many diſtempers as are commonly imputed to it.</head>
               <p>THOUGH <hi>Sanctorius</hi> proved that our bodies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire freely, he ſeemed to have no knowledge of their imbibing any thing from without, excepting <hi>air,</hi> and therefore was not aware, that his experiments diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered no more, than the difference between the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and moiſture we abſorb through the pores of the ſkin and lungs; but exhalation and abſorption ſo confound each other, as makes it extremely difficult, if not impoſſible, to aſcertain the true ſum of either. We may be aſſured, however, that the diſcharges from the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010575_0011_0F80D163656691D8"/>
lungs and outer ſurface, are greater than ſuch trials ſhow them to be; ſince no allowance is made for whatever we imbibe, which, paſt all doubts, muſt be very conſiderable <note n="*" place="bottom">A negro man who had eaten or drank but little for ſome days before he was gibbetted at Charleſtown in March 1759, and had nothing given him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, regularly voided a large quantity of urine early every morning; but he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged no more till about the ſame hour next day. The reaſon undoubtedly was, that ſo long as the ſun was above the horizon and warmed the air, perſpiration was freer, becauſe the fluids were more determined towards the ſkin thereby; but as it became colder and more damp withal in the night, the outward ſurface was then conſtricted, and the humours, conſequently, being repelled towards the <hi>viſcera,</hi> urine was increaſed, the moiſture abſorbed furniſhing matter for it.</note>. When, therefore, that authour found his weight increaſed, he always charged it to ſo much of the perſpiration being detained; and aſcribed to ſuch accidents almoſt every diſeaſe to which mankind is liable. But this could only be a ſuppoſititious inference, for it cannot be thought that he experienced all thoſe ill conſequences in himſelf; and to apply the reſult of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, which concerned him alone, to whatever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to others, in whom that, as well as all the other diſcharges, might have proceeded in a very different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was ſtretching the concluſion rather too far. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we owe much to <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> but, ſtill, there is no need to admit his miſtakes; for it is in part owing to this condeſcenſion, that I know not what <hi>attenuants</hi> and <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorificks</hi> have been introduced into the practice, in order to diſſolve ſome notional viſcidneſs of the fluids, and promote ſweats in fevers; for on thoſe two effects, the removal of moſt acute diſeaſes is thought chiefly to depend, though one of them acts in direct contradiction to the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:010575_0012_0F80D1641FE68100"/>Some men of great reputation have likewiſe adopted <hi>Sanctorius</hi>'s aſſertion, that five-eighths of all our food and drink ought to paſs by perſpiration; but this rule can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold in any country, where cold and warm ſeaſons ſucceed each other, whatever may happen at times du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſummer. Nor is it leſs an errour to maintain, that the daily ſum of all the diſcharges, ſhould equal the quantity of our diet and drink, to keep up the ſame weight of body, that we may enjoy health. For to anſwer that great end, thoſe excretions muſt vary at different times of the year; and therefore, no fixed weight can be aſſigned for the ſtandard of health; becauſe that which would be moſt proper at one ſeaſon, might be dangerous in the higheſt degree at another, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the courſe of this eſſay. It ſeems, indeed, that this great perſpiration was meant as neceſſary, only, in the ſummer; for from the <hi>autumnal equinox</hi> to the <hi>winter ſolſtice,</hi> himſelf informs us, that it ſcarcely exceeded one pound, or was about, one-fifth part of what it had been at another time: yet he does not complain of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders from ſo remarkable a difference therein, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this abatement happened by degrees; and in all likelihood it might have continued thus ſmall through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the month of January and for a good part of Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary. In general, as the weather is cooler and more changeable in the ſpring and autumn than in ſummer, perſpiration not only muſt be leſs then, but more vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able alſo. How dangerous therefore, or at leaſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and difficult muſt it be, to follow his rule for the preſervation of health, by reducing the body in the ſpring to the weight it ſhould be of in ſummer, and keeping it to that poiſe. But this reaſoning would equally
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010575_0013_0F80D1673325EEE0"/>
hold, for preſerving the like weight of body in winter, as during a warm ſeaſon, by promoting perſpiration to the ſame quantity in the former period, that it ought to be in the latter. He, moreover, ſays, that they would enjoy the beſt health, and might attain extreme age, who keep their bodies from varying <hi>much</hi> in weight. Under what limitations <hi>much</hi> is to be underſtood here, I know not; but we are well aſſured, that the perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to increaſe with the heat of the air; elſe, we could not live, much leſs enjoy health, during very warm weather <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Lining</hi> began to fall away in March, and by the end of September loſt ſeventeen pounds weight, but he regained that and more, before the end of February following.</note>. For as the fiery particles enter our bodies along with the watery ones, and, perhaps, ſome portion of the air itſelf, unleſs the fluids were at the ſame time conſtantly venting, according to the expanſions they are made to undergo, and alſo to free us of this unnatural heat, ſuch a general overfulneſs muſt ſoon enſue, as would diſtend the veſſels, paſt all power of contracting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; inſtances of which happen almoſt every ſummer to ſome people in Carolina. This profuſe perſpiration is therefore abſolutely neceſſary, during a ſultry ſeaſon, to preſerve a balance, between the much relaxed veſſels, and highly rarified fluids. Hence it appears, that our bodies are conſtantly diſcharging the heat they abſorb from without; and ſo languid do the vital actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, that whilſt we ſweat freely as we ought to do, our natural heat is really leſs after the ſummer is far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, than in winter. In January 1752, when the mercury fell to the 18th diviſion, it roſe in a ſmall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer placed under my arm, to the 97th; but in July
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010575_0014_0F80D168B280C988"/>
that ſame year, when the heat of the ſhaded air was marked by the 101ſt degree, it did not riſe in the ſame ſituation, above the 95th. It was juſt now ſaid, that we could not live when the weather is very warm, unleſs the perſpiration increaſed in proportion as the fluids were ratified. Accordingly, I ſometimes have been ſent for to people who were expiring, in a manner, from being too long expoſed to the intenſe heat of the ſun, and others were already dead before I could reach them, though but a few doors from me. The firſt ſymptoms perceived on theſe occaſions, are an univerſal languid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a faintiſh ſort of drowſineſs; preſently ſuch a tightneſs is felt round the breaſt as if it were ſtrongly girded, ſo that the perſon can ſcarcely breathe; and then but ſlowly. Soon after he falls, as it were, into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſleep; from which if he cannot be ſpeedily rouſed, death quickly follows. In ſuch caſes, I commonly found the ſkin rather dry and very hot; the countenance full and fluſhed; all the outward veins very much diſtended; and on the breaſt, and other places, inflammations might be perceived, as in the <hi>ſcarlet fever,</hi> or a ſlight <hi>eryſipelas,</hi> the whole body appearing enlarged and fuller than in health; but the redneſs we ſpeak of in the ſkin, only happened a little while before the patient's death. The putrefaction in thoſe who die after this manner, is always ſudden and great; which makes it neceſſary to bury them in a few hours; nor does the heat their bodies acquired, abate ſo much after death as in other carcaſſes, for the time they lie uninterred. But theſe things by the bye—</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Lining</hi> (who was very exact) ſometimes found himſelf heavier by ſeveral ounces, than he was a few
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010575_0015_0F80D169741626F8"/>
hours before, though he perſpired ſenſibly all the while, from ſeveral parts of his body, beſides what paſſed from the lungs; hence it ſeems, that perſpiration and abſorp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may both go on freely together: But he often times abated the perſpiration deſignedly, without any perceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able injury, ſo that the matter detained, either was not ſo pernicious as is commonly thought, or his body muſt have been quickly freed of it by ſome other diſcharge. So earneſt was he to know what might be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of checking this ſuddenly that he ſome times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf at once to the wind, when ſweating profuſely. But this curioſity was not always gratified without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable effects. In particular, at the beginning of July, having only an open thin linen waiſtcoat over his ſhirt, he ſat from eleven to noon in a cloſe room where the heat was marked by the 87th degree of Fahrenheit's ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer; and in that one hour perſpiring eleven and an half ounces, he inſtantly removed into an open paſſage through which the wind blew briſkly, the mercury fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there to 82; and in one hour and a quarter gained ſix and an half ounces, though he ſtill ſweated from ſome parts. The whole of this muſt ſurely be charged to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorption, and conſiſted either of the perſpiration with which his linen was damped, or elementary water im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed from the air, not more than 13 or 14 degrees colder than his blood, which of itſelf, was not likely to do much harm. However, let us even grant that ſome of the perſpiration was detained here, yet the quantity thereof, together with whatever elſe was abſorbed, did not occaſion any great fulneſs or <hi>plethora;</hi> nor could a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſcence enſue immediately. But ſuch experiments were unſafe on another ſeere; and this we ſpeak of, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010575_0016_0F80D16A2F3645F0"/>
followed by gripings, and a painful wearineſs chiefly affecting the legs, knees and thighs; however thoſe ſymptoms went off on his having ſome plentiful ſtools. Were not thoſe effects owing to the ſudden ſtrong conſtrictions which the outward veſſels and membranes were made to undergo, by the cooler air; the hinderance thence ariſing to the motion of the blood through thoſe parts, from which it was repelled and made to accumulate in the abdominal viſcera; where, happily, for him, the ſecretions were ſoon increaſed ſo as to vent off the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant humours? Let thoſe who can judge of the laws that obtain in the animal oeconomy determine this queſtion.—</p>
               <p>Perſpiration can never be ſtopped in a living body; and the reaſons aſſigned for diſeaſes from an abatement of it are, that not only a <hi>plethora</hi> is thereby brought on, but the humour itſelf is ſuppoſed ſo putreſcent, as makes it in the higheſt degree dangerous, to have any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of detained, even for a ſhort time. Were it, indeed, true, that five-eighths of our food and drink ought to paſs that way, and were it poſſible that this diſcharge could be ſuppreſſed for a number of days together, the appetite continuing good all the while, alarming overfulneſſes undoubtedly would enſue, unleſs the other excretions increaſed according as the perſpiration diminiſhed. But we are well aſſured, that for much the greateſt part of the year, the common quantity of this diſcharge falls far ſhort of the above proportion in Carolina, where the climate is warmer than in Italy; <hi>Sanctorius</hi> himſelf found it ſo for three months, and he might have extended the time ſtill farther, as already hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:010575_0017_0F80D16B29C6C360"/>That there ought to be ſomewhat of a regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in this diſcharge as requiſite to health, no one can doubt; and we may ſay the ſame of all the other excretions, which ſhould have certain proportions, to free the body in different ways, of ſuch things as were <hi>acrid</hi> when firſt taken in; became ſo afterward; or having ſerved the ends for which they were admitted, ought then to be expelled, to make way for freſh ſupplies. As to the quality of that humour which paſſes the pores of the ſkin, thoſe who confide in the doctrine of <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> would do well to diſtinguiſh the notion of <hi>putrefaction</hi> from <hi>putreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence;</hi> for, ſome part of the milk only excepted, all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal fluids are <hi>putreſcent</hi> under certain circumſtances, though a tendency thereto can never happen, ſo long as they circulate regularly; for this implies a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the whole <hi>ſyſtem.</hi> But, why this ſubtileſt of all ſhould be the moſt ſo, and of courſe diſpoſed to infect the reſt of the fluids immediately, more eſpecially in a conſtitution, that, perhaps but an hour before, was in the beſt ſtate, does not clearly appear. We know that the thin excrements may be again abſorbed, without ill conſequences, though they had been mixed with things that were nearly putrid in the inteſtines. Nor can it be with reaſon conceived, why the perſpiration ſhould be more liable to <hi>putrefaction</hi> than the <hi>urine,</hi> which though it conſiſts rather of groſſer and perhaps more corruptible parts than the inſenſible diſcharge, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces no bad effects when refunded into the blood. Of this any perſon may be preſently convinced, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing ſo briſkly, as make himſelf ſweat for an hour or two; when little urine will remain to be voided, though the bladder had been ſo full before, as occaſioned

a ſtrong deſire to empty it <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>When the urine is <hi>analized,</hi> it yields a <hi>tartarous</hi> ſalt, compoſed of an <hi>alkaline</hi> earth, and a ſmall quantity of oil and an acid, which is found adhering to chamber-pots, that are not duly cleanſed. 2dly, An <hi>ammoniacal</hi> ſalt, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from a mixture of volatile with acid ſalts; ſo that, if a little <hi>alkaline</hi> ſalt or quicklime, be added to inſpiſſated urine, a volatile urinous ſmell will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately enſue; as when thoſe ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients are mixed with crude <hi>ſalt ammoniac,</hi> 3dly, A fixed ſalt, which is partly <hi>alkaline,</hi> and in part <hi>neutral,</hi> as common ſalt is. <hi>Vide</hi> opera Hoffmanni in folio, pag. 69.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall by and by enquire, whether the perſpiration and urine be not nearly, if not quite the ſame, with this difference, however, that the inſenſible perſpiration may not contain ſuch groſs <hi>ſaline, ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous</hi> and <hi>earthy</hi> parts as paſs by urine. Whence then does the latter derive ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leterious a diſpoſition, for all thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents exiſted before in the fluids when the perſon was in health; and the like principles are alſo found in the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, of the beſt regulated conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Neither will the ſuppoſal avail, that, as being a humour of the laſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection,</hi> it, for that reaſon, muſt be the moſt <hi>putreſcent,</hi> for, even in this reſpect, it is only on a foot with the other natural diſcharges; which being ſeverally ſecreted and excreted in the due order of time, muſt therefore be perfectly concocted. It ought, however, to be obſerved, that thoſe contents of the urine only appeared in the above manner after they were concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, and perhaps heightened by the great heat uſed in ſuch proceſſes; but were much leſs active, when diffuſed throughout the circulating fluids.</p>
                     <p>I would further take notice, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration is, perhaps, the only diſcharge that cannot be wholly ſtopped, as the urine and ſtools often times are for ſeveral days together, without very dangerous conſequences; and both may be taken up again by the veſſels, and circulate a new with the fluids, as already hath been ſaid. In dropſies, be the patient's drink ever ſo plentiful, little urine will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted in proportion; ſo that whatever ought to have paſſed that way, muſt in ſuch caſes be lodged in the <hi>cellular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,</hi> or cavities of the body, together with the <hi>ſerous</hi> parts of the blood, where they may continue ſtagnated, for ſome months, without fatal effects. When, therefore, a patient recovers from a dropſy, nothing ſeems more plain, than that the humours which had lain ſo long in a ſtate of reſt, muſt firſt be abſorbed, before they can either be expelled through any of the excreting organs, or aſſimilated again in the courſe of circulation, as the veſſels recover ſtrength. It is needleſs to ſay much of thoſe <hi>extravaſations</hi> that happen from contuſions, in which the blood that had for many days been deprived of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is again diſſolved and abſorbed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any injury, though the contrary might be expected; for here as well as in a dropſy, ſome degree of <hi>putrefaction</hi> might be looked for. But as there are ſmall and often times no evidences at all thereof on thoſe and many other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I have thought <hi>that</hi> term was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </note>. Surely no man in his ſenſes, will believe that the perſpiration can poſſibly be ſo <hi>acrid</hi> or <hi>cauſtical,</hi> as the matter which gives the <hi>ſmall-pox;</hi> but though inoculation informs us of the inſtant of time the fluids are infected, yet it commonly requires ſix or ſeven

days, before they are ſo generally tainted thereby to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a fever, in order to expel the <hi>morbifick</hi> cauſe: And the ſame, probably, may be ſaid of other contagious diſeaſes, though we cannot always aſcertain the exact time, when the patients received the firſt ſeeds of theſe diſorders. But if a perſon in health, happens to ſicken preſently after going out of a warm room into the open air, the mode is to impute the diſtemper to a check of the perſpiration; whereas in truth, we ought to look for another cauſe for ſuch ſudden violent effects.</p>
               <p>But were the matter we perſpire really ſo diſpoſed to putrefaction, it might with reaſon be expected, that having brought on a fever of many days, it would in that time become ſo putrid, (from the many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which then concurred to make it ſo) that it would give better proofs thereof, than it commonly does. Yet we are ſeldom ſenſible of much acrimony in the fluids, as they paſs ſo many fine irritable canals in their way to the ſkin, either before or during the <hi>critical ſweat,</hi> though <hi>that</hi> is ſuppoſed to free the body of the <hi>morbifick</hi> cauſe, which, according to the <hi>Sanctorian doctrine,</hi> conſiſts of ſomewhat very <hi>acrid,</hi> or deſtructive of health. To me it ſeems, that were the perſpiration really ſo vicious in its own nature, as immediately to diſpoſe the fluids to putrefaction, its acrimony, or whatever elſe ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous properties are derived from, would be ſo heightened by a fever, that the <hi>ſweats,</hi> ſo much wiſhed for at thoſe times, could not happen, becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions it might occaſion on the fine exhaling veſſels by irritation. Nor would the urinary organs be exempt from the like effects, ſo that the expultion of the <hi>febrifick matter</hi> would be prevented either way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010575_0020_0F80D16D2C3C5740"/>The advantages ariſing from poultices and fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the ſpreading of contagious diſeaſes, among other things, plainly prove, that we receive the ſteams which exhale from other bodies. It is alſo true that each individual perſon in a large company, may, without any preſent or future inconveniency, imbibe ſome of the perſpiration which was diſcharged from a great number of people, of very different conſtitutions, even after it had been diffuſed in the moſt promiſcuous manner, through the heated air of a room. But when any perſon ſickens, after being in ſo crowded an aſſembly (where he ſweated profuſely), the reaſon commonly given is this plain, and not leſs true one, that he was injured by going out of a warm apartment into the cool damp air, heated as he then was.</p>
               <p>But, there are fevers which attack, when no ſenſible abatement of the perſpiration can be impeached; on the contrary, it proceeded freely, ſometimes too profuſely, before they came on, and continued plentiful, or with ſhort interruptions only, throughout thoſe diſeaſes. And we likewiſe know, that this diſcharge is ſmall, for ſeveral months together, at ſome ſeaſons, with great advantage to many. On the whole, we have good grounds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that neither this nor any of the other natural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, are limited to exact or ſtated rules, but vary not only in different people at the ſame time, but even in the ſame men daily, who yet enjoy health.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Lining</hi>'s tables ſhew, that when the urine was greateſt, perſpiration was always leaſt, and the contrary. Hence it ſeems, that in countries where hot and cold
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010575_0021_0F80D16DF98985D0"/>
weather ſucceed each other, the fluids are determined in a fuller ſtream toward the ſkin at one ſeaſon, and are again more repelled into the <hi>viſcera</hi> at another. For this reaſon, the diſcharges from within or through the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pores, muſt increaſe or diminiſh by turns, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the humours are more or leſs directed one way or the other. The difference therefore between the urine and perſpiration, might not be great at the year's end, as Dr. <hi>Lining</hi> diſcovered, though the exceſs was in favour of the former, becauſe the weather was uncommonly cool, during the twelve months he made his experiments.</p>
               <p>As ſuch a conformity appears in the quantity of thoſe two diſcharges, the augmentation of one ſeems intended to make up for any defect in the other, which muſt of courſe happen on a change in the weather. They alſo are the beſt ſuited to anſwer the great end of becoming ſubſtitutes for each other, as being the moſt conſiderable of all the excretions. And though one may not increaſe exactly, in the ſame proportion as the other leſſens, yet they ſeem to act reciprocally as counterpoiſes, when the weight of the fluids and ſtrength of the veſſels are pretty well adjuſted.</p>
               <p>To ſhew the truth of what hath been ſaid, of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in thoſe two diſcharges during hot and cold weather, let us take the <hi>medium</hi> of the perſpiration for twenty-four hours in July, and compare this with its mean quantity for the ſame ſpace of time in February, they will then reſpectively be as eighty-ſeven to thirty-ſeven: A plain proof how greatly the perſpiring veſſels were dilated, and how much more plentiful was the flow
<pb n="21"
                      facs="unknown:010575_0022_0F80D16EA4264D90"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the fluids towards the outward arteries in the ſummer than in winter. Again, if the mean quantity of the urine for twenty-four hours in February, be compared with its medium alſo for the ſame time in July, they will be as ſeventy-eight to forty-four nearly. The difference therefore between the greateſt perſpiration in ſummer, and moſt urine in the winter, does not exceed nine ounces in twenty-four hours: But the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſmalleſt perſpiration, and leaſt urine in the moſt oppoſite ſeaſons, was no more that ſeven ounces; an amazing correſpondence! though to the unthinking part of mankind, thoſe things paſs unheeded, as if they bore no ſort of proportion.</p>
               <p>But a greater agreement ſtill appears between thoſe two ſecretions than reſults merely from ſuch a conformity in their quantities, by which they ſeem intended to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply each others defects at different times of the year. And if they really do ſo, as is likely beyond a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, it ought to follow, that the matter which paſſes both ways, ſhould be nearly, if not quite the ſame; and that it is, an eaſy experiment will ſhow. For, if a ſmall quantity of the perſpiration from the lungs, be collected by blowing in a clean wine glaſs, and ſome urine is made in another, (both being taken faſting, or before the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours have been diluted with freſh <hi>chyle</hi>), any perſon having an acute taſte and ſmell, will at once pronounce that both are urine. Should a little ſalt of tartar be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to each, a ſlightly volatile, but not diſagreeable, ſmell will ariſe from both; and if they be permitted to ſtand for a day, without having any thing mingled with them, a more acrid taſte and ſcent will then be perceived; the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010575_0023_0F80D16F68DA7730"/>
urine, however, being ſtill moſt pungent<note n="*" place="bottom">Beſides the general perſpiration from the greateſt part of the outer ſurface and the lunes, particular drains ſeem appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to free the neighbouring parts, of ſome more highly ſaline and ſulphureous matter. For what perſpires from behind the ears, from the gums, arm-pits, groins and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the toes, hath a raneid offenſive ſmell, which differs in each place. So that could the whole perſpiration be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected together, there is no room to doubt, it would make a mixture, full as acrimonious as the urine is.</note>. Moreover, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeems more plain, than that thoſe ſalts which paſs with the urine in temperate ſeaſons, are diſcharged through the ſkin when the weather is very warm; for black gloves which have been worn, in ſuch a ſeaſon, till they were wet with ſweat, will be covered with a cruſt of white ſalt when dry; and our ſweat alſo has the ſame ſaltiſh taſte. What we then perſpire, ſmells at firſt as freſh blood; but after ſome hours, it communicates a urinous ſcent and yellow colour to our linen: So that if thoſe things do not amount to a full proof, they make it extremely probable, that the perſpiration and urine, free the body in different ways of much the ſame ſort of matter; and that what perſpires from the outward ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and lungs, is the ſame as urine in the kidneys. The pores of the ſkin are ſo many channels, intended to clear the external parts of whatever hath become uſeleſs and unfit to be detained there; the lungs and paſſages leading to them, perform the ſame office for the breaſt and neighbouring parts; the kidneys and inteſtines doing the like for the lower <hi>viſcera;</hi> ſo that, according to their various ſituations, they ſeverally contribute to the ſame great ends. And, though the chief excretions ſeem to go on without any eſtabliſhed rules, in various climates, and in the inhabitants of the ſame country, at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſeaſons, or even in the ſame perſons from day to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010575_0024_0F80D170E714E9D0"/>
day; ſome making more urine, whilſt leſs paſſes by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, the contrary being the habit of another, yet all of them may enjoy health, ſo the requiſites of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral conſtitutions be but anſwered either way.</p>
               <p>Were it indeed true, that a <hi>pletbora</hi> from an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the perſpiration muſt of courſe happen, before inflammatory fevers can attack, it might be expected, that ſuch diſorders would be moſt common in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becauſe a much greater quantity thereof may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a ſhort time, <hi>that diſcharge</hi> being then greateſt, and the fibres very lax and irritable, which renders them ſuſceptible of ſtrong ſpaſmodick contractions from ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cauſes. It, however, falls out quite otherwiſe, for ſuch diſeaſes ſeldom appear with us at that ſeaſon, but moſtly in the winter and ſpring, when perſpiration is little, and, conſequently, leſs likely to produce the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs ſo much contended for. But at no time can ſuch an addition be made to the circulating fluids thereby, in any equal number of hours, as by eating and drinking plentifully, and even intemperately, according to the daily cuſtom of many, without much inconveniency, at leaſt, for the preſent, though ſeveral pounds of freſh chyle, the produce, perhaps, of an ill judged mixture of meats and drinks, paſs into their veſſels oftener than once in the day. It may probably be ſaid here, that the excretions are ſtill going on, and therefore, whatever overfulneſs may happen from ſuch exceſſes, are abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every moment. But is not this equally true on a diminution of the perſpiration? for though the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pores may be occaſionally ſtraitened, yet that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge is ſtill proceeding from the lungs, and it may be

more plentifully, becauſe a greater quantity of blood muſt circulate through that organ in all fevers, ſuppoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hemorrhage or any exceſſive increaſe of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominal ſecretions happens in the mean time; beſides that urine alſo is commonly augmented at ſuch times; ſo that perſpiration is the only diſcharge whoſe defects can be compenſated by another channel. It hath been ſaid, that no great plethora can happen from an interception of the perſpiration; yet, for the ſake of argument, let us even grant, that ſomewhat of an overfulneſs may at times enſue from that cauſe; but then might we not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this would be removed, and that the fever it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ought to ceaſe, after repeated bleedings, ſweatings and the like evacuations ſo commonly made in ſuch caſes; more eſpecially as the appetite fails for every thing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept drink or thin nouriſhment, which ſoon paſſes off. Nevertheleſs the diſeaſe too often continues, though the patient is ſo emptied, that he can ſcarcely be known. Beſides, nothing is ſo notorious, as that the body ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is exceedingly waſted by a fever of a few days, though no artificial evacuations had been made, and little paſſed by any of the ſenſible diſcharges; the patient alſo having all this while been well ſupplied with ſuitable diet. No way then remains to account for this great loſs of ſubſtance, but by ſuppoſing the perſpiration to have been vaſtly increaſed, from the lungs moſtly, for the ſkin, tongue and throat, are at times dry and parched on thoſe occaſions.</p>
               <p>Whether thoſe things will be conſidered in the ſame light by others, I know not; but to me it ſeems, that whatever <hi>plethora</hi> may enſue, from a temporary and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010575_0026_0F80D1742E9AC558"/>
partial check of the perſpiration (for partial it muſt be), cannot of itſelf ſo often bring on a fever, as already hath been ſaid, if it can at all. For according to <hi>Sanctorius</hi> himſelf, were the whole of it detained, it would only make an addition of one pound to the fluids in twenty-four hours, from the autumnal equinox to the winter ſolſtice; or of thirty-ſeven ounces in the ſpace of one day and night in February, according to Dr. <hi>Lining;</hi> and ſuppoſing ſtill, which yet can ſcarcely be, that the whole of this were matter that ought to have perſpired, without any addition being made to it, by the moiſture abſorbed from the air. However, this is only mentioned in order to give the argument its full ſcope, but without admitting that an entire ſtop can poſſibly be put to the perſpiration, ſo long as the humours circulate at all.</p>
               <p>If a dangerous overfulneſs cannot well ariſe from a detention of the perſpiration, in the common courſe of things, as little is its ſuppoſed proneneſs to putrefaction likely to bring on a violent diſeaſe ſo ſuddenly, as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens to people who, but a few hours before, were healthy and ſtrong; for ſurely it is difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how either the quantity or quality of that fluid which might occaſionally be intercepted, could excite ſuch diſtreſſing and hazardous effects in ſo ſmall a time. I would aſk thoſe who maintain the doctrine we have been cenſuring, Whether it can fairly be imputed to an abatement of the perſpiration, that a perſon on going out of a warm room into the cool moiſt air, or that the man who drinks cold water, or ſits down on the damp ground when he is much heated with exerciſe, ſhall immediately ſhiver, and have a fever, pleuriſy, or quinſy?
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010575_0027_0F80D174C8A17130"/>
That one who plunges himſelf into the water whilſt he is ſweating freely, ſhall inſtantly become rigid, inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and die in a few hours? or that thoſe who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to rain in the ſummer, or ſleep only for a little while out of doors at night during that ſeaſon, ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be cramped al over, and have a <hi>tetanus,</hi> or ſome other dangerous diſeaſe? Many inſtances in all thoſe ways have I known, and ſuch effects ought undoubtedly to be aſcribed to ſome other cauſe, than a diminution of the perſpiration alone: We alſo know for certain, that this diſcharge undergoes remarkable checks, for many hours together, without much inconveniency, as almoſt every man can recollect to have happened to himſelf on various occaſions.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the immediate cauſe of Fevers.</head>
               <p>THOUGH it be not the lot of man to enjoy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant health, many perſons however are happily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with ſuch well conſtructed conſtitutions, that, for a number of years together, the veſſels every where have proper ſtrength, and continue ſo flexible withal, that the fluids they contain, can paſs freely from the heart to all parts of the body, and return without any hinderance to that organ. Under circumſtances like theſe, every part receives only its natural proportion of the blood; the ſeveral ſecretions and excretions will be made in regular order; and as no redundance can happen, ſo nothing will fall ſhort, till the equality of action and re-action that ſubſiſted between the ſolids and fluids is interrupted; and then the <hi>natural, vital and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal functions</hi> muſt be diſordered in proportion. It therefore ſeems plain that when any man is attacked with a fever, in whom the conſtitution was ſo well diſpoſed immediately before, the fault could not have been in the fluids; for they neither exceeded in quantity, nor erred in quality, but in the veſſels alone, owing to ſome change in the condition of their coats; for, paſt all doubts, they are not now in the ſame ſtate as before; and according to the alteration they have undergone, ſo muſt more or leſs of diſorder enſue in the diſtribution of the blood, and conſequently in all things that depend on its regular circulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:010575_0029_0F80D1763A6A1A00"/>I know but two ways, in which the equality of mutual action between the ſolids and fluids can be broken in upon, or, in other words, that a diſeaſe can happen; namely, when the veſſels are ſo diſtended by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural rarefaction of the humours, that they cannot cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate freely; but ſuch an expanſion ſeldom occaſions a diſtemper in temperate climates; and muſt then be owing to too much heat, a cloſe confined air, or ſuch as does not gravitate ſufficiently, whence ſudden death ſometimes enſues. Nor does any thing prevent the blood from being expanded by the natural heat of our bodies, ſo as to deſtroy us, but that this is checked and kept within bounds by the ſuperiour ſpring of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Diſorders of this ſort, however, not being the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our preſent inquiry, we ſhall paſs to the other, which is by far the moſt common cauſe of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>It is very ſingular, that almoſt every fever ſhould be preceeded by a ſenſe of coldneſs in ſome degree; and the greater this, and longer its continuance, the more dangerous for the moſt part is the diſorder. This chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs may come on ſuddenly; but, more frequently, the patient hath ſucceſſive chills and fluſhings, perhaps, for ſome days; and in the mean time, an irkſome ſort of wearineſs is perceived, chiefly about the legs, knees and thighs, together with a liſtleſſneſs of the other parts, and of the mind alſo; yet, all this while, the pulſe, though ſomewhat hard, may not be much quickened. Thoſe ſenſations of coldneſs, return oftener and continue longer, more eſpecially if the perſon expoſes himſelf to the wind; and the other ſymptoms likewiſe increaſe, till at laſt a ſtrong ſhivering or <hi>horror</hi> comes on. At this
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010575_0030_0F80D17A355EA4B8"/>
time the hands and feet are cold, the veins which lie immediately under the ſkin diſappear, and the face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the other outward parts are pale, and, as it were, ſhrunk or contracted. An inſatiable thirſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends; a painful ſtiffneſs is felt in the joints and all the external muſcles; but ſtill moſt ſeverely from the hips downwards. And as the fluids are now made to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate in the internal and ſuperiour parts, a ſickneſs at the ſtomach, anxiety, quick-breathing, and head-ach en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, with great heat about the <hi>epigaſtrium,</hi> breaſt and forehead, which, after ſome time, diffuſſes itſelf over the body and limbs, ſo proper care be taken. The pulſe is confuſed, ſmall, hard and very quick during the <hi>horror;</hi> but it becomes ſomewhat fuller, more ſoft and ſlow when the cold fit ceaſes: Yet it is common for the ſick to be more or leſs chilly at times, throughout every acute diſeaſe, at all ſeaſons, more eſpecially on turning in bed, or when the clothes are lifted up, ſo as to admit the cool air to the ſkin.</p>
               <p>If I judge rightly, the above ſymptoms clearly ſhow, that the motion of the fluids is in ſome meaſure inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in moſt, if not all, the outward veſſels and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; the ſmall contracted pulſe, points out ſome fault in the coats of the arteries, which are too much braced to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the blood either to enter or paſs them freely; and the paleneſs of the face and ſhrinking of all the outward parts likewiſe make it evident, that the ſkin together with the contiguous membranes are ſpaſmodically affected. It is no leſs worthy of obſervation, that this conſtriction took place in ſome degree, before any perceivable quickneſs happened in the pulſe, and, likewiſe, that from the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010575_0031_0F80D17AD06B3388"/>
time it came on, even in the ſlighteſt manner, health was impaired in proportion. But the bad effects of it appeared ſtill more clearly in time of the ſhivering; for the contraction having then not only become ſtronger but alſo more general, by communicating itſelf to a great number of veſſels, and other membranous parts, whatever of order ſubſiſted before, in the <hi>natural, vital, and animal oeconomy,</hi> was thereby confounded. If thoſe things be true, as they certainly are, may we not ſafely conclude, that the immediate cauſe of feveriſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, is an unnatural conſtriction of the arteries in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and that the ſtronger this, and the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of veſſels it affects, the more ſevere muſt be the diſtemper.</p>
               <p>The outward branches of the <hi>deſcending aorta,</hi> are probably, moſt expoſed to accidents of this ſort, from cold or moiſt air, as being diſtributed through much the greateſt part of the body, and conveying the blood to places moſt diſtant from the Heart, where its <hi>velocity and momentum are ſmall;</hi> for which reaſon ſuch conſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may the eaſier be brought on them. And we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly find, that the heat fails firſt and moſt in the legs and feet; and the painful ſtiffneſs is alſo more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable there than in other parts.</p>
               <p>Whatever can give much pain or ſtimulate the nerves, ſo as to cauſe them to excite ſuch conſtrictions, may bring on a fever. But we do not ſuppoſe all the arteries muſt be thus affected, to produce the diſeaſe, it being fully ſufficient for this purpoſe, that ſo many of them ſhould be ſo diſordered, as will occaſion an irregular
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010575_0032_0F80D17B94AC1188"/>
diſtribution of the blood; and that they be kept in this ſtate to continue the diſtemper. Nothing is more known, than that there are plain ſigns of great laxneſs in ſome veſſels, whilſt at the ſame time, others are apparently too much braced; witneſs the ſmall hard pulſe, and brown parched tongue in choleras and fevers with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, purgings, profuſe ſweats, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It will probably be admitted, that ſome degree of ſpaſm, does, indeed, take place in time of the <hi>horror,</hi> but that this muſt be removed, before a general warmth can return, more eſpecially ere the patient can ſweat, or the urine become thick. But we are well aſſured, that diſtreſſing ſpaſms of particular parts oftentimes happen, and yet only a hardneſs, without much quickneſs, will be perceived in the pulſe, as is found in nervous and other colicks; the headaches, choakings, and ſome other complaints, common to hyſterical and hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal people, in the biliary ducts during a jaundice, and even in the <hi>Tetanus</hi> itſelf, except during the general temporary contractions which are common to that cruel diſeaſe. So, in endeavouring to eſtabliſh the above theory, it was no where inſinuated, that the arteries muſt be ſo conſtricted, as wholly to prevent the fluids from paſſing; though this ſeems nearly the caſe ſometimes in thoſe of the extreme parts, during the ſevere <hi>horrors</hi> of <hi>quartan and tertian intermittents.</hi> But that is a ſtate of ſuch violence, as no conſtitutions can ſupport for many hours together; and we accordingly find, that they who die of thoſe diſeaſes, never recover a proper warmth after the <hi>horrors</hi> attacked; either a <hi>mortal anxiety, lethargy, convulſions,</hi> or an <hi>apoplexy</hi> ſoon
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010575_0033_0F80D17C25190648"/>
enſuing: Till the fatal ſtage of a fever, or probably juſt at the inſtant of death, this ſpaſm may be ſtrongeſt in time of the cold fit; but notwithſtanding the force of it does abate (for abate it muſt) before the body can every where become warm, the action of the heart being now weakened, and its motions much hurried, by the precipitous return of the <hi>venous</hi> blood<note n="*" place="bottom">Our moſt gracious Sovereign King GEORGE II. in all likelihood, could not have died ſo ſuddenly, from the burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the right ventricle of the heart, (thin as all the veſſels were ſaid to be) unleſs a general forcible ſpaſm of the coats of the arteries and other muſcular membranes had preceeded, though no perſon happened to be preſent when the horror attacked. The cauſe of his Royal Highneſs the Duke of Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's death, was more palpable; for he underwent two or three ſucceſſive ſtrong rigors or ſhiverings, whereby the fluids were ſo impetuouſly urged into the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ſuperiour parts, that the veſſels of the brain were made to give way to the violent irruption of the blood, that was thus forced upon them.</note>, it neither can receive nor throw out ſuch a quantity of that fluid, nor communicate ſuch an <hi>impetus</hi> to it, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to dilate the conſtricted arteries fully; and they, in their turn, not only refuſe a ready admittance, but a free paſſage alſo to the blood, as already hath been ſaid. Beſides, the coats of the arteries being rendered more elaſtick from the time the ſpaſm came on, and ſtill more ſo by the <hi>horror,</hi> they will maintain, the ſuperiority they have already acquired over the feeble action of the heart, and the little reſiſtance the fluids can make: The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe therefore will not only continue, but may even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, if the cauſe be not removed.</p>
               <p>The ſame reaſoning will hold exactly in thoſe <hi>ſpaſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical contractions,</hi> that ariſe from the irritation of ſome ſort of <hi>acrimony</hi> lying in the ſtomach or inteſtines; and they alſo will continue till that be either corrected or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. As to the occaſional ſweats, and thick urine in
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010575_0034_0F80D17CDE75FD28"/>
fevers, it hath been ſaid, that the ſpaſm needs not be very general to bring on and keep up thoſe diſeaſes; for a perſon may be dangerouſly ill, though only part of the ſyſtem is thus affected; and even in the <hi>opiſthotonos</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſome muſcles commonly are capable of voluntary motions, whilſt others are detained in an unvaried ſtate of violent contraction. Nothing farther can be inferred from thoſe ſweats in fevers, than that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward veſſels are not ſo ſtrongly conſtricted, as wholly to intercept the fluids from paſſing to the exhaling canals; or that the ſpaſm was at ſuch times ſomewhat abated; the thick urine ſhowing the ſame of the ſmall <hi>emulgent arteries.</hi> But, though thoſe unnatural contractions may abate in part, they cannot be ſaid to have ceaſed, ſo long as the pulſe is not ſoft, be it ſtrong or weak, quick or ſlow, this hardneſs being a proof of too great ſpringi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the arteries.</p>
               <p>Having offered ſome reaſons, which, at leaſt, ſeem to favour my opinion of the immediate cauſe of fevers, it may not be amiſs to point out a few of its moſt obvious effects; and thoſe, with others not here mentioned, would be better underſtood, if the notion of ſome <hi>anatomiſts</hi> were true, that the ſeveral different orders of veſſels, conſiſt only of various arrangements of one and the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued canal, which is every where full of fluids. Nay farther, all the flexible parts of our bodies, are, alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the above ſuppoſal; of which were we aſſured it might then be eaſy to account for the <hi>ſympathy,</hi> that evidently takes place between one part of our bodies and another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:010575_0035_0F80D17DA52A6B68"/>Firſt, We obſerved, that from the time the ſpaſm began, and whilſt it was gaining on the veſſels, the equality of reciprocal action, which ſubſiſted before between them and the fluids, was interrupted, and health alſo declined in proportion to the force and extent of that contraction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the blood was tumultuouſly puſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the viens at the time of the <hi>horror,</hi> becauſe of the ſtrong preſſure that was then made on them, by the conſtriction of the ſkin and other <hi>muſcular membranes,</hi> the coats of thoſe veſſels being likewiſe rendered more ſpringy thereby, it is plain, that the heart ought either to have admitted and expelled more blood in the ſame time than it does in health, or performed its motions quicker. But the former not being poſſible, nor probable could it even receive ſo much, becauſe its <hi>muſcular fibres</hi> might be <hi>ſpaſmodically affected</hi> in ſome degree, the latter una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably happened.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the capacities of all the arteries, on which this ſpaſm acts (1.), muſt be leſſened in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo they can neither receive nor tranſmit their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural quantities of the fluids, ſo long as they continue in that ſtate: An overplus muſt therefore be admitted by others, over and above what they ought to contain, were the circulation every where free. And the ſtronger this check in any conſiderable number of veſſels, the more muſt the blood be collected, and the greater its impetus in thoſe that are more open and paſſable, as being but little or not at all affected with the ſpaſm; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs where ſuch overfulneſſes happen, as diſable the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries from contracting themſelves properly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:010575_0036_0F80D17E5F001C88"/>Fourthly, From this obſtruction (1. 2. 3.) to the free and equal diſtribution of the fluids, ſome ſtop muſt be put to the ſucceeding blood; this again will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to <hi>that</hi> which follows, and ſo on, till ſo much as cannot paſs the conſticted veſſels, is made to recoil, by an inverted ſort of circulation, on thoſe that have not undergone any unnatural contractions, or on theſe that are leaſt able to reſiſt its weight and <hi>impulſe.</hi> The over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus will, therefore, fall chiefly on ſuch veſſels as are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally weak, or on thoſe that are not ſupported by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding muſcles: And we accordingly find, that thoſe of the <hi>viſcera</hi> and <hi>brain,</hi> are always over-charged in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, if nothing happens to vent the redundance, which elſe muſt enſue in them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Under circumſtances like thoſe (4.) the the veſſels that are thus too much diſtended, cannot clear themſelves of this additional quantity of the blood, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe they are ſo ſtretched thereby, that they have not the power to complete their <hi>ſyſtoles;</hi> but chiefly, for that the veſſels in other parts, are not at preſent in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to receive their full proportions of the fluids.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, When things have come to that paſs (5.), ſuppoſing the ſpaſm ſtill gaining, and urging the fluids yet more into the internal and ſuperiour parts, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſtrength being at the ſame time greatly ſpent, the blood will then be compelled to retire within a narrow compaſs; and, at laſt, being moſtly collected in the brain, lungs, and large veſſels near the heart, the ſmall arteries in the outward and extreme parts ſhut themſelves up; the arms and legs loſe their heat, and the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010575_0037_0F80D182B5396978"/>
fleſh feels hard. The aortas no longer receive the blood freely from the heart; this organ can admit but little from the <hi>vena cava</hi> and <hi>pulmonaris;</hi> the lungs alſo being already overfilled, receive only a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity from the heart. But here let us ſtop! for to thoſe who are much weakened, the laſt hour cannot now be far off. Nay, when the like ſymptoms happen to them, who enjoyed a good ſhare of ſtrength but an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, death muſt ſoon enſue, if they cannot be ſpeedily relieved. They therefore who are cut off by acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, may with truth be ſaid to die a violent death; for the actions of thoſe organs on which life depends, are ſtopped and as it were overwhelmed by this exceſſive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of the fluids in them, the veſſels in other parts, being very generally cloſed at ſuch times; ſo that the patients yield as <hi>victims</hi> to the vehemence of the ſymptoms, rather than becauſe their bodies are drained of the reſources of life. For in thoſe diſtempers that prove mortal in a few days, enough of fluids often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times remains to the laſt gaſp to continue life, were the veſſels but in condition to circulate them regularly. On the other hand, when any perſon ſinks under a hemorr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hage, cholera, purging, ſpitting, or other ſudden or ſlow diſcharges, the body is in the end ſo deprived of its juices, that a ſufficiency of them is not left to fill the remote ſmall veſſels; which, for want of the uſual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to their contractibleneſs, and becauſe the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectile force</hi> of the heart is then very ſmall, ſhut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to their axes.</p>
               <p>It is needleſs to recount more effects of this ſuppoſed unnatural conſtriction, for any others that can happen in
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010575_0038_0F80D18350D73BC8"/>
the courſe of feveriſh diſeaſes, may eaſily be underſtood from the ſame manner of reaſoning. And though, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, this ſpaſm does not always produce fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, yet, what we have related will appear in ſome degree in every fever, unleſs the ſymptoms be abated by ſome diſcharge or other, to prevent the overfulneſſes that elſe muſt enſue, in the internal and ſuperiour veſſels.</p>
               <p>Should thoſe things be true, may not many ſymptoms which are daily ſeen in fevers, be eaſily accounted for, from the irregular diſtribution of the fluids, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in conſequence of this <hi>ſpaſmodick conſtriction of the arteries,</hi> whereby the blood is ſtrongly repreſſed from ſome parts, and made to accummulate in others <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>It will probably be objected, that in thoſe complaints the blood is evidently inflamed, as appears from the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or pale tough ſkin, with which its ſurface is covered; the red part or grume being likewiſe larger and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum commonly leſs in quantity than in health. But ſetting aſide the conſideration, of the effect cold air may
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:010575_0039_0F80D18437C680E0"/>
have in contributing to thoſe appearances, when that fluid is expoſed to it in a ſtate of reſt, we will even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the blood to be really more denſe in inflammatory fevers; yet it is not leſs true, that it was by no means ſo, before its velocity had been unnaturally augmented, and it ſuſtained a continued ſtrong com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, from the great force the arteries acquired, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other conſequences of thoſe cauſes. But, let the conſtrictions be removed, ſo that a regular circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may follow, the fever with its painful ſymptoms will then ceaſe, and, in a little time, no ſuch <hi>viſcidneſs</hi> will be ſeen, becauſe the blood ſoon recovers its proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, after regaining a free and equal diſtribution throughout the ſyſtem, and is no longer under the like reſtraints in paſſing the veſſels.</p>
               <p>It is commonly thought, that perſons of ſtrong full habits, are moſt liable to inflammatory diſtempers; but the effects of this ſpaſm will be the ſame in weakly people, though no <hi>plethora</hi> took place before, provided the weather favours thoſe diſorders; and the like tough ſkin will alſo be ſeen on their blood, but not in ſo great a degree. I have often times known women ſeized with ſevere <hi>pleuriſies, peripneumonies,</hi> or <hi>quinſies,</hi> after being much weakened by an abortion, or a flooding. The ſame complaints have likewiſe been brought on tender ſubjects by a <hi>colick;</hi> for the conſtrictions, that in this caſe aroſe at firſt in the ſtomach, from the irritation of an <hi>acid acrimony,</hi> being communicated by ſympathy to the outward ſmall veſſels, a <hi>horror</hi> thence enſued; and whenever that happens, be the cauſe what it will, more or leſs of fever muſt enſue; the diſeaſe, moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010575_0040_0F80D184695E2A08"/>
being of that ſort which then prevails, no matter of whatever age or conſtitution the patient may be. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, we ſee the ſtrongeſt men have intermittents, or fevers of the depreſſed kind in July and Auguſt; and on the other hand, puny perſons and infants alſo, are liable to inflammatory diſorders in the winter.</p>
               <p>I will further obſerve, that acute diſtempers ſeldom continue with the ſame violence and intenſeneſs of heat; for very commonly the patients have either ſenſible or obſcure chillineſſes at times; and then it may be juſtly concluded, that the ſpaſm is ſtill gaining and the diſeaſe increaſing in conſequence. At the time of thoſe chilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the pulſe is more quick, hard and ſmall, and all the former ſymptoms are heightened; for ſuch ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings truly are <hi>horrors,</hi> which not only aggravate the <hi>ſpaſm</hi> that acted before, but make it extend to a greater number of veſſels, whereby the diſorder will at leaſt be prolonged. Such occaſional ſhiverings ſhould therefore be prevented if poſſible, by keeping the patients pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly covered, according to the weather, for every time the cold air hath acceſs to their bodies, thoſe <hi>horrors</hi> will more certainly come on, eſpecially in the winter.</p>
               <p>If I have not explained myſelf clearly on the nature of the <hi>ſpaſm</hi> I meant to eſtabliſh, let us ſuppoſe it were poſſible, to have all the veſſels of the human body laid open to view; the heart at the ſame time propelling the blood throughout the ſyſtem, and receiving it back again from the veins, as is regularly done in health, here, were a preſſure made on any conſiderable number of arteries, ſo as to ſtraiten them in an equal degree
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:010575_0041_0F80D18520EC7398"/>
with the <hi>morbifick conſtriction</hi> we ſuppoſe, the veſſels in other places would be ſeen to ſwell; and the more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous thoſe that are preſſed, and greater the weight applied, the more would the fluids be made to retire thence and accumulate in others, where overfulneſſes muſt enſue, in proportion to the check given to the progreſs of the blood through the confined veſſels. All this is plain enough, and ſomewhat of the ſame ſort as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly happens, whenever the coats of the arteries are <hi>ſpaſmodically</hi> affected.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the cure of common, continued, and inflammatory fevers.</head>
               <p>I HAVE for a long time thought, that, among the variety of diſtempers to which we are liable, <hi>fevers,</hi> in particular, have been divided in too many claſſes; nor are the ways of treating them leſs diverſified. It might have been meant by this ſhew of exactneſs, to leave us as little room as poſſible, to miſtake one diſeaſe for another; but, in my opinion, that end had been better anſwered by fewer principles, ſo they were well defined. For experience hath convinced me, that it matters not much, under what forms ſeveral acute diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders appear, or whatever may be the ages or conſtitutions of the patients (when no particular acrimony prevails), provided the complaints agree in ſome circumſtances with others, that are commonly believed to be of very different natures; and for no reaſon that I can perceive, but becauſe ſome ſymptoms fall more on one part than another. Hence the diſeaſe hath ſome name, which ſuits well enough in converſation; but it ſhould not be thence inferred, that any material difference ought always to be made in the manner of curing it, more eſpecially at its firſt onſet. For if it be granted, that a <hi>ſpaſmodick contraction of the arteries is the immediate cauſe of fevers,</hi> and that the ſymptoms which happen in the courſes of thoſe diſtempers, are owing as it were to an inverted or irregular circulation of the blood, what hath
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:010575_0043_0F80D186C7B1E110"/>
juſt now been ſaid, will not appear ſo chimerical; more eſpecially when it is applied to ſuch feveriſh complaints as attack thoſe, who but a few hours before were in health.</p>
               <p>It would be needleſs, to give many inſtances of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I have for many years uſed with ſucceſs, to remove common continued, or inflammatory fevers, within the firſt or ſecond day, when they were not attended with a purging, which happens but ſeldom in the latter ſort. But for an example, let us ſuppoſe a ſtrong man to be attacked with <hi>a pleuriſy;</hi> yet, though this be as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and diſtreſſing a malady, as almoſt any we are liable to, it will be removed in a few hours by purging and ſweating, ſo the diſcharges be but plentiful, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is properly taken care of. Nor will the reaſon, why this management ſhould have ſo good effects, be a ſecret to thoſe, who recollect what hath been ſaid on the conſtrictions of the external veſſels, and the overfulneſſes they occaſion within; which being only effects of the former, are more directly abated by purging, than any other evacuation that can be made; and therefore, whatever inflammation or obſtruction might have enſued from the preſent diſtended condition of the internal veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, will be prevented by thoſe means. For great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated <hi>revulſions</hi> being thus made, as it were immediately from thoſe parts, they will be relieved in proportion, of the overcharges they ſuſtained, by every looſe ſtool. And as the like effects extend to all thoſe veſſels, in which any degree of <hi>plethora</hi> took place, and even to the heart and lungs, each muſt then act with more power, ſo as not only to clear themſelves of whatever
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010575_0044_0F80D1875F87F1F8"/>
plenitude might ſtill remain in them, but alſo by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating a briſker impulſe to the blood itſelf the ſmall contracted arteries will thereby be dilated by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Farther to inſure the patient's ſweating, hot bricks ought to be laid at a convenient diſtance from the feet and legs, to aſſiſt in taking off the unnatural contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that we ſuppoſed were ſtrongeſt thereabouts, by the kindly warmth they give thoſe parts. The effect of this treatment is ſuch, that, after the perſon hath had ſome large ſtools, and ſweated plentifully at the ſame time, the pulſe, which began to ſoften and fill, on the ſecretions being freely promoted in the <hi>abdominal viſcera,</hi> will ſoon become ſlow and natural, as a proof that the ſpaſm is removed, and the blood circulated regularly; all that was required for the cure.</p>
               <p>This is my common way of reaſoning, on the good effects of purging and ſweating, in the early ſtages of fevers, but whether I judge rightly or not, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of ſuch treatment, have been confirmed to me by thouſands of inſtances. To be diligent in obſerving, what the ſame diſeaſe conſtantly requires to remove it, in the moſt ſpeedy and effectual manner, and perfect our judgments therein, with all the certainty that experience and the nature of things will allow, is, in my opinion, the only true way, to eſtabliſh a rational theory and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful practice; as both would then depend on ſuch fixed principles as muſt abide the teſt. Whether I have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded either way, is left to others; but this I may be allowed, that the above theory ſeems to juſtify the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice as this does the former. For, paſt all doubts, had not the veſſels within been too much filled, to increaſe
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:010575_0045_0F80D188AA12CC38"/>
the excretions directly from them, and promote ſo many plentiful ſtools, muſt have had conſequences of the moſt dangerous nature; and, on the other hand, had not the outward parts been too much braced or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted, then, ſurely, to bring on profuſe ſweats by relaxing them ſtill more, had been equally pernicious.</p>
               <p>When I firſt began to uſe this method, ſome diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments happened, from my not attending to that material circumſtance of raiſing and keeping up a proper heat in the legs and feet, and guarding the other parts of the body from cold air, more eſpecially during the winter; the neceſſity for which did not then occur, though it was altogether conſiſtent with the notion of a <hi>ſpaſmodick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction:</hi> But, after care was taken that way, few patients miſſed of relief, unleſs they themſelves or their attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, thought it unneceſſary to comply with ſuch ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly triſling injunctions.</p>
               <p>That the patients may not be obliged to get up, a warm bed-pan muſt always be carefully conveyed to them under the bed-clothes; and their drink and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be given either with a child's feeding-boat, or through the ſpout of a tea-pot, as they lie covered; beſides, when the bricks cool, thoſe ſhould be removed and hot ones put in their places, ſo long as may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Though the fever, together with the painful ſymptoms, will undoubtedly be abated by thoſe means, yet they may not ceaſe on this firſt trial. In that caſe, the medicine muſt be repeated, and the diſcharges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted more briſkly, unleſs the patient be already very weak; but he muſt be ſo, in an extreme degree, to deter
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:010575_0046_0F80D189226ED1C0"/>
us from attempting his relief at once by purging and ſweating, rather than ſuffer an expectoration to come on in a <hi>pleuriſy or peripneumony;</hi> for at beſt, <hi>that</hi> gives only a chance to recover.</p>
               <p>I ought to obſerve, that it is not always neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the laxative, though the ſymptoms be not wholly removed, ſo the moſt accute are abated; for it may then be ſufficient, to make a decoction of poppy-heads and anniſeeds with water; and when the liquor is preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, ſome eſſence of antimony and a little ſugar being added, one common ſpoonful of this mixture muſt be given every half hour, or ſeldomer, according to the caſe, till the patient ſweats freely, and the fever and pain ceaſe. A dry tickling cough is ſometimes trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for a few days after, the diſeaſe is pretty well over; to allay which, I add the inſpiſſated juice of liquorice to the decoction of poppies, and a little of the beſt olive-oil diſſolved with extract of gum arabick, is afterward mixed with the liquor, to be given as above.</p>
               <p>It is evident, that the earlier this method is purſued, ſo much the better will it ſucceed; for if the breathing had been much obſtructed for ſome days, by a ſevere pain in the ſide or breaſt, this, together with the ſpaſm which then acts on the outward veſſels, will cauſe the fluids to accummulate in the lungs; hence a dry cough muſt enſue from anxiety, at the beginning of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; but the ſecretions in that part being afterwards increaſed by degrees, the phlegm that then lies extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated in the <hi>bronchial veſicles,</hi> will alſo excite a cough, by its irritation, to expel itſelf; and thus both the cough
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:010575_0047_0F80D189C2984A98"/>
and ſpitting muſt continue till the overfulneſſes that took place in the <hi>pulmonary</hi> veſſels be removed, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſecretions there ceaſe in conſequence. But thoſe things would not have happened, had the complaint been abated within the firſt or ſecond day; at leaſt they could not be either dangerous or troubleſome; and, in general, the ſame treatment anſwers very well at any time before the expectoration becomes free.</p>
               <p>The patient's chamber ought not to be too cloſe or warm, nor his bed ſtand very near a fire, that the air he breathes may not be hot and dry. His head and breaſt muſt be raiſed high; and though he ſhould be carefully covered, the bed-clothes need not be more than he uſed in health, except from the waiſt downwards, for the ſweat we would bring on, will be ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the hot bricks, and warm drink and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhould be given often, but in ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities. For thoſe purpoſes, weak ſage tea ſweetened a little with honey, meager broth made with lean meat of any ſort, and thin ſtrained gruel, will ſerve in lieu of every thing elſe.</p>
               <p>This hint for purging, I borrowed from <hi>nature;</hi> for obſerving when inflammatory diſeaſes were moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that thoſe patients who had looſeneſſes at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of fevers, ſeldom were liable to complaints of the ſides, breaſt or parts above; and alſo, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers were generally mild and ſhort, even in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; or, if a <hi>pleuriſy, peripneumony</hi> or <hi>quinſy</hi> came on during the preſent illneſs, this did not happen till the purging ceaſed; and likewiſe, that if the belly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:010575_0048_0F80D18A5E792D90"/>
freely looſe, on the firſt days of pleuriſies or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripneumonies, they commonly were abated thereby: It, therefore, ſeemed reaſonable, that a <hi>diarrhea,</hi> promoted by art, would have good effects in ſuch caſes; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly fell out, and with greater advantages than were expected; but, to confeſs a truth, at my firſt ſetting out in this way, I underwent ſome ſerious reflections, on ſtraying ſo much from the common forms of practiſing. Repeated purging is recommended in inflammatory <hi>quinſies;</hi> but why ſo carefully forbidden in the firſt days of <hi>pleuriſies</hi> and <hi>peripneumonies,</hi> I ſee no reaſon. If this caution proceeded from fear, either to delay or prevent the expectoration that of courſe is expected in thoſe diſorders, one with equal probability would apprehend the ſame, from the large repeated bleedings that are generally made.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Boerhaave</hi> ſays in his 830th and 888th A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſm, is remarkably to the point; for ſpeaking of a peripneumony and pleuriſy, he tells us, <hi>'that a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of bile by ſtool,'</hi> is one of the ways in which a <hi>criſis</hi> happens in thoſe diſorders; and his reſerve <hi>'if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be relieved thereby,'</hi> is as applicable to the other <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions and excretions,</hi> by which he ſays thoſe diſtempers are removed before the 4th day. How a ſuitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the <hi>abdominal ſecretions,</hi> may relieve the veſſels in the <hi>thorax</hi> of their preſent overfulneſſes, and thereby prevent an obſtruction, which might end in an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I eaſily perceive, but cannot ſo readily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the meaning of the word <hi>concoction,</hi> ſo commonly uſed in ſpeaking of fevers, without any erruption or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010575_0049_0F80D18D957EBB38"/>
to a ſuppuration<note n="*" place="bottom">By <hi>concoction,</hi> I ſuppoſe authours mean ſuch a change wrought on the <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick cauſe,</hi> as renders it either inactive and inert, or prepares it for being expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the body by ſome outlet. But in ſimple continued, inflammatory, or other common fevers, to ſpeak of <hi>morbifick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>concoction,</hi> is more likely to lead us into a labyrinth, than ſatisfy our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, more eſpecially at the beginning of thoſe diſeaſes, when they attack them, who juſt before were in health. Indeed it is quite reaſonable, to apply thoſe terms to <hi>contagious diſorders,</hi> and alſo to fevers that ariſe from inflammations tending to ſuppuration, for there a <hi>morbifick matter</hi> is evident; but I have known the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of a large company ſicken in the ſpring or autumn, after ſpending ſeveral days together, on a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arty of pleaſure as it was called. Yet though they all were alike expoſed to the ſame weather by day as well as in the night, and partook of the ſame intemperate exerciſes and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, one perſon however was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after confined by the gout or rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm; another had the quinſy; a third a dyſentery, ague, purging, tooth-ach, and ſo on. Here then it is plain, that the ſame general remote cauſes acted equally on them all; but it is no leſs true, they had as various effects on their different conſtitutions; yet according to the common mode of ſpeaking, each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint here had a <hi>morbifick cauſe</hi> proper to itſelf, the nature of which let thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, who, on all occaſions, adopt ſuch reaſoning, We ſay with propriety, that the eruption, when complete and benign, is a criſis to the firſt fever in the meaſles and ſmall pox; whereas in ſome other acute diſorders, there are certain <hi>exanthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matous</hi> appearances, which never fail to portend death to the patients. Can any thinking man aſſert, that in pleuriſies, peripneumonies, catarrhal fevers, or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous aſthmas, the body is really diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of the morbifick matter by ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which only empties the veſſels that were over charged? or when a fever, quinſy, tooth-ach, head-ach, or even the diſtempers juſt now mentioned, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by purging and ſweating dextrouſly uſed at their beginnings, that this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by our thus expelling their <hi>morbifick cauſes;</hi> or when the conſtitution is much relaxed, both as to the ſolids and fluids, by an intermitting fever; can it be ſaid, that the bark (which cures merely by its bracing qualities, without promoting any one ſenſible excretion) then acts by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling a <hi>morbifick matter</hi> of any ſort? I would be underſtood, that no diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature exiſted in the fluids, preceding the attacks of ſimple acute diſeaſes, on thoſe who juſt before were in health; though it cannot be denied that fevers may bring on ſomewhat of this ſort, and then it is to be eſteemed an effect rather that the cauſe of the diſorder, notwithſtanding to may require our attention to remove it.</note>. Farther, if purging be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved at the beginning of the fevers we ſpeak of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a plentiful <hi>diarrhea</hi> leſſens and even ſtops the ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in the ſecond ſtages of them, the effect complained of, is a direct proof of the advantages of briſk purging, at the time we recommend. For nothing ſhews more clearly, how ſudden and great a revulſion is thereby made from the parts affected, by the humours being ſo
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:010575_0050_0F80D18E52CEF100"/>
haſtily carried off another way; whereas, when thoſe complaints are thus far advanced, ſuch a waſte of the fluids ſhould by no means be made; for they ought rather to be detained then, to aſſiſt in diſc<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſing or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving whatever obſtruction or inflammation hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the lungs or elſewhere. The objections, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to purging on the firſt days of thoſe complaints, are ſo far from having any weight, that, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they really ſerve to eſtabliſh the uſefulneſs of it, when the veſſels within are only overcharged or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in part, and before an inflammation hath come on.</p>
               <p>I follow the ſame method at the beginning of every common fever, when the belly is not already looſe enough; for at ſuch times, it is by no means ſufficient, that the patients have ſtools as in health (which yet hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens but ſeldom in the firſt days of inflammatory diſeaſes), becauſe, however well this might ſuit, when all the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſcharges</hi> proceed in due order and proportion, ſomething more will be neceſſary, now, that this harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is broken in upon. Nor will clyſters fulfill the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as much experience hath convinced me; not to mention, that, according to the foregoing theory, there are good reaſons againſt the uſe of them.</p>
               <p>The advantages of removing all fevers ſpeedily, and in particular thoſe of the ſides and lungs, are too many and great to need many words. And it is needleſs to ſhow, how preferable the above method is, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of bleeding the patients not only largely at once, but alſo repeatedly, which yet often fails to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

thoſe complaints, probably, becauſe ſome rules above laid down, are not obſerved, I mean, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting ſweats after ſuch evacuations; for, let the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients loſe ever ſo much blood, enough of that fluid will ſtill remain to renew the pain, ſo the ſpaſm of the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be permitted to continue. Nay, it may even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtronger, and communicate itſelf to a greater number of veſſels, the more the fluids are diminiſhed, unleſs care be taken to prevent this; for the latter being the only antagoniſts, to the ſtrong diſpoſition the arteries have to contraction, when this is not properly reſiſted, they will cloſe themſelves in proportion. Granting, however, the diſeaſe to be cured by a great loſs of blood, this happens preciſely by emptying the veſſels, though in a leſs direct manner than we propoſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the nature and ſeat of the complaint, but with this difference, that it weakens the patient much more than purging and ſweating. Suppoſing after all, that the diſtemper is not removed by bleeding, weakened as the patient already is, his recovery will then depend on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration alone, which muſt not only be plentiful, but of a good quality alſo. A dangerous condition ſurely! for however well ſuited this diſcharge may be, we have too many fatal inſtances to prove, that it may be eaſily ſuppreſſed by various accidents; beſides many ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence oftentimes enſue, from this manner of termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating thoſe diſeaſes. For thoſe reaſons, an expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould not be ſuffered to come on at all, if by any means they can be cured without it. But it is worthy of remark, that when recovery is effected even that way, it is really compleated at laſt, in the manner we propoſe at firſt, by emptying the internal veſſels at once,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:010575_0052_0F80D18FAF52A790"/>
which is gradually done by the ſpitting; but with much more hazard to the patient. One the whole, be the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of thoſe diſtempers abated by whatever means, a ſweat will nevertheleſs come on ſooner or latter; when, and not before, the pulſe becomes ſlow and natural, in evidence that the ſpaſmodick conſtrictions of the arteries are then removed, as already hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p>In ſome countries, bleeding may perhaps be more neceſſary in inflammatory fevers, than I have generally found it in <hi>South-Carolina;</hi> yet, be this operation ſo needful or not here, it is no where more practiſed. Thoſe who are of opinion, that they ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from a rule, which hath ſo long been as it were univerſally eſtabliſhed, may order ſome blood to be taken away if they pleaſe, ſo the patient be ſtrong; but I ſeldom do, unleſs the diſorder had been of ſome days continuance, or the pain in the ſide ſo acute, to obſtruct breathing greatly, and thus occaſion the fluids to accumulate in a high degree in the lungs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, for the moſt part, much bleeding weakens the ſick rather than gives laſting relief. For though the pain abates ſometimes, during the flow of blood from the vein, and may be eaſier for a ſmall time after, it will ſurely return, ſo the ſpaſm continues, when every thing remains ſtill to be done, as if no blood had been loſt. I therefore depend on purging and ſweating, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally certain of ſucceſs that way, provided the diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be plentiful, and things are properly conducted in other reſpects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:010575_0053_0F80D19066413E50"/>By this method, women have been cured of <hi>pleuriſies</hi> and <hi>peripneumonies</hi> in every ſtage of pregnancy, though inflammatory diſeaſes are known to be full of danger to ſuch ſubjects. One, in particular, being ſeized with an <hi>acute pleuriſy</hi> in the eighth month after concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was effectually relieved in leſs than twelve hours; and ſhe was as ſpeedily recovered of a relapſe, brought on by her going into a wet room, on the third day after the firſt illneſs, though the latter attack was equally ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere with the former; and in the ſpace of ſeven weeks ſhe was delivered of a healthy child. Another of a middling conſtitution, who relapſed twice into the ſame diſtemper in the ſpace of three weeks, was at each time ſo ſoon freed of it, that her ſtrength was but little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, after having been thrice ſeized with the <hi>pleuriſy</hi> within ſo ſhort a time. But in truth, the patients ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are more weakened by that diſtemper, when treated in the above manner at the beginning of it, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens from any other ſmart fever, of equal continuance. May I be allowed to obſerve, that had thoſe two women been managed in the moſt approved uſual way, the chance to recover, would have been much againſt them. I do not confine this practice to our natives alone, but apply it to the ſtrongeſt Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when attacked with thoſe diſeaſes, on their firſt landing here in the winter, and the ſucceſs is alike in both.</p>
               <p>I am not over anxious about the choice of medicines; but avoiding ſuch as are very irritating, and as there ſtill is a preference, I chiefly uſe <hi>manna, Epſom ſalt, elixir ſalutis, Kermes mineral</hi> rightly prepared, <hi>eſſence of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:010575_0054_0F80D19135830150"/>
ſalt of tartar, magneſia, &amp;c.</hi> which being variouſly combined, are made either in mixtures with water, or in powders, together with ſome drops of chemical oil, either of <hi>mint,</hi> or ſome other aromatick plant. But in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever form they be adminiſtered, the ingredients ought to be ſo proportioned, that by giving a ſmall doſe of the compoſition every hour, the expected operation may be brought on, by the time the patient hath taken it four or five times; and whenever he begins to purge, the medicine ought to be diſcontinued, for more ſtools will follow, which, together with the ſweat that ſoon comes on, often remove the diſeaſe at once, or leave us little more to do. Every thing however ought to be given warm for ſome days; and the patient ſhould lie in bed at leaſt forty-eight hours, having hot bricks near his feet, more eſpecially during the winter, to prevent his catching cold, which would ſurely bring on a relapſe; for the ſolids being ſtill very <hi>irritable,</hi> a <hi>ſpaſmodick conſtriction</hi> will now be more eaſily brought on, than if they had not ſo lately been affected that way. And for the like reaſon, he muſt afterwards expoſe himſelf by degrees to the open air; in the middle of the day for ſome time, and then only, when the weather is fair and warm; but if it be cold, he ought to be confined ſome days longer to bed, with hot bricks to his feet, in caſe he perceives himſelf chilly, or thoſe parts have not a good warmth.</p>
               <p>Though a tedious or dangerous ſpitting will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by thoſe means, it muſt yet be confeſſed, that a ſmall cough and pain in the ſide ſometimes remain; but without any other marks of a fever, than ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of hardneſs in the pulſe; and this will more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:010575_0055_0F80D191DDDF1070"/>
happen, if the diſeaſe continued ſome days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore relief was ſought: Thoſe ſymptoms, however, very commonly yield to ſuch a decoction of poppies, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hath been mentioned; but the perſon ought ſtill to be carefully guarded againſt cold, and have all things given him warm. The ſide, likewiſe, ſhould be cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly bathed with a mixture of brandy, ſpirit of ſal am moniac and laudanum (or opium had better be diſſolved in the brandy), the part being afterward cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a flannel ſqueezed hot out of the ſame ſpirit, and a warm tile laid over all. Or a plaiſter of galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, mixed with a litile opium and camphor, may be applied to the place.</p>
               <p>I would remark here, how improbable the common opinion is, that too braced a ſtate of the ſolids, and great compactneſs in the blood, ſhould be ſuch neceſſary circumſtances to diſpoſe us to <hi>inflammatory diſeaſes,</hi> as we are told. For ſuppoſing a <hi>pleuriſy</hi> removed, within the firſt twenty four hours from its attacking a ſtrong man, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more frequently happens in this country, than to ſee it followed, in a day or two, by a <hi>quotidian</hi> or <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> intermittent; though diſeaſes of this ſort, do not require ſuch a conſtitution to favour their appearing, as thoſe of a contrary character are thought to do. Nor do I ſcruple to give the bark to ſuch patients, without regarding their having been ſo lately ill of an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diſtemper; but then I begin with the decoction, and add laxatives and diaphoreticks to it, for the firſt two three days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:010575_0056_0F80D1965BF3D688"/>Every phyſician of the ſmalleſt attention, muſt have obſerved a remarkable difference in the forms of diſeaſes, owing to the temporary changes our conſtitutions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo from the weather, in the ſeveral ſeaſons of the year; and accordingly, the <hi>ſpaſm</hi> we ſpeak of muſt have various effects. Thus we ſee, that ſome of the excretions are at times much abated thereby, whilſt others are not increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in proportion; and again, it promotes exceſſive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, either by ſtool, urine, uterine or other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhages, according as the veſſels in different places are diſpoſed to vent the fluids, with which they happen to be overcharged. And when the reſiſtance to their flowing towards any one part, hath once been leſſened, by an increaſed diſcharge made from it, they will ruſh that way in a freer ſtream, ſo long as any degree of ſpaſm continues on the arteries elſewhere. On ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of this nature, depends the difficulty we find in checking <hi>profuſe ſweats, diarrheas, catarrhal ſpittings,</hi> and other irregular <hi>excretions</hi> of long ſtanding, though no remarkable fever attends; becauſe the veſſels whence they proceed, have become ſo dilated and weak, that their powers of contraction are loſt; and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not detain their contents.</p>
               <p>When the ſecretions within become unnaturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe in fevers, the ſame regard is due to the <hi>ſpaſmodical condition</hi> of the outward veſſels, as in the diſeaſes we have more fully ſpoken of; by keeping the body duly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and laying hot bricks near the knees, legs and feet, whilſt the proper medicines are given to check thoſe precipitous evacuations. But here, as well as in all other diſorders, ſpecial regard ſhould be had, to
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:010575_0057_0F80D196657E28E8"/>
whatever acrimony may have taken place in the firſt paſſages, or paſſed thence to the blood; whether it were an <hi>acid</hi> alone, or a mixture thereof with the <hi>bile,</hi> which, perhaps, might have brought on the diſeaſe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it afterward. In general, the diaphoretick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen ought to be uſed here; and of the cordial brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kind too, when the patient is much weakened and emptied by a catarrhal ſpitting, <hi>cholera, bilious</hi> or <hi>ſerous</hi> purgings or vomitings. But as too bound a belly, is oftentimes the cauſe of the latter diſorder, ſo it will not ceaſe, till the guts are freed of all hard excrements; for whilſt one pellet remains within, their <hi>periſtatick mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> will, as it were, be inverted from the part it lodges in, and of courſe the vomitings muſt continue. But maladies of this ſort, not being the ſubject of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enquiry, we ſhall diſmiſs all farther conſiderations of them.</p>
               <p>Should any one ſtill doubt, that ſuch <hi>ſpaſmodical</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions are in truth the cauſe of fevers, let him but obſerve what happens to the moſt weakened perſons, when the fatal ſtages of diſeaſes commence, and it will then clearly appear, how the ſame effects that aroſe (though in a ſmaller degree, becauſe the patients were ſtrong) at the time this <hi>ſpaſm</hi> firſt attacked, do indeed introduce the ſcene, that concludes the <hi>tragedy</hi> in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who die of any diſtemper. The certain approach of this mortal period, is announced in many of thoſe who are carried off by acute diſorders, by more or leſs of a <hi>horror</hi> or <hi>rigor.</hi> But, notwithſtanding the ſame hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſometimes to them who have been worn out ſlowly by conſumptions, purgings, or ſome other diſcharges of
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:010575_0058_0F80D19724542BC0"/>
long continuance; and in thoſe alſo who are ſuddenly exhauſted by <hi>choleras, hemorrhages,</hi> or otherwiſe, it for the moſt part manifeſts itſelf with equal aſſurance, by a gradual abatement of heat in the hands and feet. And as the veſſels there ſhut themſelves up ſtill more, this gains on the limbs in proportion, ſo that they become cold and ſometimes livid, the circulation being then at an end in thoſe parts. And thus the progreſs of death on the body may be traced; the extreme parts being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible and inanimated, for many hours, perhaps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore life is extinguiſhed in the brain and near the heart. On the other hand, the death of thoſe is more ſudden, in whom a ſtrong <hi>horror</hi> or <hi>rigor</hi> happened, becauſe of the general and violent contractions of the veſſels, which repel the blood tumultuouſly, and as it were at once, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the internal and ſuperiour parts. And as the veſſels within, have not ſtrength to reſiſt ſo impetuous a torrent of the fluids, as is then made on them; and ſeeing the ſpaſm is likewiſe gaining faſt on the arteries and other muſcular membranes, the brain, lungs and heart are ſo quickly deluged and overwhelmed, that an end is ſoon put to the circulation of the blood. In the courſe of my practice, I have ſometimes been preſent when this <hi>rigor</hi> attacked, and always obſerved, that according to the degree of it, death enſued ſooner or later. Though ſome become immediately inſenſible, and cannot move any part from the moment the <hi>horror</hi> came on; others retained both their reaſon and ſpeech for a ſhort while, and complained either of a painful ſtiffneſs as if they were cramped, or a numbneſs of all the fleſhy parts and joints, more eſpecially of the arms, thighs and legs, in ſo much that they could not move them afterwards. On
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:010575_0059_0F80D197E93E3658"/>
the contrary, ſome cannot lie ſtill at all, but toſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about in the moſt reſtleſs manner, ſo long as they are able, from the dreadful ſtifling, which is cauſed by the fluids being exceſſively accumulated in the lungs and large veſſels near the heart: Breathing is then very ſhort, redoubled and <hi>ſuſpirious;</hi> and the patient perceives an intolerable heat about the breaſt, which ſeems to diffuſe itſelf all over his body, ſo that he will not endure any covering, and calls out to be fanned, and to have every window ſet open, be the weather ever ſo rigorous, though at the ſame time, he is bathed with clammy ſweats, and his legs and arms are cold as marble. The anxious reſtleſſneſs we juſt now mentioned, was ſaid to continue ſo long as the patient could move, or, as would ſeem, till the veſſels of the brain became ſo diſtended and full, that they compreſs the origins of the nerves, and then an end is at once put to all further ſenſations. The brain being thus effectually ſurcharged, and the blood ſtill continuing to be propelled that way, the like overfulneſſes begin in the veſſels of the <hi>cerebellum;</hi> and from that inſtant of time, breathing, which before was exceeding ſhort, becomes very ſlow; and the perſon moves no more, but dies in the poſture he lay when that happened. Inſpiration is every moment performed at longer intervals now, and ceaſes as the laſt act of life, when thoſe veſſels are ſtretched and filled, beyond the power of exerting any farther contractions. Such <hi>rigors</hi> are indeed more common at the end of <hi>acute than chronical diſeaſes;</hi> but I have ſometimes ſeen people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover of fevers, more eſpecially from choleras, though the reſtleſſneſs and anxiety we ſpoke of, ſeemed to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that death was near. Yet, whether a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:010575_0060_0F80D198AF1567E0"/>
                  <hi>horror</hi> came on or not, no one ever ſurvived this ſlow breathing, under the circumſtances above deſcribed; it being a proof, that the organ whence the <hi>vital actions</hi> derive all their energy, is overpowered paſt a poſſibility of relief. For before that ſort of breathing happened, ſuch an overfulneſs muſt have been in the veſſels of the brain, that they could receive no more; the whole of the fluids being at thoſe times confined to few veſſels.</p>
               <p>In proportion to the progreſs of this fatal ſpaſm on the arteries and other muſcular membranes, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the blood it occaſions, from the outward into the internal and ſuperiour parts, How ſpeedily do the ſigns of death advance? How anxious is breathing, and how fluttering and ſmall the pulſe; and when it ſcarcely can, or, perhaps, cannot at all, be felt in the wriſt, what a ſtrong throbbing may be perceived in the <hi>carotids</hi> and about the <hi>epigaſtrium?</hi> How much are the veſſels in the eyes diſtended (though they do not appear in health), which gives us reaſon to believe thoſe of the brain are likewiſe in the ſame condition; and conſequently this is ever a bad ſign in acute diſeaſes? Whence proceeds that pale <hi>ghaſtly countenance,</hi> called a <hi>Hippocratick face;</hi> and why does it portend death to thoſe who are much weakened? And laſtly, how it comes that the outward fleſh ſhould be hard and rigid at ſuch times, if no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural bracedneſs took place in the fibres, even of the muſcles themſelves; general convulſions deſtroy ſome; others have only convulſive twitchings all over; ſome again have been watchful or outrageouſly delirious; whilſt thoſe whoſe bodies have been drained of the vital fluids by degrees, are oftentimes ſenſible almoſt to the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:010575_0061_0F80D19963ADC230"/>
laſt gaſp. However, a peripneumony cloſes the ſcene in all who die of any diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall end this eſſay with ſome queries, which, in my opinion, cannot be ſo well explained in any other way, as by ſuppoſing the <hi>ſpaſmodical conſtrictions we mentioned, to be the immediate cauſe of fevers,</hi> owing, probably, to ſome ſort of <hi>irritation</hi> affecting the nerves in their courſes towards, or after they are inſerted in the blood veſſels and other muſcular membranes. And it is not unlikely, When a perſon hath been injured by cold or moiſt air, or a high wind acting on the lungs and outer ſurface of the body, that they produce the ſame effects by ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating too much, as a ſharp humour is known to do, whilſt it lies in the bowels or paſſes thence to the blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether an abatement of the perſpiration, be of itſelf ſo certain and common a cauſe of fevers, as is thought, ſeeing the moſt dangerous often times attack thoſe ſuddenly; who were in health but an hour or two before; ſo that, neither the quantity nor quality of that humour which might then be detained, can, with reaſon, be accuſed of ſuch diſtreſſing effects in ſo ſmall a time?</p>
               <p>Whether, before a fever can come on, the fluids muſt neceſſarily have contracted ſome ſort of acrimony or viſcidneſs, and of courſe, that the ſolids were either too much braced or relaxed? I would be underſtood, that according to the common way of ſpeaking, one or the other of thoſe conditions muſt have exiſted, before the <hi>morbifick cauſe</hi> began to act; or that thoſe of themſelves
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:010575_0062_0F80D19A75B494B8"/>
were ſufficient to produce thoſe effects? but thoſe two queſtions have been already anſwered.</p>
               <p>Why, in general, the more ſevere the <hi>horror</hi> and longer its continuance, ſo much the more dangerous is the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding diſeaſe? At firſt ſight one would expect, that the ſtronger the <hi>rigor,</hi> the more powerful muſt be the cauſe that brought it on, and therefore, the greater would be the difficulty to remove the diſorder that follows. Yet, though this rule moſt commonly holds, we have an exception to it in the violent ſhiverings, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times precede tertian and quartan intermittents, the fits, in either caſe, often terminating in five or ſix hours; perhaps, becauſe the ſolids are lax rather than very ſpringy, and the blood not very compact, before thoſe ſorts of fevers can be formed at all; and therefore, the fibres relax ſooner after a good warmth is regained; the plentiful ſweat which follows putting an end to the fever for that time.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon why thoſe who commonly have cold feet, are in a particular manner liable to diſorders of the <hi>hypogaſtrium</hi> and parts above? This want of heat muſt be owing to a lurking <hi>ſpaſm</hi> acting on the veſſels there, which prevents the free motion of the blood; ſo much of it therefore as cannot circulate freely in thoſe parts, muſt be received by others, over and above what they ought to contain, if a regular diſtribution of the fluids took place. This ſurplus will be admitted where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any local weakneſſes happen, ſo that the effects are extremely various. I never knew any perſon who was habitually liable to ſuch a coldneſs of the legs and feet,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:010575_0063_0F80D19AE3562480"/>
in whom an acid acrimony did not abound, at leaſt in the firſt paſſages, which by its irritation there, or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed thence to the blood, may indeed be the cauſe of the partial ſpaſm we ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>Why are vomitings and purgings ſo common in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers during the ſummer and autumn, and <hi>choleras,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or bilious diarrheas alſo ſhould then be frequent? Becauſe the ſolids are very lax at thoſe times, and the blood much diſſolved. The former therefore are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly irritable and ſuſceptible of <hi>ſpaſms</hi> from ſlight cauſes; and, ſeeing every unnatural conſtriction of the outward parts, repels the fluids in ſome degree, they will now be immediately admitted by the veſſels within; in which overfulneſſes enſuing, their contents will be as readily allowed to eſcape, by an increaſe of ſome ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other. The quantity of returning blood through the <hi>vena portarum</hi> to the liver, being augmented by a <hi>ſpaſm,</hi> a profuſe ſeparation of the bile follows; which, paſſing into the <hi>duodenum,</hi> occaſions vomitings, purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or both; for the gall is of ſo pungent and ſapona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous a nature, that it will ſtimulate the ſtomach and guts ſtrongly to expel itſelf; and thoſe diſcharges will continue till the ſpaſm ceaſes. However, this redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the bile is oftentimes prevented, by increaſed ſecretions made from other organs, as the ſtomach, pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas or inteſtines; and we accordingly find, that the vomitings ſometimes are taſteleſs, and the ſtools pale and purely <hi>lymphatick</hi> or <hi>ſerous,</hi> ſmelling more like freſh blood than excrements.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:010575_0064_0F80D19BAE17B2A8"/>May not the ſurpriſingly profuſe diſcharges of urine, which hyſterical and hypochondriacal perſons ſometimes void, immediately on the attacks of <hi>ſpaſms,</hi> be eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, from the anſwer to the preceeding query? And alſo, how thoſe extraordinary ſecretions in the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys may divert greater evils, in the ſame manner, as if the overfulneſſes of the veſſels within, were abated by vomitings and purgings, as oftentimes happens, to ſuch ſubjects; when ſpaſms are brought on by ſudden ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes or frights.</p>
               <p>Does it not plainly appear from the foregoing theory, why, when the urine becomes clear in fevers, after have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been thick or high coloured, or it had been limpid from the firſt, a <hi>delirium, ſtupor, convulſions, ſtifling an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xieties,</hi> or an <hi>obſtinaie watchfulneſs,</hi> may with reaſon be expected? For ſuch urine ſhows, that the <hi>ſpaſmodical conſtrictions</hi> have become more forcible, as well as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or that they were very ſtrong from the beginning, and amongſt others reached the emulgent arteries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Therefore, as this ſort of urine is generally made in ſmall quantities during fevers, the fluids, for thoſe and other reaſons, muſt ſoon be dangerouſly collected in the internal and ſuperiour parts, if this cannot be prevented.</p>
               <p>How comes it to paſs, that either too great a flow or ſtoppage of the <hi>lochia</hi> and <hi>menſes</hi> may happen from a <hi>ſpaſm?</hi> Anſwer, becauſe of the preſent local laxneſs or conſtriction of the <hi>uterine</hi> and <hi>hypogaſtrick</hi> veſſels, whilſt the external ones are at the ſame time more or leſs <hi>ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modically</hi> affected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:010575_0065_0F80D19C8539D078"/>Whence is it, that, at the approach of death, ſome perſons have better ſpirits and are ſtronger for a little while, the pulſe alſo being then fuller? It probably hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, from an increaſed and more general conſtriction of the arteries, wnich urges the fluids in a fuller ſtream towards the internal and ſuperiour parts; whereby a momentary greater ſecretion of the animal ſpirits is made, as their laſt effort to maintain life. This is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called a lightening before death.</p>
               <p>May not the painful ſtiffneſs that is perceived in the joints and muſculous parts, more eſpecially about the thighs and legs, before a fever, be more reaſonably explained by ſuppoſing a ſpaſmodical conſtriction of the arteries and other muſcular membranes, perhaps of the fleſhy fibres of the muſcles themſelves; the hinderance thence ariſing to the free motion of the blood, and it may be of the animal ſpirits alſo, rather than becauſe the fluids are too viſcid to allow a proper ſecretion of the ſpirits to be made, as ſome authors ſuppoſe? A plentiful ſweat ſeldom fails to abate thoſe ſymptoms, and ſometimes removes them at once; whereas, they ought indeed to be increaſed thereby, had they been owing to too thick a conſiſtence in the blood.</p>
               <p>Do not the paleneſs and contraction of the face and all the outward parts, together with every other appearance in time of the <hi>horror,</hi> clearly ſhow that the ſkin and the ſeveral parts having any immediate connexion with it, are then ſtrongly conſtricted? And does not the ſmall hard pulſe make it equally plain, that the coats of the arteries likewiſe ſuffer in the ſame way; and that they
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:010575_0066_0F80D19D38D0C4F0"/>
continue thus diſordered throughout the diſeaſe, ſo long as the pulſe is hard, no matter whether it be ſmall and quick, or ſtrong and ſlow, as in <hi>comas, apoplexies,</hi> and ſome other diſorders? And ſeeing ſo large a veſſel as the <hi>carpal artery,</hi> undergoes ſo forcible a conſtriction at the firſt onſet of a fever, may not the large trunks and even the muſcular fibres of the heart itſelf, ſuffer like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the ſame manner at times, more eſpecially when diſeaſes draw near their mortal periods? This tightneſs in the pulſe, is imputed by ſome, to too great a denſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the blood, which cannot be, for the ſame happens in ſome degree during the fevers of infants, <hi>anaſarcous</hi> and other much relaxed or weakly people, in whom, ſurely, the fluids cannot with reaſon be accuſed of that fault.</p>
               <p>Does not the great thirſt that comes on before a <hi>horror</hi> attacks, and continues unquenchable in it, the dry hard cruſt likewiſe which preſently covers the tongue, the mouth, throat and noſtrils alſo being parched, make it very plain, that the excreting ducts of the <hi>ſalivary</hi> and <hi>mucous</hi> glands, are then ſtrongly contracted; and the thin parts of thoſe humours exhaling, what remains ſtopped in the extremities of the ducts thickens, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>epithelium,</hi> forms the above dry ſkin? Some authours inform us, that this thick cruſt ariſes from a general diſſipation of the thin parts of the blood, or I know not what <hi>ſeptick</hi> matter; but neither of thoſe can be impeached for its cauſe, ſo early as it oftentimes is ſeen. And it is alſo true, that the thicker and drier it is, ſo much the greater commonly is the danger, that being a ſign of general ſtrong <hi>ſpaſms.</hi> But whenever
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:010575_0067_0F80D19DEE9B51F8"/>
thoſe <hi>unnatural conſtrictions</hi> are removed, this will ſoon diſappear.</p>
               <p>Are not the <hi>nauſea,</hi> the diſtention and throbbing about the <hi>epigastrium,</hi> the pain in the loins and coſtiveneſs ſo common in fevers, owing to an overcharge in the internal veſſels, and a <hi>ſpaſm</hi> that then acts on them, which prevents ſuch an increaſe of the ſecretions there, as might abate this fulneſs, rather than to any acrimony, (though now and then ſomewhat of that ſort takes place in the firſt paſſages); a ſimple dryneſs of the inteſtines, which term has no preciſe meaning; or laſtly, to the want of excrementitious matter in them, (though they frequently are much loaded therewith)? The pain in the loins, may in part ariſe from the <hi>meſenterick nerves</hi> being over-ſtretched, by the ſurcharged blood veſſels, many of which are cloſely ſurrounded by twigs of thoſe nerves <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>Are not the precipitous purgings which ſometimes happen towards the end of fevers, moſt commonly owing to an aggravation of the <hi>ſpaſm</hi> that acted before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the fluids are ſtill more repelled towards the internal parts. And becauſe the ſpring of the veſſels there was weakened, by the continued overfulneſſes they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuffered, they will now yield the eaſier to this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional weight of the fluids, and permit their contents to eſcape. Such purgings are commonly imputed to ſome unknown acrimony or putrefaction of the humours.</p>

               <p>Whence are clammy ſweats, and why do they preſage ſo much danger, when the patient's ſtrength is already ſpent? And the reaſon alſo, why a paleneſs of the face and ſhrinking of the features, ſhould at ſuch times, ſo certainly forebode death? Anſwer, becauſe thoſe are ſigns of very general and ſtrong <hi>ſpaſmodick contractions,</hi> not only of the arteries, but of the ſkin and other muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular membranes likewiſe, whereby, whatever was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the outward excreting canals is preſſed out. The noſe is now pinched; the lips, ears, temples and face are ſhriveled, cold and pale; all the outward parts being ſo forcibly braced, that even the fleſh itſelf feels ſtiff and hard, as having loſt its pliancy.</p>
               <p>I may be thought tedious in mentioning thoſe things, but the deſign was to ſhow, how eaſily many ſymptoms which happen in diſeaſes may be explained; and how a tolerable judgment may be formed, either of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's recovery or death, by comparing what hath been ſaid here, together with the ſecond and third chapters of this eſſay; in which a <hi>ſpaſm</hi> was aſſigned for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:010575_0069_0F80D1A14AC654D0"/>
cauſe of acute diſtempers; that a very general communication of this conſtriction muſt happen, before they can prove mortal to the ſick, and alſo that it muſt be removed, ere the patient can recover. I have already obſerved that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> had ſuch a notion of fevers and their ſymptoms; but, though ſome moderns rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned well on the effects of ſuch unnatural contractions, yet, in my opinion, they did rot alter the method of cure ſo much for the better as might have been expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their great abilities and long experience.</p>
               <p>It hath been ſaid, that when the patient is coſtive, I looſen the belly at the beginning of almoſt every fever, and do not ſuffer it to be long bound afterwards in any one acute diſeaſe, provided the nature of the complaint and condition of the ſick, will at all permit his having two or three ſtools daily; experience having convinced me, that the preſent painful or dangerous ſymptoms may be mitigated, and others prevented thereby, ſo proper care be taken in other reſpects. In ſhort I am bold enough to ſay, that whoever purſues this method of emptying the abdominal veſſels ſufficiently, and, in conſequence, thoſe of the other internal and ſuperiour parts, in the firſt days of inflammatory and common continued fevers, under the management above laid down, will remove them ſooner, and with leſs loſs of ſtrength to the patients, than by any other treatment hitherto propoſed. For, in few words, to recover thoſe who are ill of ſuch diſorders, nothing more ſeems wanting, than to abate whatever overfulneſſes may have happened within, from an inverted circulation of the blood, cauſed by the <hi>ſpaſmodical conſtrictions,</hi> that ſeem
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:010575_0070_0F80D1A1F9A43DA8"/>
to act chiefly and moſt ſtrongly on the external veſſels; and thoſe contractions muſt alſo be removed, elſe the other end will not be anſwered.</p>
               <p>I frequently mentioned the neceſſity, for laying hot bricks at a convenient diſtance from the feet and legs, in fevers; and truly I have found them of ſo great ſervice, that I think they can ſcarcely be diſpenſed with, in very many acute and chronical complaints, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially during the winter, unleſs thoſe parts are inflamed. And I here declare, that they, alone, have given more immediate relief in <hi>hysterical and hypochondriacal ſpaſms,</hi> than could have been reaped from the whole <hi>materia me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica of antiſpaſmodicks</hi> without them; the ſuffocations or convulſions oftentimes abating preſently, without the aſſiſtance of any thing elſe <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The juſtly celebrated <hi>Baron Van Savieten</hi> quotes from <hi>Trillerus,</hi> the caſe of a young man who had been twice plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bled in a <hi>pleuriſy,</hi> and with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as was thought. But on the fifth day the ſymptoms were ſo violent, that the patient's life was in a manner deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. His feet being put in warm water, a vein was opened in each, with a large orifice, but no blood iſſued, ſo cold were thoſe parts. Scalding water, as would ſeem, was then poured on them, which made the veins bleed freely, and with ſo good effect, that the half dead patient was not only relieved, but recovered.— Vide <hi>Van Savieten comment, in Boerhaave</hi> Aph. Tom. III, pag. 39.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>noble and excellent phyſician</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here of the advantages of bleeding in a <hi>pleuriſy,</hi> imputes the recovery of this patient to the quantity of blood that was then taken away; though the two former large bleedings, did not prevent his growing worſe. And even here it is moſt probable, that the laſting good effects aſcribed to that operation, were more owing to the hot water, which removed the ſpaſmodick conſtriction that acted on thoſe parts. This inſtance is exactly to the point; and clearly ſhows how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it is to keep up a good warmth in the feet and legs in ſome acute diſeaſes.</p>
                  </note>. Putting the legs in warm water, is frequently practiſed on ſuch and other occaſions; but the good effects thereof generally ceaſe with the immerſion; for before thoſe parts can be wiped dry, they may be again chilled, and the ſpaſm renewed in conſequence. Beſides, without great care the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's

linen and bed clothes will be damped by the ſteams of the hot water; which, as things now are, muſt have bad effects. It is uſual alſo, to wrap up the legs and feet in hot flannels; but thoſe ſoon cool and require ſhifting often. Bottles filled with hot water have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been tecommended; but I have known them break or leak at the corks in the bed, much to the detriment of the patient; neither does rhe covering lie ſo cloſe as over the bricks, which may be had almoſt every where, are ſoon made ready, and eaſily changed when they cool. They alſo are much to be preferred to ſtones, which are apt to ſplit and fly in the fire; and I have ſeen this happen even after they were put in the bed.</p>
               <p>Thus have I given my opinion on this ſubject, which if founded in reaſon, did not need the ornaments of eloquence, to recommend it to the ingenuous. But, if the theory be not rational, or what I reckon upon more, ſhould not the practice ſtand the teſt, no flouriſhes of ſtile could protect them from that contempt, which whimſical propoſitions juſtly deſerve, whatever ſpecious arguments introduce them to the publick. Being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious how little I can ſerve mankind, I ought by all means to be careful how I propagated a doctrine, which, if wrong, might be deſtructive in the higheſt degree; more eſpecially as daily opportunities offer for trying it, and, of courſe, expoſing me to cenſure, were it found fallacious.</p>
               <p>The newneſs of the practice in <hi>pleuriſies, peripneumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and ſome other acute diſeaſes, may cauſe it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a ſuſpicious light to thoſe, who do not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend

the principles on which it is eſtabliſhed; or to thoſe who are not accuſtomed to reaſon in the ſame way on the immediate cauſe of fevers, and the ſeveral ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms that happen in conſequence thereof. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be their ſentiments on this head, I hope the method propoſed above, will neither be condemned by implication nor prejudice, before it hath undergone ſome fair trials in the way I have directed; when, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the medicines operate properly, and due care be otherwiſe taken, I have no doubts of its ſucceeding in general, the numberleſs inſtances of which, or rather its failing but ſeldom, unleſs from mismanagement have emboldened me to ſay any thing at all of it. I do not however pretend, to the knowledge of any method or remedy, which will remove any one diſtemper with abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute certainty, being very ſenſible that the virtues of all medicines are only <hi>conditional</hi> or <hi>relative.</hi> Accordingly we now and then are mortified, by diſappointments in the cure of thoſe diſeaſes, which we vainly believed were beſt underſtood by us, owing, perhaps, to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of a hidden nature, a certain <gap reason="foreign">

lancet; fot however neceſſary it may be to take away blood on particular occaſions, paſt all doubts, this is frequently done when it ought to be omitted. Nor does any diſeaſe require ſuch a waſte of the <hi>vital fluids,</hi> as is too often made; by which means the patient is left to ſtruggle with the double danger of the diſtemper and extreme weakneſs.</p>
               <p>Were it duly conſidered, that the ſtrongeſt perſons who eat and drink moderately, and uſe neceſſary exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, have no more blood than is requiſite in health; and that the <hi>plethora</hi> or overfulneſs ſo much contended for, at the beginning of acute and inflammatory fevers, is for the moſt part more imaginary than real, and local rather than general; the pretence for taking away ſo much blood at once, or by repeating the operation again and again, cannot be founded in reaſon. What then ſhall we ſay of thoſe who practiſe this on them who fall ſhort of ſo vigorous a conſtitution?</p>
               <p>The arteries are naturally ſo diſpoſed to contraction, from the ſtrength of their <hi>orbicular fibres,</hi> that were it not for the reſiſtance made by our fluids, they would ſhut themſelves up to their axes. A certain quantity of blood muſt therefore be neceſſary to keep thoſe veſſels duly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and excite a proper <hi>diaſtole;</hi> but when too much of that fluid is loſt, and the oppoſition to their contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs is thus leſſened, they will cloſe themſelves in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; and the more, becauſe the force of the heart is weakened both by this great loſs of blood and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. We have a plain proof of this, from the fainting that happens when the veſſels have been ſuddenly emptied by
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:010575_0074_0F80D1A4A1A0CF78"/>
a large orifice; for the quantity of returning blood to the heart being now ſo diminiſhed, that enough thereof does not arrive at that organ, to promote a proper <hi>diaſtole</hi> that a forcible <hi>ſyſtole</hi> may follow. In this caſe, the feet and hands become cold, and the countenance pale and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted; all the outward parts ſhrink; and clammy ſweats appear as the arteries collapſe, for want of a ſuitable quantity and due <hi>impulſe</hi> in the blood, to keep them fully diſtended; ſo that the ſkin, together with its contiguous veſſels and membranes, plainly undergoes <hi>ſpaſmodical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions</hi> at ſuch times.</p>
               <p>On ſome occaſions, we are directed to take away blood <hi>ad animi deliquium;</hi> but to ſay the leaſt, this is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain rule, for ſuppoſing bleeding to be neceſſary, ſome perſons may faint before a ſufficient quantity hath been loſt, and others may bleed too much, ere they fall into a <hi>ſyncope.</hi> But when a fainting happens, the vein ought to be bound up immediately, however ſmall the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge might be, and the patient laid down, if he had been bled ſitting up.</p>
               <p>Repeated bleeding is alſo enjoined in ſome caſes, till the blood appears florid and free of all <hi>ſizineſs;</hi> but whatever ſhow of reaſon may be in this, the injunction ſeems not much better founded, than the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>of taking away all the bad blood, and leaving only what is good behind.</hi> For it may be truly aſſerted, that this point will not be attained, ſo the fever continues, before the veſſels have been too much emptied, and the vital actions depreſſed in proportion.</p>

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>The weakneſs brought on by an exceſſive loſs of blood, is ſudden and great, and its effects may be traced for a long time, by a paleneſs of the face, trembling, chilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and want of heat in the extreme parts, great lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guidneſs of the vital and natural actions, and a ſlow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. On the whole, though the loſs of ſome blood may be, occaſionally, needful, or taking away a moderate quantity may do little harm in ſome caſes, the abuſe of that operation is certainly very hurtful for the preſent, as well as the time to come. Eight or ten ounces of blood, are as much as any man ought to loſe in moſt diſorders; for if farther evacuation be neceſſary, he that underſtands the foregoing theory, cannot be at a loſs as to the way it ſhould be made; the method above propoſed having this great advantage, that though a patient may be much more emptied thereby than by bleeding, this, however, is done by degrees, and his ſtrength is all the while ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with proper nouriſhment. The judicious <hi>Sydenham,</hi> ſeriouſly laments the neceſſity he thought there was, for bleeding ſo often in the rheumatiſm, becauſe of the great weakneſs it brought on. He therefore changed <hi>that</hi> practice, and, after the third bleeding, depended on purging and anodynes, which anſwered equally as to the diſeaſe, far better ſurely for the patient; and the effects would have been as good after bleeding only once, or, perhaps, not at all, as much experience hath convinced me; more eſpecially had he added <hi>ſudorificks</hi> and <hi>alkalies</hi> to his other medicines.</p>

                  <hi>Vomits</hi> are thought by many, to be, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly needful, more eſpecially in remitting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting fevers; but, as might be expected, thoſe
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:010575_0076_0F80D1A64F0903A8"/>
who make this a rule, oftentimes do much miſchief; which is not charged as it ought to be, to their own te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity and want of judgment. All the bad effects of this headlong ſort of practice, cannot be recounted here; but let us give a very common inſtance, in the caſes of thoſe who are ſtupid and drowſy in fevers, from too great a fulneſs in the veſſels of the brain, the belly being at the ſame time bound.—Now, though the fevers may abate, according to the uſual courſes of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, yet a hard and too quick pulſe, head-ach, ſickneſs at the ſtomach, and general diſorder, frequently remain, as evidences, not only of a lurking <hi>ſpaſm,</hi> but likewiſe of too great an overcharge ſtill remaining, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and ſuperiour veſſels. To give an emetick, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, under circumſtances like theſe, can ſcarcely fail in having pernicious effects; even <hi>convulſions,</hi> a <hi>dilirium</hi> or <hi>ſtupor</hi> ſometimes enſuing immediately, or at the next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn or increaſe of the fever. How thoſe things ſhould be, is ſo evident as not to need any explanation: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs when a patient diſcharges much <hi>mucus, acidity, green or yellow bile,</hi> in the fever, we ought to promote the vomitings with warm water drank plentifully, and thrown up again, till it returns clear and taſteleſs. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus or camomile tea</hi> is often uſed for this purpoſe, from a notion that they ſtrengthen the ſtomach; but they lie ſo little a while there, that any effect they may have this way, does not deſerve our regard at ſuch times; beſides, the bitterneſs of thoſe infuſions conceals other taſtes, ſo that we cannot ſo well know when all the offending mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is diſcharged, as if water alone were uſed.</p>

            <p>IT will plainly appear from the foregoing <hi>Eſſay,</hi> how ill qualified the authour is for <hi>medical diſputation,</hi> more eſpecially, when the deſign was to oppoſe ſome notions, that have been long admitted for truths. But if there be reaſon to ſuſpect, that certain opinions have been adopted, which were liable to objection, it can have no bad conſequences to examine them, ſeeing thoſe things will ſtill remain as before, if they be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
            <p>Various are the ways in which <hi>criſes</hi> are ſaid to be brought about; but however the ſymptoms might be moderated in fevers by a hemorrhage, or an increaſe of ſome excretion or other, I never ſaw an acute diſeaſe go clearly off, before a general ſweat happened. This ſort of perſpiration, ſometimes, is of ſo rank a nature, as to be offenſive to the ſick themſelves, and their attendants
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:010575_0078_0F80D1AA059492D8"/>
alſo, owing, perhaps, to the great heat and rapid mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the fluids ſuſtained, whereby their ſaline and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous parts were not only multiplied, but rendered more volatile alſo; the urine and ſtools, likewiſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a more nauſeous ſcent from the ſame cauſes.</p>
            <p>When this ſweat is coming on, the pulſe becomes fuller and more ſoft, and the tongue moiſter, as ſigns of ſome abatement in the <hi>ſpaſmodick</hi> condition of the ſolids, and that the hindrance to a more regular diſtribution of the fluids, is now giving way. And, as the perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion advances more, the pulſe ſtill ſoftens, fills and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſlower; whatever overfulneſſes happened in the internal and ſuperiour parts, together with the ſeveral ſymptoms which depended thereon, abating alſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. For as the outward veſſels relax yet more, and continue to diſcharge themſelves plentifully, thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, being eaſed of their overload, by the humours now taking another courſe, recover their <hi>ſyſtole,</hi> and by little and little clear themſelves of the ſurcharges they ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that, provided things be but well managed now, a free circulation will ſoon enſue; or, in other words, the diſeaſe will ceaſe, all the unnatural conſtrictions being then abated.</p>
            <p>Before the pulſe becomes ſofter and more full, it will be vain to look for the <hi>ſedimentum album leve &amp; aequale,</hi> ſo much wiſhed for in the urine during an acute diſeaſe; becauſe the <hi>morbifick matter</hi> is thought to be diſcharged that way. But this ſort of ſediment, among others, is only a ſign, that the veſſels within are recovering their natural diameters, whether they had been too much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:010575_0079_0F80D1AA9F5BB1D8"/>
or contracted before; for more or leſs of ſuch a ſettling, will always be ſeen in the urine of people in health: And why it ſhould be more plentiful at the end of fevers, may be underſtood from the greater laxneſs of the ſolids, and diſſolution of the fluids, of which both the full ſoft pulſe and <hi>critical ſweat</hi> are proofs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, from the vehemence of the circulation during a fever, more particles may be rubbed off the coats of the veſſels than in health, and help to increaſe this ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Here I would be underſtood to mean, what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens at the termination of acute diſeaſes; for though the blood be ever ſo <hi>ſizy,</hi> when the compreſſing force of the veſſels was exerted with its greateſt power, yet, if the patient be bled ſome hours after the fever ceaſed, the <hi>ſerum</hi> will then be more in quantity than it was during the diſtemper, and the red part leſs. Indeed, the paleneſs and weakneſs which are ſeen after every fever, plainly enough ſhow, that the ſolids are much relaxed and the blood thinned.</p>
            <p>It muſt not be inferred from thoſe looſe hints, that I conſider the inſpection of the urine as unneceſſary; on the contrary, I do not know any one of the internal ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whence ſo good a judgment may be formed, of the condition of the parts within during fevers, as from <hi>that diſcharge.</hi> The urine is clear in acute diſeaſes with <hi>convulſions, ſtupors,</hi> or <hi>delirium,</hi> more eſpecially if the latter be of the outrageous ſort; in <hi>manias, apoplexies, epilepſies,</hi> during the <hi>horrors</hi> of all fevers, as well as in <hi>hyſterical, hypochondriacal</hi> and <hi>aſthmatick</hi> attacks, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly when the belly is bound, in conſequence of a <hi>ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmodick conſtriction</hi> of the <hi>muſcular fibres</hi> of the inteſtines,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:010575_0080_0F80D1ABD5C33E48"/>
which prevents the ſecretions being made in them. But, when purgings happen in fevers, the urine is, commonly, thick or high coloured, and hath either a large ſediment or cloud; for the urinary organs, then partake of the ſame laxneſs with the other internal parts.</p>
            <p>Limpid urine, is juſtly eſteemed an unfavourable ſign in fevers, for it ſhews a very extenſive ſtrong ſpaſm. But the miſchief this portends, ought not to be imputed to the detention of any <hi>morbifick matter</hi> that ſhould have paſſed that way, ſeeing the diſeaſe continued whilſt the urine was very thick, but to the ſpaſm having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated itſelf to a greater number of veſſels, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſtronger alſo, on thoſe it poſſeſſed before, whereby the fluids are repelled into fewer veſſels and a ſmaller compaſs. In this caſe, the moſt alarming conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are to be dreaded, from the overfulneſſes and ſtagnations that muſt ſoon enſue in the internal and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour parts. And we accordingly ſee, that either a <hi>dilirium, convulſions, comatous</hi> or <hi>lethargick ſtupors, mortal anxieties,</hi> &amp;c. infallibly ſucceed when ſuch a change hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the urine, unleſs they can be prevented; but this is ſeldom in our power, when patients, are much weakened.</p>
            <p>Symptoms like thoſe we have juſt now mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are ſaid to happen <hi>per metaſtaſm,</hi> or from a tranſlation of the <hi>morbifick matter</hi> to the brain or elſewhere. But that ſort of reaſoning explains nothing to me, who have ſome doubts of ſuch matter exiſting in the fluids, more eſpecially at the beginning of common continued, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory or even intermitting fevers, when ſuch
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:010575_0081_0F80D1AC21794278"/>
ſymptoms are frequently ſeen. However, I can eaſily comprehend how they may be brought on, by an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſpaſm; which, as it muſt take place before a fever can attack, ſo muſt it be removed ere the patient will recover, or become very general before a diſeaſe can prove mortal, as already hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>When the urine is clear in fevers, it is commonly ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſmall quantities; but hyſterical and ſome other people, whoſe nerves are very ſenſible, oftentimes diſcharge aprofuſion of urine, immediately after the attack of a <hi>ſpaſm;</hi> which, paſt all doubts, prevents ill conſequences in another way, that elſe would enſue, when the fluids are thus precipitouſly and impetuouſly repelled towards the viſcera and brain. Again, it for the moſt part holds, that when the belly is looſe in fevers, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially during warm weather, the urine will be high co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, or full of ſediment; and ſo long as it continues ſo, there is not much danger either of <hi>ſtupors or convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> unleſs the patients ſit up too long when they are very weak. At the time therefore, that the urine is clear in the firſt days of fevers, it is a rule with me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the ſtricture of the veſſels within, and abate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever overfulneſſes have happened there, by promoting looſe ſtools and ſweatings likewiſe, in order to obviate the danger that would quickly follow, from the fluids being accumulated in the internal and ſuperiour veſſels. This, indeed, cannot be done, when the patient's ſtrength is already ſpent by a lingering diſeaſe; but it may and ought to be attempted, at the beginning of common continued and inflammatory fevers, which oftentimes prove mortal on the third, fifth, or ſeventh day; for in
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:010575_0082_0F80D1ACE1A2CF30"/>
ſuch caſes, enough of fluids generally remain to the laſt breath to ſupport life, were the veſſels but in condition to circulate them. They therefore who fall by diſorders of that ſort, truly die a violent death, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid. On the whole, though the examination of the urine be uſeful, as thence both the approach and completing of the <hi>criſis</hi> may be pretty well known, yet in my opinion, it cannot be affirmed with any degree of propriety, that the body is ſo commonly freed of the <hi>febrifick cauſe</hi> that way as is thought, if it be at all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the diſtemper aroſe from gravel in the paſſages; but we do not ſpeak of ſuch complaints.</p>
            <p>A <hi>criſis</hi> is ſaid to be brought about, by bleedings from the noſe, <hi>uterus</hi> and <hi>hemorrhoidal veins;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by a <hi>diarrhea,</hi> an <hi>expectoration,</hi> &amp;c. It cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be denied, that a well-timed ſuitable diſcharge made in either of thoſe ways, will much abate the painful ſymptoms, by venting ſome part of the fluids, that were too much collected in the veſſels within, and more ſo in ſome than others, which being thus eaſed of their over-fulneſſes, will now contract themſelves with greater power. And becauſe the ſame effects extend to others, in ſome degree, and alſo to the heart and lungs, the blood muſt then he propelled with a greater <hi>impetus</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the conſtricted veſſels, and ſo dilate them gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Yet after all, the ſweat we mentioned muſt ſtill enſue, before a complete <hi>criſis</hi> can happen, no matter by whatever natural or artificial diſcharges, the overload, which took place in the veſſels within, might be leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Does not what we have ſaid of the humours being too much repelled from the outward to the internal parts
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:010575_0083_0F80D1ADF3EBFA18"/>
at ſuch times, plainly appear among other things, from what happens to the ſtrongeſt man at the firſt onſet of an inflammatory fever? for the pulſe is then ſo ſmall, the patient likewiſe being in all reſpects ſo exceedingly weak and helpleſs, becauſe the vital actions are as it were overpowered, that they who know not the reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no blood ought to be taken away; but after that hath been done, the ſick perſon perceives himſelf ſtronger, and the pulſe alſo inlarges.</p>
            <p>Fevers are ſaid to ceaſe, when the <hi>morbifick cauſe</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be thrown on the glandulous or other parts; but, though it be eaſy to conceive how obſtructions of this ſort may be formed, yet in what manner they prove truly <hi>critical,</hi> thoſe muſt declare to whom ſuch inſtances have occurred. For myſelf, I always obſerved that ſome degree of feveriſhneſs ſtill remained, till thoſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours were either diſcuſſed or ſuppurated; and even then the patient ſweated at laſt before he recovered.</p>
            <p>As to a <hi>critical diarrhea,</hi> it is juſt what we propoſed to bring on early in the diſeaſe; and if the patient hath the good fortune to ſweat, when that happens of its own own accord, the ſame ſalutary effects may probably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, as we find by promoting thoſe diſcharges at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, in order to relieve the veſſels within of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges they ſuſtained, and perhaps clearing the firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of ſome ſort of acrimony, that might either bring on or continue the ſpaſm. But, whether this purging come on naturally, or was promoted by art, a general ſweat muſt nevertheleſs follow, before the patient will be free of fever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:010575_0084_0F80D1AE5DEE5698"/>Whether fevers can be removed in cold climates, without the ſweat we mean, I will not diſpute; but in <hi>South-Carolina</hi> they never have a criſis any other way; and how it can be otherwiſe elſewhere, does not appear from the laws of mutual action between the ſolids and fluids, or according to the foregoing theory. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge may not, indeed, be ſo plentiful in cold countries as with us, in whom a laxer conſtitution commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, for the greateſt part of the year.</p>
            <p>My opinion of thoſe things is confirmed, by what authours have ſaid of the different ſorts of <hi>criſes;</hi> for ſuch increaſed excretions could not have been made, unleſs the fluids were either too much collected in, or too plentifully determined towards the places whence they proceed. For it is plain, that had they circulated freely and equally throughout the ſyſtem as in health, nothing of that nature could have happened, becauſe the ſecretions would not have exceeded any where, every part then receiving only its proper quantity of the fluids. Much leſs could a hemorrhage break out, except the veſſels had firſt been ſo over-ſtretched, that their coats were made to give way to the additional weight and <hi>impulſe</hi> of the blood. Neither could this have been, if the progreſs of the fluids had not been intercepted, in ſome degree, by ſome change made in the condition of the arteries in other parts. It then ſeems clear, that ſo much of the blood as could neither be received nor circulated by the veſſels, which were <hi>ſpaſmodically affected,</hi> muſt have been admitted by others, over and above what they ought to contain, had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular diſtribution of it taken place, as we have already
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:010575_0085_0F80D1B28CBB71F8"/>
mentioned. An expectoration could no more happen in a <hi>peripneumony</hi> than from a <hi>diarrhea,</hi> unleſs the fluids had firſt been unnaturally accumulated in the lungs, to augment the ſecretions there; and the extravaſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed humours acting as a ſtimulus, they excite a cough to expel themſelves. Have we not evident proofs of too great diſtention in the veſſels, at or near the place, whence a future <hi>hemorrhage</hi> or an augmented ſecretion is to proceed, for ſome time before this happens? Is not a bleeding from the noſe, preceeded by a fulneſs and fluſhing of the face, throbbing of the <hi>carotid</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral arteries,</hi> buzzing or ringing in the ears, and a heavineſs or pain in the eyes and forehead? How dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult is breathing, and what heat and oppreſſion are perceived about the breaſt in <hi>peripneumonies,</hi> and in the <hi>peripneumonick ſtages of pleuriſies,</hi> owing to the great weight of fluids, with which the lungs are charged? In the mortal ſtages of all diſeaſes, how anxiouſly do the patients toſs themſelves about, and gaſp in the quickeſt manner, becauſe of the ſtifling from the fluids being moſtly accumulated in the lungs and large veſſels near the heart; the circulation being already at an end in the extreme parts? May it not be foretold that the menſes will ſoon flow, when a heat, throbbing, heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pain are perceived about the loins, hips and <hi>hypogaſtrium?</hi> And, not to mention other things of the ſame ſort, when the circulation begins to recover itſelf in the external ſmall arteries, the <hi>critical ſweat</hi> may be announced, by a more equal heat, a plumpneſs of all the outward parts, and ſoftneſs of the ſkin, together with a fuller and leſs hard pulſe, a moiſter tongue, and an abatement of the ſickneſs, anxiety, &amp;c. all plain
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:010575_0086_0F80D1B323CF53F0"/>
proofs of what hath been repeatedly alledged, of a <hi>ſpaſmodick conſtriction</hi> being the immediate cauſe of fevers, which the ſeveral ſymptoms we have laſt recounted, ſhow is then giving way,</p>
