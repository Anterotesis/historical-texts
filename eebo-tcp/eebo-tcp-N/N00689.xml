         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HIS Excellency adminiſtred an Oath of Secrecy to the Lieutenant Governour, <hi>Edward Randolph,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>Thomas Weaver,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> they not being Members of the Council.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip appointed <hi>Thomas Weaver,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to act as Council at Law in behalf of his Majeſty, and to aſſiſt to take the Minits of the Council.</p>
            <p>By his Lordſhips Command a Letter was read from his Grace the Duke of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> principal Secretary of State, to his Lordſhip, Governour of <hi>New-York,</hi> in relation to Pyrats.</p>
            <p>By his Lordſhips Command, the Letter to his Lordſhip from <hi>James Vernon,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Secretary to their Excellencies, the Lords Juſtices of <hi>England,</hi> in relation to Pyrats was read; as likewiſe a ſecond Letter from Mr. <hi>Vernon,</hi> with Memorials from the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, of Damages done in the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> by Pyrats belonging to <hi>New-York,</hi> the ſaid Pyrats being reported to have Commiſſions and Protections from the late Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi> and a Command to his Lordſhip to make enquiry into the ſame</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip then told the Gentlemen of the Council, That the occaſion of his calling them was to have their Advice in relation to ſome Diſcoveries he had made about Pyrats, and deſired Mr. <hi>Weaver</hi> to open the matter to them.</p>
            <p>Who enlarged upon the ſtrict Orders given by his Majeſty againſt Pyrats, to the Governour of <hi>New-York,</hi> and now read to them, of the Nature of the Crime of Pyracy, how involv'd with other Crimes, eſpecially Murder, and the ill Conſequences that attend it: How far his Majeſties Honour is prejudiced, with regard to his Allyes: The great loſs and deſtruction of the Trade of the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company of <hi>England,</hi> and therein the vaſt loſs of his Majeſties Revenue, and to the Ruin of his Majeſties Subjects by Reprizals made on their Effects in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi> The diſhonour done to his Majeſty. That any of his Governours ſhould grant Commiſſions to Pyrates, or that they ſhould grant Protections to prevent Proſecutions for a Crime abhorr'd by all civil Governments, all
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000834_0003_0FABA12B606F3900"/>
which is a betraying the Truſt repoſed in them by his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>That his Lordſhip had received full Information that Coll. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> late Governour of this Province, had admitted notorious known Pyrats to bring in their Spoils to the City of <hi>New York,</hi> and had granted them Protections under his Hand and Seal, for which he had received conſiderable Rewards from them, they at the ſame time confeſſing to him that they had Robb'd the Subjects of the great <hi>Mogul,</hi> his Majeſty's Alley.</p>
            <p>That likewiſe his Lordſhip was well informed that <hi>William Nicolls,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of his Majeſty's Council, by Profeſſion a Lawyer, and therefore not ignorant of the Nature of Pyracy, had ſo far betrayed the Truſt his Majeſty had repoſed in him, as to make the bargain between the Pyrates and Coll <hi>Fletcher,</hi> (well knowing them to be Pyrats) and agreed with them on the Price they ſhould give Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi> for his Protections; for which his Service the ſaid Mr. <hi>Nicolls</hi> had a Preſent made him of eight hundred Pieces of Eight. To prove which a Depoſition was produced to his Lordſhip and Council, of <hi>Edward Taylor,</hi> one of the Pyrats who made the agreement with Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicolls.</hi> Which Depoſition was very full to prove the ſame. And likewiſe ſeveral Original Protections as for Pyrats were produced, ſigned and ſealed by Coll. <hi>Fletcher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That his Lordſhip eſteemed it a very great betraying of Truſt both in Coll. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> the late Governour, who is now on ship board bound for <hi>England,</hi> as likewiſe of Mr. <hi>Nicolls,</hi> one of his Majeſty's Council, now confined in the Fort, involv'd in the ſame Crime with him. That this is matter of State, and his Lordſhip deſired their Aſſiſtance and Opinion, what ſhould be done therein for his Majeſty's Service.</p>
            <p>On this Mr. <hi>Nicolls</hi> was ſent for to appear before his Lordſhip and Council, and being charg'd by Mr. <hi>Weaver</hi> with the fore-going particulars, and having heard read the aforeſaid Depoſition of <hi>Edward Taylor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nicolls</hi> for his Defence ſaid, He knew no Perſons that were Pyrats, nor did he know of any Contract made by Pyrats with Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi>; but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that he had received the eight hundred Dollars from <hi>Edward Taylor</hi> for obtaining Protections and did believe he deſerved them for his pains and labour in ſerving them. He likewiſe offered, That there is an Act of this Province that gave allowance to Privateers to come in and have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections, if they gave Security to the Government.</p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>Weaver</hi> anſwered, That there was no ſuch Act that gave any benefit to theſe Pyrats, and produced the Act in relation to Pyrats, and read part of it</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Weaver,</hi> by his Lordſhips order, acquainted the Council, That Capt <hi>Evans,</hi> Commander of his Majeſties Ship, <hi>The Richmond,</hi> bound for <hi>England,</hi> had given in a Memorial to his Lordſhip, That be wanted forty Sailors, but acquainted his Lordſhip, that he could Man his Ship by Pyrats. His Lordſhip being ſtartled thereat, told Capt. <hi>Evans,</hi> That he thought it dangerous to admit ſo many Pyrats on board the Kings Ship, for that they might knock the Kings Sailors on the head, or joyn with them to run away with the Kings Ship. To which Capt. <hi>Evans</hi> replyed, He did not fear that. This diſcourſe was about the 18th of <hi>April</hi>: and four or five days after Capt. <hi>Evans</hi> came again to his Lordſhip, and deſired an
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000834_0004_0FABA12C21920E20"/>
Order for ten of Capt. <hi>Syms</hi> Saylors, affirming to his Lordſhip, that he had got thirty Volunteers on board, who would pay for their Paſſage home for <hi>England.</hi> That his Lordſhips Jealouſie being much increaſed by theſe Diſcourses of Capt. <hi>Evans,</hi> his Lordſhip ordered him to get ready to ſail, and when the Ship was ready, his Lordſhips Pacquets and Capt. <hi>Evans</hi> ſailing Orders ſhould be ready. And ſome few days after Capt. <hi>Evans</hi> came to his Lordſhip, and told him, that he was ready, and would, with his Lordſhips leave, ſail to the Watering - place at <hi>Statten-Iſland,</hi> and when watered would fall down to <hi>Sandy Hook,</hi> where he expected ſix or eight Sailors would come on board of him; and then Capt. <hi>Evans</hi> ſaid he would wait on his Lordſhip at New-York, and receive his Pacquets and ſailing Orders</p>
            <p>To theſe Diſcourſes his Lordſhip offered his Oath voluntarily to the Council, that they were true. And to the two laſt Diſcourſes of thirty Volunteers on board that would pay for their Paſſage home: and that ſix or eight Sailors would come on board at <hi>Sandy-Hook,</hi> Mr. <hi>VVeaver</hi> (who was preſent with his Lordſhip at the time of their being ſpoke) offered to atteſt.</p>
            <p>That his Lordſhip (believing it not ſafe to hazard the Kings Ship, and with deſign to catch the ſaid Pyrates (if on board) had this morning ſecur'd Cap. <hi>Evans</hi> in this Fort, and had given a Commiſſion to Cap. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>iford,</hi> with neceſſary Inſtructions, and ſeveral Gentlemen, with forty armed Sailers were now ſent with him on board the <hi>Richmond,</hi> which his Lordſhip offered to the Conſideration of the Council.</p>
            <p>On which Captain <hi>Evans</hi> being called in before the Council, and charged with the aforegoing particulars, Capt. <hi>Evans</hi> abſolutely deny'd that he had ſaid to his Lordſhip that he would man his Ship with Pyrates, and ſaid his Lordſhip had miſtaken him, for that he had only ſaid he believed he could get ſo many of the Privateers come in with Capt. <hi>Alliſon</hi> from <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> and likewiſe denyed all the other Speeches to be ſaid by him, which were atteſted by his Lordſhip; and Captain <hi>Evans</hi> proteſted, that he had no Pyrate or Volunteer (to pay his paſſage) on board the Kings Ship, nor would he ſuffer any Pyrate to come on board the Ship, nor did he know of any that was to come on board. On which both Captain <hi>Evans</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicolls</hi> were ordered to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip then propoſed to the Council that ſince the Infamy of Encouraging and Supporting Pyrates was laid on the City of <hi>New York,</hi> that it would be for the honour of the Government (what in them lay) to wipe off that ſtain, and to publiſh a Proclamation forthwith concerning the horrid crime of Pyracy, and for the proſecuting and diſcovery of Pyrates, to which the Council unanimouſly aſſented.</p>
            <p>Then his Lordship deſired the advice of the Council what Methods ſhould be uſed againſt Coll. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nicolls</hi> and Captain <hi>Evans,</hi> on this Emergency. Mr. <hi>Chidly Brooks</hi> ſaid, that giving Protections to Pyrates hath not been looked upon formerly as ſo great a matter, for that all the neighbouring Governments had done it commonly. To which his Lordſhip replyed, That Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> might, if he pleaſed, think it a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000834_0005_0FABA12DAAA9D448"/>
Piccadillo but his Majeſty and his Miniſters at home eſteemed it as a high Offence, as might be perceived by the ſtrict Inſtructions about it, that had been read to them. To which Mr. <hi>Brooke</hi> anſwered, That he would not excuſe it, but only ſpoke of what had been done.</p>
            <p>The Council were of Opinion not one diſſenting, That the Depoſitions and Proofs againſt Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi> ſhould be taken, and ſealed with the Seal of the Province, and ſent home to the King with Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi> a Priſoner. But as for Mr. <hi>Nicolls</hi> they believed it proper he ſhould be tryed here where the fact was committed, and not be ſent home, which would Ruin him, he having, (as they believed) no Money at home.</p>
            <p>To which his Lordſhip replyed, That there was ſo general a Corruption in this Province, and the People ſo accuſtomed to the Profits of Pyrats, that they were apt to be almoſt in an Uproar on the Execution of the Laws; and that he did not know how far it was proper to bring this matter to a Tryal here; and that ſince Coll. <hi>Fletcher</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nicolls</hi> were both involved in the ſame Crime of Male-adminiſtration of the Truſt repoſed in them by his Majeſty, it was his Lordſhips Opinion, that they ſhould both be ſent home together, and be anſwerable to his Majeſty</p>
