            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT, BY THE TRANSLATOR.</head>
            <p>THE Philoſophical and Political Hiſtory of the Eſtabliſhments and Commerce of the Europeans in both the Indies, by the Abbe Raynal, is certainly one of the fineſt works which have appeared ſince the revival of letters; and perhaps the moſt inſtructive of any which have been known. It is an original as to its formation; and ought to ſerve henceforward for a model. An addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional part to this work, diſcuſſing the diſputes of Great-Britain with her Colonies, has been long and ardently expected. In the courſe of his travels, the tranſlator happily ſucceeded in obtaining a copy of this exquiſite little piece, which has not yet made its appearance from any preſs. He publiſhes a French edition, in favour of thoſe who will feel its eloquent reaſoning more forcibly in its native language, at the ſame time with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſlation of it; in which he has been deſirous, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in vain, that all the warmth, the grace, the ſtrength, the dignity of the original, ſhould not be loſt. And he flatters himſelf, that the indulgence of the illuſtrious hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian will not be wanting to a man, who, of his own motion, has taken the liberty to give this compoſition to the public, only from a ſtrong perſuaſion, that its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous argument will be uſeful, in a critical conjuncture, to that country which he loves with an ardour, that can be exceeded only by the nobler flame, which burns in the boſom of the philanthropic author, for the freedom and happineſs of all the countries upon earth.</p>
            <p>It may not, perhaps, be quite needleſs to obſerve, though it ought to be underſtood, that the valuation of ſums, made in the original in foreign money, is, in the tranſlation, made in ſterling.</p>
            <p>The abundant good ſenſe, the political ſagacity, and even the ſalutary ſarcaſm, to be found, amidſt the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of benevolence, in this hiſtorical tract, could never, it is apprehended, be more opportunely laid before thoſe
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:017686_0003_0FA21D40AE888190"/>
whom it may concern, than now. It now ſeems to be the general and anxious expectation, that, before the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Parliament from its preſent ſeſſion, ſome proper and efficacious ſteps will at laſt, at this high time, be thought of, towards cloſing the unnatural, the ſhameful, and diſtreſsful breach, between the mother country and her colonies; a breach in which, as it is obſerved, with great truth, by the author of a Plan of Accommodation<note n="*" place="bottom">Printed in 1780.</note>, founded in juſtice and liberality, <q>The people on both ſides are robbed of their trueſt intereſts, and made to ſacrifice their mutual happineſs, to gain nothing but contempt and miſery.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let not Wiſdom utter her voice in the ſtreets, and no man regard her.</p>
            <p>The Tranſlator cannot help moſt ſolicitouſly wiſhing, that ſome of his fellow-ſubjects, of the Britiſh dominions, may enter the liſts for the prize propoſed in the following Advertiſement from the Academy of Lyons, in the hope that he ſhall have the happineſs to ſee it borne from the reſt of the lettered world, by a hero of that people, who have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT, FROM THE ACADEMY Of Sciences, Polite Literature, and Arts, at Lyons.</head>
            <p>THE Abbe Raynal, after having inſtructed mankind by his writings, would ſtill contribute to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their knowledge, by exciting emulation. An Aſſociate in the labours of the Academy of Lyons, he propoſed to it to give out two ſubjects for prizes, of which he has conſtituted the fund, to be diſtributed by the Academy, to the authors whom it ſhall judge to have beſt anſwered the views of the propounded queſtions.</p>
            <p>The Academy accepted of the offer with gratitude, and publiſhes the ſubjects without delay.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſubject propoſed for the year <hi>1782,</hi> relating exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to the manufactures and proſperity of the city of Lyons, is omitted here, as, however judicious and patriotic in the founder of the prize, it is an object only of particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, and, conſequently, not intereſting, like the ſecond, to the world at large.</p>

               <p>The Academy, conſidering the importance of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſets no limits to the length of the compoſition, but only wiſhes the author to write in French or Latin.</p>
               <p>No work can be admitted after the firſt day of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, 1783. The Academy will proclaim the prize the ſame year, in its public aſſembly, after St. Lewis's day, or the 25th of Auguſt.</p>

            <head>THE REVOLUTION OF AMERICA.</head>
            <p>ENGLAND was juſt diſengaged from a long and bloody war, in which her fleets had diſplayed the banner of victory in all ſeas; in which a dominion, already too vaſt, was augmented by an immenſe acceſſion of territory in both the Indies. This ſplendid face of things might have an impoſing air abroad; but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was reduced within to groan for its acquiſitions and its triumphs. Overwhelmed with a debt of £. 148,000,000 which coſt her an intereſt of £. 4,959,000, ſhe was ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient to the moſt neceſſary expences with the five millions eight hundred thouſand pounds which remained to her of her revenue; and this revenue, ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable of increaſe, had no certain and aſſured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency.</p>
            <p>Land remained loaded with a higher tax than it ever had been in time of peace. New taxes had been laid on windows and on houſes. Theſe acts laid a heavy charge on all real eſtate. Wine, plate, cards, dice, all that was regarded as an object of luxury, or amuſement, paid more than could have been thought poſſible. To reimburſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the ſacrifice made to the preſervation of the public health, in the prohibition of ſpiritous liquors, the treaſury had recourſe to malt, beer, cider, and all the uſual beve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of the people. The ſea-ports diſpatched nothing to foreign countries, and received nothing from them, but what was burthened cruelly with duties, on the import and the export. Raw materials and workmanſhip were riſen to ſo high a price in Great-Britain, that her mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants found themſelves ſupplanted in countries where they had never before experienced a competition. The
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017686_0008_0FA21D45DC459838"/>

            <p>The ſprings of the ſtate were ſtrained. All the muſcles of the body politic, experiencing at once a violent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, were in ſome ſort diſplaced. It was a critical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was neceſſary to let the people breathe. They could not be relieved by a dimmution of expence. That of the government was neceſſary, either to give value to conqueſts bought at the price of ſo much treaſure, at the price of ſo much blood; or to reſtrain the houſe of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, angered by the humiliations of the laſt war, and by the ſacrifice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The members of a confederacy ought all, in proportion to the extent of their powers, to contribute to its defence and to its ſpendor, ſince it is by the public power alone that each claſs can preſerve the entire and peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of its poſſeſſions. The indigent man has, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, leſs intereſt in it than the rich; but he has the intereſt of his quiet in the firſt inſtance, and in the next, that of the preſervation of the public wealth, which he is called upon to partake of by his induſtry.

ultimately into ſtill viler hands, to pay the ſcandal and the ignominy of their pleaſures. It is prodigally ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a faſtuous ſhew of grandeur, the vain decoration of thoſe who cannot attain to real grandeur, and in feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities and entertainments, the reſource of impotent idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the midſt of the cares and labours which the right government of an empire would demand. A portion of it, it is true, is given to the public wants; but inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and incapacity, apply it without judgment, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oeconomy. Authority deceived, and which will not condeſcend even to make an effort at being undeceived, ſuffers an unjuſt diſtribution in the taxes, and a manner of gathering them which is itſelf but an oppreſſion more. Then is every patriotic ſentiment extinguiſhed. A war is eſtabliſhed between the prince and ſubjects. They who raiſe the revenues of the ſtate appear to be no other than the enemies of the citizen. He defends his fortune from taxation as he would defend it from invaſion. Whatever cunning can purloin from power ſeems lawful gain; and the ſubjects, corrupted by the government, make repriſals on the maſter by whom they are pillaged. They perceive not, that in this unequal combat, they are themſelves dupes and victims. The inſatiable and ardent treaſury, leſs ſatisfied with what if given, than irritated by what has been refuſed, reaches eagerly, with a hundred hands, after what one alone has dared to divert from its g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ipe. It joins the activity of power to, that of intereſt. Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations are multiplied, under the ſpecious name of chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juſtice; and the monſter who beggars all thoſe whom he torments, thanks heaven devoutly for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the criminals who have been puniſhed by him, and of the crimes by which he is enriched. Happy the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign who ſhould not diſdain, for the prevention of ſo many abuſes, to render to his ſubjects a faithful account of the employment of the ſums he might exact! But this ſovereign has not yet appeared; and, without doubt, he never will appear. The debt, however, of the protected people, towards the protector ſtate, is not a leſs neceſſary and ſacred tie; and no nation has diſowned it. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh colonies in North-America had not given an example
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017686_0010_0FA21D4772C75BF0"/>
of it; and never had the Britiſh miniſtry recourſe to them without obtaining the ſuccour it ſolicited.</p>
            <p>But this ſuccour was granted in gifts, and not in taxes, ſince the conceſſion of it was preceded by free and public deliberations in the aſſemblies of each eſtabliſhment. The mother-country had found herſelf engaged in expenſive and cruel wars. Tumultuous and enterpriſing parliaments had diſturbed her tranquillity. She had fallen into the hands of miniſters corrupt and bold; unhappily diſpoſed to raiſe the authority of the throne upon the ruin of all the rights, and all the powers of the people. And even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions had taken place, before an attack upon a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, ſtabliſhed and ſtrengthened by the happy experience of two ages, had ever once been dreamed of.</p>
            <p>The colonies in the new world had been accuſtomed to regard this mode of furniſhing their contingent, in men and money, as a right. Had this pretenſion been doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or erroneous, prudence would have forbidden its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too openly attacked. The art of maintaining autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is a delicate art, which requires more circumſpection than is generally thought. They who govern, are, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, too much accuſtomed to hold men in contempt. They regard them too much as ſlaves, ſubdued and bent down by nature, whilſt they are only ſo from habit. If you lay on them a new load, take care leſt they ſhake it off with fury and with intereſt. Forget not that the lever of power has no other fulcrum than opinion; that the power of thoſe who govern, is, in reality, but the power of thoſe who ſuffer government. Remind not people at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively occupied by their labours, or ſleeping in their chains, to lift up their eyes to truth too terrible for you; and whilſt they are obeying, bring not to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance their right to command. When the moment of this fearful rouſing ſhall arrive; when they ſhall have thought in earneſt that they are not made for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, but that their magiſtrates are made for them; when they ſhall once have been able to bring themſelves together, to feel the communication of kindred minds, and to pronounce with a voice unanimous; <hi>We will not have this law; this practice it offenſive;</hi> medium is no
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017686_0011_0FA21D4802B6E688"/>
more; you will be conſtrained, by an unavoidable alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, either to puniſh or to yield; either to be tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical or weak; and your authority henceforth deteſted or deſpiſed, whichever part it take, will have to chuſe from the people but their upon inſolence, or their hidden ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>The firſt duty, therefore, of a wiſe adminiſtration, is to manage the prevailing opinions in any country: for opinion is the property moſt dear to man, dearer even than his life, and conſequently much dearer than his wealth. A wiſe adminiſtration may, without doubt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to rectify opinions by information, or to altar them by perſuaſion, if they tend to the diminution of the public power. But it is not permitted to thwart them without neceſſity; and there never was any neceſſity for rejecting the ſyſtem adopted by North-America.</p>
            <p>In effect, whether the different ſettlements in this new world had been authorized, as they wiſhed, to ſend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives to parliament, where they might have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated with their fellow-citizens on the neceſſities of the Britiſh empire at large; or, whether they had continued to examine within themſelves what ſhould be the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution which it was right for them to make, no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience could have reſulted from it to the treaſury. In one caſe, the voice of their delegated claimants would have been drowned in that of the majority; and theſe provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would have found themſelves legally loaded with ſuch a portion of the burden as it ſhould be wiſhed to make them bear. In the other, the miniſtry, continuing to diſpoſe of the dignities, the employments, the penſions, and even of the elections, would have experienced no more reſiſtance to its will in that hemiſphere than in this.</p>
            <p>But the maxims conſecrated by cuſtom in America were not founded in prejudice alone. The pretenſions of the coloniſts reſted on the nature of their charters, and on the ſtill more ſolid baſis of that right of every Engliſh ſubject, not to be taxed without conſent, expreſſed by himſelf or his repreſentative. This right, which ought to be that of every people, ſince it is founded on the eternal law of reaſon, originated ſo far back as in the reign of the firſt Edward. From that epoch the Engliſhman has never
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017686_0012_0FA21D48C24F4B18"/>
loſt ſight of it. In peace, in war, under weak or wicked kings, in ſlaviſh or tumultuous times, it has been his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permitted claim. Under the Tudors, this Engliſhman has been ſeen to give up ſome of his moſt precious privileges, and, unreſiſtingly, to ſubmit his neck to the axe of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; but never to renounce the right of ſelf-taxation. It was in the defence of it that he has ſhed rivers of blood, that he has puniſhed or dethroned his kings. In ſhort, at the Revolution in 1688, this right was ſolemnly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, by the celebrated act, in which liberty was ſoon to trace, with the ſame hand with which it had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out the royal deſpot, the conditions of the contract between a nation and the ſovereign it had newly choſen. This prerogative of a people, much more ſacred, without all queſtion, than ſo many imaginary rights which ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition would ſanctify in tyrants, was, with regard to England, at once both the inſtrument and the rampart of her liberty. She thought, ſhe felt, that it was the only barrier which could for ever limit deſpotiſm; that the moment which ſtrips a people of this privilege, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it to oppreſſion; and that the funds, raiſed in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance for its ſecurity, are ſooner or later ſubſervient to its ruin. The Engliſhman, in founding his colony, had carried with him theſe principles beyond the ſeas; and the ſame ideas had been tranſmitted to his progeny.</p>
            <p>Ah! if in the countries even of Europe, in which ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſeems long ſince to have taken its ſeat in the midſt of vices, of riches, and of arts; in which the deſpotiſm of armies ſupports the deſpotiſm of courts; in which man, chained from his cradle, and bound tightly by all the cords both of policy and ſuperſtition, has never breathed the air of liberty; if in theſe countries, notwithſtanding, they who have once in their lives reſtricted on the fate of nations, cannot forbear adopting the maxims, and envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the happineſs of the people who knew how to make it the ground work and foundation of their conſtitution; how much more ought the Engliſh natives of America to be attached to the glorious birth right they inherit! They know the price at which their anceſtors had bought it. The very ſoil which they inhabit muſt produce in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017686_0013_0FA21D4A094DE5A0"/>
them a ſentiment favourable to theſe ideas. Diſperſed throughout an immenſe continent; free as the wild na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which ſurrounds them, amidſt their rocks, their mountains, the vaſt plains of their deſerts, on the confines of thoſe foreſts in which all is ſtill in its ſavage ſtate, and where there are no traces of either the ſlavery or the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of man, they ſeem to receive from every natural ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a leſſon of liberty and independence. Beſides, theſe people, given up almoſt all of them to agriculture and to commerce, to uſeful labours, which elevate and fortify the ſoul in inſpiring ſimple manners, hitherto as far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from riches as from poverty, cannot be yet cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted either by the exceſs of luxury, or by the exceſs of want. It is in this ſtate above all others, that the man who enjoys liberty is moſt capable to maintain it, and to ſhew himſelf jealous in the defence of an hereditary right, which ſeems to be the moſt certain ſecurity for all the reſt. Such was the reſolution of the Americans.</p>
            <p>Whether the Britiſh miniſtry were ignorant of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, of whether they hoped that their delegates would ſucceed in changing them, they laid hold of the moment of a glorious peace for exacting a forced contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution from the colonies. For war, and let it be well remarked, war, whether unfortunate or ſucceſsful, ſerves always as a pretext for the uſurpations of governments; as if the directors of the warring powers propoſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by it leſs to vanquiſh their enemies, than to enſlave their ſubjects. The year 1764 ſaw the birth of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſtamp act, which forbid the admiſſion in the courts of juſtice of any inſtrument which ſhould not be written on paper marked and ſold for the profit of the Britiſh treaſury.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh provinces of North America become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignant at this uſurpation of their moſt precious and moſt ſacred rights. By an unanimous agreement they renounce the conſumption of whatever was furniſhed them by the mother country, 'till it ſhould have withdrawn this ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and oppreſſive bid.

the men, animated by this example, give up on their part other conveniencies and enjoyments. Many cultivators of land quit the plough, to form themſelves to the induſtry of the workſhop; and wool, flax, and cotton, coarſely wrought, are ſold at the price which would before have purchaſed the fineſt cloths and the moſt beautiful ſtuffs.</p>
            <p>This kind of conſpiracy ſtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the government. By the clamour of the merchants, whoſe wares are without vent, its inquietude is increaſed. The enemies of the miniſtry uphold theſe diſcontents; and the ſtamp-act is revoked after two years of a convulſive agitation, which, in other times, would have lighted up a civil war.</p>
            <p>But the triumph of the colonies is of ſhort duration. The parliament, which had retreated but with extreme repugnance, ordains, in 1767, that the revenue which could not be obtained by means of ſtamps, ſhould be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by taxes on the glaſs, the lead, the paſte-board, the colours, the paper-hangings, and the tea, which are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried from England to America. The people of the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Continent are not leſs revolted at this innovation than at the former. In vain are they told that no one could diſpute the right of Great-Britain to lay on her exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the duties which her intereſt demands, ſince ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not to her colonies, ſituated beyond the ſeas, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of fabricating themſelves the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es ſubjected to the new taxation. This ſubterfuge appears but as a deriſion to men, who, being cultivators of land alone, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the having no communication but with their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-country, cannot procure, either by their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, or by foreign connections, the objects which had recently been taxed. Whether this tribute be paid in the old or new world, they perceive that the word makes no alteration in the thing, and that their liberty would not be leſs attacked by this mode, than by that which had been repelled by them with ſucceſs. The coloniſts ſea clearly that the government would beguile them; and they will not be beguiled. Theſe political ſophiſms ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to them as they are, the maſk of tyranny.</p>
            <p>Nations in general are made more for feeling than for thinking. The greateſt part of them never had an
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017686_0015_0FA21D4B335DC3D8"/>
idea of analyſing the nature of the power by which they are governed. They obey without reflection, and becauſe they have the habit of obeying. The origin and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the firſt national aſſociations being unknown to them, all reſiſtance to government appears to them a crime. It is chiefly in thoſe ſtates where the principles of legiſlation are confounded with thoſe of religion, that this blindneſs is to be met with. The habit of believing, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the habit of ſuffering. Man renounces not any one object with impunity. It ſeems as if nature would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge herſelf upon him who dares thus to degrade her. The ſervile diſpoſition which ſhe ſtamps upon his ſoul in conſequence, extends itſelf throughout. It makes a duty of reſignation as of meanneſs; and kiſſing chains of all kinds with reſpect, trembles to examine either its doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines or its laws. In the ſame manner that a ſingle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance in religious opinions is ſufficient to make many more to be adopted by minds once deceived, a firſt uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of government opens the door to all the reſt. He who believes the greater, believes the leſs; he who can do the greater, can do the leſs. It is by this double abuſe of credulity and authority, that all the abſurdities in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion and of policy have been introduced into the world for the haraſſing and the cruſhing of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race. Thus, at the firſt ſignal of liberty amongſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they have been prompted to ſhake off both theſe yokes together; and the epoch in which the human mind began to diſcuſs the abuſes of the church and clergy, is that in which reaſon perceived at laſt the rights of men; and in which courage attempted to ſet the firſt limits to deſpotic power. The principles of toleration and of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, eſtabliſhed in the Engliſh colonies, had made them a different people from all others. There it was known what was the dignity of man; and when the Britiſh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry violated it, it could not be otherwiſe but that a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all compoſed of denizens, ſhould riſe againſt the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the attempt.</p>
            <p>Three years elapſed, without a revenue from any one of the taxes which had ſo wounded the Americans to the quick. This was ſomething: but it was not all to which

But the object of this exception was only to palliate the ſhame of entirely giving up the ſuperiority of the mother country <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The miniſtry, deceived by their delegates, believed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly that the diſpoſition of the new world was alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when, in 1773, they ordered the collection of the duty upon tea.</p>
            <p>At this news the indignation becomes general in North-America. In ſome provinces, formal thanks are agreed upon to be rendered to the maſters of veſſels who would not ſuffer this production to make any part of their cargo. In others, the merchants to whom it is conſigned will not receive it. Here, he is declared an enemy of his country who ſhall dare to vend it. There, they are ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized with the ſame reproach who ſhall keep it in their ſtores. Many provinces ſolemnly renounce the uſe of this elegant refreſhment. A ſtill greater number burn what they had remaining of this leaf, 'till then the object of their delight. The tea ſent to this part of the globe was valued at more than two hundred thouſand pounds; and not a ſingle cheſt of it was landed. Boſton was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal theatre of this inſurrection. Its inhabitants deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in their very port, three cargoes of tea which arrived from Europe.</p>
            <p>This great town had always appeared more occupied by a ſenſe of its rights than the reſt of America. The leaſt attempt that was made upon their privileges had been repelled without ſcruple and without reſerve. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, ſometimes not unaccompanied by tumult, had for ſome years been tireſome to government. The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry who had a vengeance to wreak, ſeized too eagerly upon the circumſtance of a blameable exceſs; and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the parliament to puniſh it ſeverely.</p>
            <p>Moderate men wiſhed that the offending town might be ſentenced only to an indemnification proportioned to

            <p>The court of London applauded itſelf for ſo rigorous a law, and doubted not but that it would bring the Boſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to that diſpoſition to ſlavery which it had vainly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured 'till then to give them.

Suppoſing the worſt, the other colonies, long ſince jealous of that of Maſſachuſetts, would aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it with indifference to its melancholy fate, and gather up the immenſe trade which would flow in to them on the tide of its misfortunes. By theſe means would be broken the union of theſe different eſtabliſhments, which had for ſome years paſt acquired a greater degree of conſiſtency than was pleaſing to the mother-country.</p>
            <p>The expectation of the miniſtry was totally deceived. An act of rigour ſometimes over-awes. The people who have murmured as long as the thunder-ſtorm grow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at a diſtance, when it comes to burſt upon them, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubmit. It is then that they weigh the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and diſadvantages of reſiſtance; that they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate their own ſtrength and that of their oppreſſors; that a panic terror ſeizes thoſe who have every thing to loſe, without any thing to gain; that they lift up their voice, that they intimidate, that they corrupt; that diviſion ariſes in the minds of men, and that the community is ſeparated into two factions, which irritate each other, which come oftentimes to blows, and cut each other's throats under the eyes of their tyrants, who, with ſweet complacency, behold their ſtreaming blood. But tyrants ſeldom find accomplices but amongſt a people already cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted to their hands. It it vice which gives them allies amongſt thoſe whom they oppreſs. It is humanly ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which, filled with terrors, dares not barter its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017686_0018_0FA21D4D46250368"/>
for honourable peril. It is the vile ambition to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which lends its arm to deſpotic power, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to be a ſlave in order to domineer; to give up a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in order to partake their ſpoil; and to renounce real honour for the obtaining of titles, the nick-names of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. It is, above all, the indifferent and cold perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, which is the laſt vice amongſt a people, the laſt crime of governments, for it is ever the government which gives it birth; it is that, which, from principle, ſacrifices a nation to a man, and the happineſs of an age and of poſterity to the enjoyment of a day and of a moment. None of theſe vices, the production of a ſociety opulent and voluptuous, of a ſociety grown old and verging to its end, belong to a people newly eſtabliſhed and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in uſeful labours. The Americans remained united. The execution of a bill, which they called inhuman, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and bloody, tended but to ſtrengthen them in the reſolution of maintaining their rights with the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and conſtancy.</p>
            <p>At Boſton, the acrid and ardent ſpirit is more and more exalted. The try of religion adds force to that of liberty. The houſes of worſhip re echo with the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent exhortations againſt England. It was, without doubt, an intereſting ſpectacle for philoſophy, to ſee that even in temples, at the foot of altars, where ſuperſtition has ſo often bleſſed the chains of nations, where prieſts have ſo often flattered tyrants, liberty lifted up her voice in defence of the privileges of an oppreſſed people; and if it can be thought that the Deity vouchſafes to look down upon the unhappy feuds of men, it was better pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed undoubtedly to ſee its ſanctuary conſecrated to this uſe, and hymns to liberty make a part of the worſhip by which it was addreſſed. Theſe exhortations of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt have had a great effect; and when a free people invokes heaven againſt oppreſſion, it delays not long to have recourſe to arms.</p>
            <p>The other inhabitants of the province of Maſſachuſetts diſdain even the idea of drawing the leaſt advantage from the ciſaſters of the capital. They think but of drawing cloſer the bonds which unite them with the Boſtonians,

            <p>All the provinces attach themſelves to the cauſe of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; and their affection increaſes in proportion to the ſufferings of this unhappy town. Nearly as culpable of a reſiſtance ſo ſeverely puniſhed, they are well aware that the mother country but defers her vengeance againſt them; and that all the grace with which the moſt favoured can be flattered, is to be the laſt on which the hand of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſhall be doomed to fall.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſpoſitions to a general inſurrection are aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the act againſt Boſton, which is ſeen circulating throughout the continent upon paper edged with black, emblematical of mourning for liberty departed. Soon the diſquietude communicates itſelf from houſe to houſe. The inhabitants aſſemble and converſe together in the public places: and writings, full of eloquence and vigour, are delivered every where from the preſs.</p>

            <p>This diſpoſition was the common one: but the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant object, the difficult thing, in the midſt of a general tumult, was to contrive that a calm might be brought on, by favour of which might be formed a concert of wills, to give dignity, ſtrength, and conſiſtency, to their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is this concert, which, of a multitude of ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered parts, and each eaſily to be broken, compoſes a whole that is not to be rendered tractable, unleſs it be to be divided by policy or by power. The neceſſity of this grand combination, or totality, is ſtrikingly perceived by the provinces of New-Hampſhire, of Maſſachuſetts, of Rhode-Iſland, of Connecticut, of New York, of New-Jerſey, of the Delaware counties, of Maryland, of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, of Virginia, and of both the Carolinas. Theſe twelve colonies, which were afterwards joined by Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, ſent deputies to Philadelphia, in the month of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, 1774, charged with the defence of their rights and intereſts.</p>
            <p>The diſputes of the mother country with her colonies, aſſume at this period an importance to which they had not been before intitled. It is no longer a few individuals who make an obſtinate reſiſtance to imperious maſters. It is the ſtruggle of one body of men againſt another; of the Congreſs of America againſt the Parliament of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; of a nation againſt a nation. By the reſolutions taken on either ſide, minds mutually are heated. The ferment of animoſity increaſes. All hope of reconciliation vaniſhes. On each ſide the ſword is whetted. Great-Britain ſends troops to the new world. This other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere prepares for its defence. Its citizens become ſoldiers. The combuſtibles are collected; the conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is about to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Gage, the commander of the royal troops, ſends from Boſton, in the night of the 18th of April, 1775, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment charged with the deſtruction of a magazine of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017686_0021_0FA21D4F79909280"/>
arms, and other military ſtores, collected by the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans at Concord. This body of troops meet at Lexing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton with ſome militia, whom they diſparſe with little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, continue their march rapidly, and execute the commiſſion to which they had been appointed. But ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are they on their return towards the capital, but they find themſelves aſſailed, for the ſpace of fifteen miles, by a furious multitude, and death on each ſide is given and received. Engliſh blood, ſo often ſhed in Europe by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh hands, irrigates America in its turn, and the civil war is embarked in.</p>
            <p>On the ſame field of battle, the following months, more regular combats are behold. Warren becomes one of the victims of theſe unnatural and murderous actions. The Congreſs honour his aſhes.</p>
            <p>"He is not dead, (ſaid the orator) this excellent citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen ſhall never die. His memory ſhall be for ever preſent, and for ever dear, to all good men, to all who love their country. In the ſhort ſpace of a life but of three and thirty years, he had diſplayed the talents of a ſtateſman, the virtues of a ſenator, the ſoul of a hero.</p>
            <p>"Approach, all you whom the ſame intereſt in ſpirits; approach your countryman's ſtill bleeding body. Waſh with your tears his honorable wounds. But hang not too long over this inanimated corſe. Return to your habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to fill them with deteſtation at the crime of tyranny. Let your horrible deſcriptions of it make each particular hair to ſtand on end upon your children's heads, inflame their eyes with noble rage, ſtamp menaces on their brows, and draw, by their months, indignation from their hearts! Then, then, ſhall you give them arms; and your laſt, your fondeſt wiſh, ſhall be, that they may return victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, or may die like Warren."</p>
            <p>The diſturbances by which the province of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts was agitated, were repeated in the other provinces. The ſcenes, indeed, were not bloody, becauſe there were no Britiſh troops? but the Americans ſeize every where on the forts, the arms, and the military ſtores: they eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where expel their governers, and the other agents of England; and every where harraſs ſuch of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

as appeared favourable to its cauſe. Some enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing men have the ſpirit even to take poſſeſſion of the works formerly erected by the French upon the lake Champlain, between New-England and Canada, and to make an irruption into this vaſt region.</p>
            <p>Whilſt ſimple individuals, or detached diſtricts, are thus uſefully ſerving the common cauſe, the Congreſs is occupied with the care of aſſembling an army. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it is given to George Waſhington, a native of Virginia, and known by ſome happy exploits in preceding wars. Inſtantly the new general flies to the province of Maſſachuſetts, drives the royal troops from poſt to poſt, and obliges them to ſhut themſelves up in Boſton. Six thouſand of theſe old ſoldiers, eſcaped from the ſword, from ſickneſs, from all the miſeries incident to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and preſſed by hunger, or by the enemy, embark the 24th of March 1776, with a precipitation which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of flight. They go to ſeek an aſylum in Nova-Scotia, which remained, as well as Florida, faithful to its ancient maſters.</p>
            <p>This ſucceſs was the firſt ſtep of Engliſh America to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the revolution. It was begun to be openly deſired. The principles which juſtified it were diſperſed on all ſides. Theſe principles, which were indebted for their birth to Europe, and particularly to England, had been tranſplanted in America by philoſophy. The knowledge, and the diſcoveries, of the mother-country, were turned againſt herſelf, and ſhe was told that,</p>
            <p>Care muſt be taken not to confound together ſociety and government. That they may be known diſtinctly, their origin ſhould be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Man, thrown, as it were, by chance, upon this globe, ſurrounded by all the evils of nature; obliged continually to defend and protect his life againſt the ſtorms and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts of the air, againſt the inundations of water, againſt the fire of volcanos, againſt the intemperature of frigid or torrid zones, againſt the ſterility of the earth, which refuſes him aliment, or its baneful fecundity, which makes p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his habitation and his prey, and, attacking his perſon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>em reſolved to render themſelves rulers of this globe, of which he thinks himſelf to be the maſter: man in this ſtate, alone and abandoned to himſelf, could do nothing for his preſervation. It was neceſſary, therefore, that he ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld unite himſelf, and aſſociate with his like, in order to bring together their ſtrength and intelligence in common ſtock. It is by this union that he has triumphed over ſo many evils, that he has faſhioned this globe to his uſe, reſtrained the rivers, ſubjugated the ſeas, inſured his ſubſiſtence, conquered a part of the animals in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to ſerve him, and driven others far from his empire, to the depths of deſerts or of woods, where their number diminiſhes from age to age. What a man alone would not have been able to effect, men have executed in concert; and all together they preſerve their work. Such is the origin, ſuch the advantage and the end of all ſociety.</p>
            <p>Government owes its birth to the neceſſity of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repreſſing the injuries which the aſſociated indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals had to fear from one another. It is the ſentinel who watches, in order that the common labours be not diſturbed.</p>
            <p>Thus ſociety originates in the wants of men, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their vices. Society tends always to good; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ought always to tend to the repreſſing of evil. Society is the firſt, it is in its origin independent and free; government was inſtituted for it, and is but its inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is for one to command; it is for the other to obey. Society created the public power; government, which has received it from ſociety, ought to conſecrate it entirely to its uſe. In ſhort, ſociety is eſſentially good; government, as is well known, may be, and is but too often, evil.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid that we were all born equal; that is not ſo: that we had all the ſame rights. I am ignorant of what are rights, where there is an inequality of talents, or of ſtrength, and no ſecurity nor ſanction: that nature offered to us all the ſame dwelling, and the ſame reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that is not ſo: that we are all endowed indifferently
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017686_0024_0FA21D54032920B8"/>
with the ſame means of defence; that is not ſo: and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> know not in what ſenſe it can be true, that we all enjoy the ſame qualities of mind and body.</p>
            <p>There is amongſt men an original inequality which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can remedy. It muſt laſt for ever; and all that can be obtained by the beſt legiſlation, is, not to deſtroy it, but to prevent the abuſe of it.</p>
            <p>But in making diſtinctions between her children, like a ſtep mother, in creating ſome children ſtrong and others weak, has not nature herſelf formed the germe or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of tyranny? I do not think it can be denied; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we look back to a time anterior to all legiſlation, a time in which man will be ſeen as paſſionate and as void of reaſon as a brute.</p>
            <p>What then have founders of nations, what have legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators propoſed to themſelves? To obviate all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters ariſing from this germe when it is expanded, by a ſort of artificial equality, which might reduce all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a ſociety, without exception, under an impartial, ſole authority. It is a ſword which moves gently, equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and indifferently, over every head: but this ſword was ideal. It was neceſſary that there ſhould be a hand, a corporeal being who ſhould hold it.</p>
            <p>What has reſulted thence? Why, that the hiſtory of civilized man is but the hiſtory of his miſery. All the pages of it are ſtained with blood; ſome with the blood of the oppreſſors, the others with the blood of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p>In this point of view, man appears more wicked and more miſerable than a beaſt. D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fferent ſpecies of beaſts ſubſiſt on different ſpecies. But ſocieties of men have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſed to attack each other. Even in the ſame ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety there is no condition but devours and is devoured, whatever may have been or are the forms of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or artificial equality, which have been oppoſed to the primitive and natural inequality.</p>
            <p>But are the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e the forms of government, ſuppoſing them made by the choice, and the free choice, of the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers in a country, and whatever ſanction they may have received, whether that of oaths, or of unanimous accord,

as of their duration, are they obligatory upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants? There is no ſuch thing: and it is impoſſible that you Engliſhmen, who have ſucceſſively undergone ſo many different revolutions in your political conſtitution, toſſed as you have been from monarchy to tyranny, from tyranny to ariſtocracy, from ariſtocracy to democracy, and from democracy to anarchy; it is impoſſible that you, without accuſing yourſelves of rebellion and of perjury, can think otherwiſe than I do.</p>
            <p>We examine things with a philoſophic eye; and it is well known, that it is not the ſpeculations of philoſophers which bring on civil troubles. No ſubjects are more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient than we are. I proceed then in purſuit of my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, without any cauſe to fear that miſchief can follow from my reaſoning.</p>
            <p>If the people are happy under their form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will keep it. If they are unhappy, it will not be either your opinions or mine, it will be the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſuffering more, and longer, which will determine them to change it; a ſalutary impulſe, which the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor will call revolt, though it be but the juſt exerciſe of a natural and unalienable right of the man who is oppreſſed, and even of the man who is not oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>A man wills and chuſes for himſelf. He cannot will nor chuſe for another; and it would be a madneſs to will and to chuſe for him who is yet unborn, for him who will not yet exiſt for ages. There is no individual but who, diſcontented with the form of the government of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, may go elſewhere to ſeek a better. There is no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety but which has the ſame right to change, as their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had to adopt, their form of government. Upon this point, it is with ſocieties as if they were at the firſt moment of their civilizaiion. Without which there would be a great evil; nay, the greateſt of evils would be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a remedy. Millions of men would be condemned to miſery without end. Conclude then with me.</p>
            <p>That there is no form of government which has the prerogative to be immutable.</p>
            <p>No political authority, which, created yeſterday, or a thouſand years ago, may not be ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:017686_0026_0FA21D5584229418"/>No power, however reſpectable, however ſacred, that is authoriſed to regard the ſtate as its property.</p>
            <p>Whoever thinks otherwiſe is a ſlave. It is to be an ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator of the work of his own hands.</p>
            <p>Whoever thinks otherwiſe is a madman, who devotes himſelf to eternal miſery, who devotes to it his family, his children, and his children's children, in allowing to his anceſtors the right of ſtipulating for him when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted not, and in arrogating to himſelf the right of ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating for a progeny which does not yet exiſt.</p>
            <p>All authority in this world has begun either by the conſent of the ſubjects, or by the power of the maſter. In both one and the other caſe, it may juſtly end. There is no preſcription in favour of tyranny againſt liberty.</p>
            <p>The truth of theſe principles is ſo much the more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, becauſe that all power by its very nature tends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

this failure of faith, are beyond our imagination. And, behold, ſuch is the inſtant marked out for you to make you declare againſt your colonies, that is, to make you raiſe up againſt yourſelves, an unjuſt, mad, ruinous war. What will become of you, when an important branch of your commerce ſhall be deſtroyed; when you ſhall have but a third of your poſſeſſions; when you ſhall have maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred a million or two of your countrymen; when your force ſhall be exhauſted, your traders ruined, your manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers reduced to ſtarve; when your debt ſhall be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and your revenue decreaſed! Look well to it; the blood of the Americans will ſooner or later fall heavy on your heads. Its effuſion will be revenged by your own hands; and you are arriving at the point.</p>

               <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>theſe people are rebels.</hi>—Rebels! And who? becauſe they will not be your ſlaves. A people ſubjected to the will of another people, who can diſpoſe as they chuſe of their government, of their laws, and of their trade; tax them at their pleaſure; ſet bounds to their induſtry, and enchain it by arbitrary prohibitions, are bond ſervants, yes, certainly are bond-ſervants; and their ſervitude is worſe than what they would undergo if governed by a tyrant. Deliverance from the oppreſſion of a tyrant is effected by his expulſion, or his death. You have delivered yourſelves by each of theſe methods. But a nation is not to be put to death, is not to be expelled. Liberty is only to be expected from a rupture, which by its conſequences involves one of the nations, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both of them, in ruin. A tyrant is a monſter with a ſingle head, which may be ſtruck off at a ſingle blow. A tyrannic nation is an hydra with a thouſand heads, for the cutting o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of which a thouſand ſwords muſt be lifted up together. The crime of oppreſſion committed by a tyrant collects all the indignation upon him alone.

               <hi>But they are our ſubjects</hi>—Your ſubjects! no more than the inhabitants of Wales are ſubjects to thoſe of Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. The authority of one nation over another cannot be founded but upon conqueſt, upon general conſent, or upon conditions propoſed on one part, and accepted on the other. Conqueſt binds no more than theft: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of anceſtors cannot be obligatory upon deſcendants: and there can be no condition which muſt not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be excluſive of the ſacrifice of liberty. Liberty is not to be bartered for any thing, becauſe there is not any thing which is of a comparable price. Such have been the diſcourſes held by you to your tyrants, ſuch hold we to you for your coloniſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The earth which they occupy is our's.</hi>—Your's! it is thus you call it becauſe you uſurped it. But be it ſo. Does not the charter of conceſſion oblige you to treat the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans as countrymen? Do you do ſo? But we are well employed here truly in talking of conceſſions by charters, by which men grant what they are not maſters of, what conſequently they have not the right to grant to a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of weak people, forced by circumſtances to receive as a gratification that which belongs to them of natural right. And then, have the deſcendants who are now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been called to a compact ſigned by their anceſtors? Either confeſs the truth of this principle, or recal the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of James. What right had you to drive him away which we have not to ſeparate ourſelves from you? ſay the Americans to you: and what have you to ſay in anſwer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are ungrateful: we are their founders; we have been their defenders; we have run in debt upon their account.</hi>— Say as much or more upon your own than theirs. If you have undertaken their defence, it was as you would have undertaken that of the Suitan of Conſtantinople, had your ambition or your intereſt required it. But have they not requitted you, in delivering up to you their productions; in receiving your merchandiſe excluſively at the exorbitant price you would pleaſe to put upon it; in ſubjecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to prohibitions which cramped their induſtry, and to reſtrictions by which you have oppreſſed their property?
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017686_0029_0FA21D5950643A60"/>
Have they not helped you? Have they not run in debt upon your account? Have they not taken arms and fought for you? When you have made your requeſts to them, which is the proper way of dealing with freemen, have they not complied with them? When did you ever expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience a refuſal from them, but when you clapped a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonet to their breaſt, and ſaid, <hi>Your money or life; die or be ſlaves?</hi> What! becauſe you have been beneficent, have you a right to be oppreſſive? What! and ſhall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions too build on gratitude the barbaroos claim, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe, and trample under foot, thoſe who have had the misfortune to receive their favours? Ah! individuals perhaps, though it is by no means a duty, individuals may, perhaps, in a benefactor, tolerate a tyrant. In them, it is great, it is magnanimous, undoubtedly, to conſent to be wretched, that they may not be ungrateful. But nations have a different morality. The public hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is the firſt law, as the firſt duty. The firſt obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe great bodies is with themſelves. They owe, before all other things, liberty and juſtice to the members which compoſe them. Every child which is burn to the ſtate, every new citizen who comes to breathe the air of the country he has choſen, or nature given him, is enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to the greateſt happineſs he can enjoy. Every obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which cannot be reconciled with that, is broken. Every contrary claim, is a wicked attempt upon his rights. And what is it to him, that his anceſtors have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, if he is deſtined to be himſelf oppreſſed? With what right can be exacted from him the payment of this uſurious debt of benefits, which he has never felt? No, no. The wiſhing to arm one's ſelf with ſuch a claim, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a whole nation, and its poſterity, is to overthrow all the ideas of policy and order, and, whilſt one invokes the name of morality, to betray all its laws. What have you not done for Hanover? Do you command at Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? All the republics of Greece were bound together by mutual ſervices; but did any one exact, as a mark of gratitude, the right of diſpoſing of the government of the ſuccou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then, there will remain to you but remorſe and ſhame. There is a decree of nature which you ſhall not change; which is, that great bodies give laws to little ones. But, tell me, if the Americans ſhould then undertake againſt Great Britain, what you have now undertaken againſt them, what would you ſay? Preciſely what they at this moment ſay to you.

Your ports are open to all the world; and you ſhut up the ports of your coloniſts. Your merchandize is wafted where you pleaſe; and their's muſt neceſſarily come to you. You manufacture, and you will not ſuffer them to manufacture. They have ſkins, they have iron; and they muſt deliver up to you, unwrought, this iron and theſe ſkins. What you acquire at a low price, they muſt buy of you at the price which your capacity impoſes. You offer them up as victims to your traders; and becauſe your India Company was in danger, the Americans muſt needs repair their loſſes. And yet you call them your countrymen and fellow-citizens; and it is thus that you invite them to receive your conſtitution? Go to, go to.

The high-ſpirited and generous Spartans, ſo extolled in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern ſtory, have ſet you the example. Like them, and with their faces muffled in their cloaks, ſhall our fellow-citizens, and the bravoes in our pay, go clan-deſtinely, and by night, to maſſacre the children of our Helots, at their father's ſide, and on their mother's breaſt; and leave alive but ſuch a number of them, as may be ſufficient for their labours, and conſiſtent with our ſafety."</p>

If the reſentment, excited by your cruelties, can be calmed; if the Americans can ſhut their eyes to the devaſtation which ſurrounds them; if, in paſſing over the ruins of their towns deſtroyed by fire, and their fields whitened by the bones of murdered relatives; if, in drawing in with every reſpiration the ſcent of the blood which your hands have on all ſides ſhed, they can forget the outrages of your deſpotiſm; if they can prevail upon themſelves to place the leaſt confidence in your declarations of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to believe that you have indeed renounced the

You would be free; be ye free. Be ſo, in the whole extent which we have ourſelves given to this ſacred name. It is not of us that you hold this right. Not unto us, not unto us, doth belong the power, by which it is to be given, or taken away. You have received it, as we did, from nature, which the fine and ſwords of tyrants may oppoſe, but which the ſins and ſwords of tyrants cannot deſtroy. We lay claim to no ſort of ſuperiority over you. We aſpire but at the honor of equality. This glory is ſufficient for us.

Let the tyrants of all countries, let all oppreſſors, political or ſacred, know, that there exiſts upon the earth a place, where a deliverance from their chains is to be found; where afflicted, dejected humanity has lifted up her head; where harveſts grow for the poor; where laws are no more than the ſecurity of happineſs; where religion is free, and conſcience has ceaſed to be a ſlave; where, in ſhort, nature ſeems to put in her plea of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, for having created man; and government, ſo long time guilty, over all the earth, makes at laſt the reparation of its crimes. Let the idea of ſuch an aſylum ſerve as a terror and reſtraint to deſpots: for if they have no kindneſs about their hearts, and look with indifference on the happineſs of man, they have at leaſt much avarice and ambition, which muſt make them anxious to preſerve both their riches and their power.</p>

It might recal to our depraved and daſtard hearts, with a ſenſe of the value and the grandeur of liberty, the energy to preſerve it. But if it muſt be, that ſuch an example as your's ſhall want power to prompt us; if it muſt be, that ſlavery, the never failing follower of venality, ſhall be, one day, eſtabliſhed in that land, which has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undated with blood in the cauſe of freedom, which has ſeen ſcaffolds erected for the puniſhment of tyrants; then will we emigrate like your fathers, then will we abandon, in a body, the ungrateful iſle, delivered up to a deſpot, and leave the monſter, to reign and roar, in a deſart, for domain.

Let us invoke, to ſtill add ſolemnity to the treaty, let us invoke our common anceſtors, who were all animated by the ſpirit of liberty like you, and did not dread to die in its defence. Let us call to witneſs, the memory of the illuſtrious founders of your colonies, that of your auguſt legiſlators, of the philoſophic Locke, the firſt man upon the earth who made a code of toleration, of the venerable Penn, the firſt who founded a city of brethren. The ſpirits of theſe great men, who ſurely at this moment are beholding us with earneſtneſs and with pleaſure, are worthy to preſide at a treaty, which is about to draw the bleſſings of peace upon a double world. Swear we, in their preſence; ſwear we, upon the very arms, with which you have ſo valiantly withſtood us; ſwear we, to remain for ever united, and for ever true; and when the oath of peace ſhall have been pronounced by all, make, of theſe ſame arms, a ſacred depoſite in ſome hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed pile, where the father's ſhall ſhew them to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations as they riſe; and there keep them carefully from age to age, in order to their being, one day, turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt, be he Engliſh or American, who ſhall dare propoſe the rupture of that alliance, which is equally uſeful, equally honorable to both the names."</p>
            <p>At this diſcourſe, I hear the towns, the villages, the fields, all the ſhores of North-America reſound, with live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt acclamation, with tendereſt repetition of the endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing names of brother and of mother, applied to your country and her ſons. And whilſt the conflagrations of war are ſucceeded by bonfires and ſports, and every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of a heart-felt triumphant joy, I ſee the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, envious of your power, to ſtand aghaſt, in ſilence, aſtoniſhment, deſpair.</p>

Will its acts be the decrees of a free people, or edicts dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the court? I am preſent at the deliberations of your houſes. In theſe revered reſorts I hear wiſdom ſpeak by the mouth of moderation. Soft perſuaſion ſeems to flow there, from the lips of moſt diſtinguiſhed orators. My heart is filled with hope: my eyes over-run with tears. Preſently a voice, the organ of deſpotiſm and of war, ſuſpends the delicious, ſweet emotion.</p>
            <p>"Engliſhmen, cries a mad haranguer, can you heſitate a moment? It is your rights, it is your muſt important intereſts, it is the glory of your name, that you are called upon to defend. It is not a foreign power which attacks theſe eſſential objects. They are menaced by an interior, domeſtic enemy. The danger therefore is more imminent, the outrage the more ſenſible.</p>

Let the ſword of juſtice fall heavy on the hands which dared diſplay it. Let us be expeditious. In theſe caſes there is a firſt moment which muſt be ſeized on; revolutions ſhould be ſtrangled in their birth. Give not to minds, yet in amazement, time to grow familiar with their guilt; to the ringleaders, time to confirm their power; not to the people, that of learning to obey new maſters.

Diſplay to their eyes, the power and majeſty of the Britiſh empire: they will preſently be falling at your feet; and go in an inſtant from terror to compunction, from compunction to obedience. If we muſt have recourſe to the ſeverity of arms, let us have no ſcruples. In civil war, pity is a moſt miſtaken virtue. When the ſword is once drawn, it ought not to be ſtayed, but by ſubmiſſion. It is for them to anſwer now, to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

            <p>"In order to make us ſuſpend our blows, and diſarm our hands, we have been told, and told repeatedly, that the land is peopled by our countrymen, by our friends, by our brethren.

They talk of liberty: I reſpect this name as much as they do; but by this liberty, is it independence, that we are to underſtand?

Yes, all; even to that pacific ſect, enjoined ſtrictly by their founder never to dip their hands in blood; they, who have reſpected the lives and the rights of ſavage people; they, who by an enthuſiaſm of humanity, have ſtruck off the fetters from their ſlaves: now, equally faithleſs to their country and their religion, they arm their hands for ſlaughter; and it is againſt you. They treat all men as brethren; and you, you only, of all people, are excluded from the title. They have ſhewn the world that the ſavages of America, that the negroes of Africa, are henceforward leſs alien to them than the citizens of Britain.</p>
            <p>"Arm, then, arm. Britons, ſtrike home; revenge, revenge, your country's wrongs, your offended rights. Revenge the treaſon to your greatneſs.

            <p>The ſophiſms of a fretting, ſtrutting ſprechifier, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by royal power and national pride, ſuppreſs, in the majority of the repreſentatives of the people, the deſire of pacific meaſures. New reſolutions reſemble thoſe which begot them; but with aggravated features of fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and deſpotiſm. Levies of troops, equipments of fleets.

            <p>Until this memorable period, the Americans had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined themſelves to a reſiſtance, authorized even by the Engliſh laws.

The only buſineſs now, was to give energy to minds ready to receive it. This was the effect which a work, entitled <hi>"Common Senſe,"</hi> produced. We ſhall give here the ſum and ſubſtance of its doctrine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tying ourſelves down to its exact form and order.</p>
            <p>Never, ſays the author of this celebrated performance, never did a more grand concernment call for the attention of the world. It is not that of a city or a province, it is that of an immenſe continent, and of a conſiderable por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the globe. It is not the affair of a day, it is that of ages. The preſent is about to decide upon a long fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity; and many hundreds of years after that we ſhall be no more, the ſun, in illuminating this hemiſphere, will il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate our glory, or expoſe our ſhame. A long time did we ſpeak of peace and reconcilement: all is changed, On the day when, in conſequence of the recourſe which has been had to arms, the firſt drop of blood was ſhed, time for diſquiſition paſſed away. A day has given birth to a revolution. A day has tranſported us to another age.</p>
            <p>Timid ſouls, ſouls who meaſure the future by the paſt, think that we ſtand in need of the protection of England. That protection might be uſeful to a riſing colony; it is become dangerous for a nation formed. Infancy muſt needs be ſupported, in its weak endeavours to walk; youth ſhould march actively and freely, in power and pride of port. The nation, as well as the man, who may have the power and right to protect me, may have the power and will to oppreſs me. I give up the ſupport of a protector, to be ſecured from the fear of a maſter.</p>
            <p>In Europe, the people are two much agitated to allow to this part of the world the enjoyment of conſtant peace. In thoſe courts and nations intereſts meet intereſts, and joſtle without end. As friends of England we muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily have all her enemies for our own. This alliance
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:017686_0045_0FA21D68414A2B70"/>
will entail upon America the dower of perpetual war. Let us part, let us part. Neutrality, trade and peace; ſuch, and ſuch only, can be the foundations of our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>The authority of Great-Britain over America muſt ſooner or later be extinct. So wills nature, neceſſity, and time. The Engliſh government can, therefore, give us only a tranſient conſtitution; and we ſhall bequeath to our poſterity but debts, and diſſentions, and a precarion ſtate. If we would inſure their happineſs, let us part. If we are fathers, if we love our children, let us part. Laws and liberty are the heritage we owe them.</p>
            <p>England is too far removed from us; we cannot be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by ſuch a diſtant country. What, to traverſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, two thouſand leagues, to claim juſtice, or to aſk for laws! to exculpate ourſelves from imaginary crimes, or ſolicit, with meanneſs, the court and miniſters of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign clime! What, to wait for years for every anſwer; and to find, as we might too often, when we had croſſed and recroſſed the ocean, that injuſtice only would be the product of our voyage! No; to be a great ſtate, the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre and the ſeat of power muſt be in the ſtate itſelf. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the deſpotiſm of the Eaſt can inure men thus to receive their laws from rulers far remote, or from the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws, by whom inviſible tyrants are repreſented. But let it not be forgotten, that the more the diſtance is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, the more ponderous and cruel is the preſſure of the deſpotic power; and the people then, deprived of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the advantages of government, feel only its mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and its vices.</p>
            <p>Nature did not create a world to ſubject it to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of an iſland. Nature has eſtabliſhed the laws of equilibrium, which ſhe every where obſerves, in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens as well as upon the earth. By the laws of bodies, and of diſtances, America can belong but to itſelf.</p>
            <p>There is no government without a mutual confidence between him who commands and him who obeys. It is all over; this mutual confidence is gone, and never can return. England has too clearly ſhewn that ſhe would command us like ſlaves; America, that ſhe was equally

ſenſible both of her rights and of her ſtrength. They have each betrayed their ſecret. From this moment there can be no further treaty. It would be ſigned by hatred and diſtruſt; hatred, which never pardons; diſtruſt, which, by its very nature, can never be reconciled.</p>
            <p>Would you know what an accommodation would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce? Your ruin. You ſtand in need of laws; you will not obtain them. Who would give them to you? The Engliſh nation? She is jealous of your increaſe. The  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

us! Ah, we ſhould then be but a vile object of pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonder to Europe, of indignation to America, and of contempt even to our enemies. If we can obey them, we had not the right to combat them. Liberty only can abſolve us. Liberty, and perfect liberty, is the only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject worthy of our labours and our dangers. What do I ſay? From this moment it is our own. Our title is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on the bloody plains of Lexington; it was there that the hand of England tore the contract by which we were united to her. Yes. At the moment when the report of the firſt muſquet diſcharged by England was heard, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture herſelf proclaimed us free and independent.</p>
            <p>Let us profit by the benefit of foes. The youth of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is the age moſt favourable to their independence. It is the time of energy and vigour. Our ſouls are not yet ſurrounded by that apparatus of luxury, which ſerves as hoſtage to a tyrant. Our arms are not yet enervated in the arts of ſoftneſs. Amongſt us are not ſeen to domineer thoſe nobles, who, by their very conſtitution, are the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary allies of kings; who love not liberty, but when they can make of it an inſtrument of oppreſſion; thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, eager for privilege and title, for whom, in critical conjunctures, the people are but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ools, for whom the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power is a ready corruptor.</p>
            <p>Your colonies are formed of plain, brave, laborious, upright men, proprietors and cultivators of their land in one. Liberty is their firſt want. Rural labours have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hardened them for war. Public enthuſiaſm brings to light unknown talents. It is in revolutions that great minds are formed, that heroes ſhow themſelves, and take their place. Remember Holland, and all her ſons; and that number of extraordinary men to which the quarrel of her liberty gave birth: behold in theſe men an example for you; remember their ſucceſs, and behold a preſage.</p>
            <p>Let our firſt ſtep be to form a conſtitution by which we may be united. The moment is arrived. Later, it would be abandoned to an uncertain fururity and the caprice of chance. The more people and riches we ſhall acquire, the more barriers will there be raiſed up between us. Then, how ſhall ſo many provinces and intereſts be made

conſiſtent? For ſuch an union, it is neceſſary that each people ſhould at once be ſenſible, both of the particular weakneſs, and the general ſtrength. There muſt be great calamities or great fears. It is then amongſt communities as amongſt individuals, that ſpring up thoſe firm and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous friendſhips which aſſociate ſouls with ſouls, and intereſts with intereſts. It is then, that one ſpirit, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from every part, forms the genius of ſtates; and that all the ſcattered powers become by union a ſingle and a formidable power. Thanks to our perſecuters, we are at this epoch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. If we have courage, it will be that of our happineſs. Few nations have laid hold of the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able moment to form their government. Once eſcaped, this moment returns no more; and anarchy or ſlavery pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the neglect of it for ages. Let not a ſimilar fault prepare for us ſimilar regret. Regret is impotent.</p>
            <p>Let the moment, which, in reſpect to us, is ſingular, be ſeized on. We have it in our power to frame the fineſt conſtitution that the world has ſeen. You have read in your ſacred books how mankind were deſtroyed by the general deluge. A ſingle family ſurvived, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Supreme Being to re-people the earth. We are this family. Deſpotiſm has deluged all; and we can a ſecond time renew the world.</p>
            <p>We are about, at this moment, to decide the fate of a race of men more numerous, perhaps, than all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Europe put together. Shall we wait till we may be the prey of a conqueror, and ſuffer the hope of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe to be deſtroyed? Imagine to yourſelves, that all the generations of the world to come, have at this moment their eyes fixed on us, and demand of us their liberty. We are about to fix their deſtiny: If we give them up, they will, perhaps, one day, drag their chains acroſs our tombs, and load them with imprecations.</p>
            <p>Call to mind a writing which has appeared amongſt you, and had for a motto, UNITE OR DIE.</p>
            <p>Let us unite then, and begin by declaring our INDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENDENCE. That alone can efface the name of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubjects, which our inſolent oppreſſors have dared to give us. That alone can make us riſe up to the dignity
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:017686_0049_0FA21D6D10A31050"/>
which is our due, inſure us allies amongſt the powers, impreſs reſpect even upon our enemies, and, if we treat with them, give us the right to treat, with the power and majeſty which becomes a nation.</p>
            <p>But I repeat it; we muſt be quick. Our uncertainty makes our weakneſs. Let us dare to be free, and we are ſo. Ready to take the leap, we draw back. We read the countenances of each other with anxious curioſity. It ſeems, as if we were aſtoniſhed at our own boldneſs, and that our very courage gave us fear. But it is not now the time to be muſing on calculations. It is paſſed. In great affairs, in which there is but one great part to take, too much circumſpection ceaſes to be prudence. Every thing that is extreme, demands reſolution in the extreme. Then, the boldeſt meaſures are the wiſeſt; and the exceſs of boldneſs itſelf becomes the means and the warrant of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Such was the ſubſtance of the ſentiments diſplayed in this work. They confirmed in their principles the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing ſpirits who had long required a total ſeparation from the mother-country. The timid citizens, who had been wavering till then, now declared deciſively for this great and intereſting rupture. The votaries of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence were numerous enough to bring the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, on the 4th of July, 1776, to the determination to pronounce it.</p>

            <p>A ſtep which broke the ties formed by blood, by reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and by habit, was to be ſupported by a grand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert of wills, by wiſe and vigorous meaſures. The United States of America gave themſelves a federate conſtitution, which joined to the interior advantages of republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, all the power of monarchy.</p>
            <p>Each province had an aſſembly formed by the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the different diſtricts, and in which the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power reſided. The executive power was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to its preſident. His rights and his obligations were, to liſten to every application from any of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; to call them together when circumſtances might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; to provide for the arming and ſubſiſting troops, and concert the operations of them with their officers. He was at the head of a ſecret committee, which was to hold a continual correſpondence with the general congreſs. The time of his continuance in office was limited to two years. But the laws permitted a prolongation of it.</p>
            <p>The provinces were not obliged to render an account of their adminiſtration to the great council of the nation, though compoſed of the deputies of all the colonies. The ſuperiority of the general congreſs over the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes, was confined to matters relative to politics and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>But ſome people have thought that the inſtitution of this body was not ſo well contrived as the legiſlation of the provinces. It ſeems, it muſt be confeſſed, that fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtates, which raiſe themſelves from the condition of ſubjects up to that of being independent, cannot, without danger, truſt their delegates with the unlimited power of making peace and war. For theſe delegates, ſhould they be corrupt or ill informed, might bring back the whole ſtate to the bondage which it is ſeeking to eſcape from. It ſeems, that in theſe times of revolution, the public will cannot be too well known, too literally pronounced. It is neceſſary, undoubtedly, they ſay, that all the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, all the operations, which relate to the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and offence, ſhould be decided on by the common
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:017686_0053_0FA21D6FB7012570"/>
repreſentatives of the body of the ſtate: but the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of war, and the conditions of peace, ought to be deliberated upon in every province; and the deliberations to be tranſmitted to the congreſs by the deputies, who would ſubmit the opinion of their provinces to the plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of voices. In ſhort, they add, that if in eſtabliſhed governments it is proper that the people ſhould rely with confidence in the wiſdom of their ſenate, in a ſtate where the conſtitution is forming, where the people, as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of their fate, call for their liberty, ſword in hand, it is neceſſary that all the citizens ſhould be continually in council, in camp, in the public places, and have their eyes continually open upon the repreſentatives to whom their deſtiny has been committed.</p>
            <p>Though theſe principles are true in general, there might be a difficulty, we may anſwer, in applying them to the new republic formed by the Americans. It is not with that republic as with the federate republics which we ſee in Europe, I mean Holland and Switzerland, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy a country but of ſmall extent, and in which it is eaſy to eſtabliſh a rapid communication between all the provinces. The ſame thing may be ſaid of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies of ancient Greece. Theſe ſtates were ſituated at a ſmall diſtance from each other, confined almoſt within the narrow compaſs of the Peloponneſus, or, at moſt, within the limits of the Archipelago. But the United States of America, diſperſed over an immenſe continent; occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the new world a ſpace of almoſt fifteen degrees; ſeparated by deſarts, by mountains, by gulfs, and by a vaſt extent of coaſt, cannot have the advantage of this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid communication. If the general congreſs could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide upon political intereſts without the particular delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of each province; if on every important occaſion, on every unforeſeen event, it ſhould be neceſſary to give new inſtructions, and, as we may ſay, a new power to the repreſentatives, this body would remain inactive. The diſtances to be paſſed, the delays and the multitude of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, might too often be hurtful to the public good.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is never at the birth of a conſtitution, and amidſt the great fermentations of liberty, that there is
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:017686_0054_0FA21D70F36C5268"/>
cauſe to fear that a body of repreſentatives ſhould, either from weakneſs or corruption, betray the intereſts with which they are entruſted. It is rather in ſuch a body that the general ſpirit is both exalted and inflamed. In that reſides, in its vigour, the genius of the nation. Choſen by the eſteem of their fellow-citizens, choſen at a time when every public function is a danger, and every vote an honour, placed at the head of thoſe who will compoſe for ever that celebrated Areopagus, and thence even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally carried to regard the public liberty as their own work, they cannot but have the enthuſiaſm of founders, who make it their pride to have their names engraved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly, to be read by diſtant ages, on the frontiſpiece of an auguſt monument which is riſing. The fears which the partiſans of the contrary ſyſtem might have upon this object, ſeem, therefore, to have ſmall foundation.</p>
            <p>I will ſay more. It might happen that a people who are fighting for liberty, fatigued with a long and painful ſtruggle, and more ſtruck with the preſent danger than the future good, might feel their courage failing, and perhaps, one day, be tempted to prefer dependence and peace to independence and tumult, attended with peril and with blood. Then would it be advantageous to this people to have diveſted themſelves of the power of making peace with their oppreſſors, and depoſited it in the hands of the ſenate which they had choſen to ſerve as an organ to their will, when this will could ſhew itſelf with freedom, pride, and courage. It ſeems as it each individual, when he had given his voice for the inſtituting ſuch a ſenate, ſhould ſay to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I raiſe the ſtandard of war againſt my ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. If my arm ſhould weary in the war, if I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe myſelf ſo low as to implore repoſe, ſupport me againſt my weakneſs. Liſten to no prayer or wiſh unworthy of me, which I diſavow beforehand; and pronounce not the name of peace until my bonds be broken.</p>
            <p>In reality, if we conſult the hiſtory of republics, we ſhall ſee, that the multitude have almoſt always great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity and heat at the firſt moment; but that it is only in a ſmall number of choſen men, and qualified to ſerve as chiefs, that reſide thoſe conſtant and vigorous reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:017686_0055_0FA21D714F8D6648"/>
which march, with a ſteady, firm, undaunted ſtep, towards ſome great and worthy end, never turning, or looking, from the path, and never ceaſing moſt ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to combat all obſtructions that they meet with, from fortune, from miſery, and from man.</p>
            <p>However it be, and whatſoever ſide may be taken in this political diſcuſſion, the Americans had not yet created for themſelves a ſyſtem of government, when in the month of March, Hopkins plundered the iſland of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a large train of artillery and a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ammunition; when in the beginning of May, Carleton drove out of Canada the provincial troops, which were employed to reduce Quebec with a view of compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conqueſt of that important territory; when in the month of June, Clinton and Parker had been ſo vigorouſly repulſed on the Southern coaſts of America. Far greater ſcenes followed the declaration of independence.</p>
            <p>Howe had been appointed to ſuperſede the feeble Gage: and it was this new general who had evacuated Boſton. Having arrived on the 2d of April at Halifax, on the 10th of June he departed for Staten-Iſland. The forces, which were to act both by ſea and land, ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joined him according to expectation; and on the 28th of Auguſt he landed on Long-Iſland without oppoſition, under the protection of a fleet commanded by the admiral his brother. The Americans exhibited as little ſpirit in defending the interior part of their country as they did on the landing of the enemy.</p>
            <p>After a very feeble reſiſtance, and conſiderable loſs, they took refuge on the continent with a facility which would hardly have been granted them by a conqueror who knew how to avail himſelf of the advantages he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. The city of New-York too was abandoned by theſe new republicans with ſtill greater precipitation than they had evacuated Long Iſland: and they filed off to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Kingſbridge, where they appeared determined to make an obſtinate reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>If the Engliſh had followed up their ſucceſs with that vivacity which circumſtances demanded, the new-raiſed troops which had oppoſed them, had infallibly been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:017686_0056_0FA21D73DA7C78C8"/>
or reduced to the neceſſity of laying down their arms. On the contrary, they were allowed ſix week: to recover from their conſternation: nor did they abandon their intrenchments till the night of the firſt or ſecond of November, when the movements, which were making in their view, were ſufficient to convince them that their camp was upon the point of being attacked.</p>
            <p>Their commander in chief, Waſhington, was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to truſt the fate of his country to an action, which might, and naturally would have terminated to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of thoſe important intereſts which had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him. He knew, that delays, ever favourable to a native, are ever fatal to a ſtranger. This conviction determined him to retire to the Jerſeys with a deſign of protracting the war. Favoured both by the inclemency of the ſeaſon, by his knowledge of the country, and by the nature of the ground, which compenſated in ſome meaſure for the want of diſcipline, he had reaſon to flatter himſelf, that he ſhould be able to cover the greateſt part of this fertile province, and keep the enemy at a diſtance from Pennſylvania. In a moment, however, he ſees his colours abandoned by the ſoldiers, whoſe engagement, at the end of ſix, and even at the end of three months, had expired: and of an army of twenty five thouſand men, there ſcarce remained two thouſand five hundred, with which he was fortunate enough to retire beyond the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware.</p>
            <p>Without loſing a moment, the King's troops ought to have paſſed the river in purſuit of this handful of fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>At this time, perhaps, reproaches were caſt on the Engliſh general for being timid and too circumſpect in the operations of the campaign. Certain it is, however, that he was raſh enough in the diſtribution of his winter-can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonments.

They were diſpoſed in ſuch a manner, as if there remained not in America a ſingle individual, who had either inclination or power to moleſt them.</p>
            <p>This preſumption encouraged the militia of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, Maryland, and Virginia, collected together and re-united for the ſupport of the common cauſe.</p>
            <p>On the 25th of December they croſſed the Delaware, and fell accidentally upon Trenton, which was occupied by fifteen hundred of the twelve thouſand Heſſians, ſold in ſo baſe a manner, by their avaricious maſter, to the king of Great-Britain. This corps was maſſacred, taken, or entirely diſperſed. Eight days after three Engliſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments were in like manner driven from Princeton, but after having better ſupported their reputation than the foreign troops in their pay.</p>
            <p>Theſe unexpected events reduced the enemies of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, in the Jerſeys, to the neceſſity of confining their poſts to Amboy and Brunſwick, where yet they were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly harraſſed during the remainder of the winter.</p>
            <p>The effect of ſtrong paſſions, and of great dangers, is often to aſtoniſh the mind, and to throw it into that kind of torpor that deprives it of the uſe of its powers; by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees it recovers and collects itſelf; all its faculties, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for a moment, diſplay themſelves with redoubled vigour: every ſpring of action is awakened, and it feels its powers riſe at once to a level with the difficulties it has to encounter. In a great multitude there are always ſome who feel this immediate effect, which rapidly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates itſelf to others. Such a revolution took place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the confederate ſtates. It cauſed armed men to iſſue from all quarters.</p>
            <p>It was very late before the campaign of 1777 was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Engliſh army, in deſpair of penetrating into Pennſylvania by way of the Jerſeys, at laſt embarked on the 23d of July, and, by the bay of Cheſapeak, landed in a country which their generals may very juſtly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for not having invaded the year before. Their march is uninterrupted, till they reach Brandywine. There, on the 11th of September, they attack and beat the Americans, and arrive on the 30th at Philadelphia,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:017686_0058_0FA21D75D080EE08"/>
which had been abandoned on the 25th by the Congreſs, and a few days later or ſooner by the greateſt number of the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>This victory is attended with no conſequences. The conqueror ſees nothing around him but hatred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation. Pent up in a ſpace extremely circumſcribed, he meets with inſurmountable obſtacles in extending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf over an uncultivated country. Even his gold affords him not its uſual reſources in the neighbouring diſtricts, nor is there a poſſibility of any ſupplies, but what muſt neceſſarily croſs the ſeas. The irkſomeneſs of an impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of nine months duration, determined him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain New York by way of the Jerſeys; and under the command of Clinton, ſucceſſor to Howe, this long and dangerous retreat was effected, without ſuſtaining ſo much loſs as a more experienced enemy would have occaſioned.</p>
            <p>While the Engliſh were waſting away their time in Pennſylvania, an important ſcene opens itſelf in the more northern part of America. In the month of May, 1776, Carleton had driven the provincials out of Canada, and in October deſtroyed the armed ſloops which they had conſtructed on the Lake Champlain. This ſucceſs drew Burgoyne to Ticonderoga, in the month of July in the following year. At his approach, a garriſon conſiſting of four thouſand men, abandoned this important poſt, with the loſs of their rear-guard, their artillery, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh general was naturally preſumptuous. A weakneſs ſo extraordinary increaſed his arrogance. He had conceived the deſign of re uniting the troops of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada with thoſe of New-York by Hudſon's-river. This project was bold and great. Had he ſucceeded he would have out North-America in two, and, perhaps, have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the war. But, to have had ſucceſs, it would have been neceſſary, that whilſt one army was going down, the other ſhould have gone up, the river. Having failed in this idea. Burgoyne ought to have ſeen, from the very firſt ſteps of it, that his enterprize was chimerical. At every march it became more and more ſo. His communication grew more diſtant; his proviſions leſs abundant. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:017686_0059_0FA21D775C360FA8"/>
taking heart again, aſſembled from all parts round him. At length this unlucky body of men found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves caught, on the 13th of October, at Saratoga; and nations learned with aſtoniſhment, that ſix thouſand of the beſt diſciplined troops of the old hemiſphere, had laid down their arms before the huſbandmen of the new, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the fortunate Gates. Thoſe who remembered that the Swedes, under Charles the twelfth, till then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, had capitulated before the Ruffians, yet uncivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, did not accuſe the Engliſh troops, but only bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the imprudence of their general.</p>
            <p>This event, ſo deciſive in the opinion of our politicians, was of no greater conſequence than that with which other actions, leſs favourable to the American arms, had been attended. After three years of fighting, maſſacre, and devaſtacion, the ſtate of things was ſcarcely changed from what it had been a fortnight after the commencement of hoſtilities. Let us endeavour to diſcover the cauſes of ſo ſtrange a ſingularity.</p>
            <p>Great-Britain, accuſtomed to ſtorms at home, ſaw not at firſt all the danger there might be in the tempeſt which was riſing in her remote poſſeſſions. For a long time her troops had been inſulted at Boſton; an authority, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of her's, had been formed in the province of Maſſachuſetts. The other colonies were making diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to follow this example, had not the adminiſtration taken thoſe great objects into their ſerious conſideration. When th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> were laid before parliament, both houſes were filled with clamour; and much declamation followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much declamation that had gone before. The ſenate of the nation decreed at laſt, that the country which was rebellious to its decreed, ſhould by force be made obedient: but his violent reſolution was executed with the ſlowneſs too frequent in ſtates of freedom.</p>
            <p>England thought, in general, that coaſts without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that countries entirely open, could not reſiſt her fleets and armies. It did not appear to her that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition could be of ſufficient duration to give time to the peaceful huſbandmen of America to learn the art of war. It was forgotten that the climate, the rivers, the deſires,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:017686_0060_0FA21D78026F9C88"/>
the ſwamps, the want of proviſion, in proportion as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances were made into the country, and an infinity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natural obſtructions, militating againſt a rapid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in a region three-fourths uncultivated, ſhould have made a part of the calculation.</p>
            <p>Succeſs was ſtill more retarded by the influence of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes.</p>
            <p>Great-Britain is the region of party. Her kings have generally ſeemed to be well enough convinced of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of leaving public affairs to the management of the prevailing faction, by which they were conducted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly with intelligence and with vigour, becauſe the principal agents of which it was compoſed were animated by a common intereſt. Then, to public ſpirit, which reigns more in England than in any other government of Europe, was added the power of a faction, and that ſpirit of party which moves men's minds ſo powerfully, becauſe it is always the effect of paſſion. To rid himſelf of this reſtraint, George the third compoſed his council of detached, unconnected members. This innovation was not attended with any very great inconveniencies, as long as events rolled round in their common courſe. But as ſoon as a war with America had complicated a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, which was not before too ſimple, it was perceived that it had neither that ſtrength, nor that union, which are ſo neceſſary for the execution of great affairs. The wheels, too far aſunder, wanted, as we may ſay, a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of motion, and a common impulſe. They went ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhly and precipitately, by turns. The adminiſtration too much reſembled that of an ordinary monarchy, when the principle of action proceeds not from the head of an intelligent and active monarch, who brings together all the ſprings under his own hand. There was no longer any integrity or wholeneſs in what was undertaken, nor was there more of it in what was executed.</p>
            <p>A miniſtry, without harmony and concord, was expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the inceſſantly renewed attacks of a body of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, united, cloſe, and firm. Its reſolutions, be they what they would, were ſure to be combated by reaſoning or by ridicule. It was reproached for having been ſevere
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:017686_0061_0FA21D7A8DC84260"/>
with the diſtant members of the ſtate, as it would have been reproached for having been too tender to them. Even they who in parliament were the moſt outrageous againſt the treatment which had been ſhewn to the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans; they who moſt encouraged them to reſiſtance; they who, perhaps, ſecretly ſent them ſuccour, were as averſe to their independence as the very miniſters whom they laboured, without ceaſing, to remove or vilify. Could the oppoſition have ſucceeded in diſguſting the king with his confidents, or have obtained the ſacrifice of them by the cry of the nation, the project of ſubjugating America had ſtill been followed, but with more dignity, more force, and perhaps with meaſures better planned. As the reduction of the revolted provinces was not to be their work, they rather wiſhed that this immenſe part of the Britiſh empire might be ſeparated from it, than that it ſhould be re-united by any other hands than theirs.</p>
            <p>The activity of the generals repaired not the vice of theſe contrarieties, and the delays in conſequence. They indulged the ſoldier with too long repoſe; they employed in meditating, the time for acting; they approached new-raiſed men with the precaution they would have taken before veteran troops. The Engliſh, who have ſo much impetuoſity in party, are of a cool and calm character in other things. They are to be agitated but by violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. When this ſpring is wanting, they move ſlow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to count their ſteps. Then they govern themſelves by the temper of their mind, which, in general, if we except the arts of imagination and taſte, is, in every thing elſe, methodical and wiſe. In war, their valour never loſes ſight of principles, or leaves much to chance. Rarely do they leave, either on their flanks, or in their rear, any thing which may give them trouble. This ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem has its advantages, particularly in a cloſe and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row country, in a country ſet thick with ſtrong holds and fortified towns. But in the preſent circumſtances, and upon the vaſt continent of America, againſt a people who ſhould not have had time allowed them for their being fortified, or inured to war, the perfection of the art, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, had been to have forgot it, and to ſubſtitute, in its
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:017686_0062_0FA21D7B22483EC0"/>
ſtead, the rapid and impetuous march, and the mighty da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ngs which at once aſtoniſh, ſtrike, and overcome. It was in the firſt moments, above all, that it would have been neceſſary to impreſs upon the Americans, not the terror of ſuch ravages as affect a people, armed for their liberty, more with indignation than with fear; but that dread which is ſtruck from a ſuperiority of talents and of arms, and which a warlike people, of the old world, ſhould naturally be ſuppoſed to carry to the new. The confidence of victory had ſoon been victory itſelf. But by too much circumſpection, by their too ſervile attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to rules and principles, ſkilful leaders failed of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering to their country the ſervice it expected from them, and which it was juſtified in expecting.</p>
            <p>The troops, on their ſide, did not preſs their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders to lead them on. They were juſt come from a country, where the cauſe which had ſent them acroſs the ocean, made no impreſſion. It was, in the eyes of the people, but a broil which could not be of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. They confounded the debates it occaſioned in parliament with other debates, often of ſmall importance. It was not talked of; or if ſome perſons entertained themſelves with it, they were not more earneſt about it than about thoſe pieces of news, which, in great cities, occupy the idleneſs of every day. The indifference of the nation had communicated itſelf to the defenders of its rights. They would even have been afraid, perhaps, to gain too deciſive advantages over countrymen, who had taken arms but to keep themſelves from chains. In all the monarchies of Europe, the ſoldier is but an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of deſpotiſm, and has its diſpoſition. He looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf as belonging to the throne, and not to the country; and a hundred thouſand armed men, are but a hundred thouſand diſciplined and formidable ſlaves. The habit even of exerciſing the empire of force, that empire to which all gives way, contributes to extinguiſh in them every ſpark o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the love of liberty. At length, the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary government and ſubordination, which moves thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of arms by a ſingle voice, which permits no aſking, nor ſeeing, nor judging, nor thinking; and, at the first

ſignal, makes it a law to kill or die, compleats the work of changing theſe ſentiments into principles, which make what may be called the morals of their ſtate. It is not ſo in England. The influence of the conſtitution is ſo great, that it extends itſelf even to the troops. There, a man is a citizen before he is a ſoldier. Public opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming itſelf to the conſtitution, honours one, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regards the other, of theſe titles. That we ſee by the hiſtory of the revolutions and tempeſts by which that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent iſland has been torn, that the Engliſh ſoldier, though enliſted for life, preſerves for political liberty a paſſion, of which an idea is not eaſily to be formed in our countries of ſlaves.</p>
            <p>How ſhould the ardour which was wanting in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh troops have animated the Heſſians, the Brunſwickers, and the other Germans ranking under the ſame banners, all equally diſcontented with the princes who had ſold them, diſcontented with the ſovereign who had bought them, diſcontented with the nation which paid their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and diſcontented with their comrades, who treated their mercenarineſs with contempt? Beſides, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d alſo brothers in the enemy's camp, to whom they dreaded to give death, and from whoſe hand a wound would have grieved them with a double pain.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of the Engliſh army had been altered too, in conſequence of a revolution in the manners of their country, which had taken place about fifteen or eighteen years before. The ſucceſſes of the laſt war; the extenſion which the peace had given to commerce; the great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions made in the Eaſt Indies: all theſe means of fortune had, without interruption, accumulated in Great-Britain prodigious riches. Theſe riches kindled the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of new enjoyments. The great went to acquire them in foreign countries; and, above all, in France; and brought home the poiſon to their country. From the higher conditions, it flowed down into all the claſſes, even to the loweſt. To a character of plainneſs, ſimplicity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and haughtineſs, ſucceeded a taſte for exterior ſhew, for diſſipation, gallantry, and what is called politeneſs. Travellers who had formerly viſited this iſland ſo renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:017686_0064_0FA21D7D127C0E40"/>
thought themſelves in another climate. The conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had ſpread to the troops. They carried with them to the new hemiſphere the paſſion which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in the old, for gaming, for ſoft accommodation, and good living. In departing from their coaſt, they ſhould have renounced the ſuperfluities of which they were enamoured. This taſte for luxury, this ardour, ſo much the more violent as it was new, did not encourage them to purſue, into the interior part of the country, an enemy ever ready to plunge into it for ſhelter. Ye new politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, who advance with ſo much confidence, that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have no influence on the fate of nations; that, with regard to them, the meaſure of greatneſs is that of riches; that the pleaſures of peace and the voluptuouſneſs of the citizen cannot weaken the effect of thoſe great machines called armies, and of which the European diſcipline has, according to your account, ſo perfected the infallible and tremendous operations: you, who to ſupport your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, muſt turn away your eyes from the aſhes of Carthage and the ruins of Rome, upon the recital I am making to you; ſuſpend your judgment, and believe it poſſible that there may be opportunities of ſucceſs which are loſt by luxury. Believe, that, even to courageous troops, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on wants has been often the chief cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. It is too eaſy perhaps to brave only death. For nations corrupted by opulence, a ſeverer trial is reſerved, that of ſupporting the loſs of their pleaſures.</p>
            <p>Add to all theſe reaſons, that the means of war ſeldom arrived, acroſs ſuch a length of ſea, in the convenient ſeaſon for action. Add, that the councils of George the third were wiſely determined to have too much influence in military operations which were to be executed at ſuch a diſtance from them; and you will know the greateſt part of the obſtacles by which the ruinous efforts of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country againſt the freedom of her colonies were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>But how happened it that America did not herſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe from her ſhores theſe Europeans who were bringing to her chains or death?</p>
            <p>This new world was deſended by regular troops, which
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:017686_0065_0FA21D7D54C419E0"/>
at firſt had been enliſted but for three or ſix months, and afterwards for three years, or as long as hoſtilities might continue. It was defended by citizens who took the field only when their particular province was invaded or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced. Neither this army always on foot, nor this mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia caſually aſſembled, had a military turn. They were farmers, traders, lawyers, exerciſed only in the arts of peace, and conducted to danger by guides, as little verſed as their ſubalterns in the very complicated ſcience of war. In this ſtate of things, what hope could they have of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring themſelves with advantage againſt veterans in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, formed to evolution, inſtructed in tactics, and abundantly provided with all the inſtruments neceſſary to a vigorous attack, to an obſtinate defence?</p>
            <p>Enthuſiaſm alone might have ſurmounted theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but did there in reality exiſt more enthuſiaſm in the colonies than in the mother-country?</p>
            <p>The general opinion in England, was, that the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had eſſentially the right of taxing every country which made a part of the Britiſh empire. Perhaps, in the beginning of the troubles, not a hundred individuals were to be found who would have called this authority in queſtion. Yet no anger was excited by the refuſal of the Americans to acknowledge it. No hatred was borne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them even after they had taken arms in ſupport of their pretenſions. As the labours of the people in the interior part of the kingdom were not affected by it, as the ſtorm murmured but at a diſtance, every one was peaceably occupied with his buſineſs, or gave himſelf up without diſturbance to his pleaſures. They all waited for the concluſion of the drama without impatience, as if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready certain of what was to be exhibited in the unravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the plot.</p>
            <p>The ferment muſt be ſuppoſed to have ſhewn itſelf at firſt much greater in the new hemiſphere than the old. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But did that warmth ſuſtain itſelf? Had the firſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of imagination laſted, muſt not the repreſſing of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:017686_0066_0FA21D7DF950BAC0"/>
exceſſes have occupied the attention of the new authority? But ſo far from having cauſe to withhold courage, it had cowardice to purſue. It was ſeen to puniſh deſertion with death, ſtaining the ſtandard of liberty with blood. It was ſeen to refuſe admitting of an exchange of priſoners, for fear of augmenting the inclination of the troops to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render at the firſt ſummons. It was ſeen reduced to the neceſſity of erecting tribunals for the proſecution of the generals or their lieutenants who ſhould too eaſily give up the poſts which their vigilance was to guard. It is true, that a hoary patriot, of fourſcore years, who was deſired to return to his fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The intoxication was never general; and it could be but momentateous. None of thoſe energetic cauſes, which have produced ſo many revolutions upon the globe, exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in North-America. Neither religion nor lawe had there been outraged. The blood of martyrs or patriots had not there ſtreamed from ſcaffolds. Morals had not been there inſulted. Manners, cuſtoms, habits, no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject dear to nations had there been the ſport of ridicule. Arbitrary power had not there torn any inhabitant from the arms of his family and his friends, to drag him to a dreary dungeon. Public order had not been there invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The principles of adminiſtration had not been chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there; and the maxims of government had there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remained the ſame. The whole queſtion was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the knowing whether the mother country had, or had not, the right to lay, directly, or indirectly, a flight tax upon the colonies: for the accumulated griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in the manifeſto were valid only in conſequence of this leading grievance. This, almoſt metaphyſical, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, was ſcarcely of ſufficient importance to cauſe the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:017686_0067_0FA21D7F04ED46B8"/>
multitude to riſe, or at leaſt to intereſt them ſtrongly in a quarrel for which they ſaw their land deprived of the hands deſtined to its cultivation, their harveſts laid waſte, their fields covered with the dead bodies of their kindred, or ſtained with their own blood. To theſe calamities, the work of the royal troops upon the coaſt, were ſoon added more inſupportable ones in the heart of the country.</p>
            <p>Never had the reſtleſſneſs of the courts of London and Verſailles diſturbed the tranquillity of North America but both theſe powers brought ſome of the migratory clans in this part of the new hemiſphere to partake in their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary ſtrife. Inſtructed by experience in the weight which theſe bordes could add to the ſcale, the Engliſh and the coloniſts were equally reſolved to employ them for their mutual deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Carleton tried, firſt, to arm theſe barbarous bands in Canada. "It is the diſpute," ſaid they in anſwer to his ſolicitations, "of a father with his children; we do not think it right for us to enter into this domeſtic ſquabble." —"But if the rebels ſhould come to attack this province, would not you help us to drive them back?"—"Ever ſince the peace, the hatchet of war has been buried forty fathoms deep."—"You would certainly find it, if you were to dig for it."—"The helve of it is rotten, and we cannot make any uſe of it."</p>
            <p>The United States were not more fortunate. "We have heard talk of ſome differences that have happened between Old and New England (ſaid the tribe of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neidas to their deputies) but we ſhall never take a part in ſuch atrocious diviſions. War between brethren is a new and a ſtrange thing in theſe regions. Our traditions have left us no example of this nature. Suppreſs your mad ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; and may a benevolent ſun diſperſe the black vapour in which you are involved!"</p>
            <p>The Maſphies alone ſeemed to intereſt themſelves in the cauſe of the Americans. "There (ſaid theſe good ſavages to them) there's ſixteen ſhillings for you. 'Tis all that we have. We thought to have bought ſome rum with it; we'll drink water. We'll go a hunting. If any beaſts fall by our arrows, we'll ſell their ſkins, and bring you the money."</p>

Its intereſts were preferred to thoſe of its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as well becauſe the remoter diſtance had prevented the ſavages from having received ſo many outrages from it as from their proud neighbours, as becauſe it could and would better pay the ſervices which might be rendered to its cauſe. Under its banners, theſe allies, whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic fierceneſs knew no reſtraint, did a hundred times more damage to the coloniſts ſettled near the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, than had been ſuffered, from the royal troops, by thoſe of their fellow citizens whom a happier deſtiny had fixed upon the confines of the ocean.</p>
            <p>Theſe calamities attacked but a more or leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of the members of the United States, who ſoon after were all, collectively, afflicted by an inward hurt.</p>
            <p>The metals, which, throughout the whole globe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent all the object of commerce, had, in this part of the new world, never been abundant. The ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them which had been ſeen there, diſappeared even at the commencement of hoſtilities. To theſe ſigns, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally agreed upon, were ſubſtituted ſigns peculiar to theſe provinces. Paper replaced ſilver and gold. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give ſome dignity to the new pledge, it was adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with emb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The artifice did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Theſe ideal riches were rejected. The more the multiplication of them was urged by want, the greater did their depreciation grow. The Congreſs was indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at the affronts given to its money, and declared all thoſe to be traitors to their country who ſhould not receive it as they would have received gold itſelf.</p>
            <p>Did not this body know, that prepoſſeſſions are no more to be controled than feelings are?

Of all this was the Congreſs well aware. But it had no choice of means. Its deſpiſed and deſpicable ſcraps of paper were actually thirty times below their original va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, when more of them were ordered to be made.

            <p>The people had no amends for this domeſtic ſcourge, as it might be called, by an eaſy communication with all the other parts of the world.

An invitation, ſo ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in appearance, was not complied with.

The French alone, who dare every thing, dared to brave the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of this new connection. But by the judicious vigilance of Admiral Lord Howe, the greateſt part of the ſhips which they ſent out were taken before they arrived at the places of their deſtination, and the others at their dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>A multitude of privateers, added to ſo many other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, might make the Americans regret their former

tranquillity, and incline them to an accommodation with England. In vain had the people been bound to the new government by the ſacredneſs of oaths and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of religion. In vain had endeavours been uſed to convince them that it was impoſſible to treat ſafely with a country in which one parliament might overturn what ſhould have been eſtabliſhed by another. In vain had they been threatened with the eternal reſentment of an exaſperated and vindictive enemy. It was poſſible that theſe diſtant troubles might not be balanced by the weight of preſent evils.</p>
            <p>So thought the Britiſh miniſtry, when they ſent to the new world public agents, authoriſed to offer every thing except independence to theſe very Americans, from whom they had two years before exacted an unconditional ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. It is not improbable but that by this plan of conciliation, a few months ſooner, ſome effect might have been produced. But at the period at which it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the court of London, it was rejected with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, becauſe this meaſure appeared but as an argument of fear and weakneſs. The people were already re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſſured. The Congreſs, the generals, the troops, the bold and ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men who in each colony had poſſeſſed themſelves of the authority; every thing had recovered its firſt ſpirit. This was the effect of a treaty of friendſhip and commerce between the United States and the court of Verſailles, ſigned the 6th of February, 1778.</p>
            <p>If the Britiſh miniſtry had reflected upon it, they would have comprehended that the ſame delirium which was drawing them to attack their colonies, was reducing them to the neceſſity of declaring war in the ſame inſtant againſt France. Then prevailed in the councils of this crown the circumſpection which muſt always be inſpired by a new reign. Then the finances were ſtill in the confuſion into which they had been plunged by a madneſs of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years. Then the decayed condition of the navy was ſuch as filled every citizen with diſquiet. Then Spain, already fatigued with her extravagant expedition of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, found herſelf in embarraſſments which would not have permitted her to run to the ſuccour of her ally. And
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:017686_0071_0FA21D81C8077B20"/>
then might England, without raſhneſs, have promiſed herſelf ſucceſs againſt the moſt powerful of her enemies, and to intimidate America by victories gained or conqueſts made near home. The importance that it was of, for this crown to take away from its rebellious ſubjects the only ſupport of which they might be aſſured, would have diminiſhed the indignation inſpired by a violation of the moſt ſolemn treaties.</p>
            <p>George the third ſaw nothing of all this. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure ſuccours which the court of Verſailles ſent to the provinces armed for the defence of their rights, did not open his eyes. The dock-yards of France were fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing with ſhipwrights. Her arſenals were filling with artillery. Scarcely was there room remaining in her magazines for more naval ſtores. Her ports preſented the moſt mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing appearance; and this ſtrange blindneſs ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued. To awaken the court of St. James's from its le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, it was neceſſary that Lewis the ſixteenth ſhould ſignify to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, on the 14th of March, that he had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the independence of the United States.</p>
            <p>This ſignification was a declaration of war. It was impoſſible that a nation, more accuſtomed to give provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation than receive it, could patiently look on, whilſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nation was looſening its ſubjects from their bonds of allegiance, and raiſing them up with much parade to the rank of ſovereign powers. All Europe foreſaw that two ſtates, in rivalſhip for ages, were about to tinge the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ocean with their blood, and again play that dreadful game, in which public proſperities will never compenſate for particular diſaſters. They in whom am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition had not extinguiſhed all benevolence for their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures, deplored beforehand the calamities, which, in either hemiſphere, were ready to fall upon the human race.</p>
            <p>The bloody ſcene, notwithſtanding, did not open yet; and this delay gave credulity a ground of hope, that peace would ſtill continue. It was not known that a fleet, which had ſailed from Tou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

French from the Eaſt Indies. Without being initiated in thoſe myſteries of perfidy, which infidious politics are arrived at regarding as great ſtrokes of ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judicious men ſuppoſed that hoſtilities muſt be inevitable, and on the point of taking place, even in our ocean. This event, which had been foreſeen, was brought on by the fight of two frigates, on the 17th of June, 1778.</p>
            <p>Here our taſk becomes more and more difficult. Our ſole object is to be uſeful, and to be true. Far be from us that ſpirit of party which blinds and degrades thoſe who are the conductors, and thoſe who aſpire to be the inſtructors, of mankind. Our wiſh is for our country; our homage is to juſtice. We honour virtue, in whatever place, in whatever form, ſhe is ſeen: the diſtinctions of condition and of nation cannot eſtrange us from her; and the man who is juſt and magnanimous is our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man over all the world. If in the different events which paſs under our eyes, we blame with boldneſs what appears to us blame worthy, we ſeek not the vain and ſorry plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of caſting indiſcreet reproach. But we are ſpeaking to nations and to poſterity. We ought to give them the hiſtory of errors, to teach them how they may be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Should we dare to be traitorouſly wanting to ſo great a duty, we might, perhaps, flatter the generation which paſſeth away; but truth and juſtice, which are eternal, would impeach us to future generations, who would read us with contempt, and pronounce not our name but with diſdain. In this long career we ſhould be juſt to thoſe who ſtill exiſt, as we have been to thoſe who exiſt no more. If, amongſt the men of power, there are any who are offended at this freedom, let us not fear to tell them, that we are but the organ of a ſupreme tribunal, which reaſon is erecting upon a baſis that cannot be ſhaken. There is no longer a government in Europe but ſhould ſtand in fear of its determinations. Public opinion, which is becoming more and more informed, and which nothing has power to arreſt or awe, has its eyes open upon nations and their courts. It penetrates into the cabinets where policy would he hid. There it judges the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitaries of power, their weakneſſes and their paſſions;
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:017686_0073_0FA21D8336E62748"/>
and, by the empire of genius and knowledge, raiſes it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, on all ſides, above the miniſters of kings, to incite or to reſtrain them. Wo to them who deſpiſe or brave it! This ſeeming courage is weakneſs in reality. Wo to them whoſe talents cannot arm them with a confidence to ſuſtain its look! Let ſuch, that they may once do juſtice, at leaſt to themſelves, lay down the burden too heavy for their feeble ſhoulders. They will ceaſe to expoſe themſelves and the nations they pretend to ſerve.</p>
            <p>France began the war with invaluable advantages. The time, the place, the circumſtances; ſhe had choſen all. It was not till after ſhe had, at leiſure, made her preparations, till after ſhe had increaſed her power to the proper pitch, that ſhe ſhewed herſelf upon the field of battle. She had to combat but an enemy who was humbled, weakened, and diſcouraged by domeſtic feuds. The wiſhes of other nations were with her, againſt thoſe imperious maſters, or, as they were called, thoſe tyrants of the ocean.</p>
            <p>Events ſeemed to correſpond to the deſire of Europe. The French officers, who had old humiliations to wipe away, performed brilliant actions, the remembrance of which will be of long duration. Great theoretic know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and unſhaken courage, ſupplied what might be wanting in them from practice and experience. All the ſingle engagements, of ſhip to ſhip, did them the higheſt honour, and moſt of them terminated to their advantage. The Britiſh fleet ran ſtill greater danger than the iſolated veſſels. It was ſo roughly treated as to have cauſe to fear being wholly or partially deſtroyed; had not the French fleet, by which it was reduced, off Uſhant, to this almoſt deſpairing ſtate, been deſtined, from timid orders, from odious intrigues, from the weakneſs of its admirals, or from all theſe motives together, to quit the ſea and be the firſt to make for port.</p>
            <p>In the intoxication of this, perhaps, unexpected ſucceſs, France ſeemed to loſe ſight of her deareſt intereſts. Her principal object ſhould have been to intercept the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of her enemies, cutting the double nerve of their ſtrength, their ſeamen and their wealth, and ſo ſap, at
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:017686_0074_0FA21D84A7C4C558"/>
once, the two foundations of Engliſh greatneſs. Nothing was more eaſy for a power prepared a long while for hoſtilities, than to intercept fleets of merchantmen, quite unprepared, and very feebly convoyed. This was not done. The immenſe riches expected by Great Britain, from all parts of the globe, entered peaceably into her harbours, without ſuffering the ſmalleſt diminution.</p>
            <p>The commerce of France, on the contrary, was haraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in both the hemiſpheres, and every where intercepted. Her colonies ſaw raviſhed from them, on their very coaſts, ſubſiſtences, to welcome which they were reaching out their arms with all the eagerneſs of want; whilſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country was deprived of four millions ſterling, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved almoſt in her fight. This reverſe was not without a cauſe. Let us endeavour to diſcover it.</p>
            <p>The French navy had been a long time unſucceſsful; and it was to the vice of its conſtitution that ſo many mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes had been aſcribed. Many attempts had been made to modify or change the regulations of it; but theſe innovations, good or bad, were always repelled with a more or leſs ſtrongly marked diſdain. At length its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals dictated themſelves, in 1776, a diſpoſition, which rendering them abſolute maſters of the roads and anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places, of the arſenals, of the dock-wards, and the magazines, deſtroyed that mutual inſpectorſhip, which Lewis the fourteenth thought it was right he ſhould eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, between the military officers and thoſe of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration. From that time there was no longer any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſibility, regulation, or oeconomy; in the ports. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing there fell into diſorder and confuſion.</p>
            <p>The new plan had an influence that was ſtill more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. Till this period, it was the miniſtry who had directed the naval operations towards the end aimed at by their politics. This authority paſſed, perhaps, almoſt without being perceived, to thoſe who were to execute theſe operations, which took inſenſibly a tincture from their prejudices. Theſe prejudices inclined them to think, that it was not in heavily and laboriouſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="77" facs="unknown:017686_0075_0FA21D84B4C0E9D0"/>
that fame was to be acquired. This double duty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was entirely neglected, or very ill performed, in conſequence of the opinion common at Breſt, that ſuch a ſervice had nothing noble in it, and led not to any kind of glory.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that this prejudice is a very odd one, and qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e contrary to all the laws of ſociety. What can be ſuppoſed to have been the deſign of ſtates in inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting this military force deſtined to ſcour the ſeas? Was it only to procure promotions for thoſe who command or ſerve? Only to give them opportunities of exerciſing a valour uſeleſs to every body but themſelves? Only to ſtain red another element with bloody battles? No, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly. Fleets of war upon the ocean, are what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes and ramparts are for inhabitants of cities; what the national armies are for provinces expoſed to incurſions of the foe. There are ſome ſorts of property attached to the ſoil; there are others which are created, tranſported by commerce, and, as they may be called, wandering on the ocean. Both theſe ſorts of property want defenders. Warriors, that is your function. What would be ſaid, if the land forces ſhould refuſe to protect the inhabitants of cities, the cultivators of fields, and to drive back the fire threatened to the harveſt? Naval officers, you think yourſelves debaſed by convoying and protecting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. But if commerce is to be no more protected, what will become of the riches of the ſtate, of which, without doubt, you expect a part, in recompence of your ſervice? What will become of your own property, in the revenue of your land, which commerce and the circulation of wealth chiefly contribute to make fruitful? You think yourſelves debaſed. What, debaſed in making yourſelves uſeful to your countrymen! And what are all the orders in the ſtate, to whom government has committed any portion of the public power, but protectors and defenders of your countrymen and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Great-Britain had juſt experienced a very humiliating reverſe in the new world, and a more powerful enemy threatened her with greater diſaſters in the old. This alarming ſituation filled all minds with doubtfulneſs and diſtruſt. The national riches arrive.

It is thus that they would have been talked to by that Lewis, who, for forty years together, knew how to be worthy of the age to which he gave a name, who mixed greatneſs with his very faults, who never, even in adverſity and abaſement, degraded his people or himſelf.

But Europe, who has her eyes fixed upon us, ſees a great deſign, and no concerted meaſures; ſees, in our arſenals and our ports, immenſe preparations, and no execution; ſees me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing fleets fitted out, and the pompous expence of them rendered almoſt uſeleſs; ſees ſpirit and valour in ſubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, irreſolution and timidity in chiefs; ſees whatever proclaims, on one hand, the ſtrength and the awe-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power of a great people, and, on the other, the ſlackneſs and weakneſs inſeparable from its character and views.

revolution. We ſhall not examine whether the ſpirit which then reigned in the cabinet of Verſailles au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed this conjecture. It is now known that this crown, which from the very beginning of the troubles had ſent ſecret ſuccour to the Americans, was watching for the propitious moment of declaring openly in their favour. The event of Saratoga appeared to it the moſt favourable conjuncture for propoſing to the Catholic king to make the cauſe a common one. Whether it were that this prince might then jude the liberty of the United States to be contrary to his intereſt; whether the reſolution might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him to be precipitate; or whether, in ſhort, other political objects might require all his attention, he did not agree to the propoſal. From his character it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that repeated ſolicitation would be uſeleſs. After the firſt experiment, he was ſo little applied to about this great affair, that it was without his being appriſed of it that the court of Verſailles cauſed it to be ſignified at St. James's that it had acknowledged the independence of the confederate provinces.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the land and ſea forces which Spain employed againſt the Portugueſe in the Brazils, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home. The rich fleet which ſhe expected from Mexico was arrived in her ports. The treaſures which came to her from Peru and from her other poſſeſſions were ſecure. She was free from all inquietude, and miſtreſs of her motions, when ſhe aſpired to the glory of being a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificator between the two hemiſpheres. Her mediation was accepted, as well by France, whoſe bold attempts had not been attended with the happy conſequences which ſhe had promiſed herſelf from them, as by England, who might fear the having an additional adverſary to contend with.</p>
            <p>Charles the third ſuſtained with dignity the great part he had to act. He awarded that, laying down their arms, each of the belligerent powers ſhould be maintained in the territories which it ſhould occupy at the time of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; that a congreſs ſhould be formed, in which the different pretenſions ſhould be diſcuſſed; and that no freſh hoſtilities ſhould commence till after the expiration of a twelve month's notice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:017686_0081_0FA21D8E9835F7B0"/>This monarch was aware that this arrangement gave to Great-Britain a facility of being reconciled with her colonies, or at leaſt of making them purchaſe, by great advantages to her commerce, the ports which ſhe occupi- in the midſt of them. He was aware that it muſt wound the dignity of the king his nephew, who had engaged to maintain the United States in the totality of their terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. But he would be juſt; and without forgetting all perſonal conſiderations, one cannot be ſo.</p>
            <p>This plan of conciliation was diſpleaſing to Verſailles, whoſe only conſolation was miniſtred by the hope that it would be rejected at London. This hope was not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. England could not reſolve upon acknowledging the Americans to be really independent; though they were not to be called to the conferences which were to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place; though France could not negotiate for them; though their intereſts were to have been taken care of ſolely by a mediator who was not bound to them by any treaty, and who, perhaps, at the bottom of his heart, was not deſirous of their proſperity; though her refuſal threatened her with an enemy the more.</p>
            <p>It is in ſuch a circumſtance as this; it is in the time when noble pride elevates the ſoul ſuperior to all terror; when nothing is ſeen more dreadful than the ſhame of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the law, and when there is no doubt or heſitation which to chuſe between ruin and diſhonour; it is then, that the greatneſs of a nation is diſplayed. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge however, that men, accuſtomed to judge of things by the event, call great and perilous reſolutions, heroiſm or madneſs, according to the good or bad ſucceſs with which they have been attended. If then I ſhould be aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what is the name which ſhall in years to come be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the firmneſs, which was in this moment exhibited by the Engliſh, I ſhould anſwer, that I do not know.

Plane ſhall have been formed with wiſdom; but their ſucceſs ſhall fail for want of concert in the movements of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By an inconſiderate order of the court, what might have proved a proud day, is decided to diſhonour. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are changed by a miniſter's diſgrace or death. Is it poſſible that a ſtrict union ſhould long ſubſiſt amongſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates of characters ſo oppoſite, as the haſty, light, diſdainful Frenchman, the jealous, haughty, ſly, ſlow, circumſpective Spaniard, and the American, who is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſnatching looks at the mother-country, and would rejoice, were they compatible with his independence, at the diſaſters of his allies? Will theſe nations long delay, whether they act ſeparately or conjointly, mutually to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, complain, and be embroiled? Ought not their greateſt hope to be, that multiplied ill ſucceſſes may do no more than replunge them into that humiliating ſtate from which they endeavoured to emerge, and firmly fix the trident in the hand of England; whilſt a conſiderable defeat or two would bring down this ambitious people from ever ranking again amongſt the principal powers of the European world?</p>
            <p>Who ſhall decide then, who can foreſee, the event? France and Spain united, have powerful means to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy; England the art of employing her's. France and Spain have their treaſures; England, a great national credit. On one ſide, the multitude of men; on the other, the ſuperiority in the art of working ſhips, and, as it were, of ſubjecting the ſea in fighthing. Here, impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity and valour; there, valour and experience. In one party, the activity which abſolute monarchy gives to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns;

in the other, the vigour and elaſticity which liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſupplies. There, loſſes and grudges to revenge; here, their late glory, with the ſovereignty of America, and of the ocean, to recover and preſerve. The allied nations have the advantage with which the union of two vaſt powers muſt be at ended, but the inconvenience likewiſe which muſt reſult from this very union, by the difficulty of harmony and concord both in their deſigns, and in the execution of them by their reſpective forces; England is abandoned to herſelf, but having only her own forces to direct, ſhe has the advantage of unity in deſigns, and of a more ſure and perhaps more ready diſpoſition in ideas: ſhe can more eaſily range her plans of defence and offence under a ſingle view.</p>
            <p>In order to weigh the matter with exactneſs, we ſhould yet put into the ſcales the different energy which may be communicated to the rival nations by a war, which is in a great many reſpects but a war of kings and miniſters, on one ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In ſhort, if we conſider the ſpirit of the French nation, oppoſite to that of the nation with which it is at variance, we ſhall ſee that the ardour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But let us ſuppoſe that the houſe of Bourbon have the advantages with which it may have been flattered. What ought to be its conduct?</p>
            <p>France is in all points of view the empire the moſt ſtrongly conſtituted, of which any remembrance has been preſerved in the annals of the world. Without being able to bear any compariſon with her, Spain is likewiſe a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry powerful ſtate, and her means of proſperity are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually increaſing. The moſt important concern then of the houſe of Bourbon ought to be, to obtain pardon of its neighbours for the advantages which it has from nature, which it owes to art, or which have been beſtowed on it by events. Should it endeavour to augment its ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the alarm would become general, and it would be thought that an univerſal ſlavery was threatened. It is perhaps to be wondered at, that the other nations of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope have not yet thwarted it in its projects againſt Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The reſentment which the injuſtice and the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of this proud iſland have every where inſpired, muſt be the cauſe of this inaction. But hatred is ſilent when intereſt appears. It is poſſible that Europe may think the weakening of Great Britain in the old and the new hemiſphere contrary to its ſafety; and that, after having enjoyed the humiliations and dangers of this lofty and tyrannie power, ſhe may at length take arms in its defence. Should it be ſo, the courts of Verſailles and Madrid would ſee themſelves fallen from the hope which they have conceived of a deciſive prepondence upon the globe.

               </gap>ur being deprived of our rights, which conſtituted our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; by the luxury of our courts and the miſery of our countries; by the hatred, the endleſs hatred, between men without heart, honour, or vigour, who poſſeſs all elſe, and robuſt men, and even virtuous men, who have nothing but life to loſe. It is prepared in America, by the increaſe of population, of cultivation, of induſtry, and of knowledge. Every thing forwards this rupture, as well the progreſs of evil in the old world, as in the new the progreſs of good.</p>
            <p>But would it be right for Spain and France, whoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in the new world are an inexhauſtible ſource of riches; would it be right for them to precipitate this rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Now this rupture is the thing that would preciſely happen, were all the north of thoſe regions ſubjected to the ſame laws, or bound together by a common intereſt.</p>
            <p>No ſooner would the liberty of this vaſt continent be eſtabliſhed, than it would become the aſylum of all the off-ſcouring amongſt us, of man of intriguing, ſeditious ſpirits, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>. This turn of mind, equally diſtant from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or repoſe, would direct itſelf towards conqueſts; and a paſſion which has ſo many attractions would eaſily captivate the firſt coloniſts, diverted by a long war from their accuſtomed occupations. The new people would
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:017686_0087_0FA21D930CCFB960"/>
have compleated their preparations for invaſion before the report of it had reached our climates. They would chuſe their enemy, the field and the moment of their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. Their thunder would fall always upon ſeas with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defence, or on coaſts taken at unawares. In a little while the ſouthern provinces would become their prey, and ſupply by the riches of their productions the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity of thoſe of the northern. Perhaps the poſſeſſions of our abſolute monarchies might even be candidates for the honour of being admitted to a confederacy with a free people, or would detach themſelves from Europe in order to belong but to themſelves.</p>
            <p>The part which the courts of Madrid and Verſailles ſhould take, if they are free to chuſe, is to let two powers ſubſiſt in North America<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who may watch, reſtrain, and counterpoize each other. Then will ages roll away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore England and the republics formed at her expence can come together. This reciprocal diſtruſt will prohibit them from any diſtant enterprize; and the eſtabliſhments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to other nations, in the new world, will enjoy without diſturbance that tranquillity, which, even down to our own times, has been ſo often troubled.</p>
            <p>In all probability, indeed, it is the very order of things which would be moſt ſuitable even for the confederate provinces themſelves. Their reſpective limits are not regulated. A great jealouſy ſubſiſts between the countries to the northward and thoſe to the ſouthward. Political principles vary from one river to another. Great animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities are obſerved between the inhabitants of the ſame town, between the members of the ſame family. Each would throw off from himſelf the heavy burden of public expences and debts. A thouſand principles of diviſion are generally ſpringing in the boſom of the United States. When dangers are once at an end, how is the exploſion of ſo many diſcontents to be retarded? how are ſo many unſettled minds, and angered hearts, to be held attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a common centre? Let the true friends of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca reflect upon it, and they will find that the only means to prevent diſturbances, amongſt that people, is to leave remaining on their frontiers a powerful rival, always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to profit by their diſſentions.</p>

               </gap>tudes, and formidable enemies, make republics flouriſh. Rome had need of Carthage; and he who deſtroyed the Roman liberty was neither Sylla, nor Caeſar; it was the firſt Cato, when his narrow and auſtere politics took her rival away from Rome, by lighting, in the ſenate, thoſe torches which burnt Carthage to the ground. Even Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, perhaps, would not have had her government, and her laws, theſe four hundred years, had ſhe not had at her door powerful neighbours, who might become her enemies or her maſters.</p>
            <p>But, ſuppoſing them thus ſituated, to what degree of happineſs, ſplendor, and power, may the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in time be raiſed?</p>
            <p>Here, in order to form a ſound judgment, let us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately begin with laying aſide the intereſt which all hearts, not excepting thoſe of ſlaves, have taken in the generous efforts of a people, who expoſed themſelves to the moſt dreadful calamities to be free. The name of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is ſo ſweet, that all they who fight for it are ſure to intereſt our ſecret wiſhes. Their cauſe is that of the whole human race; it becomes our own. We revenge ourſelves of our own oppreſſors, by giving vent, at leaſt, with liberty, to our hatred againſt thoſe oppreſſors who cannot puniſh it. At the ſound of breaking chains, it ſeems as if our own were about to become lighter; and we think for ſome moments that we breathe a purer air, in learning that fewer tyrants are to be counted in the world. Theſe great revolutions of liberty, moreover, admoniſh deſpots. They warn them not to truſt to too long patience in the people, not to truſt to impunity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. Thus, when the laws of ſociety execute ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon the crimes of private individuals, the good man hopes that the puniſhment of the guilty will, by its terrible example, prevent the commiſſion of new crimes. Terror ſometimes ſupplies the place of juſtice to the thief, and conſcience to the aſſaſſin. Such is the ſource of the warm intereſt we feel in all the wars of liberty. Such is that with which we have been inſpired for the Americans. Our imaginations have been inflamed in their favour.

We ſeem to be preſent at, and to feel as they do, all their victories and their defeats. The ſpirit of juſtice, which is pleaſed in compenſating paſt miſery by happineſs to come, is pleaſed in thinking that this part of the new world cannot fail of becoming one of the moſt flouriſhing countries upon the globe. Nay, it has been even ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that there is cauſe to fear leſt Europe ſhould one day find her maſters in her children. Let us dare to ſtem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> torrent of public opinion, and that of public enthuſiaſm. Let us not be led aſtray by imagination, that embelliſher of all things; nor by paſſion, which loves to create illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and realizes all it hopes. Our duty is to combat every prejudice, ſhould it be even that which is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the wiſhes of our heart. To be true, above all things, is our chief concern, and not to betray the pure and upright conſcience which preſides over our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and dictates every judgment that we paſs. At this moment, perhaps, we ſhall not be believed: but a bold conjecture, which is verified at the end of many ages, does more honour to the hiſtorian, than the recital of a long ſeries of facts which cannot be conteſted; and I write not only for my contemporaries, who will but ſome years ſurvive me. Yet a few revolutions of the ſun, and they and I ſhall be no more. But I deliver over my ideas to poſterity and to time. It is for them to judge me.</p>
            <p>The ſpace occupied by the thirteen republics, between the mountains and the ocean, is but of ſixty-ſeven ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues; but upon the coaſt their extent is, in a ſtrait line, three hundred and forty five.</p>
            <p>In this region the lands are, almoſt throughout, bad, or of a middling quality. Scarcely any thing but maze grows in the four moſt northern colonies. The only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource of their inhabitants is fiſhery, of which the annual product, in money, does not amount to above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty or ſeventy thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>Corn ſuſtains principally the provinces of New-York, Jerſey, and Pennſylvania. But the ſoil there is ſo rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become worſe than it was, that an acre, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielded full ſixty buſhels of wheat, now produces but very rarely above twenty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="unknown:017686_0090_0FA21D971FCF5F20"/>Though the ſoil of Maryland and Virginia is much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to all the reſt, it cannot be ſaid to be very fruitful. The old plantations do not yield above a third of the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco which they formerly produced. It is not poſſible to form new ones; and the cultivators have been obliged to turn their views towards other objects.</p>
            <p>North-Carolina produces ſome corn, but of a quality ſo inferior, that it is ſold for five and twenty, or thirty per cent. leſs than the other, in all the markets.</p>
            <p>South Carolina and Georgia have a perfectly flat face of country, for the diſtance of fifty miles from the ſea-ſide. The exceſſive rains which fall there, finding no means of diſcharge, form numerous ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On the intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſpaces left by theſe multitudinous little ſeas, grows an inferior kind of indigo, which muſt have its place chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged every year. Where the country riſes from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Engliſh government, ſeeing that North America could never enrich them by the productions proper to that country, thought of the powerful motive of premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, for the creating, in this part of the new world, of linen, wine, and ſilk. The poverty of the ſoil, which would not bear flax, obſtructed the firſt of theſe views; the badneſs of the climate, which would not agree with vines, oppoſed the ſucceſs of the ſecond: and the want of hands permitted not the third to take place. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety eſtabliſhed at London, for the encouragement of arts, manufactures, and commerce, was not more happy than the miniſtry had been. Its premiums did not give birth to any one of the objects which it had propoſed to the activity and induſtry of thoſe countries.</p>
            <p>Great Britain was obliged to content herſelf with ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every year to theſe countries, merchandiſe to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of ſomething more than two millions. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumers of this merchandiſe delivered up to her, excluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their indigo, their iron, their tobacco, and their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, the reſt of the globe had given them for their wood, their cuts, their fiſh, their rice, and their ſalted proviſions. Yet the balance was always ſo much againſt them, that, when the troubles began, the colonies owed from five to ſix millions to the mother country, and had no caſh in circulation.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe diſadvantages, there had been ſucceſſively formed, within the thirteen provinces, a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of two millions nine hundred and eighty-one thouſand ſix hundred and ſeventy eight perſons, including four hundred thouſand negroes. Oppreſſion and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance were continually driving thither new inhabitants. The war has now barred this refuge to the unhappy; but the peace will open it to them again; when they will flock thither in greater numbers than ever. They who ſhall go with projects of cultivation will not have all the ſatisfaction which they may promiſe themſelves, becauſe they will find the good land, and even the middling, all occupied; and there will be nothing to be offered them but barren ſands, unhealthy marſhes, or ſleep mountains. Emigration will be more favourable to manufacturers and artiſts, though even they may, perhaps, gain nothing by their change of country and climate.</p>
            <p>We cannot determine, without raſhneſs, what may one day be the population of the United States. Such a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, generally pretty difficult, becomes impracticable for a region where the land degenerates very rapidly, and where the expence of labour and improvement is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably anſwered by the reproduction. If ten millions of men ever find a certain ſubſiſtence in theſe provinces, it will be much. Even then the exportation will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to nothing, or next to nothing: but interior in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry will replace foreign induſtry. The country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little, will be able to ſuffice for itſelf, provided that the inhabitants know how to make themſelves happy by oeconomy and with mediocrity.</p>

               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:017686_0092_0FA21D9843637A38"/>Ye people of North-America, let the example of all the nations who have gone before you, and above all that of your mother-country, ſerve you for inſtruction. Fear the affluence of gold, which brings with luxury the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of manners, the contempt of laws. Fear a too unequal diſtribution of riches, which exhibits a ſmall number of citizens in opulence, and a great multitude of citizens in extreme poverty; whence ſprings the inſolence of the former, and the debaſement of the latter. Secure yourſelves againſt the ſpirit of conqueſt. The tranquility of an empire diminiſhes in proportion to its extenſion. Have arms for your defence; have none for offence. Seek competency and health, in labour; proſperity, in the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of lands, and the workſhops of induſtry; power, in manners and virtue. Cauſe arts and ſciences, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the civilized from the ſavage man, to flouriſh and abound. Above all, watch carefully over the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your children. It is from public ſchools, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that come the wiſe magiſtrates, the capable and courageous ſoldiers, the good fathers, the good huſbands, the good brothers, the good friends, the good men. Wherever the youth are ſeen depraved, the nation is on the decline. Let liberty have an immoveable foundation in the wiſdom of your laws, and let it be the indeſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cement to bind your provinces together. Eſtabliſh no legal preference amongſt the different forms of worſhip. Superſtition is innocent, wherever it is neither perſecuted nor protected; and may your duration, if it be poſſible, equal the duration of the world!</p>
