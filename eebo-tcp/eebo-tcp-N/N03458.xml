            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the beſt, and moſt perfect Pattern, moſt worthy of Imitation; he that ſaith, he abideth in him, ought alſo ſo to walk, as he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 6</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> having in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter exhorted Believers to patient bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Afflictions by the Example of Chriſt, <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. He proceeds in this to perſwade them to improve the Croſs they have outwardly, to inward Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Chriſt's Death is propoſed to us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as an Examplar both of external Mortification
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004230_0004_1004243236D1B8D0"/>
in bearing Reproaches, Perſecution, and all other Troubles; this the Apoſtle proſecutes in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, and of internal in the deſtroying the Body of Sin; this he exhorts to in this Chapter, and draws his Argument from Chriſt's Death, not only as the Examplar, but efficient and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cauſe of our Mortification, and which hath a real Influence upon it, in that Chriſt by his Death did not only merit the Pardon of Sin, but the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Spirit, whereby Corruption might be deſtroyed, and our Natures renewed. And being armed with this Mind, that we being dead with Chriſt to Sin, ſhould not live any longer in it, or be ſeduced by the corrupt Deſires, and ſinful Ways of carnal Men, and make them the Rule of our Living: But the holy Will of God revealed in his Word, (which is the Rule by which we ought to walk) in Oppoſition to the Luſts of Men, we are to live not as Men would have us, but as God commands. Since every one of us ſhall give an Account, whether he be high or low, rich or poor, great or ſmall, ſtrong or weak, &amp;c. Of himſelf, of his own Actions, and not another's; he ſhall give an Account of himſelf in his natural Capacity, as a Man, and in his Capacity as a rich or great Man, and in his religious Capacity, as one that hath enjoyed ſuch Education, ſuch Means of Grace, &amp;c. I ſay with the Apoſtle in my Text, <hi>He ſhall give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</hi> Give Account, i.e. come to a Reckoning, and anſwer for his Offices, Relations and Behaviour in the World <hi>To him,</hi> i. e. to God and Chriſt <hi>That is ready,</hi> i. e. fit, prepared, well furniſhed and near at hand. <hi>To judge,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. to pronounce a righteous and true Sentence upon all Things and Perſons.</p>

From this Text, thus briefly opened, we obſerve the following Doctrine: Namely,</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCT. That it is a Matter of the higheſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and Importance to Men, to be ready to give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</head>
               <p>That the Judge of all Things and Perſons ſtands ready to call all Men to a ſtrict Account of all their Actions and Deportments in this World, is undoubtedly true. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Chap. v. Ver. 9. <hi>Grudge not one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Brethren, leſt ye be condemned: Behold, the Judge ſtandeth before the Door:</hi> i. e. He is in a Readineſs to bring thoſe Evils upon Men, which they wiſh may fall upon others; or to give their Reward to them, <hi>who through patient Continuance in well doing ſeek for it,</hi> Rom ii. 7. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that our Text is a Metaphor taken from Stewards giving Account to their Maſters. <hi>Mat.</hi> xviii. 25 Luke xvi. 2. <hi>Give an Account of thy Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardſhip, for thou mayeſt be no longer Steward.</hi> If we carefully attend to the Deſign and Aim of the Parable of which the Text laſt mentioned is a Part, we ſhall eaſily ſee, that the main Things in which our Saviour ſeemeth deſirous by this Parable to inſtruct us are two; the one, that we are but Stewards of the good Things God lends us, and muſt give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to our Maſter for them. And the other, That being no other than Stewards intruſted with ſome of our Maſter's Goods for a Time, it is our higheſt Prudence, while we have them in our Truſt, to make ſuch an Uſe of them, as may be for our Advantage, when we give up our Account.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004230_0006_10042433C286E190"/>
In the handling of the Doctrine, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhew,</p>
               <p>I. That Men ſhall give an Account to God that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</p>
               <p>II. That it is of the higheſt Concernment &amp; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to them to be ready to do it.</p>
               <p>III. That God is ready to take an Account of all Men. And</p>
               <p>IV. Make an Application ſutable to the awful and affecting Occaſion of this Day.</p>
               <p>Of theſe in their Order. And</p>
               <p>I. <hi>That Men ſhall give an Account to God that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead</hi> This Men ſhall do immediately after the Separation of the Soul from the Body; and as it is <hi>appointed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Men ouce to die, but after this the Judgment,</hi> Heb. ix. 27. After Souls by Death are ſeparated from their Bodies, they come to Judgment; and thus every particular Man is handed over by Death to the Bar of God, the great Judge, and ſo is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd by his Sentence to it's particular State and Place with it's reſpective People, Rom. xiv. 12. <hi>So then every one of us muſt give an Account of himſelf to God.</hi> At the great and general Aſſize, the Day of Judgment, ſhall the general and univerſal One take Place. Acts xvii 31 <hi>Becauſe he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Day in the which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs by that Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given Aſſurance unto all Men, in that he hath raiſed him from the Dead.</hi> When all Sinners in their entire Perſons, Bodies and Souls united, ſhall be adjudged to their final unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eternal State. Rom. xiv. 10. <hi>But why doſt thou judge thy Brother? Or why doſt thou ſet at nought thy Brother? for we ſhall all ſtand,</hi> or be ſet, <hi>before the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004230_0007_10042436F9A533C0"/>
There is a Variety of Scripture that leads us to the Knowlege, and ſhould alſo lead us to the Acknowlegement of this neceſſary Point, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> That every one aſſoon as his Spirit takes it's laſt Farewell of his Body, makes his Appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the impartial Tribunal of God, and that then a righteous and true Sentence is paſſed without any Delay, whereby their future State is unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and irrevocably determined. Luke xvi 22, 23. <hi>And it came to paſs that the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's Boſom: the rich Man alſo died and was buried. And in Hell he lift up his Eyes being in Torments.</hi> The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judgment of every ſingle Man follows im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately his Departure out of this Life. The Souls of wicked Men depart to go to their own Place, <hi>Acts</hi> i 25. The Souls of wicked Men are no leſs puniſhed in Hell than the apoſtate Angels, <hi>Jude Ver.</hi> 6, 7. And the Spirits of them who in the Time of <hi>Noah</hi> were diſobedient, are ſaid to be in Priſon. 1 Pet. iii. 19. <hi>And preached unto the Spirits in Priſon:</hi> That is Souls of Men departed, which are frequently called Spirits. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> xii. 7. <hi>Acts</hi> vii 59. In Priſon, that is Hell. So it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxvii 20. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 25. This is the State of the Wicked to which their Souls are caſt immediately after Death, where they remain in Torments and utter Darkneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the Judgment of the great Day. But the Souls of the Righteous after Death are with Chriſt in Heaven, and enjoy that bleſſed Viſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 23. Chriſt promiſed that the Thief on the Croſs ſhould be with him in Paradiſe, that very ſame Day he died, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiii. 43. (And it will be a happy Exchange for thy Soul, when by and by it takes its Flight from thy Body, if this may be thy
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004230_0008_1004243BA59CD478"/>
Lot.) The Spirits of juſt Men after Death return to God, and are received by God, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> xii. 7. Though <hi>Solomon</hi> only may ſpeak here of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, yet ſome underſtand it of the Souls both of Believers, and Unbelievers, which are both ſentenced by God as ſupream Judge, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately when a Man dieth, every Man to his Place, the Souls of Believers to Heaven, of Unbelievers to Hell. Thus I leave the firſt, and proceed to treat of the ſecond Article of the Doctrine; <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p>II. <hi>That it is of the higheſt Concernment and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to Men, to be ready to give up their Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick &amp; the Dead.</hi> Our principal Concern and Buſineſs in this World, is to prepare for another. And this is to be done by improving all we are and have to God's Glory, which is the principal End of our Creation, and all the Bleſſings and good Things which our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father freely, and undeſervedly beſtows upon us.

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004230_0009_10042441DCF767C0"/>
the Conſideration and Reſolution of two Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; <abbr>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe are Queſtions of great Moment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve full and diſtinct Anſwers: But I muſt be as clear and comprehenſive as I can in theſe, and the other Parts of the Doctrine, conſidering the ſcanty Meaſure of Time now left me. I reſume the firſt Queſtion which is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How ſhall Men prepare to give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This now is to be conſidered and reſolved in this general Manner, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz</hi>
                  </abbr> They that will have the Crown of Glory determined for them at God's Tribunal, muſt run for it, they muſt ſo run as to obtain it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 24. This is a Work which requires much Striving and Labour: Men muſt make it their Buſineſs not only to do Things in themſelves lawful or good, but which are ſo cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all their Circumſtances, and in the beſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for the Glory of God, and the Good of others. Forgetting thoſe Things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe Things which are before. To be ſo intent upon this one Thing, as if there were not any thing elſe worthy of their Thoughts and Care. <hi>One Thing have I deſired of the Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the Houſe of the Lord all the Days of my Life, to behold the Beauty</hi> (or the Delights, <hi>Marg) of the Lord, and to inquire in his Temple,</hi> Pſalm xxvi. 4. Truſting that they ſhall through Grace,

be kept all along, Maugre all Difficulties in the Hand of Chriſt, till upon his Account they ſhall be poſſeſſed of all they aim at, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> the purchaſed Inheritance eternally ſettled upon the Sons of God. <hi>Laying aſide every Weight, and the Sin that doth ſo eaſily beſet them, and running with Patience the Race that is ſet before them,</hi> Heb. xii. 1. Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the old Man, the corrupt Nature which remained in every Chriſtian, ſtiled by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, The Body of Death,</hi> Rom. vii. 24. But eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially every Chriſtian his own perſonal, &amp; proper Iniquity, which cleaves nearer and cloſer to him than his Garments, improving daily holy <hi>David'</hi>s Care and Study in Pſalm xviii. 23. <hi>I was alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right before him, and kept my ſelf from mine own Iniquity.</hi> This they are to mortify in them, that how diſtant ſoever the Goal is, which finiſheth the Race of a Chriſtian's Life, yet the Way paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to it, though it be troubleſome and long, and be ſet to us all by God himſelf, muſt be patiently, ſtrenuoſly and conſtantly run that they may obtain it. Pſalm cxix 32, 33. <hi>I will run the Way of thy Commandments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my Heart. Teach me, O Lord, the Way of thy Statutes, and I ſhall keep it unto the End.</hi> In a Word, The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives us the Subſtance of this in a few Words, 2 Tim iv. 7. <hi>I have fought the good Fight, I have finiſhed my Courſe, I have kept the Faith.</hi> The Life of a Chriſtian, of him that would prepare for Death, and the Judgment which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows after it, ſhould be a military Life, but they muſt not fight the evil Fights of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or quarrelſome Men, but their Fighting ſhould be the good and noble Fight of Faith, a daily Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for the Faith delivered to the Saints <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing

Their conſtant Study ſhould be Things that promote Godlineſs, imparting thoſe Things unto others, and living up to them in their own Converſation; herein exerciſing themſelves to have always Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences void of Offence, toward God, and toward Men, improving all their Care and Thought chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they may not offend GOD or Men in any Thing, but that they may be without Blame at the Judgment of God, as well as of Man. They only are bleſſed and happy whoſe Belief concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another World, and the Account they have to give to God (who will bring every Work into Judgment, with every ſecret Thing) do make them endeavour after Holineſs in this World. Thus have we conſidered and reſolved the firſt Queſtion, and proceed next to the ſecond Queſtion, which is,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What makes it of ſo great Concernment and Importance to Men to prepare to give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead?</hi> Many are the forceable, &amp; cogent Arguments and Motives that might here be ſubjoined to ſupport and reſolve this Queſtion I ſhall mention a few of them, and I muſt but juſt mention them.</p>
               <p>As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Certainty of the Account to be given by all Men to God</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in our Text aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certains it, <hi>Who ſhall give an Account,</hi> &amp;c It is a Matter not to be doubted of, they ſhall not fail of doing it. <hi>I ſaid in my Heart,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) God ſhall judge the Righteous and the Wicked,</hi> Eccl. iii. 17 <hi>So then, every one of us muſt give an Account of himſelf to God,</hi> Rom. xiv. 12. Men ſhall certainly give an Account to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether they be Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, Inferiours, or Equals; and in whatſoever
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004230_0012_1004244E155885F8"/>
Station and Relation, they ſtand in the World. Heb. xiii. 17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your Souls, as they that muſt give Account,</hi> Not only Miniſters, but Magiſtrates, yea all Men in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Capacities, Relations &amp; Conditions in this Life, muſt do it, they muſt certainly appear before the Bar of God, who will call all Men unto Judgment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Account to be given to God by Men, is very Extenſive.</hi> It will reach unto all the Deportments, Degrees and Periods of a Man's Life; even their idle Words will be brought unto the Reckoning. Mat. xii. 36. <hi>But I ſay unto you, that every idle Word that Men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give account thereof in the Day of Judgment. Rejoyce O young Man in thy Youth,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) and let thy Heart cheer thee in the Days of thy Youth and walk in the Ways of thy Heart, and in the Sight of thine Eyes, but know thou that for all theſe Things God will bring thee into Judgment.</hi> The moſt ſecretoins ſhall not eſcape the Notice and Cenſure of the Judge: <hi>For God ſhall bring every Work into Judgment, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſecret Thing, whether it be Good, or whether it be Evil.</hi> Eccl. xii. 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It will be an impartial and critical Account. Unto thee, O Lord belongeth Mercy, for thou rendreſt to every Man according to his Work,</hi> Pſalm lxii 22. God will judge every Man according (not to what others have done, but) to what he himſelf hath done. His eternal Joy and Rejoycing, or Sorrow and Mourning ſhall be according to what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath wrought, not according to what others hath wrought <hi>For every Man ſhall bear his own Burden,</hi> Gal. vi 5. If ever they enter into the Joy of Heaven, they ſhall rejoyce in their own Work, and if eternal Sorrow be their Portion, they ſhall
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004230_0013_100424579DD40450"/>
groan under their own Burdens, they will not be the Sins of others, but their own Sins which will ſink them into eternal Miſery. For though Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours ſhall anſwer to God for the Sins of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, yet it ſhall not properly be for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours Sins, but for their own Sins, in neglecting to warn &amp; reprove them, and to do what in them lay to have hindred them in their ſinful Courſes. For the Lord our God judgeth righteouſly, he try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Reins and the Heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> xi 20. He is a juſt God, who will deal with all according to their Works. He is a God that takes notice not only of overt Acts, that are ſcandalous and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but of the ſecret Thoughts, Motions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Men's Hearts, Rev. ii 23. <hi>I will kill her Children with Death; and all the Churches ſhall know that I am he which ſearcheth the Reins and the Hearts, and I will give every one of you accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The Account may be very ſudden and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Many a Candle is extinguiſhed before it be half burnt out, many a clear Morning is overcaſt and clouded before Noon. Oh, how many ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den &amp; untimely Deaths have we ſeen, and heard of in our Day? And how little do Men lay it to Heart? The Sun knoweth his going down, but no Man knoweth the Day or Hour of his Diſſolution and Judgment. Good old <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he <hi>knew not the Day of his Death,</hi> Gen. xxvii. 2 Nevertheleſs Man's <hi>Days are determined the Number of his Months is with God, who hath appointed his Bounds that he cannot paſs,</hi> and Man <hi>ſhall accompliſh as an Hireling his Day,</hi> Job xiv. 5, 6. Yet the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Day of a Man's Death is uncertain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and may be very ſudden with Reſpect to any Man. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to-morrow,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) for thou
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004230_0014_1004245924537810"/>
knoweſt not what a Day may bring forth,</hi> Prov. xxvii 1. Not only daily Obſervation and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, but many Scripture Records give Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to this Truth. <hi>Nadab</hi> &amp; <hi>Abihu</hi> offered ſtrange Fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not, and there went out Fire from the Lord, and devoured them, &amp; they died before the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> x. 1, 2. Again, It was a ſudden &amp; unexpected Death and Judgment, which the Lord's of the Philiſtines met with, when the Houſe wherein they were feaſting and rejoycing, fell upon them by the Hands of <hi>Samſon, Judges</hi> xvi 30 And <hi>Job'</hi>s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, (though he was a very good Man) were overtaken with a very ſudden and unlook'd for End; when they were rejoycing together, <hi>behold there came a great Wind from the Wilderneſs, and ſmote the four Corners of the Houſe, and it fell upon the young Men, and they are dead,</hi> Job i. 19. How ſudden and unexpected ſoever Death comes, ſo ſudden the Judgment, <hi>for after this the Judgment,</hi> Heb. ix. 27.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>A joyful Sentence of endleſs Bliſs and Glory ſhall at Death be pronounced on all them that are ready and prepared to give up their Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</hi> They ſhall near a Voice from Heaven pronouncing their welcome Sentence upon them. Rev. xiv. 13. <hi>And I heard a Voice from Heaven, ſaying unto me, Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea ſaith the Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</hi> They ſhall be at Reſt from the Troubles of this Life, and their good Deeds and patient Sufferings, ſhall follow them as Witneſſes for them before the Judge of the Quick &amp; the Dead. The Souls of the Righteous are made perfect in Holineſs,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004230_0015_1004245C57759D80"/>
and received into the higheſt Heavens, where they behold the Face of God in Light and Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Good <hi>Aſaph</hi> being hard put to it to underſtand and reconcile the Myſtery of divine Providence, becauſe of the Proſperity of the Wicked, and the many Troubles and Diſtreſſes of the Righteous; he ſatisfyeth and ſupports himſelf with the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their different Ends. As to the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſaith he, <hi>Surely thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery Places, thou caſtedſt them down into Deſtruction,</hi> Pſalm lxxiii. 18. But as to the Righteous, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſuch, that God is their Guide here, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Portion hereafter, Ver. 24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy Counſel, and afterward receive me to Glory.</hi> But</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Account will be terrible and ſurpriſing to ſuch as are unprepared, and unprovided, to give Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</hi> Their Sentence will be, <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Mat. xxv. 41. The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Wicked is to eternal Miſery; lying in two Things. (1.) In a Departure from God, ſo as never more to have any Favour from him. (2.) In a Senſe of Pain and Miſery, exceeding that which Fire cauſeth to a Body conſuming with it. In this Life wicked Men are capable of ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God with them. &amp; receive ſeveral Favours from God, in Gifts of common Providence, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grace, which might ſerve either as Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to allure them, or Means to help them in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, but having abuſed theſe, the righteous God, in that Day, even the Day of Death, will totally depart from them, and they ſhall receive no more Tokens of Kindneſs and Favour from him; and whereas by the Advantages they had from ſuch a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004230_0016_100424615A5224D8"/>
Preſence of divine Providence as God was pleaſed in this Life to allow them, they lived in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Pleaſure and Liberty which they were not thankful for, they ſhall at that Day, i. e. the Day of Death and Judgment, be adjudged to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torments.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, <hi>The righteous Sentence that ſhall be pronounced by God the righteous Judge, upon every Man at Death, ſhall be deriſive and irrevocable.</hi> Here there is left no Room for Abatement, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal or Review. There can be no Evaſion at God's Bar, for he is Judge alone, and is juſtified when he ſpeaketh and clear when he judgeth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> li. 4. Then every Man is ordered to the Place appointed for him, the Wicked to a State of endleſs Miſery from which there is no Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Judas</hi> went to his own Place, <hi>Acts</hi> i. 25. And the Glutton is tormented forever in that Place without the leaſt Hopes of Reprieve or Eſcape. The State of the Damned will be void of any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Comfort or Satisfaction. But the Souls of good Men when they leave their Bodies, go into an unalterable Eſtate of eternal Bliſs, where are <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and enjoy a Felicity, which we are not able to expreſs, but is ſet out to us under the Notion of <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Boſom, to let us know that it is a Place of Reſt and Communion with Saints, and the ſame Felicity which <hi>Abraham the Friend of God</hi> doth enjoy. <hi>For we know,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. V. 1 <hi>that if our earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, an Houſe not made with Hands eternal in the Heavens.</hi> In ſuch a State as that it ſhall be incorruptible, no more ſubject to any Corruption or Decay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004230_0017_1004246962C9A3C0"/>
Come we now to the third general Point in the Doctrine, which is,</p>
               <p>III. <hi>That God is ready to take an Account of Men.</hi> He is always ſit, prepared, furniſhed and well appointed, to ſit upon his Judgment-Seat, and pronounce Sentence according to the various Caſes and Suits of all that are ſummoned, to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. <hi>Behold the Judge ſtandeth before the Door,</hi> James v. 9 But ſome Men wiſh there were no God, no Judge to call them unto an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>The Fool hath ſaid in his Heart there is no God,</hi> Pſalm xiv. 1. That is, he wiſhes there were no God, for he ſees nothing but Matter of Fear, Terror and Amazement round about. As the Wicked here lived without the Bounds of God's Law, they are afraid to fall under the Stroke of his Juſtice: Fear wiſhes the Deſtruction of that which it apprehends hurtful: And the amazing Fear of the Wicked conſiders God as a God to whom Vengeance belongs, as the Judge of all the Earth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> liv. 12.</p>
               <p>That God is prepared, and inconteſtably well furniſhed to take an Account of Men, may in ſome meaſure appear from the few following Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His unaccountable Sovereignty. He is the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords,</hi> 1 Tim. vi 15. He is the only Potentate becauſe he hath only Power in, and from himſelf, by him Kings reign, and he is the bleſſed Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, becauſe he is the Fountain of all Felicity, and Happineſs, yea, he is the moſt mighty Being, and Lord, to whom all other Princes are Subjects, all other Lords are Vaſſals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he rules all as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens do over the Earth. He is King of Worlds, King of Ages, as the Word tranſlated Eternal ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004230_0018_1004246B6E75EFA8"/>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 17. God is Being of the inviſible World, and the ſenſitive. Whatſoever is in Time is ſubject to the Sovereignty of the great God, who gave Being to all Things. <hi>The Lord hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his Throne in the Heavens: and his Kingdom ruleth over all,</hi> Pſalm ciii 19 His royal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty extends over Angels and Devils, over godly and ungodly, over rational and irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; all Things and Perſons, at all Times, and in all Places, are ſwayed and governed by his mighty Scepter. Earthly Kings may ſtep out of their own Country, into the Territory of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Prince, and as ſuch leave their Country, they leave their Dominion behind them; but Heaven and Earth &amp; every particular Part of both is the Territory of God</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>His Power is great and incomprehenſible. The Thunder of his Power who can underſtand?</hi> Job xxvi. 14. Infinite and unconceivable Power is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the divine Nature. This is a Truth not to be doubted of: For though Goodneſs, Wiſdom, Mercy &amp; Juſtice be eſſential, yet Power is more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently eſſential, becauſe no Acts of Goodneſs, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Mercy, Juſtice, can be exerciſed by him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Power.

And tho' it be true that God hath given Evidences of his Power in all his Works, yet it is as true, that he hath a Power beyond the Expreſſion of it in his Works; and as this is truly the Glory of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, ſo it is moſt certainly the Support and great Comfort of Believer.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>His Knowlege is infinite. O Lord, How great are thy Works! and thy Thoughts are very deep,</hi> Pſalm xcii. 5.

He knows all the Actions of Creatures. He counts in particular, all the Ways of Men. <hi>Doth he not ſee all my Ways, and count all my Steps,</hi> Job xxxi. 4. He diſcerns the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart, all that is in the Mind, all that is in the Affections, every Stirring &amp; Purpoſe; ſo that not one Thought can be withheld from him, yea, <hi>Hell and Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are before him: how much more then the Hearts of the Children of Men?</hi> Prov. xv. 11.

Thou madeſt him to have Dominion over the Works of thy Hands; thou haſt put all Things under his Feet,</hi> Pſalm viii. 5, 6. able is indeed Miſerable where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to excite thy Compaſſion; but he is not miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable without being criminal. He is a Rebel not by Neceſſity, but by Will. But Mercy ſteps in, and pleads in the behalf of the Offender, and moſt warmly urgeth, if Man be deſtroyed &amp; made Fuel for Hell Fire, the Creation is vain and to no Purpoſe: But then Juſtice anſwers, if Man be not
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004230_0021_1004247D3B83E6A0"/>
condemned, the Law is inſignificant, and will be intirely fruſtrated: Truth backs and ſupports Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and free Grace warmly urgeth Mercy! How can theſe Pleas be anſwered, this ſeeming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction accorded, and the Difference adjuſted? The Reaſon of Man cannot reach this Caſe, nor his Ability provide a Salvo, but God in the Depth of his Wiſdom found out an Expedient, by which Truth and Juſtice ſhall be ſatisfied in puniſhing, and Grace and Mercy moſt illuſtriouſly diſplayed in pardoning, by transferring the Puniſhment of our Crimes upon a Surety, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, from whoſe precious Blood Juſtice exacts a Recompenſe, and for whoſe Blood, Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are conferred upon us by Mercy, without the Expence and Loſs of one Drop of our own. This is the admirable Temperament found out in the unſearchable Wiſdom of God, whereby his Juſtice is honoured in the Sufferings of Man's Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and his Mercy glorified in the Application of the Propitiation to the Offender, Rom iii. 24, 25. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his Grace, through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Jeſus Chriſt Whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins that are paſt, through the Forbearance of God.</hi> Thus doth God freely juſtify thoſe, whom he effectually calleth, not by infuſing Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by pardoning their Sins, and by accounting, and accepting their Perſons, as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, not for any Thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Chriſt's Sake alone, who by his Obedience and Death, did fully diſcharge the Debt of all thoſe, who are thus juſtified, and did make a proper, real and full Satisfaction to the Father's Juſtice, in their Behalf.</p>

               <p>In the Improvement of this Doctrine, I ſhall in the firſt Place addreſs this numerous Aſſembly; and in the ſecond Place, the poor Priſoner, who is the Occaſion of ſo great an Aſſembly here at this Time. As to the Aſſembly, I might apply the Doctrine, and this melancholly Occaſion many Ways to them, but that I muſt not intrude upon your Time, or Patience. Let then your Ears, and rather your Hearts, give diligent Attention to a few Words. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is a neceſſary Point of your Faith to believe that there is a God that will call us all (in our Time and Order) to an Account, and that with him there are future Rewards and Puniſhments.</hi> We ſhould humbly and feelingly acknowlege with holy <hi>David, Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous, verily, he is a God that judgeth in the Earth,</hi> Pſalm lviii. 11. I beſeech you entertain, and improve this moſt certain Truth, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> That it is no longer to be doubted, or queſtioned by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that there is a God that inquires into, tries and diſcerns all Things &amp; Perſons. <hi>The Lord's Throne is in Heaven, his Eyes behold, his Eye lids try the Children of Men,</hi> Pſalm xi 4. And this he doth not as a Spectator only but to render to every one according to his Work, <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxii. 12. To God the ſovereign Being, the ſupream and univerſal Lawgiver and Judge, doth belong the univerſal Right and Power of vindictive Juſtice, it is his Propriety, as he will avenge all Injuries againſt his People, he will much more avenge the Sins and Injuries againſt his Son, and will actually return to Evil-Doers as a Recompence for their Sins the Evil of Puniſhment. He is not only juſt and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004230_0023_1004248ACF9D0648"/>
powerful, but actually manifeſting both in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution on them. Deut. xxxii. 41. <hi>If I whet my glittering Sword and mine Hand take hold on Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will render Vengeance to mine Enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</hi> If Men did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and conſtantly revere this Truth, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they ſhould allow themſelves in ſo many Crimes as they are guilty of, and daily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrating. But before I finiſh this Uſe, I muſt take leave to mention a few Errors and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections alledged and maintained by ſome Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to this Truth, and offer Scripture Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> and ſome others ſay, the Souls of the Righteous are not preſently after Death, admitted to enjoy Happineſs, which conſiſts in ſeeing of God, but are put into ſome Manſion, though it be not a heavenly one, yet a Place above Hell, where they enjoy, even until the Reſurrection, ſome heavenly Delight and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, without ſeeing God. And the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> likewiſe tell us, that the Souls of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous after Death, until the Reſurrection are (as it were) extinguiſhed. Theſe Errors are broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and maintained in Oppoſition to many expreſs Texts of Scripture, as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> xii. 7. where the wiſe Man declares that the Spirits of juſt Men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death, return to God and are rewarded by him. And the Protomartyr <hi>Stephen</hi> died in the Belief of this Truth, and ſealed it with his Blood, <hi>Acts</hi> vii. 59. <hi>And they ſtoned Stephen, calling upon God, and ſaying, Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> aſſures us, That the Spirits of juſt Men are made perfect in Holineſs, and placed in the heavenly Jeruſalem, with the Angels, <hi>Heb</hi> xii. 22, 23. And
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004230_0024_10040233CF7D8BB0"/>
a more excellent Author, namely, Jeſus Chriſt the Lord of Glory intimates <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 22, 25. That the Souls of the Righteous after Death are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and carried into <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Boſom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and others alledge and maintain that the Souls of the Wicked are not adjudged to the Torments of Hell, till after the Reſurrection: And the <hi>Socinians</hi> go ſtill farther, ſaying, that the Souls of the Wicked ſhall never be tormented in Hell. Theſe Errors contradict the ſacred Text, in ſundry Places, and Inſtances, Heb. ix. 27. <hi>And as it is appointed unto Men once to die, but after this the Judgment.</hi> Which evidently ſheweth, that the particular Judgment of every ſingle Man follows immediately his Departure out of this Life: Of this alſo Inſtances ſhall now be produced, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Soul of the rich Glutton which was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in Hell Flames after it left the Body, <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 22, 23. And <hi>Judas</hi> was ſtruck into his own Place, <hi>Acts</hi> i. 25.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Very groſs and abſurd are the Errors which <hi>Papiſts</hi> have framed againſt this Doctrine, who (albeit the holy Scripture doth not acknowlege any other Place than Heaven and Hell for Souls, departed from their Bodies) yet have deviſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther four beſides theſe two; <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> Limbus Patrum, Limbus Infantum, a moſt pleaſant Meadow, and Purgatory.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> in which (ſay they) the faithful who died before Chriſt's Paſſion have been ſhut up as in a dark Priſon under Ground, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Torment, and for the Time without Happineſs, have been kept cloſe there until Chriſt's Reſurrection and Aſcenſion into Heaven. In Anſwer hereto, we ſhould remember what is already noted from <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 22, 23. To which
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004230_0025_10042490DB0FFA80"/>
we may add, that the Vertue of Chriſt's Sacrifice did no leſs extend it ſelf to Believers under the old Teſtament, than the new. We are told, Rev. xiii 8. <hi>All that dwell upon the Earth ſhall worſhip him, whoſe Names are not written in the Book of the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World.</hi> And the Example of <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> which two before the Paſſion of Chriſt were ſeen upon the Mount with him, <hi>Luke</hi> ix. 30, 31. is a Confutation of this wild Fancy, even to a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their <hi>Limbus Infantum</hi> hath no better Ground to ſupport it, than their <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> becauſe the Covenant belongs to the Children of Believers though not baptiſed: In which Covenant, Glory and Life eternal are promiſed. Acts ii. 39. <hi>For the Promiſe is unto you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> Likewiſe our compaſſionate Redeemer declared, that the Kingdom of Heaven belonged to little Children, though not baptiſed. <hi>Mat.</hi> xix. 14. And the Infants of the Iſraelites dying before the eighth Day, were not ſhut up in <hi>Limbus Infantum,</hi> as the Adverſaries themſelves confeſs. But the Nature and Eſſence of Baptiſm, under the new Teſtament, and the Nature and Eſſence of Circumciſion under the old, are the ſame, according to the Apoſtle's Reaſoning, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> ii. 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Device, is almoſt pleaſant Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; in which (ſay they) as in a royal or ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian Priſon, the Souls that are in it want Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet ſuffer no Puniſhment of Senſe, except what ariſeth from the Delay of Happineſs, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Loſs. This Place ſeems to be the <hi>Eliſian Fields,</hi> taken out of the ſixth Book of <hi>Virgil'</hi>s
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004230_0026_100424926202A270"/>
                  <hi>AEneids.</hi> The Folly of this idle Fancy is made evident by the Anſwer to the firſt Objection. And methinks the very Hearing or Reading of it will carry its own Confutation, yea Condemnation with it, to every thinking and judicious Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly. <hi>Purgatory.</hi> The Notion of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, deviſed by the popiſh Church, is built upon the tottering Foundation of Venial Sin. But there is no ſuch Thing as Venial Sin, as it is explained by the Papiſts themſelves. <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 23. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us that temporal Puniſhments do not extend themſelves beyond this Life. <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 17, 18. For in this Life only the Godly receive their evil Things, as the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked receive their good Things, <hi>Luke</hi> xvi. 25. They that die in the Lord, reſt from their Labours, <hi>Rev.</hi> xiv. 13. And Chriſt's Satisfaction for the Sins of Believers, is moſt full, compleat and perfect, and doth not need our imperfect Satisfactions, whether for the Fault or the Puniſhment. <hi>Iſai.</hi> liii. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1 John i. 7. <hi>And the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>USE 2. <hi>Be perſwaded to employ your Thoughts and beſt Care, to be always ready to give up your Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead Knowing the Terrors of the Lord, we perſwade Men,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. v. 11. We believing and being fully perſwaded that there ſhall be ſuch a great and terrible Day of the Lord, when there ſhall be ſuch a narrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and Search into whatſoever Men have tho't ſpake or done in the Fleſh. We perſwade Men to believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to walk according to the Rule of the Goſpel, to avoid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very diſhoneſt and unwarrantable Behaviour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, to decline not only openly diſhoneſt
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004230_0027_1004249B73FE3228"/>
Actions, but every ſecret and hidden diſhoneſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. There are thoſe, who tho' they make a ſplendid Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and behave themſelves very ſpeciouſly in their more external Converſation, yet it were a Shame to ſpeak of the Things that are done of them in Secret; but yet in the Preſence of God their Judge, who will e're long undoubtedly call them to an Account, to which Period, truly all of us are haſtening. <hi>Man is like to Vanity, his Days are as a Shadow that paſſeth away,</hi> Pſalm cxliv. 5. And therefore Men ought to employ and improve all their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Talents, Time, Means and Seaſons of Grace, all that they have, and all Occaſions for this very great Purpoſe, namely, to prepare for Death, and the Judgment that immediately follows after it: <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant, whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing,</hi> Mat. xxiv. 46. And the preſent melancholly Occaſion ſhould profitably be improved by every one of us; we are not to be Spectators only, but Mourners on many Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, which I cannot now ſtand to enumerate. We are to be warned and admoniſhed, the poor Criminal in his Chains, is a Monitor to us all. This Houſe of Prayer and Praiſe, is now turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Houſe of Mourning. Ye are anon to be Witneſſes of a very affecting Tragedy, Death indeed is the End of Men, and who can be ſo Hardy as not to receive ſome Impreſſions from the natural &amp; timely Death of others: But more eſpecially from the untimely End which ſome unhappily bring upon themſelves, (as in the Caſe of this unhappy young Man, in his twenty-ninth Year,) who finds by ſad Experience that there is no Diſcharge in that War, and that Wickedneſs ſhall not deliver thoſe that are given to it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> viii. 8 Oh, that the Day of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004230_0028_1004249D02082C10"/>
his Death, may prove better to him than the Day of his Birth! and that every Soul in this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may find that Saying of the wiſe Man, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally accompliſhed in himſelf, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that <hi>it is better to go to the Houſe of Mourning, than to the Houſe of Feaſting; for that is the End of all Men, and the Living will lay it to his Heart,</hi> Eccleſ. vii. 2.</p>
               <p>Was the poor Spectacle before us, (I mean the Priſoner) now to ſpeak to you, doubtleſs he would addreſs you to this Effect: Take Warning by me every one of you, more eſpecially young Men: Behold the woful Fruits of bad Courſes, Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thoſe that had the Care of my Education, and perhaps their ſinful Neglect, Contempt of the Word and Sacraments, and of the Miniſtry, and Worſhip of God, Profanation of the Lord's Day, taking the Name of the glorious Jehovah often in vain, Idleneſs, Drunkenneſs, and Rioting, Lying, Stealing, and waſting of my Neighbour's Goods, whoſe Good and Quiet, I ought to tender and regard as my own. I have taſted the Pleaſures of Sin, but now I drink deep of the bitter Fruits of it. My Companions in my ill Courſes, have often (at the Coſt of our innocent Neighbours) put a Cup of Pleaſure, ſweetned Draughts into my Hand, but mixed with the Poyſon of Sin, which now is become a Cup of Shame and Bitterneſs unto me. Oh! Pity me, and pity your ſelves, by guarding betimes againſt an ignorant and ill ſpent Life. And pray earneſtly to be protected by divine Mercy from coming to my ſad Caſe, and ſo ſhameful an End as I have brought my ſinful Life to. To think that this poor Object ſuffers only for the Sin of Burglary is impertinent: No, his many other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities, were as ſo many Ingredients in the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004230_0029_100424A0143FAB88"/>
Provocation given to a juſt God, to leave him to perpetrate the laſt Act upon which his Conviction is grounded, and by which his Meaſure is filled up. May all of you then be careful to ſhun ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and vicious Courſes, which ſooner or later will bring Shame, and make ſo good Improvement of this Occaſion, as to induce you to beg of God dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Stile of holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm cxix. 133. <hi>Order my Steps in thy Word, and let not any Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have Dominion over me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have already hinted at ſundry Motives to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Men to ſtudy to be always in a Readineſs to give up their Account unto God, which is to be done by them immediately after Death. As to the Certainty of the Account to be given, it is very extenſive, it will be impartial and critical, it may be very ſudden and unexpected: Endleſs Joy and Comfort ſhall be to thoſe that are found ready, but endleſs Sorrow &amp; Miſery to ſuch as are found unprepared, and the Sentence that is paſſed upon every Man at Death, will be deciſive and irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. Moreover, there are many ſpecial Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and Privileges which doth undoubtedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to thoſe that are conſtant and faithful in the Proſecution of this neceſſary Work; Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Peace to every Man that worketh good, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 10. The Word Peace, according to the uſual Acceptation of it amongſt the Hebrews, is comprehenſive of all Good and Happineſs, both here and hereafter. But Time would fail me, if I ſhould attempt to give a Liſt of Particulars here. I have therefore fixed upon three general Heads, under which (I think) they are all couched. As</p>

(as far as we can and ought to judge.) <hi>The Tree is known by his Fruit,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, Mat. xii. 33. If the Fruit be good, the Tree muſt be good. And the Branch cannot bear Fruit, except it be in the Vine, <hi>John</hi> xv. 4 God graciouſly giveth unto ſuch a Place and a Name better than of Sons and Daughters; he will give them an everlaſting Name that ſhall not be cut off. This ſhall be the high Privilege, moſt excellent Dignity and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of all thoſe that chuſe the Things that pleaſe him, and take hold of his Covenant; yea, all thoſe that join themſelves to the Lord to ſerve him, and to love him, ſhall in their Perſons and Services be accepted with him; he will bring them to his holy Mountain, and make them joyful in his Houſe of Prayer, <hi>Iſai.</hi> lvi. 4, to 8.

love God, namely, Chriſt and his Benefits, which are ſet out as Things not obvious to Senſe, and not to be comprehended by Reaſon. It could never have entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, that God ſhould give his only begotten Son out of his eternal Boſom, to take upon him the Nature of Man, and to die upon the Croſs: or, that Chriſt ſhould ſo far humble himſelf and become obedient unto Death, to redeem and reſcue loſt Man, from eternal Death, reconcile him to his eternal Father, and by the Sacrifice of himſelf ſecure his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Glory. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the Gates into the City,</hi> Rev. xxii. 14.

They ſhall walk with God their Saviour in white, be cloathed in white Raiment, be Pillars in the Temple of the living God; yea, they ſhall be continually before the Throne of God, and ſerve him Day and Night in his Temple. And he that fitteth on the Throne ſhall dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, they ſhall hunger no more, nor thirſt any more; neither ſhall the Sun light on them, nor any Heat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Lamb which is in the midſt of the Throne ſhall feed them, and God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, <hi>Rev</hi> vii. 9. 13, to 18 Surely ſuch excellent Privileges and

               <p>It might be proper here to add ſome Directions, but I muſt refer you in this Matter to the Anſwer given to the firſt Queſtion, under the ſecond Branch of the Doctrine, and haſten to ſay a few Words to the diſtreſſed Priſoner. Poor Man, We pity you, and we have frequently and fervently prayed to God for Mercy to your immortal Soul: And I hope that our Prayers and Labours have not been in vain. I truſt that you remember that I have heretofore directed you in publick &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, as to the Nature of Goſpel Faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and that God is ready to ſhew Mercy to penitent believing Sinners I hope I need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt at this Time upon theſe Points. Now, now, is the only Time left you to improve theſe ſpecial Graces with the greateſt Importunity. Nor do I think it convenient at this critical Hour to load you with Variety of Matter or Phraſes; but very affectionately move you to the following Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inquiry with your ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, <hi>That you are in a few Minutes to give an Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead. Behold, the Judge ſtandeth before the Door.</hi> Your Caſe is as it were called, and the Sentence preparing ready to be pronounced upon you this, <hi>Give an Account of your Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for thou ſhalt be no longer Steward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

God by its inward Influence upon your Heart, ſo convinced you of Sin, in not believing in Chriſt, that you now believe in him to the ſaving of your Soul? If ſo, you very ſenſibly feel theſe two Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it. One, a godly Sorrow of Heart for Sin, as it is diſpleaſing to a holy God, judging and condemning thy ſelf before God. Are you ready to ſay with the Thief on the Croſs, that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the due Reward of your Deeds? <hi>Luke</hi> xxiii. 41. Moſt earneſtly beſeeching the almighty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all Perſons &amp; Things, which made Waters flow out of the Rock to ſmite thy flinty Heart, to take thy ſtony Heart out of thy Body, to open thy Heart as he did <hi>Lydia</hi>'s, to put a new Spirit within thy Bowels, to anoint thine Eyes with Eye-Salve, that ſo thou mayeſt now ſee and feel thine own Wretchedneſs, and mayeſt feelingly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege with <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom vii. 18 <hi>That in thy Fleſh there dwelleth no good Thing.</hi> With holy <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> xxxviii. 4 That thine Iniquities are as a weighty Burden unto thee, yea too heavy for thee. With <hi>Jacob,</hi> That thou art leſs than the leaſt of God's Mercies. With <hi>Daniel,</hi> That open Shame belongeth unto thee. With <hi>Job,</hi> That thou canſt not anſwer for one of a thouſand, <hi>Chap.</hi> ix. 3 That ſo thou mayeſt have, (if it were poſſible) a Glimpſe of that woful Score, which the Lord hath againſt thee in this thy Day of Reckoning The other is a juſtifying of God now, under the manifeſt Effects of his holy &amp; juſt Diſpleaſure againſt thy Sins; ſaying in Humility &amp; Sincerity of thy Soul, O Lord thou art juſt in all that is brought upon me, for thou haſt done right, but I have done wickedly, <hi>Neh</hi> ix 33. Thus will the Mercy of God be ſweet unto thee, when thou feeleſt the intolerable Burthen of a wounded Spirit; thy Soul will thirſt after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,

&amp; all Things will be as Dung to thee; that thou mayeſt win Chriſt, and obtain the Favour of God through him. The Tidings of Chriſt in the Sequel of the Diſcourſe, will make thy very Heart to leap within thee, as the Salutation of <hi>Mary</hi> did the Babe in the Womb of <hi>Eliſabeth:</hi> They will come down upon thy perplexed Soul, like the Rain upon the mown Graſs, &amp; as the Showers that water the Earth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxi. 6 And this leads to the next Meditation and Inquiry <abbr>

            <head>The Confeſſion and Dying Warning of Hugh Henderſon, Sign'd by him in the Preſence of four of the Miniſters, the Morning of the Day of his Execution.</head>
            <p>I <hi>Hugh Henderſon</hi> otherwiſe through my Wickedneſs called <hi>John Hamilton,</hi> of about 28 or 29 Years of Age, was born in <hi>Armagh</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> received Baptiſm in the Manner of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, &amp; was brought up by my Uncle, who was obliged to give me ſuitable Learning, but did not; which Neglect, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with my own neglect of learning the Word of God afterwards, was a great Reaſon of my taking to ſuch wicked Courſes as have brought me to my unhappy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untimely End.</p>
            <p>I began with ſmaller Sins while I was Young; with but ſtealing Pins; againſt which I received Warning often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but perſiſted in it, and was very diſobedient, till <hi>I</hi> increaſed further in Sin.</p>
            <p>I came into this Country about nine Years ago, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently took to <hi>Drinking;</hi> and when I had been about a Year here, I took to <hi>Stealing,</hi> which I have followed from that Time, except too or three Years intermiſſion; and have liv'd in profane <hi>Curſing, Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Lying,</hi> and <hi>breaking</hi> the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>Gameing,</hi> eſpecially whilſt I was in <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Government; to which I have added <hi>Whoreing</hi> alſo: So that my Sins have been very many and hainous in the Sight of God and Man; but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly I confeſs my <hi>Houſe-breaking,</hi> for which I muſt juſtly die, and am righteouſly expos'd to the Wrath of God for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:004230_0037_100424C8173AC700"/>
But I have my Hope and Dependance upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for the Pardon of my many &amp; great Sins, and for eternal Salvation: For He has come into the World to bear the Sins of Men, has ſuffered upon the Croſs, and made Atonement by his Blood: In Him I deſire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with my whole Soul, repenting bitterly of all my Sins, and forſaking and renouncing them all; begging and hoping for Pardon at the Hands of God only for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt</p>
            <p>I alſo entreat Forgiveneſs of all Perſons whom I have wronged and injured by my Acts of Unrighteouſneſs and Violence, or other Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>I deſire to bleſs God he has given me ſuch a Sight and Senſe of my Sins, and has granted me ſuch a Space for my repenting, and affording me the precious Means of Grace, when he might have juſtly cut me off ſuddenly in the midſt of my Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>I thank God alſo for the many Favours and Kindneſſes of his People and Miniſters, and the Helps and Aſſiſtances afforded me during my Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>I thank his Excellency the Governour for his Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards me in granting me a <hi>Reprieve,</hi> and am ſorry that I have not improv'd the whole Time of it better than I have; but truſt it has been a Mercy to <hi>my</hi> Soul.</p>
            <p>And being that my Sins have brought me to theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sufferings, I would ſolemnly <hi>Warn</hi> all Perſons <hi>in General</hi> that they beware of ſinning againſt an holy God as I have done; and I pray God to keep them from the Sins I have been guilty of; from <hi>Whoring</hi> and Drinking, breaking the Sabbath, Curſing and Swearing, and Lying and Gaming; and from Stealing eſpecially.</p>
            <p>I would <hi>particularly</hi> warn all <hi>Parents</hi> &amp; <hi>Heads of Families</hi> that they neglect not Prayer in their Houſes, and that they do not fail to bring up the Children under their Care in ſuitable Learning, and in the Knowledge and Fear of God and Practice of Religion, that they may not fall into ſuch pernicious Courſes as I have done.</p>
            <p>I would ſolemnly Warn all <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> that they be ſure to be obedient to their Parents, and Maſters and Miſtreſſeſs: Diſobedience being a dangerous Inlet to much other Wickedneſs</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:004230_0038_100424D36A302008"/>
And I ſolemnly warn all <hi>Young Perſons</hi> that they eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially beware of the foremention'd heinous Sins, and they do not by any Means neglect the Care of their Souls, but ſee that they be buſy with God in their Youth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themſelves with Chriſt and the way to Salvation by Him, accept of Him, and rely upon Him for eternal Happineſs.</p>
            <p>I would earneſtly Warn and Charge all <hi>Tavern Keepers</hi> that they mind and give good Weight and Meaſure, there being much Iniquity through the neglect thereof, and ſee that they keep good Orders, and do not let Perſons have too much Drink, being that by thoſe Means they become in a great Meaſure chargeable with the Sins which others commit when depriv'd of their Senſes thereby. I pray the Tavern Keepers of this Town of <hi>Worceſter</hi> that they would beware of ſuffering any Diſorders in their Houſes, letting the young Perſons, or the younger or elder Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Place continue in their evil Practices of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Exceſs.</p>
            <p>And while I remember what paſs'd with me in <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Government, I can't but warn them againſt their rudeneſs, viciouſneſs, irreligiouſneſs, and breaking the Lord's Day.</p>
            <p>Having given this Warning, I deſire to commend my ſelf to the Charity and Prayers of all God's People for me, and that you would lift up your Hearts to God for me, for the Pardon of my Sins, an Intereſt in Chriſt, and that I may be ſanctified by the Spirit of God: But above all I commend my ſelf to the infinite Mercy of God, in my dear Redeemer, begging and beſeeching that through the Merits of his Blood I may this Day be with Him in Paradiſe.</p>
