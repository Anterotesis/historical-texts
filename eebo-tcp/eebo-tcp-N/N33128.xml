            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sometime previous to that tranſaction, my wife and her aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates concerted a plan to deprive me of life.— After they had effected their purpoſe, I was to have been thrown into an aſh-hole, which communicated from a fire place in my houſe, into the cellar. In this place, I had it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation to conceal her, after cutting her in pieces;—and while this was in agitation, I thought of a breach made in my cellar wall— in which the witches and wizards kept their treaſure.—This place I examined, plunging a crow-bar twice into it;—and concluding to bury her here, I returned, in a few moments, to where ſhe lay, and took the body in my arms to diſpoſe of accordingly;—but immediately laid it back.—<hi>Had you any thought of murdering the infant in bed with her?</hi>—The devil and I were at ſtrife about it.—He endeavoured to urge me to it; but the angels commanded the contrary, and I laid it carefully away.—<hi>Were you not jealous with reſpect to the chaſtity of your wife?</hi>—Yes, and confirm'd in that opinion by an acquaintance with her illicit correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents;—ſeveral of whom were evidences againſt me on my trial.—<hi>Had you any private bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with your wife the day previous to the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?</hi>—Not that I recollect; though we were ſtrangers to domeſtic happineſs ſome months before that event took place.—<hi>Did you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to authority, and divulge your ſuſpicions?</hi>— Yes, but ſome of them being intimate with her, and free-maſons, acted partially, and put a maſter over me only.—<hi>Was it juſtifiable, taking into conſideration every circumſtance, to kill your wife?</hi>—To kill in ſelf-defence is juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable—ſhe had frequently threatened my life—and often when ſitting at table.—Was it not juſt in Moſes to kill the Egyptian, and bury him in the ſand?—<hi>He acted under the immediate influence of his divine Maſter—you, from a ſpirit of malevolence, created by jealouſy.</hi> —You are indeed miſtaken,—I was ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with holy angels when I laid violent hands on my wife.—<hi>Would it not tend to your future happineſs, and be more ſatisfactory to your children and friends, were you to conduct with ſteadineſs and compoſure of mind, by devoting the few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining hours of life, in ſerious meditation, and advice of the clergy?</hi>—Reply, don't you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that men of liberal education are more intriguing, and do more frequently deceive the world than illiterate farmers.—And will you not allow that there are as many bad clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in proportion to their number, as of any other ſect?—As this is my opinion, why ſhould I requeſt their advice or prayers, in preference to others.</p>
