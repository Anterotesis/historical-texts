            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>MATTHEW VII. 12.</bibl>
                  <p>THEREFORE ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER YOU WOULD, THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM; FOR THIS IS THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS precept of our divine Lord hath always been admired as moſt excellent; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs with the greateſt reaſon. Yet it needs ſome explanation. It is not ſurely to be underſtood in the moſt unlimited ſenſe, implying that becauſe a prince expects and wiſhes for obedience from his ſubjects, he is obliged to obey them: that becauſe parents wiſh their children to ſubmit to their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, therefore they are to ſubmit to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their children: or that becauſe ſome men wiſh that others would concur and aſſiſt them to the gratification of their unlawful deſires, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they alſo are to gratify the unlawful deſires of others. But whatever we are conſcious, that we ſhould, in an exchange of circumſtances, wiſh, and are perſuaded that we might reaſonably wiſh, that others would do to us; that we are bound to do to them. This is the general rule given us in the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023346_0005_0FBF22CBB3EA0618"/>
text; and a very extenſive rule it is, reaching to the whole of our conduct: and is particularly uſeful to direct our conduct toward inferiours, and thoſe whom we have in our power. I have therefore thought it a proper foundation for the diſcourſe which by <hi>the Society for the Promotion of Freedom, and for the Relief of Perſons unlawfully holden in Bondage,</hi> I have the honour to be appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, on the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>This divine maxim is moſt properly applicable to the ſlave-trade, and to the ſlavery of the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. Let us then make the application.</p>
            <p>Should we be willing, that the Africans or any other nation ſhould purchaſe us, our wives and children, tranſport us into Africa and there ſell us into perpetual and abſolute ſlavery? Should we be willing, that they by large bribes and offers of a gainful traffic ſhould entice our neighbours to kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nap and ſell us to them, and that they ſhould hold in perpetual and cruel bondage, not only ourſelves, but our poſterity through all generations? Yet why is it not as right for them to treat us in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as it is for us to treat them in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Their colour indeed is different from our's. But does this give us a right to enſlave them? The nations from Germany to Guinea have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of every ſhade from the faireſt white, to a jetty black: and if a black complexion ſubject a nation or an individual to ſlavery; where ſhall ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very begin? or where ſhall it end?</p>
            <p>I propoſe to mention a few reaſons againſt the right of the ſlave-trade—and then to conſider the principal arguments, which I have ever heard urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in favour of it.—What will be ſaid againſt the ſlave-trade will generally be equally applicable to ſlavery itſelf; and if concluſive againſt the former, will be equally concluſive againſt the latter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:023346_0006_0FBF22CE342BA2F8"/>As to the ſlave-trade, I conceive it to be unjuſt in itſelf—abominable on account of the cruel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which it is conducted—and totally wrong on account of the impolicy of it, or its deſtructive ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the moral and political intereſts of any country.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is unjuſt in itſelf.—It is unjuſt in the ſame ſenſe, and for the ſame reaſon, as it is, to ſteal, to rob, or to murder. It is a principle, the truth of which hath in this country been generally, if not univerſally acknowledged, ever ſince the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the late war, <hi>that all men are born equally free.</hi> If this be true, the Africans are by nature equally entitled to freedom as we are; and therefore we have no more right to enſlave, or to afford aid to enſlave them, than they have to do the ſame to us. They have the ſame right to their freedom, which they have to their property or to their lives. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to enſlave them is as really and in the ſame ſenſe wrong, as to ſteal from them, to rob or to murder them.</p>
            <p>There are indeed caſes in which men may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be deprived of their liberty and reduced to ſlavery; as there are caſes in which they may be juſtly deprived of their lives. But they can juſtly be deprived of neither, unleſs they have by their own voluntary conduct forfeited it. Therefore ſtill the right to liberty ſtands on the ſame baſis with the right to life. And that the Africans have done ſomething whereby they have forfeited their liberty muſt appear, before we can juſtly deprive them of it; as it muſt appear, that they have done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereby they have forfeited their lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may juſtly deprive them of theſe.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſlave-trade is wicked and abominable on account of the cruel manner in which it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:023346_0007_0FBF22CF71757408"/>Beſide the ſtealing or kidnapping of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, in the firſt inſtance, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of others to this abominable practice; the inhuman manner in which they are tranſported to America, and in which they are treated on their paſſage and in their ſubſequent ſlavery, is ſuch as ought forever to deter every man from acting any part in this buſineſs, who has any regard to juſtice or humanity. They are crowded ſo cloſely into the holds and between the decks of veſſels, that they have ſcarcely room to lie down, and ſometimes not room to ſit up in an erect poſture; the men at the ſame time faſtened together with irons by two and two; and all this in the moſt ſultry climate. The conſequence of the whole is, that the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and fatal diſeaſes are ſoon bred among them, whereby vaſt numbers of thoſe exported from Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca periſh in the voyage: others in dread of that ſlavery which is before them, and in diſtreſs and deſpair from the loſs of their parents, their children, their huſbands, their wives, all their dear connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their dear native country itſelf, ſtarve themſelves to death or plunge themſelves into the ocean. Thoſe who attempt in the former of thoſe ways to eſcape from their perſecutors, are tortured by live coals applied to their mouths. Thoſe who attempt an eſcape in the latter and fail, are equally tortured by the moſt cruel beating, or otherwiſe as their perſecutors pleaſe. If any of them make an attempt, as they ſometimes do, to recover their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſome, and as the circumſtances may be, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are put to immediate death. Others beaten, bruiſed, cut and mangled in a moſt inhuman and ſhocking manner, are in this ſituation exhibited to the reſt, to terrify them from the like attempt in future: and ſome are delivered up to every ſpecies of torment, whether by the application of the whip,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023346_0008_0FBF22D233C75F00"/>
or of any other inſtrument, even of fire itſelf, as the ingenuity of the ſhip-maſter and of his crew is able to ſuggeſt or their ſituation will admit; and theſe torments are purpoſely continued for ſeveral days, before death is permitted to afford relief to theſe objects of vengeance.</p>
            <p>By theſe means, according to the common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, twenty-five thouſand, which is a fourth part of thoſe who are exported from Africa, and by the conceſſion of all, twenty thouſand, annually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, before they arrive at the places of their deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in America.</p>
            <p>But this is by no means the end of the ſufferings of this unhappy people. Bred up in a country ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly yielding the neceſſaries and conveniences of ſavage life, they have never been accuſtomed to labour: of courſe they are but ill prepared to go through the fatigue and drudgery to which they are doomed in their ſtate of ſlavery. Therefore partly by this cauſe, partly by the ſcantineſs and badneſs of their food, and partly from dejection of ſpirits, mortification and deſpair, another twenty-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand die in the ſeaſoning, as it is called, i. e. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two years of their arrival in America. This I ſay is the common computation. Or if we will in this particular be as favourable to the trade as in the eſtimate of the number which periſhes on the paſſage, we may reckon the number which dies in the ſeaſoning to be twenty thouſand. So that of the hundred thouſand annually exported from Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to America, fifty thouſand, as it is commonly computed, or on the moſt favourable eſtimate, forty thouſand, die before they are ſeaſoned to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all. The cruel ſufferings of theſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable beings are not yet at an end. Thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023346_0009_0FBF22D911CE9418"/>
they have to drag out a miſerable life in abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſlavery, entirely at the diſpoſal of their maſters, by whom not only every venial fault, every mere inadvertence or miſtake, but even real virtues, are liable to be conſtrued into the moſt atrocious crimes, and puniſhed as ſuch, according to their caprice or rage, while they are intoxicated ſometimes with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, ſometimes with paſſion.</p>
            <p>By theſe maſters they are ſupplied with barely enough to keep them from ſtarving, as the whole expence laid out on a ſlave for food, clothing and medicine is commonly computed on an average at thirty ſhillings ſterling annually. At the ſame time they are kept at hard labour from five o'clock in the morning, till nine at night, excepting time to eat twice during the day. And they are conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the watchful eye of overſeers and Negro-drivers more tyrannical and cruel than even their maſters themſelves. From theſe drivers for every imagined, as well as real neglect or want of exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they receive the laſh, the ſmack of which is all day long in the ears of thoſe who are on the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or in the vicinity; and it is uſed with ſuch dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and ſeverity, as not only to lacerate the ſkin, but to tear out ſmall portions of the fleſh at almoſt every ſtroke.</p>
            <p>This is the general treatment of the ſlaves. But many individuals ſuffer ſtill more ſeverely. Many, many are knocked down; ſome have their eyes beaten out; ſome have an arm or a leg broken, or chopt off; and many for a very ſmall or for no crime at all, have been beaten to death merely to gratify the fury of an enraged maſter or overſeer.</p>
            <p>Nor ought we on this occaſion to overlook the wars among the nations of Africa excited by the trade, or the deſtruction attendant on thoſe wars. Not to mention the deſtruction of property, the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023346_0010_0FBF22DCF9F84560"/>
burning of towns and villages, &amp;c. it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by reaſonable computation, that there are annually exported from Africa to the various parts of America, one hundred thouſand ſlaves, as was before obſerved; that of theſe ſix thouſand are cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of war; that in the wars in which theſe are taken, ten perſons of the victors and vanquiſhed are killed, to one taken; that therefore the taking of the ſix thouſand captives is attended with the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſixty thouſand of their countrymen. Now does not juſtice? does not humanity ſhrink from the idea, that in order to procure one ſlave to grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ify our avarice, we ſhould put to death ten human beings? Or that in order to increaſe our property, and that only in ſome ſmall degree, we ſhould carry on a trade, or even connive at it, to ſupport which ſixty thouſand of our own ſpecies are ſlain in war?</p>
            <p>Theſe ſixty thouſand, added to the forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand who periſh on the paſſage and in the ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, give us an hundred thouſand who are annually deſtroyed by the trade; and the whole advantage gained by this amazing deſtruction of human lives is ſixty thouſand ſlaves. For you will recollect, that the whole number exported from Africa is an hundred thouſand; that of theſe forty thouſand die on the paſſage and in the ſeaſoning, and ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand are deſtroyed in the wars. Therefore while one hundred and ſixty thouſand are killed in the wars and are exported from Africa, but ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand are added to the ſtock of ſlaves.</p>
            <p>Now when we conſider all this; when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the miſeries which this unhappy people ſuffer in their wars, in their captivity, in their voyage to America, and during a wretched life of cruel ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: and eſpecially when we conſider the annual deſtruction of an hundred thouſand lives in the manner before mentioned; who can heſitate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023346_0011_0FBF22DE8C3DDD88"/>
this trade and the conſequent ſlavery to be contrary to every principle of juſtice and humanity, of the law of nature and of the law of God?</p>
            <p n="3">III. This trade and this ſlavery are utterly wrong on the ground of impolicy. In a variety of reſpects they are exceedingly hurtful to the ſtate which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerates them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are hurtful, as they deprave the morals of the people.—The inceſſant and inhuman cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties practiſed in the trade and in the ſubſequent ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very neceſſarily tend to harden the human heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tender feelings of humanity in the maſters of veſſels, in the ſailors, in the factors, in the proprietors of the ſlaves, in their children, in the overſeers, in the ſlaves themſelves, and in all who habitually ſee thoſe cruelties. Now the eradication or even the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of compaſſion, tenderneſs and humanity, is certainly a great depravation of heart, and muſt be followed with correſpondent depravity of manners. And meaſures which lead to ſuch depravity of heart and manners, cannot but be extremely hurtful to the ſtate, and conſequently are extremely impolitic.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The trade is impolitic as it is ſo deſtructive of the lives of ſeamen. The ingenious Mr. Clark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath in a very ſatisfactory manner made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that in the ſlave-trade alone Great-Britain loſes annually about nineteen hundred ſeamen; and that this loſs is more than double to the loſs annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuſtained by Great-Britain in all her other trade taken together. And doubtleſs we loſe as many as Great-Britain in proportion to the number of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom we employ in this trade.—Now can it be politic to carry on a trade which is ſo deſtructive of that uſeful part of our citizens, our ſeamen?</p>
            <p n="3">3. African ſlavery is exceedingly impolitic, as it diſcourages induſtry. Nothing is more eſſential to the political proſperity of any ſtate, than induſtry in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023346_0012_0FBF22E181A6C290"/>
the citizens. But in proportion as ſlaves are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, every kind of labour becomes ignominious: and in fact in thoſe of the United States, in which ſlaves are the moſt numerous, gentlemen and ladies of any faſhion diſdain to employ themſelves in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which in other ſtates is conſiſtent with the dignity of the firſt families and firſt offices. In a country filled with Negro ſlaves, labour belongs to them only, and a white man is deſpiſed in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he applies to it.—Now how deſtructive to induſtry in all of the loweſt and middle claſs of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, ſuch a ſituation and the prevalence of ſuch ideas will be, you can eaſily conceive. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is, that ſome will nearly ſtarve, others will betake themſelves to the moſt diſhoneſt practices, to obtain the means of living.</p>
            <p>As ſlavery produces indolence in the white peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo it produces all thoſe vices which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally connected with it; ſuch as intemperance, lewdneſs and prodigality. Theſe vices enfeeble both the body and the mind, and unfit men for any vigorous exertions and employments either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or mental. And thoſe who are unfit for ſuch exertions, are already a very degenerate race; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, not only in a moral, but a natural ſenſe. They are contemptible too, and will ſoon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed even by their Negroes themſelves.</p>
            <p>Slavery tends to lewdneſs not only as it produces indolence, but as it affords abundant opportunity for that wickedneſs without either the danger and difficulty of an attack on the virtue of a woman of chaſtity, or the danger of a connection with one of ill fame. A planter with his hundred wenches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him is in ſome reſpects at leaſt like the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in his ſeraglio, and we learn the too frequent influence and effect of ſuch a ſituation, not only from common fame, but from the multitude of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023346_0013_0FBF22E30D82E0A8"/>
mulattoes in countries where ſlaves are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous.</p>
            <p>Slavery has a moſt direct tendency to haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alſo, and a domineering ſpirit and conduct in the proprietors of the ſlaves, in their children, and in all who have the control of them. A man who has been bred up in domineering over Negroes, can ſcarcely avoid contracting ſuch a habit of haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and domination, as will expreſs itſelf in his general treatment of mankind, whether in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate capacity, or in any office civil or military with which he may be veſted. Deſpotiſm in economics naturally leads to deſpotiſm in politics, and domeſtic ſlavery in a free government is a perfect ſoleciſm in human affairs.</p>
            <p>How baneful all theſe tendencies and effects of ſlavery muſt be to the public good, and eſpecially to the public good of ſuch a free country as our's, I need not inform you.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the ſame proportion as induſtry and labour are diſcouraged, is population diſcouraged and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. This is another reſpect in which ſlavery is exceedingly impolitic. That population is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in proportion as induſtry is diſcouraged, is, I conceive, ſo plain that nothing needs to be ſaid to illuſtrate it. Mankind in general will enter into matrimony as ſoon as they poſſeſs the means of ſupporting a family. But the great body of any people have no other way of ſupporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or a family, than by their own labour. Of courſe as labour is diſcouraged, matrimony is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and population is prevented.—But the impolicy of whatever produces theſe effects will be acknowledged by all. The wealth, ſtrength and glory of a ſtate depend on the number of its virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous citizens: and a ſtate without citizens is at leaſt as great an abſurdity, as a king without ſubjects.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:023346_0014_0FBF22E5AC9DD060"/>5. The impolicy of ſlavery ſtill further appears from this, that it weakens the ſtate, and in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the degree in which it exiſts, expoſes it to become an eaſy conqueſt.—The increaſe of free ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens is an increaſe of the ſtrength of the ſtate. But not ſo with regard to the increaſe of ſlaves. They not only add nothing to the ſtrength of the ſtate, but actually diminiſh it in proportion to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Every ſlave is naturally an enemy to the ſtate in which he is holden in ſlavery, and wants nothing but an opportunity to aſſiſt in its overthrow. And an enemy within a ſtate, is much more dangerous than one without it.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations concerning the prevention of population and weakening the ſtate, are ſupported by facts which have fallen within our own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That the ſouthern ſtates, in which ſlaves are ſo numerous, are in no meaſure ſo populous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the extent of territory, as the northern, is a fact of univerſal notoriety: and that during the late war, the ſouthern ſtates found themſelves greatly weakened by their ſlaves, and therefore were ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overrun by the Britiſh army, is equally noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>From the view we have now taken of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject we ſcruple not to infer, that to carry on the ſlave-trade and to introduce ſlaves into our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is not only to be guilty of injuſtice, robbery and cruelty toward our fellow-men; but it is to injure ourſelves and our country; and therefore it is altogether unjuſtifiable, wicked and abominable.</p>
            <p>Having thus conſidered the injuſtice and ruinous tendency of the ſlave-trade, I proceed to attend to the principal arguments urged in favour of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is ſaid, that the Africans are the poſterity of Ham, the ſon of Noah; that Canaan one of Ham's ſons, was curſed by Noah to be a ſervant
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023346_0015_0FBF22E6B746DD18"/>
of ſervants; that by Canaan we are to underſtand Ham's poſterity in general; that as his poſterity are devoted by God to ſlavery, we have a right to enſlave them.—This is the argument: to which I anſwer:</p>
            <p>It is indeed generally thought that Ham peopled Africa; but that the curſe on Canaan extended to all the poſterity of Ham is a mere imagination. The only reaſon given for it is, that Canaan was only one of Ham's ſons; and that it ſeems reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the curſe of Ham's conduct ſhould fall on all his poſterity, if on any. But this argument is inſufficient. We might as clearly argue, that the judgments denounced on the houſe of David, on account of his ſin in the matter of Uriah, muſt equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall on all his poſterity. Yet we know, that many of them lived and died in great proſperity. So in every caſe in which judgments are predicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any nation or family.</p>
            <p>It is allowed in this argument, that the curſe was to fall on the <hi>poſterity</hi> of Ham, and not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Ham himſelf; If otherwiſe, it is nothing to the purpoſe of the ſlave-trade, or of any ſlaves now in exiſtence. It being allowed then, that this curſe was to fall on Ham's poſterity, he who had a right to curſe the whole of that poſterity, had the ſame right to curſe a part of it only, and the poſterity of Canaan equally as any other <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>art; and a curſe on Ham's poſterity in the line of Canaan was as real a curſe on Ham himſelf, as a curſe on all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would have been.</p>
            <p>Therefore we have no ground to believe, that this curſe reſpected any others, than the poſterity of Canaan, who lived in the land of Canaan, which is well known to be remote from Africa. We have a particular account, that all the ſons of Canaan ſettled in the land of Canaan; as may be ſeen in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023346_0016_0FBF22E836193670"/>
Gen. x. 15—20. <q>And Canaan begat Sidon his firſt born, and Heth, and the Jebuſite, and the Emorite, and the Girgaſite, and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, and the Arvadite, and the Zemorite, and the Hamathite; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward were the families of the Canaanites ſpread abroad. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou goeſt to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goeſt unto Sodom and Gomorrah, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah, and Zeboim, even unto Laſhah.</q>—Nor have we account that any of their poſterity except the Carthaginians afterward removed to any part of Africa: and none will pretend that theſe peopled Africa in general; eſpecially conſidering, that they were ſubdued, deſtroyed and ſo far extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by the Romans.</p>
            <p>This curſe then of the poſterity of Canaan, had no reference to the inhabitants of Guinea, or of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica in general; but was fulfilled partly in Joſhua's time, in the reduction and ſervitude of the Canaan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, and eſpecially of the Gibeonites; partly by what the Phenicians ſuffered from the Chaldeans, Perſians and Greeks; and finally by what the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians ſuffered from the Romans.</p>
            <p>Therefore this curſe gives us no right to enſlave the Africans, as we do by the ſlave-trade, becauſe it has no reſpect to the Africans whom we enſlave. Nor if it had reſpected them, would it have given any ſuch right; becauſe it was not an inſtitution of ſlavery, but a mere prophecy of it. And from this prophecy we have no more ground to infer the right of ſlavery, than we have from the prophecy of the deſtruction of Jeruſalem by Nebuchadnezzar, or by the Romans, to infer their right reſpectively to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it in the manner they did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or from other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies to infer the right of Judas to betray his maſter, or of the Jews to crucify him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:023346_0017_0FBF22E9B67C7898"/>2. The right of ſlavery is inferred from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Abraham, who had ſervants born in his houſe and bought with his money.—But it is by no means certain, that theſe were ſlaves, as our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are. If they were, it is unaccountable, that he went out at the head of an army of them to fight his enemies. No Weſt-India planter would eaſily be induced to venture himſelf in ſuch a ſituation. It is far more probable, that ſimilar to ſome of the vaſſals under the feudal conſtitution, the ſervants of Abraham were only in a good meaſure dependant on him, and protected by him. But if they were to all intents and purpoſes ſlaves, Abraham's holding of them will no more prove the right of ſlavery, than his going in to Hagar, will prove it right for any man to cohabit with his wench.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the divine permiſſion given the Iſraelites to buy ſervants of the nations round about them, it is argued, that we have a right to buy the Africans and hold them in ſlavery. See Lev. xxv. 44—47. <q>Both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids, which thou ſhalt have, ſhall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them ſhall be buy bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and bondmaids. Moreover, of the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of the ſtrangers that do ſojourn among you, of them ſhall ye buy, and of their families, that are with you, which they begat in your land; and they ſhall be your poſſeſſion. And ye ſhall take them as an inheritance for your children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you, to inherit them for a poſſeſſion; they ſhall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Iſrael ye ſhall not rule one over another with rigour.</q> But if this be at all to the purpoſe, it is a permiſſion to every nation under heaven to buy ſlaves of the nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them: to us, to buy of our Indian neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; to them, to buy of us; to the French, to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023346_0018_0FBF22EB31EBE458"/>
buy of the Engliſh, and to the Engliſh to buy of the French; and ſo through the world. If then this argument be valid, every man has an entire right to engage in this trade, and to buy and ſell any other man of another nation, and any other man of another nation has an entire right to buy and ſell him. Thus according to this conſtruction, we have in Lev. xxv. 43, &amp;c. an inſtitution of an univerſal ſlave-trade, by which every man may not only become a merchant, but may rightfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the merchandize itſelf of this trade, and may be bought and ſold like a beaſt.—Now this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will be given up as abſurd, and therefore alſo the conſtruction of ſcripture from which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, muſt be given up. Yet it is preſumed, that there is no avoiding that conſtruction or the abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity flowing from it, but by admitting, that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Iſraelites to buy ſlaves has no reſpect to us, but was in the ſame manner peculiar to them, as the permiſſion and command to ſubdue, deſtroy and extirpate the whole Canaanitiſh nation; and therefore no more gives countenance to African ſlavery, than the command to extirpate the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites, gives countenance to the extirpation of any nation in theſe days, by an univerſal ſlaughter of men and women, young men and maidens, infants and ſucklings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is further pleaded, that there were ſlaves in the time of the apoſtles; that they did not forbid the holding of thoſe ſlaves, but gave directions to ſervants, doubtleſs referring to the ſervants of that day, to obey <hi>their maſters,</hi> and <hi>count them worthy of all honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the anſwer is, that the apoſtles teach the general duties of ſervants who are righteouſly in the ſtate of ſervitude, as many are or may be, by hire, by indenture, and by judgment of a civil court.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023346_0019_0FBF22F793470B18"/>
But they do not ſay, whether the ſervants in general of that day were juſtly holden in ſlavery or not. In like manner they lay down the general rules of obedience to civil magiſtrates, without deciding concerning the characters of the magiſtrates of the Roman empire in the reign of Nero. And as the apoſtle Paul requires maſters <hi>to give their ſervants that which is juſt and equal,</hi> (Col. iv. 1.) ſo if any were enſlaved unjuſtly, of courſe he in this text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of the maſters of ſuch, to give them their freedom.—Thus the apoſtles treat the ſlavery of that day in the ſame manner that they treat the civil government; and ſay nothing more in favour of the former, than they ſay in favour of the latter.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this argument from the ſlavery prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the days of the apoſtles, if it prove any thing, proves too much, and ſo confutes itſelf. It proves, that we may enſlave all captives taken in war, of any nation, and in any the moſt unjuſt war, ſuch as the wars of the Romans, which were generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken from the motives of ambition or avarice. On the ground of this argument we had a right to enſlave the priſoners, whom we, during the late war, took from the Britiſh army; and they had the ſame right to enſlave thoſe whom they took from us; and ſo with reſpect to all other nations.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is ſtrongly urged, that the Negroes brought from Africa are all captives of war, and therefore are juſtly bought and holden in ſlavery.—This is a principal argument always urged by the advocates for ſlavery; and in a ſolemn debate on this ſubject, it hath been ſtrongly inſiſted on, very lately in the Britiſh parliament. Therefore it requires our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention.</p>
            <p>Captives in a war juſt on their part, cannot be juſtly enſlaved; nor is this pretended. Therefore the captives who may be juſtly enſlaved, muſt be
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023346_0020_0FBF22FC13F9EFF8"/>
taken in a war unjuſt on their part. But even on the ſuppoſition, that captives in ſuch a war may be juſtly enſlaved, it will not follow, that we can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry on the ſlave-trade, as it is commonly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on from the African coaſt. In this trade any ſlaves are purchaſed, who are offered for ſale, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtly or unjuſtly enſlaved. No enquiry is made whether they were captives in any war; much leſs, whether they were captivated in a war unjuſt on their part.</p>
            <p>By the moſt authentic accounts, it appears, that the wars in general in Africa are excited by the proſpect of gain from the ſale of the captives of the war. Therefore thoſe taken by the aſſailants in ſuch wars, cannot be juſtly enſlaved. Beſide theſe, many are kidnapped by thoſe of neighbouring na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſome by their own neighbours; and ſome by their kings or his agents; others for debt or ſome trifling crime are condemned to perpetual ſlavery—But none of theſe are juſtly enſlaved. And the traders make no enquiry concerning the mode or occaſion of their firſt enſlavement. They buy all that are offered, provided they like them and the price.—So that the plea, that the African ſlaves are captives in war, is entirely inſufficient to juſtify the ſlave-trade as now carried on.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; if it were ever ſo true, that all the Negroes exported from Africa were captives in war, and that they were taken in a war unjuſt on their part; ſtill they could not be juſtly enſlaved. —We have no right to enſlave a private foe in a ſtate of nature, after he is conquered. Suppoſe in a ſtate of nature one man riſes againſt another and endeavours to kill him; in this caſe the perſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted has no right to kill the aſſailant, unleſs it be neceſſary to preſerve his own life. But in wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween nations, one nation may no doubt ſecure it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023346_0021_0FBF22FD4FAA0668"/>
againſt another, by other means than the ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of its captives. If a nation be victorious in the war, it may exact ſome towns or a diſtrict of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by way of caution; or it may impoſe a fine to deter from future injuries. If the nation be not victorious, it will do no good to enſlave the captives whom it has taken. It will provoke the victors, and fooliſhly excite vengeance which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.</p>
            <p>Or if neither nation be decidedly victorious, to enſlave the captives on either ſide can anſwer no good purpoſe, but muſt at leaſt occaſion the enſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the citizens of the other nation, who are now, or in future may be in a ſtate of captivity. Such a practice therefore neceſſarily tends to evil and not good.</p>
            <p>Beſides; captives in war are generally common ſoldiers or common citizens; and they are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of the true cauſe or cauſes of the war, and are by their ſuperiours made to believe, that the war is entirely juſt on their part. Or if this be not the caſe, they may by force be compelled to ſerve in a war which they know to be unjuſt. In either of theſe caſes they do not deſerve to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to perpetual ſlavery. To inflict perpetual ſlavery on theſe private ſoldiers and citizens is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſtly not to do, as we would wiſh that men ſhould do to us. If we were taken in a war unjuſt on our part, we ſhould not think it right to be condemned to perpetual ſlavery. No more right is it for us to condemn and hold in perpetual ſlavery others, who are in the ſame ſituation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is argued, that as the Africans in their own country, previouſly to the purchaſe of them by the African traders, are captives in war; if they were not bought up by thoſe traders, they would be put to death: that therefore to purchaſe them and to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023346_0022_0FBF22FEB90C0100"/>
ſubject them to ſlavery inſtead of death, is an act of mercy not only lawful, but meritorious.</p>
            <p>If the caſe were indeed ſo as is now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, the purchaſe of the Negroes would be no more meritorious, than the act of a man, who, if we were taken by the Algerines, ſhould purchaſe us out of that ſlavery. This would indeed be an act of benevolence, if the purchaſer ſhould ſet us at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. But it is no act of benevolence to buy a man out of one ſtate into another no better. Nay, the act of ranſoming a man from death gives no right to the ranſomer to commit a crime or an act of injuſtice to the perſon ranſomed. The perſon ranſomed is doubtleſs obligated according to his ability to ſatisfy the ranſomer for his expence and trouble. Yet the ranſomer has no more right to enſlave the other, than the man who ſaves the life of another who was about to be killed by a robber or an aſſaſſin, has a right to enſlave him.—The li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a man for life is a far greater good, than the property paid for a Negro on the African coaſt. And to deprive a man of an immenſely greater good, in order to recover one immenſely leſs, is an immenſe injury and crime.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As to the pretence, that to prohibit or lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this trade, would be hurtful to our commerce; it is ſufficient to aſk, whether on the ſuppoſition, that it were advantageous to the commerce of Great-Britain to ſend her ſhips to theſe ſtates, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us into perpetual ſlavery in the Weſt-Indies, it would be right that ſhe ſhould go into that trade.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That to prohibit the ſlave trade would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe on the property of thoſe, who have expended large ſums to carry on that trade, or of thoſe who wiſh to purchaſe the ſlaves for their plantations, hath alſo been urged as an argument in favour of the trade.—But the ſame argument would prove,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023346_0023_0FBF230045BB8B68"/>
that if the ſkins and teeth of the Negroes were as valuable articles of commerce as furs and elephant's teeth, and a merchant were to lay out his property in this commerce, he ought by no means to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed therein.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But others will carry on the trade, if we do not.—So others will rob, ſteal and murder, if we do not.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It is ſaid, that ſome men are intended by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be ſlaves.—If this mean, that the author of nature has given ſome men a licence, to enſlave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; this is denied and proof is demanded. If it mean, that God hath made ſome of capacities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to others, and that the laſt have a right to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the firſt; this argument will prove, that ſome of the citizens of every country, have a right to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave other citizens of the ſame country; nay, that ſome have a right to enſlave their own brothers and ſiſters.—But if this argument mean, that God in his providence ſuffers ſome men to be enſlaved, and that this proves, that from the beginning he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ſhould be enſlaved, and made them with this intention; the anſwer is, that in like manner he ſuffers ſome men to be murdered, and in this ſenſe, he intended and made them to be murdered. Yet no man in his ſenſes will hence argue the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of murder.</p>
            <p n="11">11. It is further pretended, that no other men, than Negroes, can endure labour in the hot cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of the Weſt-Indies and the ſouthern ſtates.— But does this appear to be fact? In all other cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, the labouring people are the moſt healthy. And I confeſs I have not yet ſeen evidence, but that thoſe who have been accuſtomed to labour and are inured to thoſe climates, can bear labour there alſo.—However, taking for granted the fact aſſerted in this objection, does it follow, that the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023346_0024_0FBF2301CBC33330"/>
inhabitants of thoſe countries have a right to enſlave the Africans to labour for them? No more ſurely than from the circumſtance, that you are feeble and cannot labour, it follows, that you have a right to enſlave your robuſt neighbour. As in all other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the feeble and thoſe who chooſe not to labour, and yet wiſh to have their lands cultivated, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to hire the robuſt to labour for them; ſo no reaſon can be given, why the inhabitants of hot climates ſhould not either perform their own labour, or hire thoſe who can perform it, whether Negroes or others.</p>
            <p>If our traders went to the coaſt of Africa to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inhabitants, or to rob them of their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all would own that ſuch murderous or piratical practices are wicked and abominable. Now it is as really wicked to rob a man of his liberty, as to rob him of his life; and it is much more wicked, than to rob him of his property. All men agree to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn highway robbery. And the ſlave-trade is as much a greater wickedneſs than highway robbery, as liberty is more valuable than property. How ſtrange is it then, that in the ſame nation highway robbery ſhould be puniſhed with death, and the ſlave-trade be encouraged by national authority.</p>
            <p>We all dread political ſlavery, or ſubjection to the arbitrary power of a king or of any man or men not deriving their authority from the people. Yet ſuch a ſtate is inconceivably preferable to the ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Negroes. Suppoſe that in the late war we had been ſubdued by Great-Britain; we ſhould have been taxed without our conſent. But theſe taxes would have amounted to but a ſmall part of our property. Whereas the Negroes are deprived of all their property; no part of their earnings is their own; the whole is their maſters.—In a conquered ſtate we ſhould have been at liberty to diſpoſe of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023346_0025_0FBF2304B4A8E948"/>
and of our property in moſt caſes, as we ſhould chooſe. We ſhould have been free to live in this or that town or place; in any part of the country, or to remove out of the country; to apply to this or that buſineſs; to labour or not; and excepting a ſufficiency for the taxes, to diſpoſe of the fruit of our labour to our own benefit, or that of our child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, or of any other perſon. But the unhappy Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes in ſlavery can do none of theſe things. They muſt do what they are commanded and as much as they are commanded, on pain of the laſh. They muſt live where they are placed, and muſt confine themſelves to that ſpot, on pain of death.</p>
            <p>So that Great-Britain in her late attempt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave America, committed a very ſmall crime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in compariſon with the crime of thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the Africans.</p>
            <p>The arguments which have been urged againſt the ſlave-trade, are with little variation applicable to the holding of ſlaves. He who holds a ſlave, continues to deprive him of that liberty, which was taken from him on the coaſt of Africa. And if it were wrong to deprive him of it in the firſt inſtance, why not in the ſecond? If this be true, no man hath a better right to retain his Negro in ſlavery, than he had to take him from his native African ſhores. And every man who cannot ſhow, that his Negro hath by his voluntary conduct forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his liberty, is obligated immediately to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numit him. Undoubtedly we ſhould think ſo, were we holden in the ſame ſlavery in which the Negroes are: And our text requires us to do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as we would that they ſhould do to us.</p>
            <p>To hold a ſlave, who has a right to his liberty, is not only a real crime, but a very great one. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good chriſtians have wondered how Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the father of the faithful, could take Hagar to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023346_0026_0FBF22EDEBF0DEF0"/>
his bed; and how Sarah, celebrated as an holy woman, could conſent to this tranſaction: Alſo, how David and Solomon could have ſo many wives and concubines, and yet be real ſaints. Let ſuch inquire how it is poſſible, that our fathers and men now alive, univerſally reputed pious, ſhould hold Negro ſlaves, and yet be the ſubjects of real piety? And whether to reduce a man, who hath the ſame right to liberty as any other man, to a ſtate of abſolute ſlavery, or to hold him in that ſtate, be not as great a crime as concubinage or fornication. I preſume it will not be denied, that to commit theft or robbery every day of a man's life, is as great a ſin as to commit fornication in one inſtance. But to ſteal a man or to rob him of his liberty is a greater ſin, than to ſteal his property, or to take it by violence. And to hold a man in a ſtate of ſlavery, who has a right to his liberty, is to be every day guilty of robbing him of his liberty, or of man-ſtealing. The conſequence is inevitable, that other things being the ſame, to hold a Negro ſlave, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he have forfeited his liberty, is a greater ſin in the ſight of God, than concubinage or fornication.</p>
            <p>Does this concluſion ſeem ſtrange to any of you? Let me entreat you to weigh it candidly before you reject it. You will not deny, that liberty is more valuable than property; and that it is a greater ſin to deprive a man of his whole liberty during life, than to deprive him of his whole property; or that man-ſtealing is a greater crime than robbery. Nor will you deny, that to hold in ſlavery a man who was ſtolen, is ſubſtantially the ſame crime as to ſteal him. Theſe principles being undeniable, I leave it to yourſelves to draw the plain and neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. And if your conſciences ſhall, in ſpite of all oppoſition, tell you, that while you hold your Negroes in ſlavery, you do wrong, exceedingly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023346_0027_0FBF22EEF5643298"/>
wrong; that you do not, as you would that men ſhould do to you; that you commit ſin in the ſight of God; that you daily violate the plain rights of mankind, and that in a higher degree, than if you committed theft or robbery; let me beſeech you not to ſtifle this conviction, but attend to it and act accordingly; leſt you add to your former guilt, that of ſinning againſt the light of truth, and of your own conſciences.</p>
            <p>To convince yourſelves, that your information being the ſame, to hold a Negro ſlave is a greater ſin than fornication, theft or robbery, you need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring the matter home to yourſelves. I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to appeal to your own conſciences, whether you would not judge it to be a greater ſin for a man to hold you or your child during life in ſuch ſlavery, as that of the Negroes, than for him to ſpend one night in a brothel, or in one inſtance to ſteal or rob. Let conſcience ſpeak, and I will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it's deciſion.</p>
            <p>This queſtion ſeems to be clearly decided by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. Exod. xxi. 16. <q>He that ſtealeth a man and ſelleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he ſhall ſurely be put to death.</q> Thus death is, by the divine expreſs declaration, the puniſhment due to the crime of man-ſtealing. But death is not the puniſhment declared by God to be due to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, theft or robbery in common caſes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have the divine authority to aſſert, that man-ſtealing is a greater crime than fornication, theft or robbery. Now to hold in ſlavery a man who has a right to liberty, is ſubſtantially the ſame crime as to deprive him of his liberty. And to deprive of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and reduce to ſlavery, a man who has a right to liberty, is man-ſtealing. For it is immaterial whether he be taken and reduced to ſlavery clan-deſtinely or by open violence. Therefore if the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023346_0028_0FBF22F1300EB048"/>
Negroes have a right to liberty, to hold them in ſlavery is man-ſtealing, which we have ſeen is, by God himſelf, declared to be a greater crime than fornication, theft or robbery.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, though this truth be clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable both from reaſon and revelation, you ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dare receive it, becauſe it ſeems to bear hardly on the characters of our pious fathers, who held ſlaves. But they did it ignorantly and in unbelief of the truth; as Abraham, Jacob, David and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon were ignorant, that polygamy or concubin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was wrong. As to domeſtic ſlavery our fathers lived in a <hi>time of ignorance which God winked at; but now he commandeth all men every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> of this wickedneſs, and <hi>to break off this ſin by righteouſneſs, and this iniquity by ſhewing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthening out of their tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</hi> You therefore to whom the preſent blaze of light as to this ſubject has reached, cannot ſin at ſo cheap a rate as our fathers.</p>
            <p>But methinks I hear ſome ſay, I have bought my Negro; I have paid a large ſum for him; I cannot loſe this ſum, and therefore I cannot manumit him. —Alas! This is <hi>hitting the nail on the head.</hi> This brings into view the true cauſe which makes it ſo difficult to convince men of what is right in this caſe.—You recollect the ſtory of Amaziah's hiring an hundred thouſand men of Iſrael, for an hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red talents, to aſſiſt him againſt the Edomites; and that when by the word of the Lord, he was forbidden to take thoſe hired men with him to the war, he cried out, <q>But what ſhall we do for the hundred talents, which I have given to the army of Iſrael?</q> In this caſe, the anſwer of God was, <q>The Lord is able to give thee much more than this.</q>—To apply this to the ſubject before us, God is able to give thee much more than thou ſhalt loſe by manumitting thy ſlave.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:023346_0029_0FBF230635760900"/>You may plead, that you uſe your ſlave well; you are not cruel to him, but feed and clothe him comfortably, &amp;c. Still every day you rob him of a moſt valuable and important right. And a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way man, who robs a man of his money in the moſt eaſy and complaiſant manner, is ſtill a robber; and murder may be effected in a manner the leaſt cruel and tormenting; ſtill it is murder.</p>
            <p>Having now taken that view of our ſubject, which was propoſed, we may in reflection ſee abundant reaſon to acquieſce in the inſtitution of this ſociety. If the ſlave-trade be unjuſt, and as groſs a violation of the rights of mankind, as would be, if the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans ſhould tranſport us into perpetual ſlavery in Africa; to unite our influence againſt it, is a duty which we owe to mankind, to ourſelves and to God too. It is but doing as we would that men ſhould do to us.—Nor is it enough that we have formed the ſociety; we muſt do the duties of it. The firſt of theſe is to put an end to the ſlave-trade. The ſecond is to relieve thoſe who, contrary to the laws of the country, are holden in bondage. Another is to defend thoſe in their remaining legal and natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al rights, who are by law holden in bondage. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other and not the leaſt important object of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, I conceive to be, to increaſe and diſperſe the light of truth with reſpect to the ſubject of African ſlavery, and ſo prepare the way for its total aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For until men in general are convinced of the injuſtice of the trade and of the ſlavery itſelf, comparatively little can be done to effect the moſt important purpoſes of the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted, that the trade is even now carried on from this ſtate. Veſſels are from time to time fitted out for the coaſt of Africa, to tranſport the Negroes to the Weſt-Indies and other parts. Nor will an end be put to this trade, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023346_0030_0FBF23094FC80230"/>
vigilance and ſtrenuous exertion on the part of this ſociety, or other friends of humanity, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a patient enduring of the oppoſition and odium of all who are concerned in it, of their friends and of all who are of the opinion that it is juſtifiable. Among theſe we are doubtleſs to reckon ſome of large property and conſiderable influence. And if the laws and cuſtoms of the country equally allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, many, and perhaps as many as now plead for the right of the African ſlave-trade, would plead for the right of kidnapping us, the citizens of the United States, and of ſelling us into perpetual ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.—If then we dare not incur the diſpleaſure of ſuch men, we may as well diſſolve the ſociety, and leave the ſlave-trade to be carried on, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes to be kidnapped, and though free in this ſtate, to be ſold into perpetual ſlavery in diſtant parts, at the pleaſure of any man, who wiſhes to make gain by ſuch abominable practices.</p>
            <p>Though we muſt expect oppoſition, yet if we be ſteady and perſevering, we need not fear, that we ſhall fail of ſucceſs. The advantages, which the cauſe has already gained, are many and great. Thirty years ago ſcarcely a man in this country thought either the ſlave-trade or the ſlavery of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes to be wrong. But now how many and able advocates in private life, in our legiſlatures, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, have appeared and have openly and irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gably pleaded the rights of humanity in this as well as other inſtances? Nay, the great body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from New-Hampſhire to Virginia incluſively, have obtained ſuch light, that in all thoſe ſtates the further importation of ſlaves is prohibited by law. And in Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is totally aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>Nor is the light concerning this ſubject confined to America. It hath appeared with great clearneſs
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023346_0031_0FBF2311A07CCD90"/>
in France, and produced remarkable effects in the National Aſſembly. It hath alſo ſhone in bright beams in Great-Britain. It flaſhes with ſplendor in the writings of Clarkſon and in the proceedings of ſeveral ſocieties formed to aboliſh the ſlave-trade. Nor hath it been poſſible to ſhut it out of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh parliament. This light is ſtill increaſing, and in time will effect a total revolution. And if we judge of the future by the paſt, within fifty years from this time, it will be as ſhameful for a man to hold a Negro ſlave, as to be guilty of common robbery or theft. But it is our duty to remove the obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which intercept the rays of this light, that it may reach not only public bodies, but every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual. And when it ſhall have obtained a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpread, ſhall have diſpelled all darkneſs, and ſlavery ſhall be no more; it will be an honour to be recorded in hiſtory, as a ſociety which was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which exerted itſelf with vigour and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to bring about an event ſo neceſſary and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the intereſts of humanity and virtue, to the ſupport of the rights and to the advancement of the happineſs of mankind.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>SOME objections to the doctrine of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſermon, have been mentioned to the author, ſince the delivery of it. Of theſe it may be proper to take ſome notice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſlaves are in a better ſituation than that in which they were in their own country; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they have opportunity to know the Chriſtian religion and to ſecure the ſaving bleſſings of it. Therefore it is not an injury, but a benefit to bring them into this country, even though their importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be accompanied and followed with ſlavery. It is alſo ſaid, that the ſituation of many Negroes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their maſters is much better, than it would be, were they free in this country; that they are much better fed and clothed, and are much more happy; that therefore to hold them in ſlavery is ſo far from a crime, that it is a meritorious act.</p>
            <p>With regard to theſe pleas, it is to be obſerved, that every man hath a right to judge concerning his own happineſs, and to chooſe the means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining or promoting it; and to deprive him of this right is the very injury of which we complain; it is to enſlave him. Becauſe we judge, that the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are more happy in this country, in a ſtate of ſlavery, than in the enjoyment of liberty in Africa, we have no more right to enſlave them and bring them into this country, than we have to enſlave any of our neighbours, who we judge would be more happy under our control, than they are at preſent under their own. Let us make the caſe our own. Should we believe, that we were juſtly treated, if the Africans ſhould carry us into perpetual ſlavery
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023346_0033_0FBF2315316946D8"/>
in Africa, on the ground that they judged, that we ſhould be more happy in that ſtate, than in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation?</p>
            <p>As to the opportunity which the Negroes in this country are ſaid to have, to become acquainted with Chriſtianity; this with reſpect to many is granted: But what follows from it? It would be ridiculous to pretend, that this is the motive on which they act who import them, or they who buy and hold them in ſlavery. Or if this were the motive, it would not ſanctify either the trade or the ſlavery. We are not at liberty to do evil, that good may come; to commit a crime more aggravated than theft or robbery, that we may make a proſelyte to Chriſtianity. Neither our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, nor any one of his apoſtles has taught us this mode of propagating the faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is ſaid, that the doctrine of the preceding ſermon imputes that as a crime to individuals, which is owing to the ſtate of ſociety. This is granted; and what follows? It is owing to the ſtate of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, that our neighbours, the Indians roaſt their captives: and does it hence follow, that ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is not to be imputed to the individual agents as a crime? It is owing to the ſtate of ſociety in Popiſh countries, that thouſands worſhip the beaſt and his image: and is that worſhip therefore not to be imputed as a crime to thoſe, who render it? Read the Revelation of St. John. The ſtate of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is ſuch, that drunkenneſs and adultery are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common in ſome countries; but will it follow, that thoſe vices are innocent in thoſe countries?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If I be ever ſo willing to manumit my ſlave, I cannot do it without being holden to maintain him, when he ſhall be ſick or ſhall be old and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit. Therefore I have a right to hold him as a ſlave.—The ſame argument will prove, that you
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:023346_0034_0FBF231804A38000"/>
have a right to enſlave your children or your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; as you are equally holden to maintain them in ſickneſs and in decrepit old age.—The argument implies, that in order to ſecure the money, which you are afraid the laws of your country will ſome time or other oblige you to pay; it is right for you to rob a free man of his liberty or be guilty of man-ſtealing. On the ground of this argument every town or pariſh obligated by law, to maintain its helpleſs poor, has a right to ſell into perpetual ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all the people, who may probably or even poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly occaſion a public expence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After all, it is not ſafe to manumit the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes: they would cut our throats; they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the peace and government of the ſtate. Or at leaſt they would be ſo idle, that they would not provide themſelves with neceſſaries: of courſe they muſt live by thievery and plundering.</p>
            <p>This objection requires a different anſwer, as it reſpects the northern, and as it reſpects the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſtates. As it reſpects the northern, in which ſlaves are ſo few, there is not the leaſt foundation to imagine, that they would combine or make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection againſt the government; or that they would attempt to murder their maſters. They are much more likely to kill their maſters, in order to obtain their liberty, or to revenge the abuſe they receive, while it is ſtill continued, than to do it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the abuſe hath ceaſed, and they are reſtored to their liberty. In this caſe, they would from a ſenſe of gratitude, or at leaſt from a conviction of the juſtice of their maſters, feel a ſtrong attachment, inſtead of a murderous diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Nor is there the leaſt danger, but that by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vigilance of the ſelect-men, and by a ſtrict ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the laws now exiſting, the Negroes might in a tolerable degree be kept from idleneſs and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:023346_0035_0FBF23190C7335C8"/>All this hath been verified by experiment. In Maſſachuſetts, all the Negroes in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth were by their new conſtitution liberated in a day: and none of the ill conſequences objected fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed either to the commonwealth or to individuals.</p>
            <p>With regard to the ſouthern ſtates, the caſe is different. The Negroes in ſome parts of thoſe ſtates are a great majority of the whole, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the evils objected would, in caſe of a general manumiſſion at once, be more likely to take place. But in the firſt place there is no proſpect, that the conviction of the truth exhibited in the preceding diſcourſe, will at once, take place in the minds of all the holders of ſlaves. The utmoſt that can be expected, is that it will take place gradually in one after another, and that of courſe the ſlaves will be gradually manumitted. Therefore the evils of a general manumiſſion at once, are dreaded without reaſon.</p>
            <p>If in any ſtate the ſlaves ſhould be manumitted in conſiderable numbers at once, or ſo that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of free Negroes ſhould become large; various meaſures might be concerted to prevent the evils feared. One I beg leave to propoſe: That over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of the free Negroes be appointed from among themſelves, who ſhall be empowered to inſpect the morals and management of the reſt, and report to proper authority, thoſe who are vicious, idle or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of managing their own affairs, and that ſuch authority diſpoſe of them under proper maſters for a year or other term, as is done, perhaps in all the ſtates, with regard to the poor white people in like manner vicious, idle or incapable of management. Such black overſeers would naturally be ambitious to diſcharge the duties of their office; they would in many reſpects have much more influence than white men with their country men: and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023346_0036_0FBF231A706F1028"/>
looking forward to the ſame honourable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, would endeavour to deſerve it by their improvement and good conduct.</p>
            <p>But after all, this whole objection, if it were ever ſo entirely founded on truth; if the freed Negroes would probably riſe againſt their maſters, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine againſt government; reſts on the ſame ground, as the apology of the robber, who murders the man whom he has robbed. Says the robber to himſelf, I have robbed this man, and now if I let him go he will kill me, or he will complain to authority and I ſhall be apprehended and hung. I muſt therefore kill him. There is no other way of ſafety for me. —The coincidence between this reaſoning and that of the objection under conſideration, muſt be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to all. And if this reaſoning of the robber be inconcluſive; if the robber have no right on that ground to kill the man whom he hath robbed; neither have the ſlave-holders any more right to continue to hold their ſlaves. If the robber ought to ſpare the life of the man robbed, take his own chance and eſteem himſelf happy, if he can eſcape juſtice; ſo the ſlave-holders ought immediately to let their ſlaves go free, treat them with the utmoſt kindneſs, by ſuch treatment endeavour to pacify them with reſpect to paſt injuries, and eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy, if they can compromiſe the matter in this manner.</p>
            <p>In all countries in which the ſlaves are a majority of the inhabitants, the maſters lie in a great meaſure at the mercy of the ſlaves, and may moſt rationally expect ſooner or later, to be cut off, or driven out by the ſlaves, or to be reduced to the ſame level and to be mingled with them into one common maſs. This I think is by antient and modern e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents demonſtrated to be the natural and neceſſary courſe of human affairs. The hewers of wood and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023346_0037_0FBF231C0204A9A0"/>
drawers of water among the Iſraelites, the Helots among the Lacedemonians, the ſlaves among the Romans, the villains and vaſſals in moſt of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Europe under the feudal ſyſtem, have long ſince mixed with the common maſs of the people, and ſhared the common privileges and honours of their reſpective countries. And in the French Weſt-Indies the Mulattoes and free Negroes are already become ſo numerous and powerful a body, as to be allowed by the National Aſſembly to enjoy the common rights and honours of free men. Theſe facts plainly ſhow, what the whites in the Weſt-Indies and the Southern States are to expect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their poſterity, that it will infallibly be a mungrel breed, or elſe they muſt quit the country to the Negroes whom they have hitherto holden in bondage.</p>
            <p>Thus it ſeems, that they will be neceſſitated by Providence to make in one way or another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to the Negroes for the injury which they have done them. In the firſt caſe, by taking them into affinity with themſelves, giving them their own ſons and daughters in marriage, and making them and their poſterity the heirs of all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and all their honours, and by raiſing their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to a partial whiteneſs, whereby a part at leaſt of that mark which brings on them ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, will be wiped off. In the other caſe, by leaving to them all their real eſtates. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the bare ſtating of the two caſes, that the compenſation in the latter caſe is by much the leaſt. In the former caſe, the compenſation will include all that is included in the latter and much more. If therefore our ſouthern brethren and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Weſt-Indies would balance their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts with their Negro ſlaves, at the cheapeſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible rate, they will doubtleſs judge it prudent, to
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023346_0038_0FBF231D7A24A4C0"/>
leave the country with all their houſes, lands and improvements to their quiet poſſeſſion and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as otherwiſe Providence will compel them to much dearer ſettlement, and one attended with a circumſtance inconceivably more mortifying, than the loſs of all their real eſtates, I mean the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their blood with that of the Negroes into one common poſterity.</p>
            <p>At leaſt it is to be hoped, that theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will induce them to forbear any further import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſlaves, as the more numerous the ſlaves are, the more dangerous they will be, and the more deeply tinged will be the colour of their mulatto poſterity.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted, but that the Negroes in theſe northern ſtates alſo will, in time, mix with the common maſs of the people. But we have this conſolation, that as they are ſo ſmall a proportion of the inhabitants, when mixed with the reſt, they will not produce any very ſenſible diverſity of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
