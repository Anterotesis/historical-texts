            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>MATTHEW VII. 12.</bibl>
                  <p>THEREFORE ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER YOU WOULD, THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM; FOR THIS IS THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS precept of our divine Lord hath always been admired as mo≈øt excellent; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs with the greate≈øt rea≈øon. Yet it needs ≈øome explanation. It is not ≈øurely to be under≈øtood in the mo≈øt unlimited ≈øen≈øe, implying that becau≈øe a prince expects and wi≈øhes for obedience from his ≈øubjects, he is obliged to obey them: that becau≈øe parents wi≈øh their children to ≈øubmit to their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, therefore they are to ≈øubmit to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their children: or that becau≈øe ≈øome men wi≈øh that others would concur and a≈ø≈øi≈øt them to the gratification of their unlawful de≈øires, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they al≈øo are to gratify the unlawful de≈øires of others. But whatever we are con≈øcious, that we ≈øhould, in an exchange of circum≈øtances, wi≈øh, and are per≈øuaded that we might rea≈øonably wi≈øh, that others would do to us; that we are bound to do to them. This is the general rule given us in the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023346_0005_0FBF22CBB3EA0618"/>
text; and a very exten≈øive rule it is, reaching to the whole of our conduct: and is particularly u≈øeful to direct our conduct toward inferiours, and tho≈øe whom we have in our power. I have therefore thought it a proper foundation for the di≈øcour≈øe which by <hi>the Society for the Promotion of Freedom, and for the Relief of Per≈øons unlawfully holden in Bondage,</hi> I have the honour to be appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, on the pre≈øent occa≈øion.</p>
            <p>This divine maxim is mo≈øt properly applicable to the ≈ølave-trade, and to the ≈ølavery of the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. Let us then make the application.</p>
            <p>Should we be willing, that the Africans or any other nation ≈øhould purcha≈øe us, our wives and children, tran≈øport us into Africa and there ≈øell us into perpetual and ab≈øolute ≈ølavery? Should we be willing, that they by large bribes and offers of a gainful traffic ≈øhould entice our neighbours to kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nap and ≈øell us to them, and that they ≈øhould hold in perpetual and cruel bondage, not only our≈øelves, but our po≈øterity through all generations? Yet why is it not as right for them to treat us in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as it is for us to treat them in the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Their colour indeed is different from our's. But does this give us a right to en≈ølave them? The nations from Germany to Guinea have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of every ≈øhade from the faire≈øt white, to a jetty black: and if a black complexion ≈øubject a nation or an individual to ≈ølavery; where ≈øhall ≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very begin? or where ≈øhall it end?</p>
            <p>I propo≈øe to mention a few rea≈øons again≈øt the right of the ≈ølave-trade‚Äîand then to con≈øider the principal arguments, which I have ever heard urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in favour of it.‚ÄîWhat will be ≈øaid again≈øt the ≈ølave-trade will generally be equally applicable to ≈ølavery it≈øelf; and if conclu≈øive again≈øt the former, will be equally conclu≈øive again≈øt the latter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:023346_0006_0FBF22CE342BA2F8"/>As to the ≈ølave-trade, I conceive it to be unju≈øt in it≈øelf‚Äîabominable on account of the cruel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which it is conducted‚Äîand totally wrong on account of the impolicy of it, or its de≈øtructive ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the moral and political intere≈øts of any country.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is unju≈øt in it≈øelf.‚ÄîIt is unju≈øt in the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe, and for the ≈øame rea≈øon, as it is, to ≈øteal, to rob, or to murder. It is a principle, the truth of which hath in this country been generally, if not univer≈øally acknowledged, ever ≈øince the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the late war, <hi>that all men are born equally free.</hi> If this be true, the Africans are by nature equally entitled to freedom as we are; and therefore we have no more right to en≈ølave, or to afford aid to en≈ølave them, than they have to do the ≈øame to us. They have the ≈øame right to their freedom, which they have to their property or to their lives. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to en≈ølave them is as really and in the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe wrong, as to ≈øteal from them, to rob or to murder them.</p>
            <p>There are indeed ca≈øes in which men may ju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be deprived of their liberty and reduced to ≈ølavery; as there are ca≈øes in which they may be ju≈øtly deprived of their lives. But they can ju≈øtly be deprived of neither, unle≈øs they have by their own voluntary conduct forfeited it. Therefore ≈øtill the right to liberty ≈øtands on the ≈øame ba≈øis with the right to life. And that the Africans have done ≈øomething whereby they have forfeited their liberty mu≈øt appear, before we can ju≈øtly deprive them of it; as it mu≈øt appear, that they have done ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereby they have forfeited their lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may ju≈øtly deprive them of the≈øe.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ≈ølave-trade is wicked and abominable on account of the cruel manner in which it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:023346_0007_0FBF22CF71757408"/>Be≈øide the ≈øtealing or kidnapping of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, in the fir≈øt in≈øtance, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtigation of others to this abominable practice; the inhuman manner in which they are tran≈øported to America, and in which they are treated on their pa≈ø≈øage and in their ≈øub≈øequent ≈ølavery, is ≈øuch as ought forever to deter every man from acting any part in this bu≈øine≈øs, who has any regard to ju≈øtice or humanity. They are crowded ≈øo clo≈øely into the holds and between the decks of ve≈ø≈øels, that they have ≈øcarcely room to lie down, and ≈øometimes not room to ≈øit up in an erect po≈øture; the men at the ≈øame time fa≈øtened together with irons by two and two; and all this in the mo≈øt ≈øultry climate. The con≈øequence of the whole is, that the mo≈øt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and fatal di≈øea≈øes are ≈øoon bred among them, whereby va≈øt numbers of tho≈øe exported from Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca peri≈øh in the voyage: others in dread of that ≈ølavery which is before them, and in di≈øtre≈øs and de≈øpair from the lo≈øs of their parents, their children, their hu≈øbands, their wives, all their dear connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their dear native country it≈øelf, ≈øtarve them≈øelves to death or plunge them≈øelves into the ocean. Tho≈øe who attempt in the former of tho≈øe ways to e≈øcape from their per≈øecutors, are tortured by live coals applied to their mouths. Tho≈øe who attempt an e≈øcape in the latter and fail, are equally tortured by the mo≈øt cruel beating, or otherwi≈øe as their per≈øecutors plea≈øe. If any of them make an attempt, as they ≈øometimes do, to recover their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ≈øome, and as the circum≈øtances may be, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are put to immediate death. Others beaten, brui≈øed, cut and mangled in a mo≈øt inhuman and ≈øhocking manner, are in this ≈øituation exhibited to the re≈øt, to terrify them from the like attempt in future: and ≈øome are delivered up to every ≈øpecies of torment, whether by the application of the whip,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023346_0008_0FBF22D233C75F00"/>
or of any other in≈øtrument, even of fire it≈øelf, as the ingenuity of the ≈øhip-ma≈øter and of his crew is able to ≈øugge≈øt or their ≈øituation will admit; and the≈øe torments are purpo≈øely continued for ≈øeveral days, before death is permitted to afford relief to the≈øe objects of vengeance.</p>
            <p>By the≈øe means, according to the common com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, twenty-five thou≈øand, which is a fourth part of tho≈øe who are exported from Africa, and by the conce≈ø≈øion of all, twenty thou≈øand, annually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh, before they arrive at the places of their de≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in America.</p>
            <p>But this is by no means the end of the ≈øufferings of this unhappy people. Bred up in a country ≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneou≈øly yielding the nece≈ø≈øaries and conveniences of ≈øavage life, they have never been accu≈øtomed to labour: of cour≈øe they are but ill prepared to go through the fatigue and drudgery to which they are doomed in their ≈øtate of ≈ølavery. Therefore partly by this cau≈øe, partly by the ≈øcantine≈øs and badne≈øs of their food, and partly from dejection of ≈øpirits, mortification and de≈øpair, another twenty-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand die in the ≈øea≈øoning, as it is called, i. e. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two years of their arrival in America. This I ≈øay is the common computation. Or if we will in this particular be as favourable to the trade as in the e≈øtimate of the number which peri≈øhes on the pa≈ø≈øage, we may reckon the number which dies in the ≈øea≈øoning to be twenty thou≈øand. So that of the hundred thou≈øand annually exported from Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to America, fifty thou≈øand, as it is commonly computed, or on the mo≈øt favourable e≈øtimate, forty thou≈øand, die before they are ≈øea≈øoned to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all. The cruel ≈øufferings of the≈øe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable beings are not yet at an end. Thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023346_0009_0FBF22D911CE9418"/>
they have to drag out a mi≈øerable life in ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ≈ølavery, entirely at the di≈øpo≈øal of their ma≈øters, by whom not only every venial fault, every mere inadvertence or mi≈øtake, but even real virtues, are liable to be con≈øtrued into the mo≈øt atrocious crimes, and puni≈øhed as ≈øuch, according to their caprice or rage, while they are intoxicated ≈øometimes with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, ≈øometimes with pa≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>By the≈øe ma≈øters they are ≈øupplied with barely enough to keep them from ≈øtarving, as the whole expence laid out on a ≈ølave for food, clothing and medicine is commonly computed on an average at thirty ≈øhillings ≈øterling annually. At the ≈øame time they are kept at hard labour from five o'clock in the morning, till nine at night, excepting time to eat twice during the day. And they are con≈øtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the watchful eye of over≈øeers and Negro-drivers more tyrannical and cruel than even their ma≈øters them≈øelves. From the≈øe drivers for every imagined, as well as real neglect or want of exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they receive the la≈øh, the ≈ømack of which is all day long in the ears of tho≈øe who are on the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or in the vicinity; and it is u≈øed with ≈øuch dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and ≈øeverity, as not only to lacerate the ≈økin, but to tear out ≈ømall portions of the fle≈øh at almo≈øt every ≈øtroke.</p>
            <p>This is the general treatment of the ≈ølaves. But many individuals ≈øuffer ≈øtill more ≈øeverely. Many, many are knocked down; ≈øome have their eyes beaten out; ≈øome have an arm or a leg broken, or chopt off; and many for a very ≈ømall or for no crime at all, have been beaten to death merely to gratify the fury of an enraged ma≈øter or over≈øeer.</p>
            <p>Nor ought we on this occa≈øion to overlook the wars among the nations of Africa excited by the trade, or the de≈øtruction attendant on tho≈øe wars. Not to mention the de≈øtruction of property, the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023346_0010_0FBF22DCF9F84560"/>
burning of towns and villages, &amp;c. it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by rea≈øonable computation, that there are annually exported from Africa to the various parts of America, one hundred thou≈øand ≈ølaves, as was before ob≈øerved; that of the≈øe ≈øix thou≈øand are cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of war; that in the wars in which the≈øe are taken, ten per≈øons of the victors and vanqui≈øhed are killed, to one taken; that therefore the taking of the ≈øix thou≈øand captives is attended with the ≈ølaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ≈øixty thou≈øand of their countrymen. Now does not ju≈øtice? does not humanity ≈øhrink from the idea, that in order to procure one ≈ølave to grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ify our avarice, we ≈øhould put to death ten human beings? Or that in order to increa≈øe our property, and that only in ≈øome ≈ømall degree, we ≈øhould carry on a trade, or even connive at it, to ≈øupport which ≈øixty thou≈øand of our own ≈øpecies are ≈ølain in war?</p>
            <p>The≈øe ≈øixty thou≈øand, added to the forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand who peri≈øh on the pa≈ø≈øage and in the ≈øea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, give us an hundred thou≈øand who are annually de≈øtroyed by the trade; and the whole advantage gained by this amazing de≈øtruction of human lives is ≈øixty thou≈øand ≈ølaves. For you will recollect, that the whole number exported from Africa is an hundred thou≈øand; that of the≈øe forty thou≈øand die on the pa≈ø≈øage and in the ≈øea≈øoning, and ≈øixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand are de≈øtroyed in the wars. Therefore while one hundred and ≈øixty thou≈øand are killed in the wars and are exported from Africa, but ≈øixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand are added to the ≈øtock of ≈ølaves.</p>
            <p>Now when we con≈øider all this; when we con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mi≈øeries which this unhappy people ≈øuffer in their wars, in their captivity, in their voyage to America, and during a wretched life of cruel ≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: and e≈øpecially when we con≈øider the annual de≈øtruction of an hundred thou≈øand lives in the manner before mentioned; who can he≈øitate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023346_0011_0FBF22DE8C3DDD88"/>
this trade and the con≈øequent ≈ølavery to be contrary to every principle of ju≈øtice and humanity, of the law of nature and of the law of God?</p>
            <p n="3">III. This trade and this ≈ølavery are utterly wrong on the ground of impolicy. In a variety of re≈øpects they are exceedingly hurtful to the ≈øtate which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerates them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are hurtful, as they deprave the morals of the people.‚ÄîThe ince≈ø≈øant and inhuman cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties practi≈øed in the trade and in the ≈øub≈øequent ≈øla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very nece≈ø≈øarily tend to harden the human heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the tender feelings of humanity in the ma≈øters of ve≈ø≈øels, in the ≈øailors, in the factors, in the proprietors of the ≈ølaves, in their children, in the over≈øeers, in the ≈ølaves them≈øelves, and in all who habitually ≈øee tho≈øe cruelties. Now the eradication or even the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of compa≈ø≈øion, tenderne≈øs and humanity, is certainly a great depravation of heart, and mu≈øt be followed with corre≈øpondent depravity of manners. And mea≈øures which lead to ≈øuch depravity of heart and manners, cannot but be extremely hurtful to the ≈øtate, and con≈øequently are extremely impolitic.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The trade is impolitic as it is ≈øo de≈øtructive of the lives of ≈øeamen. The ingenious Mr. Clark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon hath in a very ≈øatisfactory manner made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that in the ≈ølave-trade alone Great-Britain lo≈øes annually about nineteen hundred ≈øeamen; and that this lo≈øs is more than double to the lo≈øs annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ≈øu≈øtained by Great-Britain in all her other trade taken together. And doubtle≈øs we lo≈øe as many as Great-Britain in proportion to the number of ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom we employ in this trade.‚ÄîNow can it be politic to carry on a trade which is ≈øo de≈øtructive of that u≈øeful part of our citizens, our ≈øeamen?</p>
            <p n="3">3. African ≈ølavery is exceedingly impolitic, as it di≈øcourages indu≈øtry. Nothing is more e≈ø≈øential to the political pro≈øperity of any ≈øtate, than indu≈øtry in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023346_0012_0FBF22E181A6C290"/>
the citizens. But in proportion as ≈ølaves are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, every kind of labour becomes ignominious: and in fact in tho≈øe of the United States, in which ≈ølaves are the mo≈øt numerous, gentlemen and ladies of any fa≈øhion di≈ødain to employ them≈øelves in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs, which in other ≈øtates is con≈øi≈øtent with the dignity of the fir≈øt families and fir≈øt offices. In a country filled with Negro ≈ølaves, labour belongs to them only, and a white man is de≈øpi≈øed in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he applies to it.‚ÄîNow how de≈øtructive to indu≈øtry in all of the lowe≈øt and middle cla≈øs of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, ≈øuch a ≈øituation and the prevalence of ≈øuch ideas will be, you can ea≈øily conceive. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence is, that ≈øome will nearly ≈øtarve, others will betake them≈øelves to the mo≈øt di≈øhone≈øt practices, to obtain the means of living.</p>
            <p>As ≈ølavery produces indolence in the white peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ≈øo it produces all tho≈øe vices which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally connected with it; ≈øuch as intemperance, lewdne≈øs and prodigality. The≈øe vices enfeeble both the body and the mind, and unfit men for any vigorous exertions and employments either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or mental. And tho≈øe who are unfit for ≈øuch exertions, are already a very degenerate race; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, not only in a moral, but a natural ≈øen≈øe. They are contemptible too, and will ≈øoon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpi≈øed even by their Negroes them≈øelves.</p>
            <p>Slavery tends to lewdne≈øs not only as it produces indolence, but as it affords abundant opportunity for that wickedne≈øs without either the danger and difficulty of an attack on the virtue of a woman of cha≈øtity, or the danger of a connection with one of ill fame. A planter with his hundred wenches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him is in ≈øome re≈øpects at lea≈øt like the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in his ≈øeraglio, and we learn the too frequent influence and effect of ≈øuch a ≈øituation, not only from common fame, but from the multitude of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023346_0013_0FBF22E30D82E0A8"/>
mulattoes in countries where ≈ølaves are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous.</p>
            <p>Slavery has a mo≈øt direct tendency to haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs al≈øo, and a domineering ≈øpirit and conduct in the proprietors of the ≈ølaves, in their children, and in all who have the control of them. A man who has been bred up in domineering over Negroes, can ≈øcarcely avoid contracting ≈øuch a habit of haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and domination, as will expre≈øs it≈øelf in his general treatment of mankind, whether in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate capacity, or in any office civil or military with which he may be ve≈øted. De≈øpoti≈øm in economics naturally leads to de≈øpoti≈øm in politics, and dome≈øtic ≈ølavery in a free government is a perfect ≈øoleci≈øm in human affairs.</p>
            <p>How baneful all the≈øe tendencies and effects of ≈ølavery mu≈øt be to the public good, and e≈øpecially to the public good of ≈øuch a free country as our's, I need not inform you.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the ≈øame proportion as indu≈øtry and labour are di≈øcouraged, is population di≈øcouraged and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. This is another re≈øpect in which ≈ølavery is exceedingly impolitic. That population is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in proportion as indu≈øtry is di≈øcouraged, is, I conceive, ≈øo plain that nothing needs to be ≈øaid to illu≈øtrate it. Mankind in general will enter into matrimony as ≈øoon as they po≈ø≈øe≈øs the means of ≈øupporting a family. But the great body of any people have no other way of ≈øupporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves or a family, than by their own labour. Of cour≈øe as labour is di≈øcouraged, matrimony is di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and population is prevented.‚ÄîBut the impolicy of whatever produces the≈øe effects will be acknowledged by all. The wealth, ≈øtrength and glory of a ≈øtate depend on the number of its virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous citizens: and a ≈øtate without citizens is at lea≈øt as great an ab≈øurdity, as a king without ≈øubjects.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:023346_0014_0FBF22E5AC9DD060"/>5. The impolicy of ≈ølavery ≈øtill further appears from this, that it weakens the ≈øtate, and in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the degree in which it exi≈øts, expo≈øes it to become an ea≈øy conque≈øt.‚ÄîThe increa≈øe of free ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens is an increa≈øe of the ≈øtrength of the ≈øtate. But not ≈øo with regard to the increa≈øe of ≈ølaves. They not only add nothing to the ≈øtrength of the ≈øtate, but actually dimini≈øh it in proportion to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Every ≈ølave is naturally an enemy to the ≈øtate in which he is holden in ≈ølavery, and wants nothing but an opportunity to a≈ø≈øi≈øt in its overthrow. And an enemy within a ≈øtate, is much more dangerous than one without it.</p>
            <p>The≈øe ob≈øervations concerning the prevention of population and weakening the ≈øtate, are ≈øupported by facts which have fallen within our own ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That the ≈øouthern ≈øtates, in which ≈ølaves are ≈øo numerous, are in no mea≈øure ≈øo populous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the extent of territory, as the northern, is a fact of univer≈øal notoriety: and that during the late war, the ≈øouthern ≈øtates found them≈øelves greatly weakened by their ≈ølaves, and therefore were ≈øo ea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overrun by the Briti≈øh army, is equally noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>From the view we have now taken of this ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject we ≈øcruple not to infer, that to carry on the ≈ølave-trade and to introduce ≈ølaves into our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is not only to be guilty of inju≈øtice, robbery and cruelty toward our fellow-men; but it is to injure our≈øelves and our country; and therefore it is altogether unju≈øtifiable, wicked and abominable.</p>
            <p>Having thus con≈øidered the inju≈øtice and ruinous tendency of the ≈ølave-trade, I proceed to attend to the principal arguments urged in favour of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is ≈øaid, that the Africans are the po≈øterity of Ham, the ≈øon of Noah; that Canaan one of Ham's ≈øons, was cur≈øed by Noah to be a ≈øervant
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023346_0015_0FBF22E6B746DD18"/>
of ≈øervants; that by Canaan we are to under≈øtand Ham's po≈øterity in general; that as his po≈øterity are devoted by God to ≈ølavery, we have a right to en≈ølave them.‚ÄîThis is the argument: to which I an≈øwer:</p>
            <p>It is indeed generally thought that Ham peopled Africa; but that the cur≈øe on Canaan extended to all the po≈øterity of Ham is a mere imagination. The only rea≈øon given for it is, that Canaan was only one of Ham's ≈øons; and that it ≈øeems rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the cur≈øe of Ham's conduct ≈øhould fall on all his po≈øterity, if on any. But this argument is in≈øufficient. We might as clearly argue, that the judgments denounced on the hou≈øe of David, on account of his ≈øin in the matter of Uriah, mu≈øt equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall on all his po≈øterity. Yet we know, that many of them lived and died in great pro≈øperity. So in every ca≈øe in which judgments are predicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any nation or family.</p>
            <p>It is allowed in this argument, that the cur≈øe was to fall on the <hi>po≈øterity</hi> of Ham, and not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Ham him≈øelf; If otherwi≈øe, it is nothing to the purpo≈øe of the ≈ølave-trade, or of any ≈ølaves now in exi≈øtence. It being allowed then, that this cur≈øe was to fall on Ham's po≈øterity, he who had a right to cur≈øe the whole of that po≈øterity, had the ≈øame right to cur≈øe a part of it only, and the po≈øterity of Canaan equally as any other <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>art; and a cur≈øe on Ham's po≈øterity in the line of Canaan was as real a cur≈øe on Ham him≈øelf, as a cur≈øe on all his po≈øteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would have been.</p>
            <p>Therefore we have no ground to believe, that this cur≈øe re≈øpected any others, than the po≈øterity of Canaan, who lived in the land of Canaan, which is well known to be remote from Africa. We have a particular account, that all the ≈øons of Canaan ≈øettled in the land of Canaan; as may be ≈øeen in
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023346_0016_0FBF22E836193670"/>
Gen. x. 15‚Äî20. <q>And Canaan begat Sidon his fir≈øt born, and Heth, and the Jebu≈øite, and the Emorite, and the Girga≈øite, and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, and the Arvadite, and the Zemorite, and the Hamathite; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward were the families of the Canaanites ≈øpread abroad. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou goe≈øt to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goe≈øt unto Sodom and Gomorrah, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah, and Zeboim, even unto La≈øhah.</q>‚ÄîNor have we account that any of their po≈øterity except the Carthaginians afterward removed to any part of Africa: and none will pretend that the≈øe peopled Africa in general; e≈øpecially con≈øidering, that they were ≈øubdued, de≈øtroyed and ≈øo far extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated by the Romans.</p>
            <p>This cur≈øe then of the po≈øterity of Canaan, had no reference to the inhabitants of Guinea, or of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica in general; but was fulfilled partly in Jo≈øhua's time, in the reduction and ≈øervitude of the Canaan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, and e≈øpecially of the Gibeonites; partly by what the Phenicians ≈øuffered from the Chaldeans, Per≈øians and Greeks; and finally by what the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians ≈øuffered from the Romans.</p>
            <p>Therefore this cur≈øe gives us no right to en≈ølave the Africans, as we do by the ≈ølave-trade, becau≈øe it has no re≈øpect to the Africans whom we en≈ølave. Nor if it had re≈øpected them, would it have given any ≈øuch right; becau≈øe it was not an in≈øtitution of ≈ølavery, but a mere prophecy of it. And from this prophecy we have no more ground to infer the right of ≈ølavery, than we have from the prophecy of the de≈øtruction of Jeru≈øalem by Nebuchadnezzar, or by the Romans, to infer their right re≈øpectively to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy it in the manner they did<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> or from other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies to infer the right of Judas to betray his ma≈øter, or of the Jews to crucify him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:023346_0017_0FBF22E9B67C7898"/>2. The right of ≈ølavery is inferred from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of Abraham, who had ≈øervants born in his hou≈øe and bought with his money.‚ÄîBut it is by no means certain, that the≈øe were ≈ølaves, as our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are. If they were, it is unaccountable, that he went out at the head of an army of them to fight his enemies. No We≈øt-India planter would ea≈øily be induced to venture him≈øelf in ≈øuch a ≈øituation. It is far more probable, that ≈øimilar to ≈øome of the va≈ø≈øals under the feudal con≈øtitution, the ≈øervants of Abraham were only in a good mea≈øure dependant on him, and protected by him. But if they were to all intents and purpo≈øes ≈ølaves, Abraham's holding of them will no more prove the right of ≈ølavery, than his going in to Hagar, will prove it right for any man to cohabit with his wench.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From the divine permi≈ø≈øion given the I≈øraelites to buy ≈øervants of the nations round about them, it is argued, that we have a right to buy the Africans and hold them in ≈ølavery. See Lev. xxv. 44‚Äî47. <q>Both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids, which thou ≈øhalt have, ≈øhall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them ≈øhall be buy bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and bondmaids. Moreover, of the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of the ≈øtrangers that do ≈øojourn among you, of them ≈øhall ye buy, and of their families, that are with you, which they begat in your land; and they ≈øhall be your po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. And ye ≈øhall take them as an inheritance for your children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you, to inherit them for a po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; they ≈øhall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of I≈ørael ye ≈øhall not rule one over another with rigour.</q> But if this be at all to the purpo≈øe, it is a permi≈ø≈øion to every nation under heaven to buy ≈ølaves of the nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them: to us, to buy of our Indian neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; to them, to buy of us; to the French, to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023346_0018_0FBF22EB31EBE458"/>
buy of the Engli≈øh, and to the Engli≈øh to buy of the French; and ≈øo through the world. If then this argument be valid, every man has an entire right to engage in this trade, and to buy and ≈øell any other man of another nation, and any other man of another nation has an entire right to buy and ≈øell him. Thus according to this con≈øtruction, we have in Lev. xxv. 43, &amp;c. an in≈øtitution of an univer≈øal ≈ølave-trade, by which every man may not only become a merchant, but may rightfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the merchandize it≈øelf of this trade, and may be bought and ≈øold like a bea≈øt.‚ÄîNow this con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will be given up as ab≈øurd, and therefore al≈øo the con≈øtruction of ≈øcripture from which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, mu≈øt be given up. Yet it is pre≈øumed, that there is no avoiding that con≈øtruction or the ab≈øurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity flowing from it, but by admitting, that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to the I≈øraelites to buy ≈ølaves has no re≈øpect to us, but was in the ≈øame manner peculiar to them, as the permi≈ø≈øion and command to ≈øubdue, de≈øtroy and extirpate the whole Canaaniti≈øh nation; and therefore no more gives countenance to African ≈ølavery, than the command to extirpate the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites, gives countenance to the extirpation of any nation in the≈øe days, by an univer≈øal ≈ølaughter of men and women, young men and maidens, infants and ≈øucklings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is further pleaded, that there were ≈ølaves in the time of the apo≈øtles; that they did not forbid the holding of tho≈øe ≈ølaves, but gave directions to ≈øervants, doubtle≈øs referring to the ≈øervants of that day, to obey <hi>their ma≈øters,</hi> and <hi>count them worthy of all honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the an≈øwer is, that the apo≈øtles teach the general duties of ≈øervants who are righteou≈øly in the ≈øtate of ≈øervitude, as many are or may be, by hire, by indenture, and by judgment of a civil court.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023346_0019_0FBF22F793470B18"/>
But they do not ≈øay, whether the ≈øervants in general of that day were ju≈øtly holden in ≈ølavery or not. In like manner they lay down the general rules of obedience to civil magi≈øtrates, without deciding concerning the characters of the magi≈øtrates of the Roman empire in the reign of Nero. And as the apo≈øtle Paul requires ma≈øters <hi>to give their ≈øervants that which is ju≈øt and equal,</hi> (Col. iv. 1.) ≈øo if any were en≈ølaved unju≈øtly, of cour≈øe he in this text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of the ma≈øters of ≈øuch, to give them their freedom.‚ÄîThus the apo≈øtles treat the ≈ølavery of that day in the ≈øame manner that they treat the civil government; and ≈øay nothing more in favour of the former, than they ≈øay in favour of the latter.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, this argument from the ≈ølavery prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the days of the apo≈øtles, if it prove any thing, proves too much, and ≈øo confutes it≈øelf. It proves, that we may en≈ølave all captives taken in war, of any nation, and in any the mo≈øt unju≈øt war, ≈øuch as the wars of the Romans, which were generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken from the motives of ambition or avarice. On the ground of this argument we had a right to en≈ølave the pri≈øoners, whom we, during the late war, took from the Briti≈øh army; and they had the ≈øame right to en≈ølave tho≈øe whom they took from us; and ≈øo with re≈øpect to all other nations.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is ≈øtrongly urged, that the Negroes brought from Africa are all captives of war, and therefore are ju≈øtly bought and holden in ≈ølavery.‚ÄîThis is a principal argument always urged by the advocates for ≈ølavery; and in a ≈øolemn debate on this ≈øubject, it hath been ≈øtrongly in≈øi≈øted on, very lately in the Briti≈øh parliament. Therefore it requires our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention.</p>
            <p>Captives in a war ju≈øt on their part, cannot be ju≈øtly en≈ølaved; nor is this pretended. Therefore the captives who may be ju≈øtly en≈ølaved, mu≈øt be
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023346_0020_0FBF22FC13F9EFF8"/>
taken in a war unju≈øt on their part. But even on the ≈øuppo≈øition, that captives in ≈øuch a war may be ju≈øtly en≈ølaved, it will not follow, that we can ju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry on the ≈ølave-trade, as it is commonly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on from the African coa≈øt. In this trade any ≈ølaves are purcha≈øed, who are offered for ≈øale, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ju≈øtly or unju≈øtly en≈ølaved. No enquiry is made whether they were captives in any war; much le≈øs, whether they were captivated in a war unju≈øt on their part.</p>
            <p>By the mo≈øt authentic accounts, it appears, that the wars in general in Africa are excited by the pro≈øpect of gain from the ≈øale of the captives of the war. Therefore tho≈øe taken by the a≈ø≈øailants in ≈øuch wars, cannot be ju≈øtly en≈ølaved. Be≈øide the≈øe, many are kidnapped by tho≈øe of neighbouring na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ≈øome by their own neighbours; and ≈øome by their kings or his agents; others for debt or ≈øome trifling crime are condemned to perpetual ≈ølavery‚ÄîBut none of the≈øe are ju≈øtly en≈ølaved. And the traders make no enquiry concerning the mode or occa≈øion of their fir≈øt en≈ølavement. They buy all that are offered, provided they like them and the price.‚ÄîSo that the plea, that the African ≈ølaves are captives in war, is entirely in≈øufficient to ju≈øtify the ≈ølave-trade as now carried on.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; if it were ever ≈øo true, that all the Negroes exported from Africa were captives in war, and that they were taken in a war unju≈øt on their part; ≈øtill they could not be ju≈øtly en≈ølaved. ‚ÄîWe have no right to en≈ølave a private foe in a ≈øtate of nature, after he is conquered. Suppo≈øe in a ≈øtate of nature one man ri≈øes again≈øt another and endeavours to kill him; in this ca≈øe the per≈øon a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaulted has no right to kill the a≈ø≈øailant, unle≈øs it be nece≈ø≈øary to pre≈øerve his own life. But in wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween nations, one nation may no doubt ≈øecure it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023346_0021_0FBF22FD4FAA0668"/>
again≈øt another, by other means than the ≈ølave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of its captives. If a nation be victorious in the war, it may exact ≈øome towns or a di≈øtrict of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by way of caution; or it may impo≈øe a fine to deter from future injuries. If the nation be not victorious, it will do no good to en≈ølave the captives whom it has taken. It will provoke the victors, and fooli≈øhly excite vengeance which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.</p>
            <p>Or if neither nation be decidedly victorious, to en≈ølave the captives on either ≈øide can an≈øwer no good purpo≈øe, but mu≈øt at lea≈øt occa≈øion the en≈ølav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the citizens of the other nation, who are now, or in future may be in a ≈øtate of captivity. Such a practice therefore nece≈ø≈øarily tends to evil and not good.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides; captives in war are generally common ≈øoldiers or common citizens; and they are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of the true cau≈øe or cau≈øes of the war, and are by their ≈øuperiours made to believe, that the war is entirely ju≈øt on their part. Or if this be not the ca≈øe, they may by force be compelled to ≈øerve in a war which they know to be unju≈øt. In either of the≈øe ca≈øes they do not de≈øerve to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to perpetual ≈ølavery. To inflict perpetual ≈ølavery on the≈øe private ≈øoldiers and citizens is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ife≈øtly not to do, as we would wi≈øh that men ≈øhould do to us. If we were taken in a war unju≈øt on our part, we ≈øhould not think it right to be condemned to perpetual ≈ølavery. No more right is it for us to condemn and hold in perpetual ≈ølavery others, who are in the ≈øame ≈øituation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is argued, that as the Africans in their own country, previou≈øly to the purcha≈øe of them by the African traders, are captives in war; if they were not bought up by tho≈øe traders, they would be put to death: that therefore to purcha≈øe them and to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023346_0022_0FBF22FEB90C0100"/>
≈øubject them to ≈ølavery in≈øtead of death, is an act of mercy not only lawful, but meritorious.</p>
            <p>If the ca≈øe were indeed ≈øo as is now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented, the purcha≈øe of the Negroes would be no more meritorious, than the act of a man, who, if we were taken by the Algerines, ≈øhould purcha≈øe us out of that ≈ølavery. This would indeed be an act of benevolence, if the purcha≈øer ≈øhould ≈øet us at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. But it is no act of benevolence to buy a man out of one ≈øtate into another no better. Nay, the act of ran≈øoming a man from death gives no right to the ran≈øomer to commit a crime or an act of inju≈øtice to the per≈øon ran≈øomed. The per≈øon ran≈øomed is doubtle≈øs obligated according to his ability to ≈øatisfy the ran≈øomer for his expence and trouble. Yet the ran≈øomer has no more right to en≈ølave the other, than the man who ≈øaves the life of another who was about to be killed by a robber or an a≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øin, has a right to en≈ølave him.‚ÄîThe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a man for life is a far greater good, than the property paid for a Negro on the African coa≈øt. And to deprive a man of an immen≈øely greater good, in order to recover one immen≈øely le≈øs, is an immen≈øe injury and crime.</p>
            <p n="7">7. As to the pretence, that to prohibit or lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide this trade, would be hurtful to our commerce; it is ≈øufficient to a≈øk, whether on the ≈øuppo≈øition, that it were advantageous to the commerce of Great-Britain to ≈øend her ≈øhips to the≈øe ≈øtates, and tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us into perpetual ≈ølavery in the We≈øt-Indies, it would be right that ≈øhe ≈øhould go into that trade.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That to prohibit the ≈ølave trade would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe on the property of tho≈øe, who have expended large ≈øums to carry on that trade, or of tho≈øe who wi≈øh to purcha≈øe the ≈ølaves for their plantations, hath al≈øo been urged as an argument in favour of the trade.‚ÄîBut the ≈øame argument would prove,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023346_0023_0FBF230045BB8B68"/>
that if the ≈økins and teeth of the Negroes were as valuable articles of commerce as furs and elephant's teeth, and a merchant were to lay out his property in this commerce, he ought by no means to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructed therein.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But others will carry on the trade, if we do not.‚ÄîSo others will rob, ≈øteal and murder, if we do not.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It is ≈øaid, that ≈øome men are intended by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be ≈ølaves.‚ÄîIf this mean, that the author of nature has given ≈øome men a licence, to en≈ølave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; this is denied and proof is demanded. If it mean, that God hath made ≈øome of capacities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to others, and that the la≈øt have a right to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølave the fir≈øt; this argument will prove, that ≈øome of the citizens of every country, have a right to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølave other citizens of the ≈øame country; nay, that ≈øome have a right to en≈ølave their own brothers and ≈øi≈øters.‚ÄîBut if this argument mean, that God in his providence ≈øuffers ≈øome men to be en≈ølaved, and that this proves, that from the beginning he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ≈øhould be en≈ølaved, and made them with this intention; the an≈øwer is, that in like manner he ≈øuffers ≈øome men to be murdered, and in this ≈øen≈øe, he intended and made them to be murdered. Yet no man in his ≈øen≈øes will hence argue the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs of murder.</p>
            <p n="11">11. It is further pretended, that no other men, than Negroes, can endure labour in the hot cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of the We≈øt-Indies and the ≈øouthern ≈øtates.‚Äî But does this appear to be fact? In all other cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, the labouring people are the mo≈øt healthy. And I confe≈øs I have not yet ≈øeen evidence, but that tho≈øe who have been accu≈øtomed to labour and are inured to tho≈øe climates, can bear labour there al≈øo.‚ÄîHowever, taking for granted the fact a≈ø≈øerted in this objection, does it follow, that the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023346_0024_0FBF2301CBC33330"/>
inhabitants of tho≈øe countries have a right to en≈ølave the Africans to labour for them? No more ≈øurely than from the circum≈øtance, that you are feeble and cannot labour, it follows, that you have a right to en≈ølave your robu≈øt neighbour. As in all other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, the feeble and tho≈øe who choo≈øe not to labour, and yet wi≈øh to have their lands cultivated, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øitated to hire the robu≈øt to labour for them; ≈øo no rea≈øon can be given, why the inhabitants of hot climates ≈øhould not either perform their own labour, or hire tho≈øe who can perform it, whether Negroes or others.</p>
            <p>If our traders went to the coa≈øt of Africa to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inhabitants, or to rob them of their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all would own that ≈øuch murderous or piratical practices are wicked and abominable. Now it is as really wicked to rob a man of his liberty, as to rob him of his life; and it is much more wicked, than to rob him of his property. All men agree to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn highway robbery. And the ≈ølave-trade is as much a greater wickedne≈øs than highway robbery, as liberty is more valuable than property. How ≈øtrange is it then, that in the ≈øame nation highway robbery ≈øhould be puni≈øhed with death, and the ≈ølave-trade be encouraged by national authority.</p>
            <p>We all dread political ≈ølavery, or ≈øubjection to the arbitrary power of a king or of any man or men not deriving their authority from the people. Yet ≈øuch a ≈øtate is inconceivably preferable to the ≈ølave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Negroes. Suppo≈øe that in the late war we had been ≈øubdued by Great-Britain; we ≈øhould have been taxed without our con≈øent. But the≈øe taxes would have amounted to but a ≈ømall part of our property. Whereas the Negroes are deprived of all their property; no part of their earnings is their own; the whole is their ma≈øters.‚ÄîIn a conquered ≈øtate we ≈øhould have been at liberty to di≈øpo≈øe of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023346_0025_0FBF2304B4A8E948"/>
and of our property in mo≈øt ca≈øes, as we ≈øhould choo≈øe. We ≈øhould have been free to live in this or that town or place; in any part of the country, or to remove out of the country; to apply to this or that bu≈øine≈øs; to labour or not; and excepting a ≈øufficiency for the taxes, to di≈øpo≈øe of the fruit of our labour to our own benefit, or that of our child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, or of any other per≈øon. But the unhappy Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes in ≈ølavery can do none of the≈øe things. They mu≈øt do what they are commanded and as much as they are commanded, on pain of the la≈øh. They mu≈øt live where they are placed, and mu≈øt confine them≈øelves to that ≈øpot, on pain of death.</p>
            <p>So that Great-Britain in her late attempt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølave America, committed a very ≈ømall crime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in compari≈øon with the crime of tho≈øe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølave the Africans.</p>
            <p>The arguments which have been urged again≈øt the ≈ølave-trade, are with little variation applicable to the holding of ≈ølaves. He who holds a ≈ølave, continues to deprive him of that liberty, which was taken from him on the coa≈øt of Africa. And if it were wrong to deprive him of it in the fir≈øt in≈øtance, why not in the ≈øecond? If this be true, no man hath a better right to retain his Negro in ≈ølavery, than he had to take him from his native African ≈øhores. And every man who cannot ≈øhow, that his Negro hath by his voluntary conduct forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his liberty, is obligated immediately to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numit him. Undoubtedly we ≈øhould think ≈øo, were we holden in the ≈øame ≈ølavery in which the Negroes are: And our text requires us to do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as we would that they ≈øhould do to us.</p>
            <p>To hold a ≈ølave, who has a right to his liberty, is not only a real crime, but a very great one. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good chri≈øtians have wondered how Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the father of the faithful, could take Hagar to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023346_0026_0FBF22EDEBF0DEF0"/>
his bed; and how Sarah, celebrated as an holy woman, could con≈øent to this tran≈øaction: Al≈øo, how David and Solomon could have ≈øo many wives and concubines, and yet be real ≈øaints. Let ≈øuch inquire how it is po≈ø≈øible, that our fathers and men now alive, univer≈øally reputed pious, ≈øhould hold Negro ≈ølaves, and yet be the ≈øubjects of real piety? And whether to reduce a man, who hath the ≈øame right to liberty as any other man, to a ≈øtate of ab≈øolute ≈ølavery, or to hold him in that ≈øtate, be not as great a crime as concubinage or fornication. I pre≈øume it will not be denied, that to commit theft or robbery every day of a man's life, is as great a ≈øin as to commit fornication in one in≈øtance. But to ≈øteal a man or to rob him of his liberty is a greater ≈øin, than to ≈øteal his property, or to take it by violence. And to hold a man in a ≈øtate of ≈ølavery, who has a right to his liberty, is to be every day guilty of robbing him of his liberty, or of man-≈øtealing. The con≈øequence is inevitable, that other things being the ≈øame, to hold a Negro ≈ølave, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs he have forfeited his liberty, is a greater ≈øin in the ≈øight of God, than concubinage or fornication.</p>
            <p>Does this conclu≈øion ≈øeem ≈øtrange to any of you? Let me entreat you to weigh it candidly before you reject it. You will not deny, that liberty is more valuable than property; and that it is a greater ≈øin to deprive a man of his whole liberty during life, than to deprive him of his whole property; or that man-≈øtealing is a greater crime than robbery. Nor will you deny, that to hold in ≈ølavery a man who was ≈øtolen, is ≈øub≈øtantially the ≈øame crime as to ≈øteal him. The≈øe principles being undeniable, I leave it to your≈øelves to draw the plain and nece≈ø≈øary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence. And if your con≈øciences ≈øhall, in ≈øpite of all oppo≈øition, tell you, that while you hold your Negroes in ≈ølavery, you do wrong, exceedingly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023346_0027_0FBF22EEF5643298"/>
wrong; that you do not, as you would that men ≈øhould do to you; that you commit ≈øin in the ≈øight of God; that you daily violate the plain rights of mankind, and that in a higher degree, than if you committed theft or robbery; let me be≈øeech you not to ≈øtifle this conviction, but attend to it and act accordingly; le≈øt you add to your former guilt, that of ≈øinning again≈øt the light of truth, and of your own con≈øciences.</p>
            <p>To convince your≈øelves, that your information being the ≈øame, to hold a Negro ≈ølave is a greater ≈øin than fornication, theft or robbery, you need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring the matter home to your≈øelves. I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to appeal to your own con≈øciences, whether you would not judge it to be a greater ≈øin for a man to hold you or your child during life in ≈øuch ≈ølavery, as that of the Negroes, than for him to ≈øpend one night in a brothel, or in one in≈øtance to ≈øteal or rob. Let con≈øcience ≈øpeak, and I will ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it's deci≈øion.</p>
            <p>This que≈øtion ≈øeems to be clearly decided by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. Exod. xxi. 16. <q>He that ≈øtealeth a man and ≈øelleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he ≈øhall ≈øurely be put to death.</q> Thus death is, by the divine expre≈øs declaration, the puni≈øhment due to the crime of man-≈øtealing. But death is not the puni≈øhment declared by God to be due to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, theft or robbery in common ca≈øes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have the divine authority to a≈ø≈øert, that man-≈øtealing is a greater crime than fornication, theft or robbery. Now to hold in ≈ølavery a man who has a right to liberty, is ≈øub≈øtantially the ≈øame crime as to deprive him of his liberty. And to deprive of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and reduce to ≈ølavery, a man who has a right to liberty, is man-≈øtealing. For it is immaterial whether he be taken and reduced to ≈ølavery clan-de≈øtinely or by open violence. Therefore if the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023346_0028_0FBF22F1300EB048"/>
Negroes have a right to liberty, to hold them in ≈ølavery is man-≈øtealing, which we have ≈øeen is, by God him≈øelf, declared to be a greater crime than fornication, theft or robbery.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, though this truth be clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrable both from rea≈øon and revelation, you ≈øcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dare receive it, becau≈øe it ≈øeems to bear hardly on the characters of our pious fathers, who held ≈ølaves. But they did it ignorantly and in unbelief of the truth; as Abraham, Jacob, David and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon were ignorant, that polygamy or concubin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was wrong. As to dome≈øtic ≈ølavery our fathers lived in a <hi>time of ignorance which God winked at; but now he commandeth all men every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> of this wickedne≈øs, and <hi>to break off this ≈øin by righteou≈øne≈øs, and this iniquity by ≈øhewing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthening out of their tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</hi> You therefore to whom the pre≈øent blaze of light as to this ≈øubject has reached, cannot ≈øin at ≈øo cheap a rate as our fathers.</p>
            <p>But methinks I hear ≈øome ≈øay, I have bought my Negro; I have paid a large ≈øum for him; I cannot lo≈øe this ≈øum, and therefore I cannot manumit him. ‚ÄîAlas! This is <hi>hitting the nail on the head.</hi> This brings into view the true cau≈øe which makes it ≈øo difficult to convince men of what is right in this ca≈øe.‚ÄîYou recollect the ≈øtory of Amaziah's hiring an hundred thou≈øand men of I≈ørael, for an hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red talents, to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him again≈øt the Edomites; and that when by the word of the Lord, he was forbidden to take tho≈øe hired men with him to the war, he cried out, <q>But what ≈øhall we do for the hundred talents, which I have given to the army of I≈ørael?</q> In this ca≈øe, the an≈øwer of God was, <q>The Lord is able to give thee much more than this.</q>‚ÄîTo apply this to the ≈øubject before us, God is able to give thee much more than thou ≈øhalt lo≈øe by manumitting thy ≈ølave.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:023346_0029_0FBF230635760900"/>You may plead, that you u≈øe your ≈ølave well; you are not cruel to him, but feed and clothe him comfortably, &amp;c. Still every day you rob him of a mo≈øt valuable and important right. And a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way man, who robs a man of his money in the mo≈øt ea≈øy and complai≈øant manner, is ≈øtill a robber; and murder may be effected in a manner the lea≈øt cruel and tormenting; ≈øtill it is murder.</p>
            <p>Having now taken that view of our ≈øubject, which was propo≈øed, we may in reflection ≈øee abundant rea≈øon to acquie≈øce in the in≈øtitution of this ≈øociety. If the ≈ølave-trade be unju≈øt, and as gro≈øs a violation of the rights of mankind, as would be, if the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans ≈øhould tran≈øport us into perpetual ≈ølavery in Africa; to unite our influence again≈øt it, is a duty which we owe to mankind, to our≈øelves and to God too. It is but doing as we would that men ≈øhould do to us.‚ÄîNor is it enough that we have formed the ≈øociety; we mu≈øt do the duties of it. The fir≈øt of the≈øe is to put an end to the ≈ølave-trade. The ≈øecond is to relieve tho≈øe who, contrary to the laws of the country, are holden in bondage. Another is to defend tho≈øe in their remaining legal and natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al rights, who are by law holden in bondage. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other and not the lea≈øt important object of this ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, I conceive to be, to increa≈øe and di≈øper≈øe the light of truth with re≈øpect to the ≈øubject of African ≈ølavery, and ≈øo prepare the way for its total aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For until men in general are convinced of the inju≈øtice of the trade and of the ≈ølavery it≈øelf, comparatively little can be done to effect the mo≈øt important purpo≈øes of the in≈øtitution.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted, that the trade is even now carried on from this ≈øtate. Ve≈ø≈øels are from time to time fitted out for the coa≈øt of Africa, to tran≈øport the Negroes to the We≈øt-Indies and other parts. Nor will an end be put to this trade, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023346_0030_0FBF23094FC80230"/>
vigilance and ≈øtrenuous exertion on the part of this ≈øociety, or other friends of humanity, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a patient enduring of the oppo≈øition and odium of all who are concerned in it, of their friends and of all who are of the opinion that it is ju≈øtifiable. Among the≈øe we are doubtle≈øs to reckon ≈øome of large property and con≈øiderable influence. And if the laws and cu≈øtoms of the country equally allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it, many, and perhaps as many as now plead for the right of the African ≈ølave-trade, would plead for the right of kidnapping us, the citizens of the United States, and of ≈øelling us into perpetual ≈ølave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.‚ÄîIf then we dare not incur the di≈øplea≈øure of ≈øuch men, we may as well di≈ø≈øolve the ≈øociety, and leave the ≈ølave-trade to be carried on, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes to be kidnapped, and though free in this ≈øtate, to be ≈øold into perpetual ≈ølavery in di≈øtant parts, at the plea≈øure of any man, who wi≈øhes to make gain by ≈øuch abominable practices.</p>
            <p>Though we mu≈øt expect oppo≈øition, yet if we be ≈øteady and per≈øevering, we need not fear, that we ≈øhall fail of ≈øucce≈øs. The advantages, which the cau≈øe has already gained, are many and great. Thirty years ago ≈øcarcely a man in this country thought either the ≈ølave-trade or the ≈ølavery of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes to be wrong. But now how many and able advocates in private life, in our legi≈ølatures, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs, have appeared and have openly and irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gably pleaded the rights of humanity in this as well as other in≈øtances? Nay, the great body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from New-Hamp≈øhire to Virginia inclu≈øively, have obtained ≈øuch light, that in all tho≈øe ≈øtates the further importation of ≈ølaves is prohibited by law. And in Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts and New-Hamp≈øhire, ≈ølave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is totally aboli≈øhed.</p>
            <p>Nor is the light concerning this ≈øubject confined to America. It hath appeared with great clearne≈øs
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023346_0031_0FBF2311A07CCD90"/>
in France, and produced remarkable effects in the National A≈ø≈øembly. It hath al≈øo ≈øhone in bright beams in Great-Britain. It fla≈øhes with ≈øplendor in the writings of Clark≈øon and in the proceedings of ≈øeveral ≈øocieties formed to aboli≈øh the ≈ølave-trade. Nor hath it been po≈ø≈øible to ≈øhut it out of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh parliament. This light is ≈øtill increa≈øing, and in time will effect a total revolution. And if we judge of the future by the pa≈øt, within fifty years from this time, it will be as ≈øhameful for a man to hold a Negro ≈ølave, as to be guilty of common robbery or theft. But it is our duty to remove the ob≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which intercept the rays of this light, that it may reach not only public bodies, but every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual. And when it ≈øhall have obtained a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ≈øpread, ≈øhall have di≈øpelled all darkne≈øs, and ≈ølavery ≈øhall be no more; it will be an honour to be recorded in hi≈øtory, as a ≈øociety which was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which exerted it≈øelf with vigour and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to bring about an event ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the intere≈øts of humanity and virtue, to the ≈øupport of the rights and to the advancement of the happine≈øs of mankind.</p>

The ≈ølaves are in a better ≈øituation than that in which they were in their own country; e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they have opportunity to know the Chri≈øtian religion and to ≈øecure the ≈øaving ble≈ø≈øings of it. Therefore it is not an injury, but a benefit to bring them into this country, even though their importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be accompanied and followed with ≈ølavery. It is al≈øo ≈øaid, that the ≈øituation of many Negroes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ma≈øters is much better, than it would be, were they free in this country; that they are much better fed and clothed, and are much more happy; that therefore to hold them in ≈ølavery is ≈øo far from a crime, that it is a meritorious act.</p>
            <p>With regard to the≈øe pleas, it is to be ob≈øerved, that every man hath a right to judge concerning his own happine≈øs, and to choo≈øe the means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining or promoting it; and to deprive him of this right is the very injury of which we complain; it is to en≈ølave him. Becau≈øe we judge, that the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are more happy in this country, in a ≈øtate of ≈ølavery, than in the enjoyment of liberty in Africa, we have no more right to en≈ølave them and bring them into this country, than we have to en≈ølave any of our neighbours, who we judge would be more happy under our control, than they are at pre≈øent under their own. Let us make the ca≈øe our own. Should we believe, that we were ju≈øtly treated, if the Africans ≈øhould carry us into perpetual ≈ølavery
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023346_0033_0FBF2315316946D8"/>
in Africa, on the ground that they judged, that we ≈øhould be more happy in that ≈øtate, than in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent ≈øituation?</p>
            <p>As to the opportunity which the Negroes in this country are ≈øaid to have, to become acquainted with Chri≈øtianity; this with re≈øpect to many is granted: But what follows from it? It would be ridiculous to pretend, that this is the motive on which they act who import them, or they who buy and hold them in ≈ølavery. Or if this were the motive, it would not ≈øanctify either the trade or the ≈ølavery. We are not at liberty to do evil, that good may come; to commit a crime more aggravated than theft or robbery, that we may make a pro≈øelyte to Chri≈øtianity. Neither our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, nor any one of his apo≈øtles has taught us this mode of propagating the faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is ≈øaid, that the doctrine of the preceding ≈øermon imputes that as a crime to individuals, which is owing to the ≈øtate of ≈øociety. This is granted; and what follows? It is owing to the ≈øtate of ≈øoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, that our neighbours, the Indians roa≈øt their captives: and does it hence follow, that ≈øuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is not to be imputed to the individual agents as a crime? It is owing to the ≈øtate of ≈øociety in Popi≈øh countries, that thou≈øands wor≈øhip the bea≈øt and his image: and is that wor≈øhip therefore not to be imputed as a crime to tho≈øe, who render it? Read the Revelation of St. John. The ≈øtate of ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is ≈øuch, that drunkenne≈øs and adultery are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common in ≈øome countries; but will it follow, that tho≈øe vices are innocent in tho≈øe countries?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If I be ever ≈øo willing to manumit my ≈ølave, I cannot do it without being holden to maintain him, when he ≈øhall be ≈øick or ≈øhall be old and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit. Therefore I have a right to hold him as a ≈ølave.‚ÄîThe ≈øame argument will prove, that you
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:023346_0034_0FBF231804A38000"/>
have a right to en≈ølave your children or your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; as you are equally holden to maintain them in ≈øickne≈øs and in decrepit old age.‚ÄîThe argument implies, that in order to ≈øecure the money, which you are afraid the laws of your country will ≈øome time or other oblige you to pay; it is right for you to rob a free man of his liberty or be guilty of man-≈øtealing. On the ground of this argument every town or pari≈øh obligated by law, to maintain its helple≈øs poor, has a right to ≈øell into perpetual ≈ølave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all the people, who may probably or even po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly occa≈øion a public expence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After all, it is not ≈øafe to manumit the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes: they would cut our throats; they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the peace and government of the ≈øtate. Or at lea≈øt they would be ≈øo idle, that they would not provide them≈øelves with nece≈ø≈øaries: of cour≈øe they mu≈øt live by thievery and plundering.</p>
            <p>This objection requires a different an≈øwer, as it re≈øpects the northern, and as it re≈øpects the ≈øouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ≈øtates. As it re≈øpects the northern, in which ≈ølaves are ≈øo few, there is not the lea≈øt foundation to imagine, that they would combine or make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection again≈øt the government; or that they would attempt to murder their ma≈øters. They are much more likely to kill their ma≈øters, in order to obtain their liberty, or to revenge the abu≈øe they receive, while it is ≈øtill continued, than to do it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the abu≈øe hath cea≈øed, and they are re≈øtored to their liberty. In this ca≈øe, they would from a ≈øen≈øe of gratitude, or at lea≈øt from a conviction of the ju≈øtice of their ma≈øters, feel a ≈øtrong attachment, in≈øtead of a murderous di≈øpo≈øition.</p>
            <p>Nor is there the lea≈øt danger, but that by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vigilance of the ≈øelect-men, and by a ≈øtrict ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the laws now exi≈øting, the Negroes might in a tolerable degree be kept from idlene≈øs and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:023346_0035_0FBF23190C7335C8"/>All this hath been verified by experiment. In Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts, all the Negroes in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth were by their new con≈øtitution liberated in a day: and none of the ill con≈øequences objected fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed either to the commonwealth or to individuals.</p>
            <p>With regard to the ≈øouthern ≈øtates, the ca≈øe is different. The Negroes in ≈øome parts of tho≈øe ≈øtates are a great majority of the whole, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the evils objected would, in ca≈øe of a general manumi≈ø≈øion at once, be more likely to take place. But in the fir≈øt place there is no pro≈øpect, that the conviction of the truth exhibited in the preceding di≈øcour≈øe, will at once, take place in the minds of all the holders of ≈ølaves. The utmo≈øt that can be expected, is that it will take place gradually in one after another, and that of cour≈øe the ≈ølaves will be gradually manumitted. Therefore the evils of a general manumi≈ø≈øion at once, are dreaded without rea≈øon.</p>
            <p>If in any ≈øtate the ≈ølaves ≈øhould be manumitted in con≈øiderable numbers at once, or ≈øo that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of free Negroes ≈øhould become large; various mea≈øures might be concerted to prevent the evils feared. One I beg leave to propo≈øe: That over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeers of the free Negroes be appointed from among them≈øelves, who ≈øhall be empowered to in≈øpect the morals and management of the re≈øt, and report to proper authority, tho≈øe who are vicious, idle or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of managing their own affairs, and that ≈øuch authority di≈øpo≈øe of them under proper ma≈øters for a year or other term, as is done, perhaps in all the ≈øtates, with regard to the poor white people in like manner vicious, idle or incapable of management. Such black over≈øeers would naturally be ambitious to di≈øcharge the duties of their office; they would in many re≈øpects have much more influence than white men with their country men: and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023346_0036_0FBF231A706F1028"/>
looking forward to the ≈øame honourable di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, would endeavour to de≈øerve it by their improvement and good conduct.</p>
            <p>But after all, this whole objection, if it were ever ≈øo entirely founded on truth; if the freed Negroes would probably ri≈øe again≈øt their ma≈øters, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine again≈øt government; re≈øts on the ≈øame ground, as the apology of the robber, who murders the man whom he has robbed. Says the robber to him≈øelf, I have robbed this man, and now if I let him go he will kill me, or he will complain to authority and I ≈øhall be apprehended and hung. I mu≈øt therefore kill him. There is no other way of ≈øafety for me. ‚ÄîThe coincidence between this rea≈øoning and that of the objection under con≈øideration, mu≈øt be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt to all. And if this rea≈øoning of the robber be inconclu≈øive; if the robber have no right on that ground to kill the man whom he hath robbed; neither have the ≈ølave-holders any more right to continue to hold their ≈ølaves. If the robber ought to ≈øpare the life of the man robbed, take his own chance and e≈øteem him≈øelf happy, if he can e≈øcape ju≈øtice; ≈øo the ≈ølave-holders ought immediately to let their ≈ølaves go free, treat them with the utmo≈øt kindne≈øs, by ≈øuch treatment endeavour to pacify them with re≈øpect to pa≈øt injuries, and e≈øteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves happy, if they can compromi≈øe the matter in this manner.</p>
            <p>In all countries in which the ≈ølaves are a majority of the inhabitants, the ma≈øters lie in a great mea≈øure at the mercy of the ≈ølaves, and may mo≈øt rationally expect ≈øooner or later, to be cut off, or driven out by the ≈ølaves, or to be reduced to the ≈øame level and to be mingled with them into one common ma≈øs. This I think is by antient and modern e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents demon≈øtrated to be the natural and nece≈ø≈øary cour≈øe of human affairs. The hewers of wood and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023346_0037_0FBF231C0204A9A0"/>
drawers of water among the I≈øraelites, the Helots among the Lacedemonians, the ≈ølaves among the Romans, the villains and va≈ø≈øals in mo≈øt of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Europe under the feudal ≈øy≈øtem, have long ≈øince mixed with the common ma≈øs of the people, and ≈øhared the common privileges and honours of their re≈øpective countries. And in the French We≈øt-Indies the Mulattoes and free Negroes are already become ≈øo numerous and powerful a body, as to be allowed by the National A≈ø≈øembly to enjoy the common rights and honours of free men. The≈øe facts plainly ≈øhow, what the whites in the We≈øt-Indies and the Southern States are to expect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their po≈øterity, that it will infallibly be a mungrel breed, or el≈øe they mu≈øt quit the country to the Negroes whom they have hitherto holden in bondage.</p>
            <p>Thus it ≈øeems, that they will be nece≈ø≈øitated by Providence to make in one way or another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øation to the Negroes for the injury which they have done them. In the fir≈øt ca≈øe, by taking them into affinity with them≈øelves, giving them their own ≈øons and daughters in marriage, and making them and their po≈øterity the heirs of all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and all their honours, and by rai≈øing their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to a partial whitene≈øs, whereby a part at lea≈øt of that mark which brings on them ≈øo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, will be wiped off. In the other ca≈øe, by leaving to them all their real e≈øtates. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt by the bare ≈øtating of the two ca≈øes, that the compen≈øation in the latter ca≈øe is by much the lea≈øt. In the former ca≈øe, the compen≈øation will include all that is included in the latter and much more. If therefore our ≈øouthern brethren and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the We≈øt-Indies would balance their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts with their Negro ≈ølaves, at the cheape≈øt po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible rate, they will doubtle≈øs judge it prudent, to
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023346_0038_0FBF231D7A24A4C0"/>
leave the country with all their hou≈øes, lands and improvements to their quiet po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as otherwi≈øe Providence will compel them to much dearer ≈øettlement, and one attended with a circum≈øtance inconceivably more mortifying, than the lo≈øs of all their real e≈øtates, I mean the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their blood with that of the Negroes into one common po≈øterity.</p>
            <p>At lea≈øt it is to be hoped, that the≈øe con≈øiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will induce them to forbear any further import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ≈ølaves, as the more numerous the ≈ølaves are, the more dangerous they will be, and the more deeply tinged will be the colour of their mulatto po≈øterity.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted, but that the Negroes in the≈øe northern ≈øtates al≈øo will, in time, mix with the common ma≈øs of the people. But we have this con≈øolation, that as they are ≈øo ≈ømall a proportion of the inhabitants, when mixed with the re≈øt, they will not produce any very ≈øen≈øible diver≈øity of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
