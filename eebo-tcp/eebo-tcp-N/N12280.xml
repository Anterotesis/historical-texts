            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS many ſoldiers, lately inliſted in the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental Army, not content with the generous bounties and encouragements granted to them by Congreſs, but influenced by a baſe regard to their intereſt, have reinliſted with, received bounties from, other Officers, and then deſerted. And whereas, it is preſumed that many, fully ſenſible of the enormity of their crimes, would return to their duty, were they not deterred by an apprehenſion of ſuffering the ſevere puniſhment lately inflicted on thoſe found guilty of deſertion—I HAVE thought proper to iſſue this my Proclamation, offering free pardon to all thoſe above deſcribed, as well as to thoſe who have deſerted from other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who ſhall voluntarily ſurrender themſelves to any Officer in the Continental Army, or join their reſpective corps, before the fifteenth day of May next. And I do ſtrictly enjoin all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in the army under my command, and entreat the good people of theſe States, to uſe their utmoſt endeavours to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and ſecure ſuch deſerters as ſhall not avail themſelves of the indulgence offered by this Proclamation.</p>

            <head>The <hi>American</hi> CRISIS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN the progreſs of politics, as in the common occurrences of life, we are not only apt to forget the ground we have travelled over, but frequently neglect to gather up experience as we go. We expend, if I may ſo ſay, the knowledge of every day on the circumſtances that produce it, and journey on in ſearch of new matter and new refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But as it is pleaſant, and ſometimes uſeful, to look back, even to the firſt periods of infancy, and trace the turns and windings through which we have paſſed, ſo we may likewiſe derive many advantages by halting a while in our political career, and taking a review of the wondrous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated labyrinth of little more than yeſterday.</p>
            <p>TRULY, may we ſay, that never did man grow old in ſo ſhort a time! We have crouded the buſineſs of an age into the compaſs of a few months, and have been driven through ſuch a rapid ſucceſſion of things, that, for the want of leiſure to think, we unavoidably waſted knowledge as we came, and have left nearly as much behind us as we brought with us: But the road is yet rich with the fragments, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we fully loſe ſight of them, will repay us for the trouble of ſtopping to pick them up.</p>
            <p>WERE a man to be totally deprived of memory, he would be incapable of forming any juſt opinion; every thing about him would ſeem a chaos; he would have even his own hiſtory to aſk from every one; and by not knowing how the world went on in his abſence, he would be at a loſs to know how it <hi>ought</hi> to go on when he recovered, or rather, returned to it again. In like manner, tho' in a leſs degree, a too great inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to paſt occurrences retards and bewilders our judgment in every thing; while, on the contrary, by comparing what is paſt with what is preſent, we frequently hit on the true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of both, and become wiſe with very little trouble. It
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015494_0004_0F998663A07B1810"/>
is a kind of countermarch, by which we get into the rear of Time, and mark the movements and meaning of things as we make our return. There are certain circumſtances, which, at the time of their happening, are kind of riddles, and as every riddle is to be followed by its anſwer, ſo thoſe kind of circumſtances will be followed by their events, and thoſe events are always the true ſolution. A conſiderable ſpace of time may lapſe between, and unleſs we continue our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations from the one to the other, the harmony of them will paſs away unnoticed: But the misfortune is, that partly from the preſſing neceſſity of ſome inſtant things, and partly from the impatience of our own tempers, we are frequently in ſuch a hurry to make out the meaning of every thing as faſt as it happens, that we thereby never truly underſtand it; and not only ſtart new difficulties to ourſelves by ſo doing, but, as it were, embarraſs Providence in her good deſigns.</p>
            <p>I have been civil in ſtating this fault on a large ſcale, for, as it now ſtands, it does not appear to be levelled againſt any particular ſet of men; but were it to be refined a little farther, it might afterwards be applied to the Tories with a degree of ſtriking propriety: Thoſe men have been remarkable for drawing ſudden concluſions from ſingle facts. The leaſt apparent miſhap on our ſide, or the leaſt ſeeming advantage on the part of the enemy, have determined with them the fate of a whole campaign. By this haſty judgment they have converted a retreat into a defeat; miſtook general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for error; while every little advantage purpoſely given the enemy, either to weaken their ſtrength by dividing it, embarraſs their councils by multiplying their objects, or to ſecure a greater poſt by the ſurrender of a leſs, has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly magnified into a conqueſt. Thus, by quartering ill policy upon ill principles, they have frequently promoted the cauſe they deſigned to injure, and injured that which they intended to promote.</p>
            <p>IT is probable the campaign may open before this Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber comes from the preſs. The enemy have long lain idle and amuſed themſelves with carrying on the war by procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations only. While they continue their delay our ſtrength encreaſes, and were they to move to action now, it is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial proof they have no reinforcement coming; wherefore, in either caſe, the comparative advantage will be
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015494_0005_0F998665F2D296F0"/>
ours. Like a wounded diſabled whale they want only time and room to die in; and though in the agony of their exit, it may be unſafe to live within the flapping of their tail, yet every hour ſhortens their date and leſſens their power of miſchief. If any thing happens while this Number is in the preſs, it will afford me a ſubject for the laſt pages of it. At preſent I am tired of waiting; and as neither the enemy, nor the ſtate of politics, have <hi>yet</hi> produced any thing new, I am thereby left in the field of general matter undirected by any ſtriking or particular object. This Criſis, therefore, will be made up rather of variety than novelty, and conſiſt more of things uſeful than things wonderful.</p>
            <p>THE ſucceſs of the cauſe, the union of the people, and the means of ſupporting and ſecuring both, are points which cannot be too much attended to. He who doubts of the former is a deſponding coward, and he who wilfully diſturbs the latter is a traitor. Their characters are eaſily fixt, and under theſe ſhort deſcriptions I leave them for the preſent.</p>
            <p>ONE of the greateſt degrees of ſentimental union which America ever knew, was in denying the right of the Britiſh parliament <hi>"to bind the Colonies in all caſes whatever."</hi> The declaration is in its form an almighty one, and is the loftieſt ſtretch of arbitrary power that ever one ſet of men, or one country claimed over another. Taxation was nothing more than the putting the declared right into practice; and this failing, recourſe was had to arms, as a means to eſtabliſh both the right <hi>and</hi> the practice, or to anſwer a worſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which will be mentioned in the courſe of this Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And in order to repay themſelves the expence of an army, and to profit by their own injuſtice, the Colonies were, by another law, declared to be in a ſtate of actual rebellion, and of conſequence all property therein would fall to the conquerors.</p>
            <p>THE Colonies, on their part, FIRST, denied the right; SECONDLY, they ſuſpended the uſe of taxable articles, and petitioned againſt the practice of taxation: and theſe failing, they, THIRDLY, defended their property by force, as ſoon as it was forcibly invaded, and in anſwer to the declaration of rebellion and non-protection <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>bliſhed their declaration of Independence and right to ſelf-protection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:015494_0006_0F998666E22A79A8"/>THESE, in a few words, are the different ſtages of the quarrel; and the parts are ſo intimately and neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with each other as to admit of no ſeparation. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to uſe a trite phraſe, muſt be a Whig or a Tory in the lump. His feelings, as a man, may be wounded; his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as a Chriſtian, may be moved; but his political prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples muſt go through all the caſes on one ſide or the other. He cannot be a Whig in <hi>this</hi> ſtage, and a Tory in <hi>that.</hi> If he ſays he is againſt the United Independence of the Continent, he is to all intents and purpoſes againſt her in all the reſt; becauſe THIS LAST comprehends the whole. And he may juſt as well ſay, that Britain was right in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring us rebels; right in taxing us; and right in declare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her <hi>"right to bind the Colonies in all caſes whatſoever."</hi> It ſignifies nothing what neutral ground, of his own create<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he may ſkulk upon for ſhelter, for the quarrel in no ſtage of it hath afforded any ſuch ground; and either we or Britain are abſolutely right or abſolutely wrong through the whole.</p>
            <p>BRITAIN, like a gameſter nearly ruined, hath now put all her loſſes into one bet, and is playing a deſperate game for the total. If ſhe win it, ſhe wins from <hi>me</hi> my life; ſhe wins the Continent as the forfeited property of rebels; the right of taxing thoſe that are left as reduced ſubjects; and the power of binding them as ſlaves: And the ſingle die which determines this unparalleled event is, Whether we ſupport our Independence or ſhe overturn it. This is coming to the point at once. Here is the touch-ſtone to try men by. <hi>He that is not a ſupporter of the Independent States of America, in the ſame degree that his religious and political prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples would ſuffer him to ſupport the government of any other country, of which he called himſelf a ſubject, is, in the American ſenſe of the word,</hi> A TORY; <hi>and the inſtant that he endeavours to bring his Toryiſm into practice, he becomes</hi> A TRAITOR. The firſt can only be detected by a general teſt, and the law hath already provided for the latter.</p>
            <p>IT is unnatural and impolitic to admit men who would root up our Independence to have any ſhare in our legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either as electors or repreſentatives; becauſe the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our Independence reſts in a great meaſure on the
<pb facs="unknown:015494_0007_0F99866765EE3C50"/>
vigour and purity of our public bodies. Would Britain, even in time of peace, much leſs in war, ſuffer an election to be carried by men who profeſſed themſelves not to be her ſubjects, or allow ſuch to ſit in parliament? Certainly not.</p>
            <p>BUT there are a certain ſpecies of Tories with whom conſcience or principle hath nothing to do, and who are ſo from avarice only. Some of the firſt fortunes in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, on the part of the Whigs, are ſtaked on the iſſue of our preſent meaſures. And ſhall diſaffection only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with ſecurity? Can any thing be a greater induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a miſerly man, than the hope of making his mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſafe? And though the ſcheme be fraught with every character of folly, yet, ſo long as he ſuppoſes, that by doing nothing materially criminal againſt America on one part, and by expreſſing his private diſapprobation againſt Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, as a palliative with the enemy on the other part, he ſtands thereby in a ſafe line between both, while, I ſay, this ground be ſuffered to remain, craft and the ſpirit of avarice will point it out, and men will not be wanting to fill up this moſt contemptible of all characters.</p>
            <p>THESE men, aſhamed to own the fordid cauſe from whence their diſaffection ſprings, add thereby meanneſs to meanneſs, by endeavouring to ſhelter themſelves under the maſk of hypocriſy; that is, they had rather be thought to be Tories from <hi>ſome kind of principle,</hi> than Tories by having <hi>no principle at all.</hi> But till ſuch time as they can ſhow ſome real reaſon, natural, political or conſcientious, on which their odjections to Independence are founded, we are not obliged to give them credit for being Tories of the firſt ſtamp, but muſt ſet them down as Tories of the laſt.</p>
            <p>IN the Second Number of the Criſis I endeavoured to ſhow the impoſſibility of the enemy making any conqueſt of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; that nothing was wanting on our part but patience and perſeverance, and that, with theſe virtues, our ſucceſs, as far as human ſpeculation could diſcern, ſeemed as certain as fate. But as there are many among us, who, influenced by others, have regularly gone back from the principles they once held, in proportion as we have gone forward; and as it is the unfortunate lot of many a good man to live within
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015494_0008_0F99866829577348"/>
the neighbourhood of diſaffected ones; I ſhall therefore, for the ſake of confirming the one and recovering the other, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, in the ſpace of a page or two, to go over ſome of the leading principles in ſupport of Independence. It is a much pleaſanter taſk to prevent vice than to puniſh it; and however our tempers may be gratified by reſentment, or our national expences eaſed by forfeited eſtates, harmony and friendſhip is nevertheleſs the happieſt condition a country can be bleſt with.</p>
            <p>THE principal arguments in ſupport of Independence may be comprehended under the four following heads,
<list>
                  <item>FIRST,—The natural right of the Continent to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence.</item>
                  <item>SECONDLY,—Her intereſt in being independent.</item>
                  <item>THIRDLY,—The neceſſity.—And</item>
                  <item>FOURTHLY,—The moral advantages ariſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. THE NATURAL RIGHT of the Continent to Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, is a point which never yet was called in queſtion. It will not even admit of a debate. To deny ſuch a right, would be a kind of atheiſm againſt nature: And the beſt anſwer to ſuch an objection would be, <hi>"The fool hath ſaid in his heart, There is no God."</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. THE INTEREST of the Continent in being inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent is a point as clearly right as the former. America, by her own internal induſtry, and unknown to all the powers of Europe, was at the beginning of the diſpute, arrived at a pitch of greatneſs, trade and population, beyond which it was the intereſt of Britain not to ſuffer her to paſs, leſt ſhe ſhould grow too powerful to be kept ſubordinate. She began to view this country with the ſame uneaſy malicious eye, with which a covetous guardian would view his ward whoſe eſtate he had been enriching himſelf by for twenty years, and ſaw him juſt arriving at manhood. And America owes no more to Britain for her preſent maturity, than the ward would to his guardian for being twenty-one years of age. That America hath flouriſhed <hi>at the time</hi> ſhe was under the government of Britain, is true; but there is every natural
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015494_0009_0F998668ECD55B20"/>
reaſon to believe, that had ſhe been an independent country from the firſt ſettlement thereof, uncontrouled by any foreign power, free to make her own laws, regulate and encourage her own commerce, ſhe had by this time been of much greater worth than now. The caſe is ſimply this, The firſt ſettlers in the different Colonies were left to ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, unnoticed and unſupported by any European govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but as the tyranny and perſecution of the old world daily drove numbers to the new, and, as by the favour of Heaven on their induſtry and perſeverance, they grew into importance, ſo, in a like degree, they became an object of profit to the greedy eyes of Europe. It was impoſſible in this ſtate of infancy, however thriving and promiſing, that they could reſiſt the power of any armed invader that ſhould ſeek to bring them under his authority. In this ſituation Britain thought it worth her while to claim them, and the Continent received and acknowledged the claimer. It was, in reality, of no very great importance who was her maſter, ſeeing, that from the force and ambition of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent powers of Europe ſhe muſt, till ſhe acquired ſtrength enough to aſſert her own right, acknowledge ſome one. As well, perhaps, Britain as another; and it might have been as well to have been under the States of Holland as any. The ſame hopes of engroſſing and profiting by her trade, by not oppreſſing it too much, would have operated alike with any maſter, and produced to the Colonies the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. The clamor of protection, likewiſe, was all a farce; becauſe, in order to make <hi>that</hi> protection neceſſary, ſhe muſt firſt, by her own quarrels create us enemies. Hard terms, indeed!</p>
            <p>TO know whether it be the intereſt of the Continent to be independent, we need only aſk this eaſy, ſimple queſtion: Is it the intereſt of a man to be a boy all his life? The anſwer to one will be the anſwer to both. America hath been one continued ſcene of legiſlative contention from the firſt king's repreſentative to the laſt; and this was unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably founded in the natural oppoſition of intereſt between the old country and the new. A governor ſent from England, or receiving his authority therefrom, ought never to have been conſidered in any other light than that of a genteel commiſſioned ſpy, whoſe private buſineſs was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:015494_0010_0F998669A08CAFF8"/>
and his public buſineſs a kind of civilized op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. In the firſt of theſe characters he was to watch the tempers, ſentiments and diſpoſition of the people, the growth of trade, and the encreaſe of private fortunes; and in the latter, to ſuppreſs all ſuch acts of the Aſſemblies, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beneficial to the people, which did not directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly throw ſome encreaſe of power or profit into the hands of thoſe who ſent him.</p>
            <p>AMERICA, till now, could never be called a <hi>free country,</hi> becauſe her legiſlation depended on the will of a man three thouſand miles diſtant, whoſe intereſt was in oppoſition to ours, and who, by a ſingle "NO," could forbid what law he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>THE freedom of trade, likewiſe, is, to a trading country, an article of ſuch vaſt importance, that the principal ſource of wealth depends upon it; and it is impoſſible that any country can flouriſh, as it otherwiſe might do, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is engroſſed, cramped and fettered by the laws and mandates of another—yet theſe evils, and more than I can here enumerate, the Continent has ſuffered by being under the government of Great-Britain. By an Independence we clear the whole at once—put an end to the buſineſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered petitions and fruitleſs remonſtrances—exchange Britain for Europe—ſhake hands with the world—live at peace with mankind—and trade to any market where we beſt can buy and ſell.</p>
            <p n="3">III. THE NECESSITY, likewiſe, of being independent, even before it was declared, became ſo evident and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, that the Continent ran the riſk of being ruined every day ſhe delayed it. There were reaſons to believe that Britain would endeavour to make a European matter of it, and rather than loſe the whole, would diſmember it like Poland, and diſpoſe of her ſeveral claims to the higheſt bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Genoa, failing in her attempts to reduce Corſica, made a ſale of it to the French, and ſuch traffics have been common in the old world. We had at that time no Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in any part of Europe, to counteract her negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and by that means ſhe had the range of every foreign Court uncontradicted on our part. We even knew nothing
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015494_0011_0F99866A675F2D88"/>
of the treaty for the Heſſians till it was concluded, and the troops ready to embark. Had we been independent before, we had probably prevented her obtaining them. We had no credit abroad, becauſe of our rebellious dependency. Our ſhips could claim no protection in foreign ports, becauſe we afforded them no juſtifiable reaſon for granting it to us. The calling ourſelves ſubjects, and at the ſame time fighting againſt the power we acknowledged, was a dangerous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to all Europe. If the grievances juſtified our taking up arms, they juſtified our ſeparation; if they did not juſtify our ſeparation, neither could they juſtify our taking up arms. All Europe was intereſted in reducing us as rebels, and all Europe (or the greateſt part at leaſt) is intereſted in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting us as Independent States. At home our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was ſtill worſe: Our currency had no foundation, and the fall of it would have ruined Whig and Tory alike. We had no other law than a kind of moderated paſſion; no other civil power than an honeſt mob; and no other protection than the temporary attachment of one man to another. Had Independence been delayed a few months longer, this Continent would have been plunged into irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable confuſion: Some violent for it, ſome againſt it, till in the general cabal the rich would have been ruined, and the poor deſtroyed. It is to Independence that every Tory owes the preſent ſafety he lives in; for by <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>that only,</hi> we emerged from a ſtate of dangerous ſuſpenſe, and became a regular people.</p>
            <p>THE neceſſity likewiſe of being independent, had there been no rupture between Britain and America, would in a little time have brought one on. The encreaſing importance of commerce, the weight and perplexity of legiſlation, and the entangled ſtate of European politics, would daily have ſhewn to the Continent the impoſſibility of continuing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate; for, after the cooleſt reflections on the matter, <hi>this muſt</hi> be allowed, that Britain was too jealous of America, to govern it juſtly; too ignorant of it, to govern it well; and too diſtant from it, to govern it at all.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. BUT, what weigh moſt with all men of ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection are the MORAL ADVANTAGES ariſing from Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence: War and deſolation are become the trades of the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015494_0012_0F99866B24B35320"/>
old world; and America neither could, nor can be under the government of Britain without becoming a ſharer of her guilt, and a partner in all the diſmal commerce of death. The ſpirit of duelling, extended on a national ſcale, is a proper character for European wars. They have ſeldom any other motive than pride, or any other object than fame. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors and the conquered are generally ruined alike, and the chief difference at laſt is, that the one marches home with his honours, and the other without them. 'Tis the natural temper of the Engliſh to fight for a feather, if they ſuppoſe <hi>that feather</hi> to be an affront; and America, without the right of aſking why, muſt have abetted in every quarrel and abided by its fate. It is a ſhocking ſituation to live in, that one country muſt be brought into all the wars of another, whether the meaſure be right or wrong, or whether ſhe will or not; yet this, in the fulleſt extent, was, and ever would be, the unavoidable conſequence of the connection. Surely! the Quakers forgot their own principles, when in their late teſtimony they called <hi>this connection</hi> with theſe military and miſerable appendages hanging to it, <hi>"The happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BRITAIN, for centuries paſt, have been nearly fifty years out of every hundred at war with ſome power or other. It certainly ought to be a conſcientious as well as political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration with America, not to dip her hands in the bloody work of Europe. Our ſituation affords us a retreat from their cabals, and the preſent happy union of the States bid fair for extirpating the future uſe of arms from one quarter of the world; yet ſuch have been the irreligious politics of the preſent leaders of the Quakers, that, for the ſake of they ſcarce know what, they would cut off every hope of ſuch a bleſſing by tying this Continent to Britain, like Hector to the chariot-wheel of Achilles, to be dragged through all the miſeries of endleſs European wars.</p>
            <p>THE connection, viewed from this ground, is diſtreſſing to every man who has the feelings of humanity. By having Britain for our maſter, we became enemies to the greateſt part of Europe, and they to us; and the conſequence was war inevitable. By being our own maſters, independent of any foreign one, we have Europe for our friends, and the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015494_0013_0F99866BF354F5F0"/>
proſpect of an endleſs peace among ourſelves. Thoſe who were advocates for the Britiſh government over theſe Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, were obliged to limit both their arguments and their ideas to the period of a European peace only: The moment Britain became plunged in war, every ſuppoſed convenience to us vaniſhed away, and all we could hope for was <hi>not to be ruined.</hi> Could this be a deſirable condition for a young country to be in?</p>
            <p>HAD the French purſued their fortune immediately after the defeat of Braddock laſt war, this city and province had then experienced the woful calamities of being a Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. A ſcene of the ſame kind might happen again; for America, conſidered as a ſubject to the crown of Britain, would ever have been the ſeat of war and the bone of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention between the two powers.</p>
            <p>ON the whole, If the future expulſion of arms from one quarter of the world be a deſirable object to a peaceable man;—if the freedom of trade to every part of it can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the attention of a man of buſineſs,—if the ſupport or fall of millions of currency can affect our intereſt;—if the entire poſſeſſion of eſtates, by cutting off the lordly claims of Britain over the ſoil, deſerves the regard of landed property;— and if the right of making our own laws, uncontrouled by royal or miniſterial ſpies or mandates, be worthy our care as freemen;—then are all men intereſted in the ſupport of Independence, and may he that ſupports it not, be driven from the bleſſing, and live unpitied beneath the ſervile ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſcandalous ſubjection!</p>
            <p>WE have been amuſed with the tales of ancient wonders; we have read, and wept over, the hiſtories of other nations; applauded, cenſured, or pitied, as their caſes affected us.— The fortitude and patience of the ſufferers—the juſtneſs of their cauſe—the weight of their oppreſſions and oppreſſors— the object to be ſaved or loſt—with all the conſequences of a defeat or a conqueſt—have, in the hour of ſympathy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched our hearts and chained it to their fate: But where is the power that ever made war upon petitioners? Or where is the war on which a world was ſtaked till now?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:015494_0014_0F99866D39616078"/>WE may not, perhaps, be wiſe enough to make all the advantages we ought of our Independence; but they are, nevertheleſs, marked and preſented to us with every character of GREAT and GOOD, and worthy the hand of Him who ſent them. I look through the preſent trouble to a time of tranquillity, when we ſhall have it in our power to ſet an example of peace to all the world. Were the Quakers really impreſſed and influenced by the quiet principles they profeſs to hold, they would, however they might diſapprove the means, be the firſt of all men to approve of INDEPENDENCE, becauſe, by ſeparating from the cities of Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah, it affords an opportunity, never given to man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of carrying their favourite principle of peace into ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral practice, by eſtabliſhing governments that ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after exiſt without wars. Oh ye fallen, cringing prieſt- and Pemberton-ridden people! what more can we ſay of ye than that a religious Quaker is a valuable character, and a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Quaker a real Jeſuit.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus gone over ſome of the principal points in ſupport of Independence, I muſt now requeſt the reader to return back with me to the period when it firſt began to be a public doctrine, and examine the progreſs it has made among the various claſſes of men. The era I mean to begin at, is the breaking out of hoſtilities, April 19th, 1775. Until this event happened, the Continent ſeemed to view the diſpute as a kind of lawſuit for a matter of right, liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating between the old country and the new; and ſhe felt the ſame kind and degree of horror, as if ſhe had ſeen an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive plaintiff, at the head of a band of ruffians, enter the court, while the cauſe was before it, and put the judge, the jury, the defendant and his council to the ſword. Perhaps a more heart-felt convulſion never reached a country with the ſame degree of power and rapidity before, and never may again. Pity for the ſufferers, mixt with indignation at the violence and heightened with apprehenſions of undergoing the ſame fate, made the affair of Lexington the affair of the Continent. Every part of it felt the ſhock, and all vibrated together. A general promotion of ſentiment took place: Thoſe who had drank deeply into Whiggiſh principles, that is, the right and neceſſity not only of oppoſing, but wholly ſetting aſide the power of the Crown as ſoon as it became
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:015494_0015_0F99866D9922B140"/>
practically dangerous (for in theory it was always ſo) ſtept into the firſt ſtage of Independence; while another claſs of Whigs, equally ſound in principle, but not ſo ſanguine in enterprize, attached themſelves the ſtronger to the cauſe and fell cloſe in with the rear of the former; their partition was a mere point. Numbers of the moderate men, whoſe chief fault, <hi>at that time,</hi> aroſe from their entertaining a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Britain than ſhe deſerved, convinced now of their miſtake, gave her up and publicly declared themſelves good Whigs. While the Tories, ſeeing it was no longer a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter, either ſlunk into ſilent obſcurity, or contented themſelves with coming forth and abuſing General Gage: Not a ſingle advocate appeared to juſtify the action of that day; it ſeemed to appear to every one with the ſame mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, ſtruck every one with the ſame force, and created in every one the ſame abhorrence. From this period we may date the growth of Independence.</p>
            <p>IF the many circumſtances, which happened at this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable time, be taken in one view, and compared with each other, they will juſtify a concluſion which ſeems not to be attended to, I mean a fixt deſign in the king and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of driving America into arms, in order that they might be furniſhed with a pretence for ſeizing the whole Continent as the immediate property of the Crown. A noble plunder for hungry courtiers!</p>
            <p>IT ought to be remembered, that the firſt petition from the Congreſs was at this time unanſwered on the part of the Britiſh king. That the motion, called Lord North's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the 20th of February, 1775, arrived in America the latter end of March. This motion was to be laid by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral governors, then in being, before the Aſſembly of each province; and the firſt Aſſembly before which it was laid, was the Aſſembly of Pennſylvania in <hi>May</hi> following. This being a juſt ſtate of the caſe, I then aſk, why were hoſtilities commenced between the time of paſſing the reſolve in the Houſe of Commons, of the 20th of February, and the time of the Aſſemblies meeting to deliberate upon it? Degrading and infamous as that motion was, there is, nevertheleſs, reaſon to believe, that the king and his adherents were afraid the Colonies would agree to it, and leſt they ſhould, took
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:015494_0016_0F99866EAB0F3568"/>
effectual care they ſhould not, by provoking them with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities in the interim. They had not the leaſt doubt at that time of conquering America at one blow; and what they expected to get by a conqueſt being infinitely greater than any thing they could hope to get either by taxation or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, they ſeemed determined to prevent even the poſſibility of hearing each other, leſt America ſhould diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point their greedy hopes of the whole, by liſtening even to their own terms. On the one hand they refuſed to hear the petition of the Continent, and on the other hand took ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual care the Continent ſhould not hear them.</p>
            <p>THAT the motion of the 20th of February and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for commencing hoſtilities were both concerted by the ſame PERSON or perſons, and not the latter by General Gage, as was falſely imagined at firſt, is evident from an extract of a letter of his to adminiſtration, read among other papers in the Houſe of Commons; in which he informs his maſters, <hi>That though their idea of his diſarming certain counties was a right one, yet it required him to be maſter of the country, in order to enable him to execute it.</hi> This was prior to the commencement of hoſtilities, and conſequently before the motion of the 20th of February could be deliberated on by the ſeveral Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS it may be aſked, why was the motion paſt, if there was at the ſame time a plan to aggravate the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans not to liſten to it? Lord North aſſigned one reaſon himſelf, which was, <hi>a hope of dividing them.</hi> This was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicly tempting them to reject it; that if, in caſe, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of arms ſhould fail of provoking them ſufficiently, the inſult of ſuch a declaration might fill it up. But by paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motion and getting it afterwards rejected in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, it enabled them, in their wretched idea of politics, among other things, to hold up the Colonies to foreign powers with every poſſible mark of diſobedience and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. They had applied to thoſe powers not to ſupply the Continent with arms, ammunition, &amp;c. and it was neceſſary they ſhould incenſe them againſt us, by aſſigning on their own part ſome ſeeming reputable reaſon why. By dividing, it had a tendency to weaken the States, and likewiſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex the adherents of America in England. But the principal
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:015494_0017_0F99866EDFBF3A50"/>
ſcheme, and that which has marked their character in every part of their conduct, was a deſign of precipitating the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies into a ſtate which they might afterwards deem rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and under that pretence put an end to all future com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, petitions or remonſtrances, by ſeizing the whole at once. They had ravaged one part of the globe, till it could glut them no longer; their prodigality required new plunder, and through the Eaſt-India article TEA they hoped to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their rapine from that quarter of the world to this.— Every deſigned quarrel has its pretence; and the ſame bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian avarice accompanied the <hi>Plant</hi> to America, which ruined the country that produced it.</p>
            <p>THAT men never turn rogues without turning fools, is a maxim, ſooner or later, univerſally true. The commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hoſtilities, being in the beginning of April, was, of all times, the worſt choſen: The Congreſs were to meet the tenth of May following, and the diſtreſs the Continent felt at this unparalleled outrage gave a ſtability to <hi>That Body,</hi> which no other circumſtance could have done. It ſuppreſſed too all inferior debates, and bound them together by a neceſſitous affection, without giving them time to differ upon trifles. The ſuffering likewiſe, ſoftened the whole body of the people into a degree of pliability, which laid the principal founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtone of union, order and government; and which, at any other time, might only have fretted and then faded away unnoticed and unimproved: But Providence, who beſt knows how to time her misfortunes as well as her immediate favours, choſe this to be the time: And who dares diſpute it?</p>
            <p>IT did not ſeem the diſpoſition of the people at this criſis to heap petition upon petition, while the former remained unanſwered: The meaſure, however, was carried in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and a ſecond petition was ſent; of which I ſhall only remark, that it was ſubmiſſive even to a dangerous fault, becauſe the prayer of it appealed ſolely to, what is called, the prerogative of the Crown, while the matter in diſpute was confeſſed to be conſtitutional. But even this Petition, flattering as it was, was ſtill not ſo harmonious as the chink of caſh, and conſequently not ſufficiently grateful to the tyrant and his miniſtry. From every circumſtance it is evident, that it was the determination of the Britiſh court
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:015494_0018_0F9986721CB2AA18"/>
to have nothing to do with America but to conquer it fully and abſolutely. They were certain of ſucceſs, and the field of battle was to be the only place of treaty. I am confident there are thouſands and tens of thouſands in America who wonder <hi>now</hi> they ſhould ever think otherwiſe; but the ſin of that day was the ſin of Civility, yet it operated againſt our preſent good in the ſame manner that a civil opinion of the devil would againſt our future peace.</p>
            <p>INDEPENDENCE was a doctrine ſcarce and rare even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the concluſion of the year Seventy-five: All our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics had been founded on the hope or expectation of make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter up—a hope, which, though general on the ſide of America, had never entered the head or heart of the Britiſh court. Their hope was conqueſt and confiſcation. Good Heavens! what volumes of thanks does America owe to Britain! What infinite obligations to the fool, that fills, with paradoxical vacancy, the throne! Nothing but the ſharpeſt eſſence of villany, compounded with the ſtrongeſt diſtillation of folly, could have produced a menſtruum that would have effected a ſeparation. The Congreſs in Seventy-four adminiſtered an abortive medicine to Independence, by prohibiting the importation of goods, and the ſucceeding Congreſs rendered the doſe ſtill more dangerous by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing it. Had Independence been a ſettled ſyſtem with America (as Britain has advanced) ſhe ought to have <hi>doubled</hi> her importation, and prohibited in ſome degree her exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this ſingle circumſtance is ſufficient to acquit America before any jury of nations of having a Continental plan of Independence in view: A charge, which had it been true, would have been honourable, but is ſo groſsly falſe, that either the amazing ignorance, or the wilful diſhoneſty, of the Britiſh court is effectually proved by it.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond petition like the firſt produced no anſwer; it was ſcarcely acknowledged to be received; the Britiſh court were too determined in their villany even to act it artfully, and in their rage for conqueſt neglected the neceſſary ſubtleties for obtaining it. They might have divided, diſtracted and played a thouſand tricks with us had they been as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as they were cruel.</p>
            <p>THIS laſt indignity gave a new ſpring to Independence.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:015494_0019_0F998673334F8F20"/>
Thoſe who knew the ſavage obſtinacy of the king and the jobbing gambling ſpirit of the court predicted the fate of the petition as ſoon as it was ſent from America; for the men being known, their meaſures were eaſily foreſeen. As poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians we ought not ſo much to ground our hope on the reaſonableneſs of the thing we aſk, as on the reaſonableneſs of the perſon of whom we aſk it: Who would expect diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a fool, candour from a tyrant, or juſtice from a villain?</p>
            <p>AS every proſpect of an accommodation ſeemed now to fail faſt, men began to think ſeriouſly on the matter; and their reaſon being thus ſtript of the falſe hope which had long encompaſſed it, became approachable by fair debate; yet ſtill the bulk of the people heſitated; they ſtartled at the novelty of Independence, without once conſidering that our getting into arms at firſt was a more extraordinary novelty, and that all other nations had gone through the work of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence before us. They doubted, likewiſe, the ability of the Continent to ſupport it, without reflecting, that it required the ſame force to obtain an accommodation by arms as an Independence. If the one was acquireable, the other was the ſame; becauſe, to accompliſh either, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that our ſtrength ſhould be too great for Britain to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due; and it was too unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that with the power of being maſters, we ſhould ſubmit to be ſervants.<note n="*" place="bottom">In this ſtate of political ſuſpenſe the pamphlet <hi>Common Senſe</hi> made its appearance, and the ſucceſs it met with does not become me to mention. Dr. Franklin, Mr. Samuel and John Adams were ſeverally ſpoken of as the ſuppoſed Author. I had not, at that time, the pleaſure either of perſonally knowing or being known to the two laſt Gentlemen. The favour of Dr. Franklin's friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip I poſſeſſed in England, and my introduction to this part of the world was through his patronage. I happened, when a ſchool boy, to pick up a pleaſing natural hiſtory of Virginia, and my inclination from that day of ſeeing the weſtern ſide of the atlantic never left me. In October, Seventy-five. Dr. Franklin propoſed giving me ſuch materials as were in his hands, towards compleating a hiſtory of the preſent tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, and ſeemed deſirous of having the firſt volume out by the next ſpring. I had then formed the outlines of Common Senſe, and finiſhed nearly the firſt part; and as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Doctor's deſign in getting out a hiſtory, was to open the new year with a new ſyſtem, I expected to ſurprize him with a production on that ſubject much earlier than he thought of; and without informing him of what I was doing, got it ready for the preſs as faſt as I conveniently could, and ſent him the firſt pamphlet that was printed off.</note> Their caution, at this time, was exceedingly miſplaced; for if they were able to defend their property and maintain their
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:015494_0020_0F998674BB5D3078"/>
rights by arms, they conſequently were able to defend and ſupport their Independence; and in proportion as theſe men ſaw the neceſſity and rightneſs of the meaſure, they honeſtly and openly declared and adopted it, and the part they have acted ſince, have done them honour, and fully eſtabliſhed their characters. Error in opinion has this peculiar advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage with it, that the foremoſt point of the contrary ground may at any time be reached by the ſudden exertion of a thought; and it frequently happens in ſentimental differences that ſome ſtriking circumſtance, or ſome forcible reaſon, quickly conceived, will effect in an inſtant what neither ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument nor example could produce in an age.</p>
            <p>I find it impoſſible in the ſmall compaſs I am limited to, to trace out the progreſs which Independence has made on the minds of the different claſſes of men, and the ſeveral reaſons by which they were moved. With ſome, it was a paſſionate abhorrence againſt the king of England and his miniſtry as a ſet of ſavages and brutes; and theſe men, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the agony of a wounded mind, were for truſting every thing to hope and Heaven and bidding defiance at once. With others, it was a growing conviction that the ſcheme of the Britiſh court was to create, ferment and drive on a quarrel for the ſake of confiſcated plunder: Men of this caſt ripened into Independence in proportion as the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence encreaſed. While a third claſs, conceiving it was the true intereſt of America, internally and externally, to be her own maſter, gave their ſupport to Independence, ſtep by ſtep, as they ſaw her abilities to maintain it enlarge. With many it was a compound of all theſe reaſons; while thoſe, who were too callous to be reached by neither, remained, and ſtill remain Tories.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>legal neceſſity</hi> of being independent, with ſeveral col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral reaſons, is pointed out in an elegant, maſterly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:015494_0021_0F998674FB431CB0"/>
in a charge to the grand jury for the diſtrict of Charles-town, by the Hon. WILLIAM HENRY DRAYTON, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Chief Juſtice of South-Carolina. This performance, and the ADDRESS of the CONVENTION of New-York, are pieces, in my humble opinion, of the firſt rank in America.</p>
            <p>THE principal cauſes why Independence has not been ſo univerſally ſupported as it ought, are, <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>indolence,</hi> and the cauſes why it has been oppoſed, are, <hi>avarice, downright villany,</hi> and <hi>luſt of perſonal power.</hi> There is not ſuch a Being in America as a Tory from conſcience: Some ſecret defect or other is interwoven in the character of all thoſe, be they men or women, who can look with patience on the brutality, luxury and debauchery of the Britiſh court, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of their army here. A woman's virtue muſt ſit very lightly on her who can even hint a favourable ſentiment in their behalf. It is remarkable that the whole race of proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes in New-York were Tories; and the ſchemes for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Tory cauſe, in this city, for which ſeveral are now in jail, and one hanged, were concerted and carried on in common baudy-houſes, aſſiſted by thoſe who kept them.</p>
            <p>THE connection between vice and meanneſs is a fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for ſatire, but when the ſatire is a fact, it cuts with the irreſiſtible power of a diamond. If a Quaker, in defence of his juſt rights, his property and the chaſtity of his houſe, takes up a muſket, he is expelled the meeting; but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent king of England, who ſeduced and took into keeping a ſiſter of their ſociety, is reverenced and ſupported with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated teſtimonies, while the friendly noodle from whom ſhe was taken, (and who is now in this city) continues a drudge in the ſervice of his rival, as if proud of being cuckolded by a creature called a king.</p>
            <p>OUR ſupport and ſucceſs depend on ſuch a variety of men and circumſtances, that every one, who does but wiſh well, is of ſome uſe: There are men who have a ſtrange awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to arms, yet have hearts to riſk every ſhilling in the cauſe, or in ſupport of thoſe who have better talents for defending it. Nature, in the arrangement of mankind, has fitted ſome for every ſervice in life: Were all ſoldiers, all would ſtarve and go naked, and were none ſoldiers, all would
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015494_0022_0F998675C5C1B970"/>
be ſlaves. As <hi>diſaffection</hi> to Independence is the badge of a Tory, ſo <hi>affection</hi> to it is the mark of a Whig; and the different ſervices of the Whigs down from thoſe who nobly contribute every thing, to thoſe who have nothing to render but their wiſhes, tend all to the ſame centre, though with different degrees of merit and ability. The larger we make the circle, the more we ſhall harmonize, and the ſtronger we ſhall be. All we want to ſhut out, is diſaffection, and <hi>that excluded,</hi> we muſt accept from each other ſuch duties as we are beſt fitted to beſtow. A narrow ſyſtem of politics, like a narrow ſyſtem of religion, is calculated only to four the temper, and live at variance with mankind.</p>
            <p>ALL we want to know in America is ſimply this, Who is for Independence, and who is not? Thoſe who are for it, will ſupport it, and the remainder will undoubtedly ſee the reaſonableneſs of their paying the charges; while thoſe who oppoſe, or ſeek to betray it, muſt expect the more rigid fate of the jail and the gibbet. There is a kind of baſtard ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, which, by being extended to all men, is as fatal to ſociety, on one hand, as the want of true generoſity is on the other. A lax manner of adminiſtring juſtice, falſely termed moderation, has a tendency both to diſpirit public virtue and promote the growth of public evils. Had the late Committee of Safety taken cognizance of the laſt teſtimony of the Quakers, and proceeded againſt ſuch delinquents as were concerned therein, they had, probably, prevented the treaſonable plans which have been concerted ſince. When one villain is ſuffered to eſcape, it encourages another to proceed, either from a hope of eſcaping likewiſe, or an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that we dare not puniſh. It has been a matter of general ſurpriſe, that no notice was taken of the incendiary publication of the Quakers, of the 20th of November laſt: A publication evidently intended to promote ſedition and treaſon, and encourage the enemy, who were then within a day's march of this city, to proceed on and poſſeſs it. I here preſent the reader with a memorial, which was laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Board of Safety a few days after the teſtimony ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. Not a member of that Board, that I converſed with but expreſſed the higheſt deteſtation of the perverted principles and conduct of the Quaker junto, and that the Board would take the matter up; notwithſtanding which,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:015494_0023_0F99867667A283D0"/>
it was ſuffered to paſs away unnoticed, to the encouragement of new acts of treaſon, the general danger of the cauſe, and the diſgrace of the State.</p>

                        </head>
                        <head type="sub">At a meeting of a reputable number of the inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia, impreſſed with a proper ſenſe of the juſtice of the cauſe which this Continent is engaged in, and animated with a generous fervor for ſupporting the ſame, it was reſolved, that the following be laid before the Board of Safety:</head>
                        <p>WE profeſs liberality of ſentiment to all men; with this diſtinction <hi>only,</hi> that thoſe who do <hi>not</hi> deſerve it, would become wiſe and <hi>ſeek</hi> to deſerve it. We hold the pure doctrine of univerſal liberty of conſcience, and conceive it our duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſecure that ſacred right to others, as well as to defend it for ourſelves; for we undertake not to judge of the religious rectitude of tenets, but leave the whole matter to Him who made us.</p>
                        <p>"WE perſecute no man, neither will we abet in the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any man for religion ſake; our common relation to others being that of fellow-citizens and fellow-ſubjects of one civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; and in this line of connection we hold out the right hand of fellowſhip to all men. But we ſhould conceive ourſelves to be unworthy members of the FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES OF AMERICA, were we unconcernedly to ſee or ſuffer any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable wound, public or private, directly or indirectly, to be given againſt the peace and ſafety of the ſame. We enquire not into the rank of the offenders, nor their religious perſuaſion; we have no buſineſs with either, our part being only to find them out, and exhibit them to juſtice.</p>
                        <p>A printed paper, dated the 20th of November, and ſigned <hi>John Pemberton,</hi> whom we ſuppoſe to be an inhabitant of this city, has lately been diſperſed abroad, a copy of which accompanies this. Had the framers and publiſhers of that paper conceived it their duty to exhort the youth, and others, of their ſociety, to a patient ſubmiſſion under preſent trying viſitations, and humbly to wait the event of Heaven towards them, they had therein ſhewn a Chriſtian temper, and we had been ſilent; but the anger and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical virulence with which their inſtructions are given, and the abuſe with which they ſtigmatize all ranks of men, not thinking
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:015494_0024_0F998677325BB940"/>
like themſelves, leave no doubt on our minds from what ſpirit their publication proceeded: And it is diſgraceful to the pure cauſe of truth, that men can dally with words of the moſt ſacred import, and play them as mechanically off as if religion conſiſted only in contrivance. We know of no inſtance, in which the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have been compelled to bear arms, or do any thing which might ſtrain their conſcience; wherefore their advice <q>to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and refuſe to ſubmit to the arbitrary inſtructions and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of men,</q> appear to us a falſe alarm, and could only be treaſonably calculated to gain favour with our enemies, when they were ſeemingly on the brink of invading this State, or, what is ſtill worſe, to weaken the hands of our defence, that their entrance into this city might be made practicable and eaſy.</p>
                        <p>"WE diſclaim all tumult and diſorder in the puniſhment of offenders; and wiſh to be governed, not by temper but by reaſon, in the manner of treating them. We are ſenſible that our cauſe has ſuffered by the two following errors; by an ill-judged lenity to traiterous perſons in ſome caſes; and ſecondly, by only a paſſionate treatment of them in others. For the future we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own both, and wiſh to be ſteady in our proceedings, and ſerious in our puniſhments.</p>
                        <p>"EVERY State in America has by the repeated voice of its inhabitants, directed and authoriſed the Continental Congreſs to publiſh a formal Declaration of Independence of, and Separation from, the oppreſſive king and parliament of Great-Britain; and we look on every man an enemy who does not in ſome line or other give his aſſiſtance towards ſupporting the ſame; at the ſame time we conſider the offence to be heightened to a degree of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable guilt, when ſuch perſons, under the ſhew of religion, endeavour, either by writing, ſpeaking, or otherwiſe, to ſubvert, overturn, or bring reproach upon the Independence of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent as declared by Congreſs.</p>
                        <p>"THE publiſhers of the paper, ſigned <hi>"John Pemberton,"</hi> have called in a loud and paſſionate manner on their friends and connections, to <hi>"withſtand and refuſe"</hi> obedience to whatever <hi>"in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions or ordinances"</hi> may be publiſhed, not warranted by (what they call) <q>THAT HAPPY CONSTITUTION UNDER WHICH THEY AND OTHERS LONG ENJOYED TRANQUILLITY AND PEACE.</q> If this be not treaſon, we know not what may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called by that name.</p>
                        <p>"TO us it is a matter of ſurpriſe and aſtoniſhment, that men with the word <hi>"peace, peace"</hi> continually on their lips, ſhould
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:015494_0025_0F99867849A7F838"/>
be ſo fond of living under, and ſupporting a government and at the ſame time calling it <hi>"happy,"</hi> which is never better pleaſed than when at war—that hath filled India with carnage and famine—Africa with ſlavery—and tampered with Indians and Negroes to cut the throats of the freemen of America. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it a diſgrace to this State to harbour or wink at ſuch palpable hypocriſy. But as we ſeek not to hurt the hair of any man's head, when we can make ourſelves ſafe without, we wiſh ſuch perſons to reſtore peace to themſelves and us, by removing themſelves to ſome part of the king of Britain's dominions, as by that means they may live unmoleſted by us or we by them; for our fixt opinion is, that thoſe who do not deſerve a place among us, ought not to have one.</p>
                        <p>"WE conclude, with requeſting the Council of Safety to take into their conſideration the paper ſigned <hi>"John Pemberton;"</hi> and if it ſhall appear to them to be of a dangerous tendency, or of a treaſonable nature, that they would commit the ſigner, together with ſuch other perſons as they can diſcover were concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, into cuſtody, until ſuch time as ſome mode of trial ſhall aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the full degree of their guilt and puniſhment; in the doing of which, we wiſh their judges, whoever they may be, to diſregard the man, his connections, intereſt, riches, poverty or principles of religion, and to attend to the nature of his offence only."</p>

            <p>THE moſt cavilling ſectarian cannot accuſe the foregoing with containing the leaſt ingredient of perſecution. The free ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit on which the American cauſe is founded, diſdains to mix with ſuch an impurity, and leave it a rubbiſh fit only for narrow and ſuſpicious minds to grovel in: Suſpicion and perſecution are weeds of the ſame dunghill, and flouriſh beſt together. Had the Quakers minded their religion and their buſineſs, they might have lived through this diſpute in enviable eaſe, and none would have moleſted them. The common phraſe with theſe people is, <hi>"Our principles are peace."</hi> To which may be replied, <hi>and your practices are the reverſe;</hi> for never did the conduct of men oppoſe their own doctrine more notoriouſly than the preſent race of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. They have artfully changed themſelves into a different ſort of people to what they uſed to be, and yet have the addreſs to perſuade each other they are not altered; like antiquated virgins they ſee not the havoc deformity hath made upon them, but pleaſantly miſtaking wrinkles for dimples, conceit themſelves yet lovely, and wonder at the ſtupid world for not admiring them.</p>
            <p>DID no injury ariſe to the public by this apoſtacy of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers from themſelves, the public would have nothing to do with it; but as both the deſign and conſequences are pointed againſt

a cauſe in which the whole community are intereſted, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no longer a ſubject confined to the cognizance of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only, but comes as a matter of criminality before either the authority of the particular State <hi>in which</hi> it is acted, or of the Continent <hi>againſt which</hi> it operates. Every attempt now to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the authority of the king or parliament of Great-Britain over America, is treaſon againſt <hi>every</hi> State; therefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any <hi>one</hi> can pardon or ſcreen from puniſhment an offender againſt <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to proceed: While the infatuated Tories of this and other States were laſt ſpring talking of Commiſſioners, accommodation, making the matter up and the Lord knows what ſtuff and nonſenſe, their <hi>good</hi> king and miniſtry were glutting themſelves with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of reducing America to an <hi>unconditional ſubmiſſion,</hi> and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing each other with the certainty of conquering it in <hi>one cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign.</hi> The following quotations are from the Parliamentary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of the debates of the Houſe of Lords, March 5th, 1776.</p>
            <p>"The Americans," ſays Lord <hi>Talbot</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Steward of the king's houſhold.</note>, <q>have been obſtinate, undutiful and ungovernable from the very beginning, from their firſt early and infant ſettlements; and I am every day more and more convinced that this people will never be brought back to their duty, and the ſubordinate relation they ſtand in to this country, till <hi>reduced to an unconditional effectual ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; no conceſſion on our part, no lenity, no endurance,</hi> will have any other effect but that of encreaſing their inſolence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"THE ſtruggle," ſays Lord <hi>Townſend</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Formerly General Townſend at Quebec, and late Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.</note>, <q>is now a ſtruggle for power; the die is caſt, and the ONLY POINT which now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be determined, is, in what manner the war can be moſt effectually proſecuted and ſpeedily finiſhed, in order to procure that <hi>unconditional ſubmiſſion,</hi> which has been ſo ably ſtated by the noble Earl with the white ſtaff</q> (meaning Lord Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot); <q>and I have no reaſon to doubt that the meaſures now purſuing will put an end to the war in the courſe of a SINGLE CAMPAIGN.</q> 
               <q>Should it linger longer, we ſhall then have reaſon to expect that ſome foreign power will interfere, and take advantage of our domeſtic troubles and civil diſtractions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>LORD <hi>Littleton,</hi> 
               <q>My ſentiments are pretty well known. I ſhall only obſerve now, that lenient meaſures have had no other effect than to produce inſult after inſult; that the more we conceded, the higher America roſe in her demands, and the more inſolent ſhe has grown. It is for this reaſon that I am
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:015494_0027_0F998679EEAAD6A0"/>
now for the moſt effective and deciſive meaſures; and am of opinion, that no alternative is left us, but to relinquiſh Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica for ever, or finally determine to compel her to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the legiſlative authority of this country; and it is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of an <hi>unconditional ſubmiſſion</hi> I would be for maintaining.</q>
            </p>
            <p>CAN words be more expreſſive than theſe? Surely the Tories will believe the Tory Lords! The truth is, they <hi>do believe them,</hi> and know as fully as any Whig on the Continent knows, that the king and miniſtry never had the leaſt deſign of an accommodation with America, but an abſolute unconditional conqueſt. And the part which the Tories were to act, was, by downright lying, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to put the Continent off its guard, and to divide and ſow diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content in the minds of ſuch Whigs as they might gain an influence over. In ſhort, to keep up a diſtraction here, that the force ſent from England might be able to conquer in <hi>"one campaign."</hi> They and the miniſtry were, by a different game, playing into each other's hands. The cry of the Tories in England was, <hi>"No re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, no accommodation,"</hi> in order to obtain the greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary force; while thoſe in America were crying nothing but <hi>"reconciliation and accommodation,"</hi> that the force ſent might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer with the leſs reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>this "ſingle campaign"</hi> is over, and America not conquered. The whole work is yet to do, and the force much leſs to do it with. Their condition is both deſpicable and deplorable: Out of caſh—out of heart—and out of hope. A country furniſhed with arms and ammunition, as America now is, with three millions of inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and three thouſand miles diſtant from the neareſt enemy that can approach her, is able to look and laugh them in the face.</p>
            <p>HOWE appears to have two objects in view, either to go up the North river, or come to Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>BY going up the North river, he ſecures a retreat for his army thro' Canada, but the ſhips muſt return, if they return at all, the ſame way they went; and as our army would be in the rear, the ſafety of their paſſage down is a doubtful matter. By ſuch a motion he ſhuts himſelf from all ſupplies from Europe but thro' Canada, and expoſes his army and navy to the danger of periſhing. The idea of his cutting off the communication between the eaſtern and ſouthern States, by means of the North river, is merely viſionary. He cannot do it by his ſhipping; becauſe no ſhip can lay long at anchor in any river within reach of the ſhore; a ſingle gun would drive a firſt rate from ſuch a ſtation: This was fully proved
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:015494_0028_0F99867A29C33538"/>
laſt October at fort Waſhington and Lee, where one gun only, on each ſide the river, obliged two frigates to cut and be towed off in an hour's time. Neither can he cut it off by his army; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſeveral poſts they muſt occupy, would divide them almoſt to nothing, and expoſe them to be picked up by ours like pebbles on a river's bank; but admitting he could, where is the injury? Becauſe while his whole force is cantoned out, as centries over the water, they will be very innocently employed, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they march into the country, the communication opens.</p>
            <p>THE moſt probable object is Philadelphia, and the reaſons are many. Howe's buſineſs in America is to conquer it, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as he finds himſelf unable to the taſk, he will employ his ſtrength to diſtreſs women and weak minds, in order to accompliſh through <hi>their</hi> fears what he cannot effect by his <hi>own</hi> force. His coming or attempting to come to Philadelphia is a circumſtance that proves his weakneſs: For no general, that felt himſelf able to take the field and attack his antagoniſt, would think of bringing his army into a city in the ſummer time; and this mere ſhifting the ſcene from place to place, without effecting any thing, has feebleneſs and cowardice on the face of it, and holds him up in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible light to any one who can reaſon juſtly and firmly. By ſeveral informations from New-York, it appears that their army in general, both officers and men, have given up the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of conquering America; their eye, now, is fixt upon the ſpoil. They ſuppoſe Philadelphia to be rich with ſtores, and as they think to get more by robbing a town than by attacking an army, their movement towards this city is probable. We are not now contending againſt an army of ſoldiers, but againſt a band of thieves, who had rather plunder than ſight, and have no other hope of conqueſt than by cluelty.</p>
            <p>THEY expect to get a mighty booty and ſtrike another general panic by making a ſudden movement and getting poſſeſſion this city, but unleſs they can march <hi>out</hi> as well as <hi>in,</hi> or get the entire command of the river, to remove off their plunder, they may probably be ſtopt with the ſtolen goods upon them. They have never yet ſucceeded wherever they have been oppoſed but at fort Waſhington. At Charlestown their defeat was effectual. At Ticonderoga they ran away. In every ſkirmiſh at Kingſbridge and the White Plains they were obliged to retreat, and the inſtant our arms were turned upon them in the Jerſies, they turned like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and thoſe that turned not were taken.</p>
            <p>THE neceſſity of always fitting our internal police to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the times we live in, is ſomething ſo ſtrikingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious

that no ſufficient objection can be made againſt it. The ſafety of all ſocieties depend upon it; and where this point is not attended to, the conſequence will either be a general languor or a tumult. The encouragement and protection of the good ſubjects of any State, and the ſuppreſſion and puniſhment of bad ones, are the principal objects for which all authority is inſtituted, and the line in which it ought to operate. We have in this city a ſtrange variety of men and characters, and the circumſtances of the times require they ſhould be publicly known; it is not the number of Tories that hurt us, ſo much, as the not finding out who they are; men muſt now take one ſide or the other, and abide by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences: The Quakers, truſting to their ſhort ſighted ſagacity, have, moſt unluckily for them, made their declaration in their laſt teſtimony, and we ought <hi>now</hi> to take them at their word. They have voluntarily read themſelves out of the Continental meeting, and cannot hope to be reſtored to it again, but by payment and penitence. Men whoſe political principles are founded on avarice, are beyond the reach of reaſon, and the only cure for Toryiſm of this caſt, is to tax it. A ſubſtantial good drawn from a real evil, is of the ſame benefit to ſociety, as if drawn from a virtue; and where men have not public ſpirit to render themſelves ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it ought to be the ſtudy of government to draw the beſt uſe poſſible from their vices. When the governing paſſion of any man or ſet of men is once known, the method of managing them is eaſy; for even miſers, whom no public virtue can impreſs, would become generous, could a heavy tax be laid upon covetouſneſs.</p>
            <p>THE Tories have endeavoured to inſure their property with the enemy, by forfeiting their reputation with us; from which may be juſtly inferred, that their governing paſſion is avarice. Make them as much afraid of loſing on one ſide as the other, and you ſtagger their Toryiſm; make them more ſo, and you reclaim them; for their principle is to worſhip any power they are moſt afraid of.</p>
            <p>THIS method of conſidering men and things together, opens into a large field for ſpeculation, and affords me opportunity of offering ſome obſervations on the ſtate of our currency, ſo as to make the ſupport of it go hand in hand, with the ſuppreſſion of diſaffection and the encouragement of public ſpirit.</p>
            <p>THE thing which firſt preſents itſelf in inſpecting the ſtate of the currency, is, that we have too much of it, and that there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of reducing the quantity, in order to encreaſe the value. Men are daily growing poor by the very means they take to get rich, for in the ſame proportion that the prices of all goods on
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:015494_0030_0F99867BA6F5E850"/>
hand are raiſed, the value of all money laid by is reduced. A ſimple caſe will make this clear: Let a man have one hundred pounds caſh, and as many goods on hand as will to-day ſell for £ 20, but not content with the preſent market-price, he raiſes them to 40, and by ſo doing, obliges others in their own defence to raiſe cent per cent likewiſe; in this caſe, it is evident that his hundred pound laid by is reduced fifty pounds in value; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, had the markets dropt cent per cent, his goods would have ſold but for ten, but his hundred pounds would have riſen in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to two hundred; becauſe it would then purchaſe as many goods again, or ſupport his family as long again as before. And ſtrange as it may ſeem, he is one hundred and fifty pounds the poorer for raiſing his goods, to what he would have been had he lowered them; becauſe the forty pounds his goods ſold for, is by the general riſe of the markets, cent per cent, rendered of no more value than the ten pounds would be had the market fallen in the ſame proportion; and conſequently the whole difference of gain or loſs is on the different values of the hundred pounds laid by, viz. from fifty to two hundred. This rage for raiſing goods is for ſeveral reaſons much more the fault of the Tories than the Whigs; and yet the Tories (to their ſhame and confuſion ought they to be told of it) are by far the moſt noiſy and diſcontented. The greateſt part of the Whigs, by being now either in the army or employed in ſome public ſervice, are <hi>buyers</hi> only and not <hi>ſellers,</hi> and as this evil has its origin in trade, it cannot be charged on thoſe who are out of it.</p>
            <p>BUT the grievance is now become too general to be remedied by partial methods, and the only effectual cure is to reduce the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of money; with half the quantity we ſhould be richer than we are now, becauſe the value of it would be doubled, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently our attachment to it increaſed; for it is not the number of dollars a man has, but how far they will go, that makes him either rich or poor.</p>
            <p>THESE two points being admitted, viz, that the quantity of money is too great, and that the prices of goods can be only ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually reduced by reducing the quantity of the money, the next point to be conſidered is, The method how to reduce it?</p>
            <p>THE circumſtances of the times, as before obſerved, require that the public characters of all men ſhould <hi>now</hi> be fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and the only general method of aſcertaining it is by an oath or affirmation, renouncing all allegiance to the king of Great-Britain, and to ſupport the Independency of the United States as declared by Congreſs. Let, at the ſame time, a tax of
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:015494_0031_0F99867C635B0680"/>
ten, fifteen or twenty per cent per annum, to be collected quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, be levied on all property. Theſe alternatives, by being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly voluntary, will take in all ſorts of people. Here is the teſt; here is the tax. He who takes the former, conſcientiouſly proves his affection to the cauſe, and binds himſelf to pay his quota by the beſt <hi>ſervices</hi> in his power, and is thereby juſtly exempt from the latter; and thoſe who chuſe the latter, pay their quota in money, to be excuſed from taking the former, or rather 'tis the price paid to us for their ſuppoſed, though miſtaken, inſurance with the enemy.</p>
            <p>BUT this is only a part of the advantage which would ariſe by knowing the different characters of men. The Whigs ſtake every thing on the iſſue of their arms, while the Tories, by their diſaffection, are ſapping and undermining their ſtrength, and, of conſequence, the property of the Whigs is the more expoſed thereby; and whatever injury their eſtates may ſuſtain by the movements of the enemy, muſt either be borne by themſelves, who have done every thing which have <hi>yet</hi> been done, or by the Tories, who have not only done nothing, but have by their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection, invited the enemy on.</p>
            <p>IN the preſent criſis we ought to know ſquare by ſquare, and houſe by houſe, who are in real allegiance with the United In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent States, and who are not. Let but the line be made clear and diſtinct, and all men will then know what they are to truſt to. It would not only be good policy, but ſtrict juſtice, to raiſe fifty or an hundred thouſand pounds, or more, if it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, out of the eſtates and property of the king of England's vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, reſident in Philadelphia, to be diſtributed, as a reward to thoſe inhabitants of the city and State, who ſhould turn out and repulſe the enemy, ſhould they attempt their march this way; and likewiſe, to bind the property of all ſuch perſons to make good the damages which that of the Whigs might ſuſtain. In the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhable mode of conducting a war, we frequently make repriſals at ſea, on the veſſels of perſons in England who are friends to our cauſe compared with the reſidentiary Tories among us.</p>
            <p>IN every former publication of mine, from Common Senſe down to the laſt Criſis, I have generally gone on the charitable ſuppoſition, that the Tories were rather a miſtaken than a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal people, and have applied argument after argument with all the candour and temper I was capable of, in order to ſet every part of the caſe clearly and fairly before them, and if poſſible to reclaim them from ruin to reaſon. I have done my duty by them
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:015494_0032_0F99867D2355AF50"/>
and have now done with that doctrine, taking it for granted, that thoſe who yet hold their diſaffection, are, either a ſet of avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious miſcreants, who would ſacrifice the Continent to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or a banditti of hungry traitors, who are hoping for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the ſpoil. To which may be added, a liſt of Crown or Proprietary dependents, who, rather than go without a portion of power, would be content to ſhare it with the devil. Of ſuch men there is no hope; and their obedience will only be according to the danger that is ſet before them, and the power that is exerciſed over them.</p>
            <p>A time will ſhortly arrive, in which, by aſcertaining the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of perſons now, we ſhall be guarded againſt their miſchiefs then; for in proportion as the enemy deſpair of conqueſt, they will be trying the arts of ſeduction and the force of fear by all the miſchiefs they can inflict. But in war we may be certain of theſe two things, viz. that cruelty in an enemy, and motions made with more than uſual parade, are always ſigns of weakneſs. He that can conquer, finds his mind too free and pleaſant to be brutiſh; and he that intends to conquer, never makes too much ſhow of his ſtrength.</p>
            <p>WE now know the enemy we have to do with. While drunk with the certainty of victory they diſdained to be civil; and in proportion as diſappointment makes them ſober, and their apprehenſions of the European war alarm them, they will become cringing and artful; honeſt they cannot be. But our anſwer to them, in either condition they may be in, is ſhort and full, <q>As Free and Independent States we are willing to make peace with you to-morrow, but we can neither hear nor reply in any other character.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IF Britain cannot conquer us, it proves, that ſhe is neither able to govern or protect us, and our particular ſituation now is ſuch, that any connection with her would be unwiſely exchanging a half defeated enemy for two powerful ones. Europe, by every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and information, is now on the eve, nay, on the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twilight of a war, and any alliance with <hi>George the Third</hi> brings <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> upon our backs; a ſeparation from him attach them to our ſide; therefore, the only road to <hi>Peace, Honour</hi> and <hi>Commerce</hi> is INDEPENDENCE.</p>
