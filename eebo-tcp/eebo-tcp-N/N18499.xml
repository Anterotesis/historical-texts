            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I AM very well aware what different effects the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing this Letter againſt dear Mr. Weſley's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, will produce. Many of my friends who are ſtrenuous advocates for <hi>Univerſal Redemption,</hi> will be immediately offended. Many that are zealous on the other ſide, will much rejoice. Thoſe that are luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm on both ſides, and are carried away with <hi>carnal Reaſoning,</hi> will wiſh this matter had never been brought under debate. The reaſons I have given at the beginning of the Letter, I think, are ſufficient to ſatisfy all. I deſire therefore that thoſe who hold <hi>Election,</hi> would not triumph or make a party on the one hand: (For I deteſt any ſuch thing) And that thoſe who are prejudiced againſt that doctrine, would not be too much concerned or offended on the other. Known unto God are all his ways from the beginning of the world. The great day will diſcover why the Lord permits dear Mr. Weſley and me, to be of a different way of thinking. And I cannot expreſs my ſelf better in reſpect to this, than in the words of a Letter which I lately received from his own dear hands.</p>

                  <p>I Thank you for yours, May <hi>24.</hi> The caſe is quite plain. There are bigots both for <hi>Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> and againſt it. God is ſending a meſſage to

thoſe on either ſide: but neither will receive it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs from one who is of their own opinion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for a time you are ſuffered to be of one opinion, and I of another. But when his time is come, God will do what man cannot, namely, make us both of one mind. Then perſecution will flame out; and it will be ſeen whether we count our lives dear unto ourſelves, ſo that we may finiſh our courſe with joy.</p>

               <salute>Rev. and very dear Brother!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>GOD only knows what unſpeakable ſorrow of heart I have felt on your account ever ſince I left England laſt. Whither it be my infirmity or not, I frankly confeſs that never did Jonah go with more reluctance againſt Nineveh, than I now take pen in hand to write againſt you. Was nature to ſpeak, I had rather die than do it: and yet if I am faithful to God, and to my own and others ſouls, I muſt not ſtand neuter any longer. I am well aware how our adverſaries will rejoice to ſee us differing among ourſelves. But what can I ſay? The Children of God are in danger of falling into error. Nay, numbers have been miſled, whom God was pleaſed to work upon by my miniſtry; and a great number ſtill are calling aloud upon <hi>me</hi> alſo to ſhew my opinion. I muſt then ſhew that I know no man after the fleſh, and that I have no reſpect of perſons any farther than is conſiſtent with my duty to my Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This letter alſo will undoubtedly loſe me many
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023998_0006_0FC2EC94B8D8EAE0"/>
friends. But for this cauſe among others, perhaps God ſtirs me up to write it, viz. to ſee whether I will forſake all for him or not. I think I have truth and ſcripture on my ſide. I think it my duty to be ſimple and conſiſtent, and leave the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of all to God.</p>
            <p>I fear I have been ſinfully ſilent too long. For ſome time before, and eſpecially ſince my laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from England, both in publick and private, by preaching and printing, you have been propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the doctrine of Univerſal Redemption; and therefore, if Paul reproved Peter for his Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, (dear and honored Sir) O be not angry with me, if I deliver my ſoul in telling you that I think in this you nearly err.</p>
            <p>'Tis not my deſign to enter into a long debate on GOD's decrees. I refer you to Dr. Edwards's Veritas Redux; who I think is unanſwerable, except in a certain point, concerning a middle ſort between elect and reprobate, which he himſelf in effect afterwards condemns. I muſt firſt inform you, that I think you had no call to be ſo explicit in the doctrine of univerſal redemption.</p>
            <p>If I miſtake not when at Briſtol, you received a letter from a private hand, charging you with not preaching the goſpel, becauſe you did not preach up election. Upon this you drew a lot. The anſwer was, "preach and print." I have often queſtioned as I do now, whether in ſo doing you did not tempt the Lord? Common prudence without a lot would have directed you in that matter.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I never heard that you inquired of GOD, whether or not election was a goſpel doctrine?
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023998_0007_0FC2ECA4A47F6DF8"/>
But I fear taking it for granted it was not—you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inquired, whether you ſhould be ſilent, or preach and print againſt it. However this be, the lot came out, preach and print. Accordingly, you preached and printed againſt election. At my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you ſuppreſſed the publiſhing the ſermon 'till I left England; but ſoon after ſent it into the world after my departure. Oh that you had kept it in! If that ſermon was printed in anſwer to a lot, I can give no other reaſon why God ſhould ſuffer you to be deceived, unleſs that thereby a door might be opened hereafter for preaching up election: and that God might give me another opportunity, as he once did, by giving you ſuch another lot at<note n="*" place="bottom">The morning I ſailed from Deal for Gibraltar, Mr. Weſley arrived from Georgia. Inſtead of coming on board to converſe with me, though the ſhip was not far off the ſhore he drew a lot, and immediately ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for London. Behind him he leaves a letter for me, in which were words to this effect. <q>When I ſaw GOD, by the wind which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying you out, brought me in, I aſked counſel of GOD. His anſwer, you have encloſed.</q> This was a piece of paper in which were written theſe words. "Let him return to London." When I received this a good man telling me he had caſt a lot, and that GOD would have me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to London. On the other hand, I knew that my call was to Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, and that I had taken leave of London, and could not juſtly go from the ſoldiers who were committed to my charge. I betook myſelf with a friend to prayer. That paſſage in the firſt book of Kings, chap. xiii. where we are told "that the prophet was ſlain by a Lion, that tempted to go back contrary to God's expreſs order, upon another prophet's telling him that God would have him do ſo—This paſſage, I ſay, was powerfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon my ſoul.—I wrote dear Mr. Weſley word that I could not return to London. We ſailed immediately. Some months after I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a letter from him at Georgia, wherein he wrote in words to this effect, "Tho' GOD never before gave me a wrong lot, yet perhaps he ſuffered me to have ſuch a lot at that time to try what was in your heart." I ſhould never have publiſhed this private tranſaction to the world, did not the glory of God call me to it. It is plain that dear Mr. Weſley had a wrong lot given him here, and juſtly, becauſe he tempted God in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one. And thus I believe it is in the preſent caſe. And if ſo, let not the children of God, who are mine and Mr. Weſley's intimate friends, and are ſuch advocates for Univerſal Redemption, think that doctrine true, becauſe dear Mr. Weſley preach'd it up in compliance with a lot given out from God.</note> Deal, of ſeeing what was in my heart, and whether I would be faithful to his cauſe or not. Oh that it may be alſo for the conviction of dear Mr. Weſley; that we may both think and ſpeak the ſame things, and conſequently be better qualified to build up thoſe ſouls that have been lately awaken'd, in their moſt holy faith!</p>
            <p>This I think may ſerve as an anſwer to the firſt part of the preface to your printed ſermon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſay, <q>Nothing but the ſtrongeſt conviction,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023998_0008_0FC2ECA5CA5147F8"/>
not only that what is here advanced is the truth as it is in Jeſus, but alſo that I am indiſpenſably obliged to declare this truth to all the world, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That you believe what you have wrote is truth, and that you honeſtly aim at GOD's glory in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I do not in the leaſt doubt. But then, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored Sir, if by tempting GOD, in caſting a lot, as before mentioned, you have thought yourſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably obliged to publiſh your ſermon againſt predeſtination, I think, in this you have been much miſtaken.</p>
            <p>But farther; as you have been unhappy in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at all, ſo you have been unhappy alſo in the choice of your text. Honored Sir! how could it enter into your heart to chuſe a text to diſprove the doctrine of election, out of the eighth of the Romans? Where the doctrine is ſo plainly aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that once talking with a Quaker, upon this ſubject, he had no other way of evading the force of the Apoſtle's aſſertion, than by ſaying, I believe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023998_0009_0FC2ECA7419EA858"/>
Paul was in the wrong. Another friend lately, who was once highly prejudiced againſt election, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly confeſs'd, that he uſed to think, St. Paul himſelf was miſtaken, or that he was not truly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
            <p>Indeed, honored Sir, it is plain beyond all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that St. Paul, thro' the whole eighth chapter of the Romans, is ſpeaking of the priviliges of thoſe only who are really in Chriſt. And let any unprejudiced perſon, read what goes before, and what follows your text, and he muſt confeſs the word ALL only ſignifies, thoſe that are in Chriſt; and the latter part of the text, plainly proves what I find dear Mr. Weſley will by no means grant, I mean, the final perſeverance of the children of GOD. <hi>He that ſpareth not his own Son, but deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> Viz. Grace to perſevere, and every thing neceſſary to bring us ſafely home to our heavenly father's kingdom.</p>
            <p>Had I a mind to prove election and final perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, I know not that I could chuſe a better text than you have choſen to diſprove it. One that does not know you, would ſuſpect you. You yourſelf were ſenſible of this. For after the firſt paragraph I ſcarce know whether you have mentioned it, ſo much as once, through your whole diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>But your diſcourſe, in my opinion, is as little to the purpoſe as your text; and inſtead of warping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> does but more and more confirm me in the Belief of the doctrine of GOD's <hi>eternal election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not mention how illogically you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. Had you wrote clearly, you ſhould firſt,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023998_0010_0FC2ECA8B3D34DB0"/>
honored Sir, have proved your propoſition. That GOD's grace is free to all; and then by way of inference, exclaimed againſt what you call the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible decree. But you knew people (becauſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſm of late, has ſo much abounded among us) were generally prejudiced againſt the doctrine of reprobation, and therefore thought, if you kept up their diſlike of that, you would overthrow the doctrine of election entirely. For, without doubt, the doctrine of election and reprobation muſt ſtand or fall togther.</p>
            <p>But paſſing by this, as alſo your equivocal defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the word grace, and your falſe definition of the word free; that I may be as ſhort as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I frankly acknowledge, I believe the doctrine of reprobation; and that God intends only to give a certain number ſaving grace, thro' Jeſus Chriſt, and that the reſt of mankind are left to periſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the imputation of Adam's guilt, and will be damned for that and their actual ſins. This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed doctrine of ſcripture, and of the XVIIth article of the church of England; as biſhop Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net himſelf confeſſes. Dear Mr. Weſley abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denies them both. And why?</p>
            <p>
               <q>For if this be ſo, (ſays he, page the 10th, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph the 9th) then is all preaching vain.— It is needleſs to them that are elected. For they whether with preaching or without, will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſaved. Therefore the end of preaching, to ſave ſouls, is void with regard to them. And it is uſeleſs to them that are not elected. For they cannot poſſibly be ſaved. They, whether with preaching or without, will infalliably be
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023998_0011_0FC2ECB0536940E8"/>
damned. The end of preaching is therefore void with regard to them likewiſe. So that in either caſe, our preaching is vain, as your hearing is alſo vain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>O dear Sir! What kind of reaſoning, or rather ſophiſtry, is this? Hath not God, who hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſalvation for a certain number, appointed alſo the preaching of the word as a means to bring them to ſalvation? Does any one hold election in any other ſenſe? And if ſo, how is preaching needleſs to them that are elected, when it is deſigned by God, to be the power of God unto their eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? And, ſince we know not who are elect and who reprobate, we are to preach promiſcuouſly to all. If it be uſeleſs to the reprobate, it is no more than what God deſigned to permit. It's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that all are brought home by it that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You ſay, page the 11th, <q>That it, viz. the doctrine of election and reprobation, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tends to deſtroy that holineſs which is the end of all the ordinances of God.</q> For, (ſays the dear miſtaken Mr. Weſley) <q>it wholly takes away thoſe firſt motives to follow after it, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently propoſed in ſcripture. The hope of future rewards, and fear of puniſhments, the hopes of heaven, and the fear of hell, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I thought one that carrys perfection to ſuch an exlated pitch as dear Mr. Weſley does, would know a true lover of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, would ſtrive to be holy for the ſake of being holy, and work for Chriſt out of love and gratitude, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the reward of heaven or fear of hell. You
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023998_0012_0FC2ECB4F0963798"/>
remember, dear ſir, what Scougal ſays—Love's a more powerful motive that does them move.</p>
            <p>But paſſing by this, and granting that rewards and puniſhments (as they certainly are) may be motives, from which a chriſtian may be honeſtly ſtirred up to act for God; how does the doctrine of election deſtroy thoſe motives? Do not the elect know that the more good works they do, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will be their reward? And is it not that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement enough to ſet them upon, and cauſe them to perſevere in working for Jeſus Chriſt?— And how does the doctrine of election deſtroy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? Whoever preached any other election than what the Apoſtle preached, when he ſaid, Choſen thro' ſanctification of the ſpirit? Nay, is not holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made a mark of our election by all that preach it? And how then can election deſtroy holineſs?</p>
            <p>The inſtance which you bring, page 11, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate your aſſertion, indeed, dear ſir, is quite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent; for you ſay, <q>If a ſick man knows, that he muſt unavoidably die, or unavoidably reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; though he knows not which, it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to take any phyſick at all.</q> Dear Sir! what abſurd reaſoning is here? Was you ever ſick in your life? If ſo, did not the bare proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or poſſibility of your recovering though you knew it was unalterably fixed that you muſt live or die, encourage you to take phyſick? For how did you know but that very phyſick might be the means God intended to recover you by? Juſt thus it is in the doctrine of election. I know that it is unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably fixed that I muſt be damned, or ſaved. But ſince I know not which, for a certainty, why ſhould
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023998_0013_0FC2ECBDD228BA38"/>
I not ſtrive, though in a ſtate of nature, ſince I know not but this ſtriving may be the means God has intended to bleſs in order to bring me into a ſtate of grace? Dear ſir! conſider theſe things— Make an impartial application, and then judge what little reaſon you had to conclude the 10th paragraph, page the 12th, in theſe words,—<q>So directly does this doctrine tend to ſhut the very gate of holineſs in general, to hinder unholy men, from ever approaching thereto or ſtriving to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in thereat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As directly, ſay you, (paragraph 11th) <q>does this doctrine tend to deſtroy ſeveral particular bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of holineſs—ſuch as meekneſs, love, &amp;c.</q> I ſhall ſay little in anſwer to this paragraph. Dear Mr. Weſley, perhaps has been diſputing with ſome warm narrow-ſpirited men, that held election, and then infers that their warmth and narrowneſs of ſpirit are owing to their principles. Does not Mr. Weſley know many dear children of God who are predeſtinarians, and yet are meek, lowly, pitiful, courteous, tender-hearted, of a catholick Spirit, and kind, and have hope even of the moſt vile?— And why? Becauſe they know God ſaved them by an act of his electing love, and they know not but he may have elected thoſe who are now even the moſt abandoned. But, dear ſir, we muſt not judge of the truth of principles in general, nor of this of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in particular, entirely from people's practice: If ſo, I am ſure more might be ſaid againſt you. For I appeal to your heart, whether you do not feel a narrow-ſpiritedneſs towards, and ſome diſunion of ſoul from thoſe that hold particular redemption.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023998_0014_0FC2ECBF385C6BC8"/>
If ſo, then according to your own rule, Univerſal Redemption is wrong, becauſe it deſtroys ſeveral branches of holineſs—ſuch as meekneſs, love, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The apoſtle St. Paul was not of your opinion,— For, Col. iii. 12, 13,—he ſays, <q>Putting on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as the elect of God, holy and beloved) bowels of mercy, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering; forbearing one another and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any; even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye.</q> Here we ſee that the apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them to put on bowels of mercy, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, &amp;c. Upon this conſideration, namely, becauſe they were the elect of God. And all who have experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally felt this doctrine in their heart, will feel that theſe graces are the genuine effects of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elected of God.</p>
            <p>But perhaps dear Mr. Weſley may be miſtaken in this point, and call that paſſion, which is only zeal for God's truths. You know, dear ſir, the apoſtle exhorts us to contend earneſtly for the faith once delivered to the ſaints; and therefore you muſt not condemn all who appear warm for the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of election, as narrow-ſpirited, or perſecutors, becauſe they think it their duty to oppoſe you. I am ſure I love you in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt. I think I could lay down my life for your ſake; but yet, dear ſir, I cannot avoid oppoſing you ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly in this point, becauſe I think you warmly, tho' I really believe not deſignedly oppoſe the truth as it is in Jeſus.—May the Lord remove the ſcales of prejudice from off the eyes of your mind, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023998_0015_0FC2ECC0B965E0D0"/>
give you a zeal according to true chriſtian knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Says your Sermon, page 13, paragraph the 12th; <q>This doctrine tends to deſtroy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of religion, the happineſs of chriſtianity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But how does Mr. Weſley know this, who never believed election? I believe they who have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced it will agree with our XVIIth article, That <q>the godly conſideration of predeſtination and our election in Chriſt, is full of ſweet pleaſures, and unſpeakable comfort to godly perſons, and ſuch as feel in themſelves the working of the ſpirit of Chriſt, mortifying the works of the fleſh, and their earthly members, and drawing their minds to high and heavenly things; as well becauſe it does greatly eſtabliſh and confirm their faith of eternal ſalvation, to be enjoyed through Chriſt; as becauſe it doth firmly kindle their love towards God:</q> which plainly ſhews that our godly refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers did not think election deſtroyed holineſs, or the comforts of religion. As for my own part, this doctrine is my daily ſupport,—I ſhould utterly ſink under a ſenſe of my impending trials, was I not firmly perſuaded Chriſt had choſen me from before the foundation of the world, and therefore will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing to pluck me finally out of his almighty hands.</p>
            <p>You proceed thus, <q>This is evident to all thoſe that believe themſelves to be reprobate; or only ſuſpect or fear it. All the great and precious promiſes are loſt to them;—they afford them no ray of comfort.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And would dear Mr. Weſley give comfort, or
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023998_0016_0FC2ECC25307AC70"/>
dare to apply the precious promiſes of the goſpel, (that children's bread) to men in a natural ſtate? God forbid! What if the doctrine of election and reprobation does put ſome upon doubting? Is not this a good means to put them upon ſtriving; and that ſtriving a good means to make their calling, and thereby their election ſure? This is one reaſon among many others, why I admire the doctrine of election. It has a natural tendency to rouſe the ſoul out of its carnal ſecurity: and therefore ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny carnal men cry out againſt it. Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption has a natural tendency to keep the ſoul in its carnal ſecurity; and therefore ſo many natural men admire and applaud it.</p>
            <p>Your three following paragraphs, 13, 14, 15, come next to be conſidered. <q>The witneſs of the Spirit, (you ſay, paragraph 14, page 14) experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhews to be much obſtructed by this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</q> But, dear ſir, whoſe experience? Not your own: for in your laſt journal, you ſeem to acknowledge you have it not; and therefore you are no proper judge in this matter. You muſt mean the experience of others; for you ſay, in the ſame paragraph, <q>Even in thoſe that have taſted of that good gift, who have yet ſoon loſt it again (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you mean loſt the ſenſe of it again) and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len back into doubts, and fears, and darkneſs, even horrible darkneſs that might be felt, &amp;c.</q> And was not this the caſe of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, after that he had received the Holy Ghoſt? Was he not led by the Spirit into the wilderneſs to be tempted of the devil? Was not his ſoul exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorrowful, even unto death, in the garden?—
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023998_0017_0FC2ECD28AC42638"/>
And was he not ſurrounded with an horrible dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even "a darkneſs that might be felt,"—when on the croſs, he cried out, My God! my God! why haſt thou forſaken me? And that his followers muſt expect the ſame, is it not evident from ſcripture? For, ſays the apoſtle, he was tempted in all things, like unto his brethren, that he might be able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour thoſe that are tempted. And why then ſhould perſons falling into darkneſs, after they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the witneſs of the Spirit, be any arguments againſt the doctrine of election? <q>Yes, you ſay, many, very many of thoſe that hold it not in all parts of the earth, have enjoyed the uninterrupted witneſs of the Spirit, the continual light of God's countenance, from the moment wherein they firſt believed, for many months and years to this very day.</q> But how does dear Mr. Weſley know this? Has he conſulted the experience of many, very many in all parts of the earth? Or ſuppoſing he had, does it follow that their being kept in this light, is owing to their not believing the Doctrine of election? No, this, according to the ſentiments of our church, <q>greatly confirms and eſtabliſhes a true chriſtian's faith of eternal ſalvation through Chriſt,</q> and is an anchor of hope both ſure and ſtedfaſt when he walks in darkneſs and ſees no light; as a true chriſtian certainly may do, after he has received the witneſs of the ſpirit, whatever you or others may unadviſedly aſſert to the contrary. Then to have reſpect to God's everlaſting covenant and throw himſelf upon the free diſtinguiſhing love of that God who changeth not; this I ſay, makes him to lift up the hands that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023998_0018_0FC2ECD4A6615910"/>
hang down, and ſtrengthens his feeble knees.— Without believing the doctrine of election I cannot ſee how we can arrive at a full aſſurance of faith: an aſſurance that <q>all my paſt ſins are forgiven, and that I am now a child of God;</q> but may hereafter, for all that I know, become a child of the devil, and be caſt into hell at laſt; is no aſſurance at all, at leaſt not a full aſſurance. No, a full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith makes the ſoul give men and devils the challenge, not only for the preſent, but for the future. Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is Chriſt that juſtifies me, who is he that condemns me? It is Chriſt that died; yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right-hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for me. Who ſhall ſeperate me from the love of Chriſt? Shall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword: Nay in all theſe things I am more than conqueror through him that loved me. For I am perſuaded that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeperate me from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus my Lord.</p>
            <p>This, dear Sir, is the triumphant language of every ſoul that has attained a full aſſurance of faith. And this aſſurance can only ariſe from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of God's electing everlaſting love. That many have an aſſurance that they are in Chriſt to day, but take no thought for, or are not aſſured that they ſhall be in him to-morrow, nay, to all eternity, is rather their imperfections and unhappineſs, than
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023998_0019_0FC2ECD610FEA5A0"/>
their privilege. I pray God bring all ſuch to a ſenſe of his eternal love, that they may no longer build upon their own faithfulneſs, but on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs of that God whoſe gifts and calling are without repentance; for thoſe whom God has once juſtified he alſo will glorify.</p>
            <p>I obſerved before, dear ſir, it is not always a ſafe rule to judge of the truth of principles from people's practice. And therefore, ſuppoſe all that hold Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Redemption, in your way of explaining it, after they receiv'd ſaith, enjoy the continual unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted light of God's countenance, it does not follow that this is a fruit of their principle: for that I am ſure has a natural tendency to keep the ſoul in darkneſs forever—becauſe the creature is thereby taught, that his being kept in a ſtate of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is owing to his own free-will: and what a ſandy foundation is that for a poor creature to build his hopes of perſeverance upon? Every relapſe into ſin, every ſurprize by temptation, muſt throw him <q>into doubts and fears, into horrible darkneſs, even darkneſs that might be felt.</q> Hence it is that the letters which have been lately ſent me by thoſe who hold Univerſal Redemption, are dead, lifeleſs, dry and inconſiſtant, in compariſon of thoſe I receive from perſons on the contrary ſide. Thoſe on the one ſide, though they might begin in the ſpirit (whatever they may ſay to the contrary) are ending in the fleſh, and building up a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs founded on their own free-will. Whilſt the others triumph in hopes of the glory of God; and built upon God's never-fading promiſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, love, even when his ſenſible preſence
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023998_0020_0FC2ECDDEF10B8A8"/>
is withdrawn from them. But I would not judge of the truth of election by the experience of any particular perſons: If I did (Oh bear with me in this fooliſhneſs of boaſting) I think I my ſelf might glory in election. For theſe five or ſix years I have received the witneſs of God's Spirit; and ſince that I have not doubted a quarter of an hour of my having a ſaving intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt. But I have fallen into ſin ſince that; and tho I lay the blame wholly on my own wicked heart, yet, perhaps it was permitted that I might confute thoſe who hold a man cannot commit ſin after he is born again. I have been alſo in heavineſs through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold temptations, and expect to be often ſo again before I die. Thus was St. Paul himſelf. Thus was Luther, that man of God, who did not hold election: and the great John Arndt, was in the utmoſt perplexity a quarter of an hour before he died, and yet he was no predeſtinarian; and if I muſt ſpeak freely I believe your writing ſo ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly againſt the doctrine of election, and pleading up a ſinleſs perfection, is one great cauſe why you are kept out of the liberties of the goſpel, and that full aſſurance of faith which thoſe enjoy who have experimentally taſted, and daily feed upon God's electing everlaſting love.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you may ſay, That Luther and Arndt were no chriſtians. I know you think meanly of Abraham and David; and have wrote me word, <q>That no baptiſt or preſbyterian writer whom you have read, knew any thing of the liberties of Chriſt.</q> See, dear Sir, what narrow-ſpiritedneſs and want of charity ariſes from your principles:
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023998_0021_0FC2ECE162BB0978"/>
and then do not cry out againſt election any more on account of its being "deſtructive of meekneſs and love."</p>
            <p>To proceed. Again, ſays the dear Mr. Weſley, page 15, paragraph the 16th, <q>How uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thought is this, That thouſands and milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, without any preceeding offence or fault of theirs, were unchangeably doomed to everlaſting burnings?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But whoever aſſerted, that thouſands and milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, without any preceeding offence or fault of theirs, were unchangeably doom'd to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings? Do not thoſe who plead up for God's dooming men to everlaſting burnings, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God looks upon them as men fallen in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam? How then are they doomed without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fault? Surely Mr. Weſley will own God's juſtice in imputing Adam's ſin to his poſterity: And alſo that after Adam fell, and his poſterity in him, God might juſtly have paſſed them all by without ſending any one of them a Saviour. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you own both theſe things, you do not believe original ſin aright. If you do own them, you muſt acknowledge the doctrine of election and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be reaſonable. For if God might juſtly have imputed Adam's ſin to all, and afterwards have paſſed by all, he might juſtly paſs by ſome.— Turn either on the right hand or on the left, you are reduced to an inextricable dilemma.</p>
            <p>Your 17th paragraph, page 16, I paſs over.— What has been ſaid on paragraph the 9th and 10th, with little alteration, will anſwer it. I ſhall only ſay, 'tis the doctrine of election that moſtly preſſes
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023998_0022_0FC2ECE27709DFD0"/>
me to abound in good works: I am made willing to ſuffer all things for the elect's ſake. This makes me preach with comfort becauſe I know ſalvation does not depend on men's free-will, but the Lord makes a willing people in the day of his power, and may make uſe of me to bring ſome of his elect home.</p>
            <p>But fifthly, you ſay, paragraph the 18th page 17, <q>this doctrine has a direct and manifeſt tendency to overthrow the whole chriſtian religion. For, ſay you, ſuppoſing that eternal unchangeable decree, one part of mankind muſt be ſaved, tho' the chriſtian Revelation were not in being.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, dear ſir, how does that follow, ſince it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the chriſtian Revelation, that we are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God's deſign in reſpect to mankind?— And how then has the doctrine of election a direct tendency to overthrow the whole chriſtian Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? For, has not God intended this Revelation as a means to bring his elect home? And how then in holding this doctrine, do we join with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern unbelievers, in making the chriſtian Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unneceſſary? No, dear ſir; you miſtake— Infidels of all kinds are on your ſide the queſtion. Deiſts, Arians, Socinians, arraign God's ſovereignty and ſtand up for universal redemption. I pray God dear Mr. Weſley's Sermon, as it has grieved the hearts of many of God's dear children, it may not alſo ſtrengthen the hands of many of God's profeſs'd enemies! Here I could almoſt ſit down and weep. O tell it not in Gath! Publiſh it not in the ſtreets of Aſkalon; leſt the daughters of the uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed rejoice, leſt the ſons of unbelief triumph!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:023998_0023_0FC2ECEA372DABE0"/>Further, you ſay, page 18, paragraph 19, <q>this doctrine makes Revelation contradict itſelf.</q>— For inſtance; ſay you, the aſſerters of this doctrine interpret that text of ſcripture, "Jacob have I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but Eſau have I hated," as implying that God "in a literal ſenſe, hated Eſau and all the reprobate from eternity." And when conſidered as fallen in Adam, were they not objects of his hatred? And might not God, of his own good pleaſure, love or ſhew mercy to Jacob, and the elect, and yet, at the ſame time, do the reprobate no wrong? But you ſay, "God is love." And cannot God be love, unleſs he ſhews the ſame mercy to all?</p>
            <p>Again, ſays dear Mr. Weſley, "they infer from that text, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, that God is love only to ſome men, viz. the elect; and that he hath mercy for thoſe only:— Flatly contrary to which is the whole tenor of the ſcripture, as is that expreſs declaration in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: The Lord is loving to every man, and his mercies are over all his works." And ſo they are; but not his ſaving mercy. God is loving to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man; he ſends his rain upon the evil, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good. But you ſay, "God is no reſpecter of perſons." No. For every one, whether Jew or Gentile, that believeth on Jeſus, and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted of him. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe texts in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, God will have mercy on whom he will have mercy; nay, I will add, and whom he will he hardeneth.</p>
            <p>You go on, page 20. "Again, from that text, the children being not yet born, neither having done good or evil, that the purpoſe of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023998_0024_0FC2ECEE42B57370"/>
to election might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth, it was ſaid unto her (unto Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca) the elder ſhall ſerve the younger; they, (i. e. Predeſtinarians) infer that our predeſtination, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, no way depends on the fore-knowledge of God." But who infers this, dear ſir! For, if by fore-knowledge, you mean fore-knowledge as it ſignifies approbation, (as it does in ſeveral parts of ſcripture,) then we confeſs that predeſtination and election do depend on God's fore-knowledge. But if by God's fore-knowledge, you underſtand God's foreſeeing ſome good works done by his creatures, and therefore electing them, then we ſay, that in this ſenſe, predeſtination does not any way depend on God's fore-knowledge. But I referred you at the beginning of this letter to Dr. Edwards. Read his <hi>Veritas Redux,</hi> which I recommended to you in a late letter, with Eliſha Cole on God's ſovereignty. Be pleaſed to read thoſe; and alſo Mr. Cooper's ſermons of Boſton, which I likewiſe ſent you, and I doubt not but you will ſee all your objections an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Though I would obſerve that after all our reading on both ſides the queſtion, we ſhall never in this life be able to ſearch out God's decrees to perfection: No; we muſt humbly adore, what we cannot comprehend; and with the great Apoſtle, at the end of our inquiries, cry out, O the depth! &amp;c. Or with our Lord, when he was admiring God's ſovereignty, even ſo father, for ſo it ſeemeth good in thy ſight.</p>
            <p>However it may not be amiſs to take notice that if thoſe texts <q>God willeth that none ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</q> "I have no pleaſure in him that dieth,"
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023998_0025_0FC2ECF1442CAE08"/>
and ſuch like, be taken in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, then no one will be damned. For God may prevent every one's damnation if he pleaſes, and cannot but in one ſenſe, be ſaid to will it, becauſe he might have prevented it if he would.</p>
            <p>But here's the diſtinction,—God taketh no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of ſinners, ſo as to delight ſimply in their death; tho' he delights to magnify his juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in their death. As a judge may take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in condemning a criminal, and yet juſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to be executed (though in his power to procure him a reprieve) in order that they may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the juſtice of the law.</p>
            <p>I could hint farther, that you unjuſtly charge the doctrine of reprobation with blaſphemy. But the doctrine of univerſal redemption, in your ſenſe, is really blaſphemous. For judge, whether it be not blaſphemy to ſay, as you do, page 20. <q>Chriſt not only died for thoſe that are ſaved, but alſo for thoſe that periſh.</q> The text you have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied, to gloſs over this, ſee it explained by Ridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Edwards and Henry. I purpoſely omit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering this and ſome other texts myſelf, that you may be brought to read ſuch treatiſes, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, would ſhow you your error. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, indeed ſir, you cannot make good the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "that Chriſt died for them that periſh," without holding (as <note n="*" place="bottom">One of the Moravian Brethren.</note> Peter Bolcher, in order to make out univerſal redemption, lately frankly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in a letter) that all the damned ſouls would hereafter be brought out of hell. I cannot think
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023998_0026_0FC2ECF2360A6578"/>
Mr. Weſley thus minded. And yet without this can be proved, univerſal redemption, taken in a literal ſenſe, falls entirely to the ground. For how can all be univerſally redeemed, if all are not finally ſaved?</p>
            <p>Dear ſir! for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, conſider how you diſhonor God. By denying election you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make man's ſalvation depend not on God's free grace, but man's free will. And if ſo, Jeſus Chriſt died at a venture, and perhaps would not have had one ſoul as the purchaſe of his blood. Our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would then be vain, and our invitations to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to believe would be in vain alſo.</p>
            <p>But, bleſſed be God!—Our Lord knew for whom he died. There was an eternal compact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the father, and the ſon. A certain number was then given him, as the purchaſe of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and death. For theſe he prayed, John xvii. —and not for the world. For theſe, and theſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is now interceeding; and with their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he will be fully ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>I purpoſely omit making any further remarks on the ſeveral laſt pages of your ſermon. Indeed, had not your name, dear ſir, been prefixed to the ſermon, I could not have been ſo uncharitable as to think you were the author of ſuch ſophiſtry. You beg the queſtion, in ſaying, "that God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared (notwithſtanding you own, I ſuppoſe, ſome will be damned) that he will ſave all, i. e. every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſon." You take it for granted, (for ſolid proof you have none) that he is unjuſt if he paſſes by any: and then you exclaim againſt the horrible decree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:023998_0027_0FC2ECF3C01D8698"/>Dear, dear ſir! O be not offended! for Chriſt's ſake be not raſh! give yourſelf to reading; ſtudy the covenant of grace; down with your carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning; be a little child! And then inſtead of pawning your ſalvation, as you have done in a late hymn-book, if the doctrine of univerſal redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not true; inſtead of talking of ſinleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as you have done in the preface of that book, and making man's ſalvation depend on his own free will, as you have in this ſermon; you will compoſe a hymn in praiſe of ſovereign diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love. You will caution believers againſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a perfection out of their own hearts, and print another ſermon, the reverſe of this, and entitle it, Free Grace. Free, not becauſe free to all: but free, becauſe God may withhold or give it to whom and when he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>Till you do this, I muſt doubt whether you know yourſelf. In the mean while I cannot but blame you for cenſuring the clergy of our church for not keeping to their articles, when you yourſelf by your principles; poſitively deny the 9th, 10th, and 18th. Dear ſir! theſe things ought not to be ſo. God knows my heart! As I told you before, ſo I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare again, nothing but a ſingle regard to the honor of Chriſt had forced the letter from me. I love and honor you for his ſake; and when I come to judgment, I may thank you before men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, for what you have, under God, done for my ſoul.</p>
            <p>There I am perſuaded, I ſhall ſee dear Mr. Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley convinced of election and everlaſting love. And it often fills me with pleaſure, to think how I
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023998_0028_0FC2ED011C5839C0"/>
ſhall behold you caſting your crown down at the feet of the lamb, and as it were filled with a holy bluſhing, for oppoſing the divine ſovereignty in the manner you have done.</p>
            <p>But I hope the Lord will ſhew you this before you go hence. O how do I long for that day! If the Lord ſhould be pleaſed to make uſe of this letter for that purpoſe, it would abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice the heart of</p>
