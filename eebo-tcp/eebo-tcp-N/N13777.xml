            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE invaſion of our country by the enemy at the cloſe of the late ſeſſion of Aſſembly, their puſhing immediately to this place, the diſperſion of the publick papers, which for the purpoſe of ſaving them neceſſarily took place, and the injury done at the printing office, have been ſo many cauſes operating unfortunately to the delay of tranſmitting you thoſe acts of Assembly which required immediate execution. The principal of theſe, the law for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting our army, having been framed on the fact that the militia of the ſeveral counties would be in quiet at home, has been peculiarly retarded by the neceſſity we were under of calling militia from almoſt every county. We have ſeized the earliest moment poſſible for diſcharging thoſe of as many counties as could be, in order that this important law may be put into a courſe of execution. It is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

At each of theſe places an officer will attend from the 10th day of March next for the purpoſe of receiving them. You will ſend them under the charge of an officer, who being enabled by the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ſufficiency in that way, he is to impreſs it, giving certificates to the perſons from whom he ſhall impreſs, and returning to the Auditors a liſt of ſuch certificates, ſpecifying the party's name, article, price, and date. Let this officer be furniſhed with a proper certificate from you that he is appointed to this duty, which he is to ſend to the Auditors together with his liſt, that they may be ſatisfied of his authority.</p>
            <p>I incloſe you two blank calenders, in which you will inſert the names and deſcriptions of your levies delivered to the officer who will be appointed by us to receive them as directed by the act of Aſſembly; the one of theſe he will ſign and leave as a voucher to you, the other ſhould be ſigned by yourſelf or the officer delivering the men for you, and left in the hands of the receiving officer.</p>
            <p>On the cloſe of your draught I muſt deſire a return of your militia, and as the law obliges the Captains to make exact returns to you at every general muſter, I am to require that from theſe you make always an exact return to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that ſo we may have a conſtant knowledge of the actual ſtrength of your militia. Notwithſtanding the requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I made you ſix months ago for a return of your militia, you have not been pleaſed to comply with it, an inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which cannot be juſtified on any principle of military ſubordination, and which cannot again paſs unnoticed.</p>
            <p>A very dangerous practice having been introduced by the enemy of laying under paroles the whole country, through which they are at any time able to march, and thereby attempting to diſarm its future oppoſition, has rendered it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for government to take up and reprobate the idea, that any citizen may thus cancel his duties to his country. I incloſe you a number of proclamations on this ſubject, and deſire that you will put one into the hands of every Captain in your county, with orders to read it at the head of his company at every private muſter during the preſent year.</p>
            <p>Such is the preſent aſpect of the enemy towards this country, that no foreſight can predict the moment at which your militia will be called into active duty. Let me exhort you therefore, and through you, your officers and men, to conſider that moment as if now come, that every man, who has or can procure a gun, have it inſtantly put into the beſt order, a bayonet fitted to it, a bayonet beſt cartouch box, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with its ſtrap, tomahawk, blanket, and knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack Some of theſe articles are neceſſary for his own ſafety, and ſome for his health and comfort. The conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſture of the publick ſtock of theſe articles, by calls from all quarters, renders it vain for the militia to expect to be ſupplied from thence, when they come into the field, and nothing is ſo eaſy as for every man to have them prepared while quiet and at home. The cartouch box with a leathern <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ap, a wooden canteen with its ſtrap, and a knapſack of thick linen (the better if painted) are what may be made in almoſt any mans family, and there are few neighbourhoods which do not afford artificers equal to the repair of a firelock, and furniſhing it with a bayonet. Let me then again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you Sir, not only to give out in general orders to your Captains, that theſe preparations be inſtantly made, but to ſee yourſelf as far as poſſible that your orders be carried into execution. The ſoldiers themſelves will thank you when, ſeparated from domeſtick accommodation, they find themſelves, through your attention to their happineſs, provided with conveniencies which will adminiſter to their f<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt wants When you order them into ſervice, it will be proper that you order them to bring theſe things with them. Conſider alſo the ſending a waggon with every ſeventy five men as a ſtanding rule, and that the officer who attends to lay in proviſions for the men on their road, always return to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> a liſt of the certificates he gives, ſtating the name, article, price, and date, in ſeperate columns. Theſe are circumſtances always neceſſary, and as in the firſt hurry of an invaſion, when it is neceſſary to write an infinity of letters and give a multiplicity of orde<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
