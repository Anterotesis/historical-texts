            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE boldeſt adventurers in reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing efforts, were never fortified with ſufficient temerity to adopt a ſyſtem of religion truly rational or ſublime. In all ages of the world, the mind of man has been preſcribed to certain rules; a deviation from which would incur the ſevereſt penalties of perſecution, and proſcription. It is true however, that new religions have been eſtabliſhed; freſh ideas brought forward; rights, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, and ceremonies altered; but theſe were trifling improvements upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral principles of common error; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing having yet appeared truly ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in the production of our moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated reformers.</p>
            <p>Sect has generated ſect, error produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing error, till at length Chriſtians are divided into as many parties as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian tribes, and carry their ſuperſtitious
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030192_0004_0FE50975280D5F48"/>
ſcruples to ſuch a length, as to exclude reaſon, as being incompatible with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But thoſe who worſhip the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, contrary to the dictates of reaſon, muſt do it conformable to the rude cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of irrational, and ſavage barbarity, and may be compared to the men of Liſtra, to whom, Paul ſaid "Him therefore ye ignorantly worſhip declare I unto you."</p>
            <p>Were our modern ſectaries, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a ſuperior refinement in the knowledge of ſcriptural ſcience, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to controul opinion, how dark and gloomy, how dull and unintereſting to a rational and intelligent being, would all religious treatiſes appear? And the author of the following ſheets would ſuffer a perſecution, no leſs rigorous than thoſe inſtituted under the influence of the Popes; and receive as dreadful a ſentence of proſcription as thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the pious directors of the
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:030192_0005_0FE50976B2657D40"/>
Inquiſition. To ſuch a length would chriſtian charity be extended by thoſe who are intoxicated with the pernicious draughts adminiſtered by a myſterious religion to its blind votaries. But ſince opinion is in ſome meaſure free, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould deter us from propagating ſentiments intereſting to the human race.</p>
            <p>No ſooner were the chains of monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh policy broken, and the mind of man permitted to explore the wide empire of reaſon, than an important truth was diſcovered, that an eſtabliſhed Church, is an eſtabliſhed tyranny; and if phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers would purſue their ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they would find that all poſitive inſtitutions of religion, are but a ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified policy, which with propriety may be conſidered a holy deception, or a pious fraud. There is no religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant deſtitute of able advocates; an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:030192_0006_0FE50979C1337AD8"/>
Fakier, or a Turkiſh Mufty, will defend his faith, with equal confidence, as an Engliſh biſhop will ſupport the trinity, or the divinity of Chriſt. Nor do I know any religion that would fall, for want of ſupporters, were they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded equal to a Britiſh prelate.</p>
            <p>How muſt every human heart ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize at the recollection of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities perpetrated under the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name of religion—under the mild banner of a human God: thoſe plots and conſpiracies formed to propagate a divine ſyſtem; theſe holy maſſacres inſtituted to eſtabliſh a belief in holy writ, and thoſe rewards given to catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic murderers to deſtroy unbelieving heretics. But St. Dominic's flaming faggots are finally conſumed; the fires of Smithfield are extinguiſhed; the dazzling ſword of fanataciſm is blunted; thoſe gibbets exhibiting the carcaſſes of ſlaughtered heretics, to adorn the
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:030192_0007_0FE509839982CAD0"/>
mother of Chriſtianity, and of Rome, are mouldered into duſt, the ſublime worſhip of ſaints, and the pious ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Idols, is left to our own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. Religious liberty, and the freedom of conſcience, is eſtabliſhed among us upon a pure and rational baſis.</p>
            <p>Let us then, in the name of GOD, remedy prevailing error, and remove ſtale prejudices, by contemplating boundleſs creation, which perpetually exhibits its captivating wonders around us, let us give free operation to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of reaſon, and improve thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculties conferred on us from a ſource unknown; and finally, let us confide in a beneficient DEITY, to crown our labours with ſucceſs.</p>

            <head>CHRISTIANITY CONTRASTED WITH DEISM.</head>
            <p>WHEN man feels himſelf poſſeſſed of new ideas, or embraces ſentiments on celeſtial or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtial objects, uncommon among the great maſs of vulgar, he alſo feels, by natural inſtinct a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to lay them before the public, for the inſpection of a regenerated people, recently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged from the ſhackles impoſed on them by knaves and impoſtors. Under this impreſſion, I embark in the ardous taſk of being the public oppoſer of popular errors; truſting at the ſame time, that in expoſing thoſe religious foibles, to which deluded mankind are too fondly addicted, I ſhall not inſult the good underſtanding of the well informed, nor abuſe that ſcope of reaſon which kind nature has conferred upon me.</p>
            <p>Could we but glance at futurity with equal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility as we view the actions of paſt generations, how would our ſouls be exalted on contemplating poſterity, at ſo great a remove from rude barbarity, advancing by gradual ſteps to a more natural
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030192_0009_0FE50985E5BE1FE8"/>
image of that perfection, which brightens the features of humanity, and exalts man to thoſe high ſtations in human life, allotted him by his divine Creator.</p>
            <p>Situated as we are in the middle paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the future and the paſt, we cannot but look forward with conſoling avidity on the rapid progreſs of human perfection, for, however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded in its progreſs, by a combination of kings and prieſts, it has nevertheleſs ſucceeded in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting ſceptres from the one, and mitres from the other.</p>
            <p>The almighty hoſt of reaſon and of truth ſtrikes deep at the root of evil, while ambiguous prieſts and their armies of ſpiritual ſlaves, grope in the obſcure cells of fable and of miſtery.</p>
            <p>When we take a proſpect of the paſt ages of the world, and recount the numberleſs enormities committed under the high-ſounding ſanction of a revealed religion, human nature recoils, and our ſouls revolt againſt ſo unnatural a ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>A liberal education, aided by rational liberty, and the light of reaſon, emboldens men to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard opinions, at the preſent day, for which, in times of yore, the inquiſitorial decrees of a vicious prieſthood would conſign him to the dungeon,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030192_0010_0FE50988E283FFA0"/>
and his works to the flames. But as theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles to human improvements are ſurmounted, and the ſuperſtitious worſhip paid to crowns and mitres, nearly aboliſhed; let us, while we reflect on paſt folly, endeavour to improve on modern wiſdom.</p>
            <p>It would be the work of a voluminous hiſtory to deliniate the errors of former ages, the wars and maſſacrees, fomented by one faction of prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood againſt another, each profeſſing divine theological inſpiration; the ſtretch of princely power, the cruelties exerciſed to eſtabliſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious tenets, the ſhifts and ſtratagems reſorted to, in order to eſtabliſh and ſeal with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>vine impreſſion, the doctrine of the victorious party; and the unnatural edicts of kings and national governors, to bind men down to theſe tenets, under pain of confiſcation and excommunication, &amp;c. All theſe being foreign to my preſent plan, I ſhall proceed briefly to ſtate ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral objections to prevailing error, and leave this age of philoſophy to draw its own conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Our deluded anceſtors were, for the moſt part, incapable of diſcriminating between ſound reaſon and ambiguous ſophiſtry, nor was holy
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030192_0011_0FE5098CEEF34980"/>
writ more revered by them, than doubtful tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or human invention. Stories the moſt idle, and doctrines the moſt repugnant to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon, never wanted legions of advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates; and cold ſteel, or flaming faggots, were applied as the cure of unbelief; hence ſprung fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſm and phrenſy, the offspring of a ſyſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ignorance eſtabliſhed duplicity, art and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture.</p>
            <p>The infatuated men of old, who idolized and adored the prophetic hiſtory, firmly believed it to be the hand writing of an unerring God, and yielding an implicit obedience to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of their Prieſts, conceived it too bold and preſumptuous to reaſon for themſelves, till at length they inſenſibly ſunk into a blind tho' tyrannic ſyſtem of orthodoxy; which kept the world in chains of ignorance for many centuries. No ſooner did a bold adventurer rouſe from the bed of theology and ſtart objections to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt doctrines of the times, but he was ſilenced by an imperious, ſelf interreſted, and monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing clergy, who had no bounds to their uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, and ſcorned to live under any rational controul.—All reforming efforts prove abortive, while the clergy rule the roaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030192_0012_0FE5099B57135D28"/>At length ſome diſappointed Monks, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted Cardinals, fired with revenge againſt the ſeer of Rome, publickly expoſed the abſurdities of current orthodoxy. They ſet up a new traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic for themſelves: and as the ſucceſs of one impoſture proves a ſtimulus to various others, we find the chriſtian religion divided, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided, into a variety of branches. Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and artifice eſtabliſhed every ſect into a kind of licenſed Order. All are poſſeſſed of divine grace; none are exempt from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Kings chuſe ſome favourite ſyſtem, as the religion of the land; not for their own good, but for that of their loving ſubjects. The pious clergy reforming with the times, found it their intereſt to crouch to the foot of monarchy; royal letters patent, by the Lord's annointed, ſealed their dogma's with a divine miſſion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate eſtabliſhments enſued; one church vied with another, ſect accuſed ſect of falſe doctrine, hereſy, and ſchiſm: the Bible was reſorted to as the rallying point of all controverſies: divines of all deſcriptions treaſuring it up, as the grand ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine, which heaven reſerves for their mutual purpoſes. Like a free port for all nations, the Bible harbours all, and ſupplies the contending
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030192_0013_0FE5099D50B16C18"/>
parties with the implements of war and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy. This Bible will confute in one paſſage the doctrine it approves in another. Tenets however doubtful can be proved by ſcripture, and fancy. From hence orginated theological broils, and national calamities: with a variety of evils heaped on man, by the blind leaders in religious ceremonies, which we hope modern wiſdom has finally put an end to.</p>
            <p>We have now no further need of holy wars to fight the Lord's battle, nor religious perſecutions to eſtabliſh the word of God; fagots need not be lighted, nor racks, nor gibbets erected, to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate a divine theology, which has nothing for its object, but ſlavery to the laity, and revenue to the clergy.</p>
            <p>Can a rational being ſuppoſe for a moment, that a religion deſcended from heaven, ſhould ſpread ſuch terror and deſolation wherever it makes its appearance: or that a gracious God, would ſpeak to his peculiar people, in a language not to be underſtood: or tranſmit to poſterity, a hiſtory ſo obſcure and unintelligible, as to leave us in eternal doubts and uncertainties: a hiſtory no leſs difficult to reconcile in all its parts, than to bring the two polar ſtars into one point: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be a more glaring contraſt, than the different conſtructions each ſect puts upon the

words of the Bible. To believe what they all ſay, is impoſſible, and how to diſcriminate we know not. Shall we then renounce the fabric, with all its fiction, rapſodies and concomitant abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: or ſhall we ſtill keep growling in the dark and never find our way, ſhall we nod approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a ſyſtem of blind myſteries, and refuſe to embrace thoſe truths conveyed to us by the light of nature and of reaſon? we ſee the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world convulſed and agitated, and it only requires the virtuous exertions of enlightened men to reſtore thoſe captive ſlaves, under the bondage of Prieſts, to the family of freemen.</p>
            <p>The few remaining fanatics will not fail to brand us with their uſual epithets of <hi>changlings, ſhifted about by every wind of doctrine, a natural man, carnally minded,</hi> with other cant phraſes. But may we not with equal juſtice retort, and accuſe them of ſhifting their ground, changing from primitive inſtitutions, and borrowing their maxims from the moſt notorious errors. What are the whole chain of reformers, but the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of popery, the illegitimates of ſuperſtition and idolatry? If fortunately for the good of man, we could diſſipate the clouds that cover ſo many myſteries, and remove the errors of human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, we ſhould be better able to confute the proud preſumption of thoſe who threaten with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030192_0015_0FE509A1E5CCB648"/>
the vengeance of heaven, all who attempt to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one tittle of their ritual. <q>Liberty of thought ſays the philoſopher, is the firſt of rights, and the moſt reſpectable domain, is that of conſcience: theſe being the gifts of nature conferred on man," <hi>who ſhall ſay we have not the right to examine.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>May we not then under the hopes of impunity examine the precepts of the chriſtian ſyſtem, and ſee whether its boaſted morality exceſs thoſe of other nations, ſo much reprobated by Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. We ſhall</p>
            <p>Firſt, with ſubmiſſion to the clergy of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, examine the holy order of thoſe miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſent by chriſtian kings, and Roman Pontiffs, to convert infidel nations to chriſtianity:</p>
            <p>Secondly, we ſhall notice the exemplary vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of thoſe patriots who graced the golden age: theſe we ſhall do by a reference to their reſpective hiſtories, after which we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to analize the venerable ſyſtem of chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Theſe three things being promiſed, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, <hi>firſt,</hi> to examine the conduct of theſe chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian miſſionaries who have travelled into foreign countries to ſpread the light of the goſpel. Theſe, inſtead of convincing the natives, that they
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030192_0016_0FE509A996796EE8"/>
excelled in the practice of moral virtues, have given the looſe to every kind of vice, and out done in every ſpecies of plunder and debauchery, thoſe who have lived without religion, and without laws. They had committed every enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that could make human nature appear mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous. Few can be ignorant of the cruelties committed by the Spaniſh miſſionaries at Mexico and Peru, where they built churches at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the inhabitants, and endeavouring to explain the myſteries of their religion to the natives, in a language of which they were totally ignorant, and afterwards piouſly ſlaughtered them as heretics, for not believing what had been ſo clearly demonſtrated to them. When theſe miſſionaries had conquered the Iſland of Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola, they made peace with the natives upon conditions that they would cultivate all their lands for the uſe of the ſervants of Jeſus, and alſo to furniſh them with a certain quantity of Gold every month. The poor wretches finding the taſk unſupportable, as well as impoſſible, took ſhelter in the mountains to ſcreen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their cruel oppreſſors, but the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards in juſtice (as they ſaid) to the injuries offered by the natives to God's people, trained their dogs to hunt them, and fired with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030192_0017_0FE509ACB068F990"/>
made a vow that each of them would deſtroy twelve Indians every day, in honour of the twelve apoſtles; to this might be added a brilliant hiſtory of the plunders and ravages committed by our much reſpected mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, upon the plains of Hindoſtan, but, humanity recoils at the diſmal recital.</p>
            <p>From a view of ſuch ſcenes of cruelties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted under the banner of a meek and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and by the real profeſſors of his holy religion, what inference can we draw, but that they look upon their religion to be a mere farce, and the Bible upon which it is founded, to be all a lie.<note n="*" place="bottom">I am purpoſely ſhort in this firſt propoſition the ſecond and third being rather lengthy.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We now proceed to notice in the ſecond place the exemplary virtues of our primitive patriots. Men are ſo infatuated even to this day, that they affect to look back with a reverential awe, and devoutly honour the paſt periods of the world, with the ſplended title of the <hi>golden age,</hi> admiring what is paſt, and deſpiſing what is preſent, with the hardened epithet of the <hi>age of iron.</hi> They indeed affirm, without much authority, that in the patriarchial ages, the earth brought forth her abundance ſpontaneouſly, that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030192_0018_0FE509AFAC4AA750"/>
the Lion, and the Tyger were harmleſs as the Lamb, and that mankind free from tumultuous paſſions, lived in the utmoſt ſimplicity and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: but if the Bible did not confute ſuch accounts, I ſhould not be able to do it, under the authority of that confuſed and barbarous hiſtory, of which the following is a brief abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Inſtead of all virtue then exiſting upon earth, the fate of the abandoned cities which were conſumed wirh fire, ſaid to be from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is a proof to the contrary, and gives us an example of the total corruption of ancient times. The diffidence that every man entertained of his neighbour, is no weak argument in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their diſhoneſty. Abraham and Iſaac both apprehended that they would be ſlain for the ſake of their wives, and it was no uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing for a man to require an oath of his neighbour that he would do him no harm.</p>
            <p>The ſtories of Judah and Tamer, his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in law, and the rape of Dinah, gives us a juſt idea of the debauchery and injuſtice of God's choſen people—Judah condemned Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer for the crime he had committed with her; —The perfidious ſons of Jacob ſlew the Sheche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites after they had ratified a treaty of peace with them, in the moſt ſolemn manner;— Jacob bargained with his uncle to ſerve ſeven
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030192_0019_0FE509B8458F7640"/>
years for his daughter Rachel: when the time expired, Laban ſhamefully impoſed upon him Leah, and had the effrontery to juſtify what he had done, and exacted another ſeven years for Rachel;—Jacob deceived his brother Eſau;— the ſons of Jacob ſold their brother Joſeph as a ſlave to the Egyptians;—Moſes committed murder; David contrived to have Uriah ſlain, that he might enjoy his wife Rebecca;—Solomon committed boundleſs fornications;—and Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon in the moſt ſhameleſs manner, cohabited with a multitude of women, before a numerous people.</p>
            <p>Such, pious Chriſtians, are the accounts of the peculiar favourites of the <hi>Deity,</hi> recorded in the divine volume, ſo much admired by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and credulity. But, when Chriſtianity took effect, were crimes leſs uſual? Does hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory paint mankind as meliorated at ſo great an event? alas! the reverſe is the fact. Gloomy ſuperſtition ſtarted up accompanied with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, which drenched the world in blood. Rome erected a ſpiritual authority, and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately trampled on the rights of God and Man; Chriſtian Saints ſucceeded heathen Gods: witchcraft and miracles were oppoſed to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal unerring laws of nature. On looking over a vaſt deſert of eighteen centuries, we find
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030192_0020_0FE509B9D279A128"/>
that Chriſtianity has been the parent of ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the hand-maid of oppreſſion, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and ſuperſtition. Blind myſteries and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous tales, are the ſpiritual food dreſſed up for the faithful in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When Rome, the proud miſtreſs of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſſumed a ſpiritual and temporal authority over all Europe, ſhe not only fettered men's minds to ſlaviſh doctrines, but preſumptuouſly laid an embargo on heaven. No more angels ſhall deſcend from thence to miniſter unto men; no more prophets ſhall predict the will of God; no more miracle to confound the obſtinate, but ſuch as are wrought by her own members; and thoſe, like the miracles of Jeſus, are done in ſecret, and ſeen only by the credulous ignorant. Yet theſe imaginary phenomenons have been trumpeted a far off by the oracles of deceit, and were the grand inſtruments in duping the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world into a ſervile ſubmiſſion to ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious formalities and idle ceremonies. When a few Chriſtian States reformed from the errors of popery, and ſhook off the pope's ſupremacy, the clergy piouſly preſerved to themſelves the means of power and monopoly. They changed indeed the name of their religion, but they firmly maintain the aggrandizing benefices. They are continually diſclaiming againſt the damnable doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030192_0021_0FE509BB5B55F878"/>
of the Roman church, who in her turn accuſes them of hereſy. Thus an irreconciliable difference pervades the whole maſs of Chriſtian profeſſors. The Chriſtian ſaints are conſidered as the tutular deities, who preſide over the churches dedicated to them. The Catholicks have a day which they conſecrate to the memory of ſeven thouſand holy virgins, who ſlept three years and thought it but one night. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh have their St. George; the Scotch their St. Andrew; the Welch their St. Taffy; the Iriſh their St. Patrick, &amp;c. Churches are dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to theſe imaginary ſaints, and days reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly obſerved to commemorate their virtues.</p>
            <p>In this country we ſmell too ſtrong of the old leaven, our churches are dedicated to we know not who, and though we profeſs to be the moſt liberal in our religious principles, we have not one church in this great continent dedicated to the <hi>ſupreme Being.</hi> Reaſon dictates, that when we enter a temple, conſecrated to religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, it ought to be dedicated to the being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in worſhipped. The God of nature being the grand object of all rational adoration, every houſe of worſhip ſhould be dedicated to him alone. But the great trait in the Chriſtian ſyſtem is its pre-eminence in the ſcience of contradiction;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030192_0022_0FE509BE2B006858"/>
Chriſtians contemn <hi>a deiſt</hi> for unbelief, but they cannot accuſe him of idolatry.</p>
            <p>A <hi>deiſt</hi> believes in <hi>a ſupreme being</hi> without an equal, or a troop of infernal deities, called devils or damned ſpirits. <hi>A deiſt</hi> contemplates the glory of omnipotence, in the minuteſt of his works, and worſhips God in every particle of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>a deiſt</hi> preſumes not to dictate to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, what bleſſings he ſhall give, or what evils to withhold; <hi>a deiſt</hi> is convinced by reaſon and experience that human petitions will never alter the will of providence; <hi>a deiſt</hi> endeavours to make himſelf happy in his preſent ſtate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns no man for opinions; is liberal, candid, and communicative to all men. But a Chriſtian worſhips three Gods in the perſon of one God: and in defiance to the ſcience of numbers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that, <hi>three times one is one,</hi> and that, <hi>once one is three;</hi> he petitions the <hi>deity</hi> in the moſt abſolute and dictatorial manner; he is diſſatisfied with what he has, and is continually coveting more; contemns thoſe who differ from him in opinion, and is ready to perſecute his brother to do his God a ſervice. In ſhort, a Chriſtian, is illiberal, narrow minded, and uncharitable in the extreme. They tell us that their God is his own ſon; that this ſon is his own father, and that he was born unbegotten, being <hi>four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030192_0023_0FE509C5219C6690"/>
years older than his mother.</hi> Three Gods are but one God; three eternals are but one eternal, three Almighties are but one Almighty; in ſhort, almoſt every tenet in the Chriſtian ſyſtem, is a complete negative to itſelf.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now contraſt a few paſſages of the ſublime medley, called the Bible, by comparing its former with its latter parts, and ſhewing the difference between the old and new word of God. In the former part we are informed that Elijah never taſted death, but that he was hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off alive to heaven in a chariot of fire; in the latter part we are informed that <hi>it is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all men once to die:</hi> and that <hi>fleſh and blood cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Whether Elijah was a man or a compoſition of fleſh and blood, I leave the Chriſtian doctors to determine. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes tells us to reſiſt evil and ſeek reſtitution for injuries done unto us, even to ſo nice a fraction, as <hi>an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth &amp;c.</hi> But Chriſt in direct oppoſition to him, tells us to <hi>reſiſt not evil,</hi> and if any one ſhall ſmite us on the one cheek, turn unto him the other alſo. As theſe two divine legiſlators differ ſo materially in their preceptorial functions, it is abſolutely impoſſible to adhere to them both: and thoſe pious Chriſtians who believe all the Bible to be the revealed will of God, muſt
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030192_0024_0FE509C92827DC88"/>
plainly ſee that in theſe oppoſite precepts, God contradicts himſelf: which totally deſtroys the idea of his being <hi>an unchangeable God, the ſame to day, to morrow, and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How chimerical are thoſe notions which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that an infinite God, in the perſon of man, or angel, ſhould in his flight thro' immenſity, perch upon this earth, and relate thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ſtories, about <hi>Sampſon</hi> and his <hi>foxes: Balaam</hi> and his <hi>aſs: Jonah</hi> and his <hi>whale: Bell</hi> and his <hi>dragons,</hi> or <hi>Tobit</hi> and his <hi>dog. Two is better than one, that which is crooked cannot be made ſtraight; that which is wanted can never be numbered:</hi> with a variety of ſuch frivolities, as are too inſignificant to amuſe the feeble ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of a child. Such never can be the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a God infinite in wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Fellow citizens, inſult not the deity by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to him a work ſo barbarouſly written, as that book called the Bible. Let the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſages ſerve as a ſample of the baſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. "<hi>Now go and ſmite Amelak and utterly deſtroy all that they have, and ſpare them not: but ſlay both man and woman, infant and ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ox and ſheep, camel and aſs, &amp;c.</hi> Again —<hi>Let his children be fatherleſs and his wife a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, let his children be continually vagabonds and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030192_0025_0FE509CAC4437610"/>
beg, let them ſeek their bread in deſolate places, let the extortioner catch all that he hath, and let the ſtranger ſpoil his labour, let there be none to extend mercy on him, neither let there be any to favour his fatherleſs children, let his poſterity be cut off, and in the generation following, let their names be blotted out.</hi>" The firſt of theſe paſſages carries with it all the marks of cruelty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and urges the execution of an act ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to humanity: while the ſecond paſſage ſeems rather the language of an infernal demon, than that of a juſt and merciful God. The only apology, for this laſt paſſage, is, that it is the compoſition of a royal prophet. As for the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> the Songs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah</hi> and <hi>Baruk,</hi> they were ſung in the camps of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and in the <hi>cities</hi> of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Homer's</hi> works were ſung in the <hi>cities</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Athens.</hi> Our Bible makers, however, took infinite pains to collect together thoſe ſcattered remnants of oriental poetry, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them the word of God: and metamorphoſed David into a pious Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>On cloſely examining this holy Bible I find it to be the dregs of ancient folly and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some parts of it pretend to give an hiſtory of the antediluvian and the firſt ages of the paſt diluvian world: other parts deſcribe God's deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030192_0026_0FE509CD304D72B0"/>
with man, under the Jewiſh oeconomy, where all nature is ſaid to be inverted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thoſe blind people of their errors: yet it appears that God's government over them was ineffectual, and void of energy. The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of worlds could not keep theſe people in proper ſubjection; he was therefore, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Bible, obliged to reſign his command, and ſuffer a people, for whom he had ſo paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal an affection, to become the common vagrants of the earth. Other parts of this holy book predicts what God will do in time to come: but as no ſpecific time is affixed to any particular event, our zealous partizans are making daily diſcoveries of the fulfilments of the prophecies.</p>
            <p>There is I think one paſſage of the Bible which bids fair never to be accompliſhed, while a Chriſtian king is in exiſtence, and which might be truly verified, if thoſe devouring monſters were finally extirpated, viz. <hi>"they ſhall turn their ſwords into plough ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning hooks."</hi> When <hi>Saul</hi> was a peaſant, he enquired of a prophet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his fathers aſſes, but when he mounted a throne, his majeſty conſulted a <hi>witch</hi> on the ſucceſs of a battle; ſuch is the univerſal piety of kings.</p>
            <p>A wretch more infernal than either <hi>witch</hi> or
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030192_0027_0FE509D709154970"/>
               <hi>Devil,</hi> would be conſulted by a king with avidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, while in purſuit of conqueſt, fame, and ambition.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to examine thoſe events called miracles, recorded in the ſacred hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The famous miracle of the red ſea dividing, and affording a dry paſſage to <hi>Moſes</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers claims the firſt rank. If the hiſtory of Egypt deceives me not, I find the ſame ſea afforded a ſimilar paſſage to <hi>Alexander the Great</hi> and his whole army, when they were purſuing victory, to the deſtruction of the Perſian em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. We are as well aſſured that the red ſea divides once a year in that particular ſpot, as we are of the hurricanes in the Weſt Indies, or the monſoon in the Eaſt Indies. The ſecond grand miracle, is that of the ſun's ſtanding ſtill at the command of <hi>Joſhua.</hi> As this mighty miracle is fully confuted by the Newtonian ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of aſtronomy, I ſhall paſs it by without a ſingle comment. If then, the two greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles upon record are either accounted for, or confuted by the laws of nature, what credit ought to be given to thoſe little tricks played off in the dark by magicians and ſoothſayers. That Moſes was a crafty and arbitrary legiſlator appears evident from his own account. He took the advantage of thick hazy weather to go up
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030192_0028_0FE509DB3505C2D0"/>
to the mountain, where he affected to conſult the deity, and then returned with his head full of proclamations, ſaying, <hi>"thus ſaith the Lord."</hi> The deluded people, being duped, paid the moſt religious regard to all his precepts which for the moſt part were exceedingly ſtupid.<note n="*" place="bottom">Perhaps of all the high finiſhed villains that ever degraded the page of hiſtory, or the ſhape of humane, none ever eqalled the monſter Moſes in ſcenes of ſyſtematic plunder, murder, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery. To aſſert that ſo vile a character could have acceſs to the deity, and conſult him face to face, is to aſſert that the deity is acceſſary to his crimes, crimes ſo complicated as to ſtagger all rational belief; Nay, charity obliges me to hope they are not done.</note> His ſucceſſors purſued the ſame maxims. Nothing could paſs into a law, until it was ſanctioned by divine approbation: this once obtained, it was proclaimed with another, <hi>"Thus ſaith the Lord."</hi> Who can juſtify the bauld-headed prophet, in calling from the woods two ſhe bears to devour forty and two little children: or can we ſuppoſe that the wiſeſt man that ever lived ſhould be the chief of adulterers and fornicators: though at a period when incapable of further exceſſes,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030192_0029_0FE509DCC100BAA8"/>
he made a fortunate diſcovery, <hi>"that all was vanity."</hi> But, paſſing over thoſe wiſe men, murderers and miracle makers, I ſhall proceed to make ſome obſervations on the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and here I truſt that every rational Chriſtian, who ſeriouſly conſiders this ſubject, will look back with horror upon his former folly, and reflect upon himſelf, for being ſo long the dupe of faction, the ſport of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the victim of deceit.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian ſyſtem is prefaced with one of the moſt extravagant fables ever recorded, a fable ſo much dwelt upon as the ſource of all human miſeries, as renders it impoſſible for me to paſs it over without ſome animadverſions. I allude to the wars in heaven, which, by the by, are only a prelude to the fall of man.</p>
            <p>I know not the time, in which this rebellion is ſaid to have happened, but the hiſtory of this memorable event is as follows: <hi>Satan,</hi> once the higheſt angel in heaven, and next in power to the Deity, ſtimulated by ambition, aſpired to the throne, and with a vaſt number of his confederates conſpired againſt the ſupreme power. The deity appriſed of the evil imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the inſurgents, whoſe intentions were to dethrone him, immediately ſummoned a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous army, at the head of which he placed
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030192_0030_0FE509E0E2FB94E8"/>
               <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> then <hi>angel Gabriel,</hi> and conferred upon him the high office of commander in chief of the heavenly hoſt. The progreſs of the proud conſpirator was impeded, after a moſt deſperate battle, in which the ſuperior ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralſhip of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the valiant pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his royal army, proved victorious. Satan's troop of infernals, being ſo completely routed, as rendered it impoſſible for him to rally his forces, or take the field a ſecond time. <hi>Genearl Jeſus</hi> purſued his victory, and kept cloſe to the rear of <hi>Satan's</hi> retreating army, until he had finally driven the rebels beyond the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of heaven.<note n="*" place="bottom">Here blind Milton takes his poetic flight, and ſets the heavens in an uproar; he purſues with wonderful ſucceſs the lofty ſtile of genius, and humours with vaſt ſublimity, the fabulous dreams of theological facts; O that ſuch talents ſhould be loſt in fable.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So wonderful was this war conducted that not one ſoldier was killed, wounded, or taken priſoner on either ſide, during the whole cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign.</p>
            <p>We muſt further obſerve that the conduct of the Deity was widely different from that of the preſent rulers of the world: who immediately
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030192_0031_0FE509ECF0F98190"/>
execute thoſe that reſiſt their government. The Deity purſued a different plan; he added ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther limb to creation by forming a place called Hell; he put a crown upon the head of Satan, and gave him the ſovereign dominion over that vaſt empire, with full power and authority, to commit all manner of depredations upon the inhabitants of this earth, as if we had been a party concerned in the rebellion. The firſt ſhock we ſuſtained, by this infernal Monſter, was at a time when he had taking a country airing in the garden of Eden, where he aſſumed the form of a ſerpent, and by the charms of his eloquence, and the ratling of his tail, he prevailed on mother Eve to eat an apple, by which all mankind would have been eternally damned if the Deity had not ratified a treaty of amity and commerce between Satan and the clergy about 1796 years ago.</p>
            <p>The conditions of this treaty, for inhumanity cruelty, and injuſtice, ſurpaſſes all rational be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. The preamble is briefly this: a virgin was overſhadowed by the holy Ghoſt: this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt was God: the virgin conceived, and brought forth a ſon: this ſon was God alſo. There is ſomething very puzzling to make it appear, that Chriſt is the ſecond perſon in the trinity. If the holy Ghoſt overſhadowed the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030192_0032_0FE509EE814F4038"/>
virgin Mary and that ſhe conceived by him; then the fruits of that conception muſt be the ſon of the holy Ghoſt: of courſe he is the grandſon of God, the third perſon in the trinity, and not the ſecond. But my buſineſs is not to prove doctrinal points, I ſhall therefore leave the doctors of myſteries to manage this part of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>After this God, or, ſon of God, had lived for thirty years in the moſt perfect poverty and wretchedneſs, he commenced the profeſſion of an itinerant preacher; and, in conſequence of his ſeditious tenets, he was accuſed before the chief judge, who ſentenced him to death, which he accordingly ſuffered. It is ſaid that Chriſt predicted all this himſelf, and that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary he ſhould die for the ſins of the world. Yet it is remarkable, that the people who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted ſo neceſſary a work, ſhould of all others be ſo much reprobated by Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt was expiring upon the croſs he ſaid to one of his fellow ſufferers, <q>this day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe.</q> This was the laſt ſpeech of a poor unfortunate God. But the creed makers aſſert that he deſcended into hell. Whether then to beleive Chriſt, or creed mongers, is at the option of the reader, for my part, I believe neither. After Chriſt was
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030192_0033_0FE509F049A43B30"/>
taken down from the croſs, he was packed up in a ſtone ſepulchre, and a centinel placed at the mouth of the cave to prevent the corps from being ſtolen away. Chriſt however, found means, without breaking the ſeal, or alarming the ſentinel, to creep out of the ſepulchre, and take a journey all the way to hell: and was ſo expeditious, as to return in leſs than three days, and took his poſition as before. Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for the Chriſtians, but quite the reverſe for the Jews, the ſentinal fell faſt aſleep, and afforded a moſt ſpecial opportunity for an angel to deſcend from heaven,<note n="*" place="bottom">If this celeſtial meſſenger had not arrived juſt at the nick of time, it is a thouſand to one: but he would have been ſhot dead by the ſentinal.</note> who rolled the ſtone from the mouth of the ſepulchre, and let out Jeſus, alive and well, ſafe and ſound. After this, Jeſus appeared to a few of his former diſciples and gave them ſome directions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their future miniſtry, when, lo! he took wings and flew up to heaven.</p>
            <p>Thus ends the whimſical hiſtory of Chriſt's birth, death, and reſurrection: on which I ſhall make a few remarks, by way of illuſtration. I have not knowledge enough in myſteries to know what Chriſt's buſineſs could be in hell,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030192_0034_0FE50A011866EED8"/>
unleſs it was to pay his court to the royal fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and, by his perſonal appearance, convince Prince Satan that the treaty was ratified on his part, by which we were purchaſed of the Devil, whoſe property we were previous to the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifiction. A papiſt will inform us, the better to eſtabliſh the doctrine of purgatory, that Chriſt did not deſcend into the hell of the damned, having no ſin to anſwer for. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant will retort, that he did not deſcend into purgatory, becauſe, having no ſin, he need not go there for purification: but moſt Chriſtians agree, that he deſcended into hell to preach the goſpel to the damned, and this clenches the argument at once. I muſt give it as my opinion that Chriſt's ſtay was too ſhort in hell to deliver many ſermons, and that if he was accuſtomed to preach from notes, as moſt of our modern divines are, they were in danger of being ſcorched by the flames; or, perhaps the climate was too hot to agree with his conſtitution, and this obliged him to make ſo ſpeedy a return to the more temperate regions of Aſia. The vulgar are led to believe that hell is ſomewhat below us, or in the bowels of the earth, which notion is chimerical, nor is it poſſible to know what part of the creation this tremendous abyſs occupies. If we may judge from the geſtures
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030192_0035_0FE50A064EB797E8"/>
of divines, in their pulpit harangues, heaven appears to be above us and hell below us, for when they mention heaven they look up, and when they mention hell they look down, it is like looking up for the ſun, and down for the moon.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt did really leave the ſepulchre, and deſcend into hell, could he not with equal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, have riſen from the dead, without the aſſiſtance of an angel: and made a public ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before that tribunal which condemned him to death. If he predicted that he would riſe the third day after his crucifixion, would not thoſe who pronounced his ſentence have anxiouſly awaited the fulfilment of ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, or, if he actually did riſe from the dead, ſhould he not have made his reſurrection of equal publicity, as his crucifixion; this he ſhould have done unleſs he was afraid of being crucified a ſecond time.</p>
            <p>If darkneſs obſcured the air,—if the earth ſhook with a convulſive pang,—if the vale of the temple was rent at Chriſt's crucifiction, he ſhould, at his reſurrection, have daſhed to atoms the ſepulchre wherein he was laid,—the proud temple ſhould have been ſhattered into duſt.— The palace of Caiphus,—and the hall of Pilot, ſhould vaniſh like ſmoak, — and a thouſand
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030192_0036_0FE509F380B8DC38"/>
phenomenons ſhould have taken place, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Jews, that the great Being, whom they crucified, was now riſen from the dead, agreeable to his own prediction. But alas! Nothing like this had happened, every thing was ſilent.</p>
            <p>In the name of common ſenſe, what great and mighty works did Chriſt perform, what godlike acts, or monuments of fame did he leave behind to eſtabliſh his divinity? His greateſt miracles are equalled, if not exceeded in the Old Teſtament. We grant that he deſtroyed a whole herd of ſwine, and a troop of devils, at one ſtroke,—he curſed the barren fig-tree, —and made a triumphant entry into the city of Jeruſalem, mounted upon an aſs ſaid to be ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; with a variety of other feats, which taken in the aggregate, make rather againſt than for his divinity.</p>
            <p>Had Chriſt left any thing wonderful, for the world to behold, we would ſuſpend all doubts reſpecting his miſſion. But doing ſo little we have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect the whole ſyſtem to be a fraud piouſly contrived by a few early impoſtors. Had he cauſed a fountain to ſpring from the dry land and raiſed its ſummit to the utmoſt ken of human ſight; had he cauſed the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030192_0037_0FE509F95739C918"/>
croſs whereon he was crucified to take root, and grow to the ſize of Babel's tower, remaining an everlaſting monument of his attoning merits; —theſe might be irreſiſtable proofs of his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But the tale is related without authority, and credited without evidence.</p>
            <p>Having ſhown the feeble principles upon which the Chriſtian ſyſtem is founded, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to other obſervations.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſays, <hi>"Lo I am with you even unto the end of the world."</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">When I read the new word of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the goſpel, and ſee how often Chriſt appears and diſappears. <hi>A little while and you ſhall ſee me, and a little while and you ſhall not ſee me,</hi> and the indefatigable Mary meeting him on all occaſions, it reminds me of Harlequin and Columbine; and the conſpicuous, part the devil acts in the farce, is characteriſtic of old Pantaleon in the Pantomime.</note> If ſo, why ſuch diſtraction among Chriſtians; or why not make another viſible appearance, and ſet matters right; and not give the poor clergy ſo much room to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain for want of faith; nor exclaim that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity is loſing ground, and that <hi>Deiſm</hi> is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard upon them. Do they inſinuate that Satan has violated the treaty, or that he is more
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030192_0038_0FE50A02B8572FF0"/>
powerful than the Almighty; ſurely not. That there is a want of faith among Chriſtians is evident, elſe mountains would be rolled about like pebble ſtones.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, under the moſt favourable circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtance in which we can view the Chriſtian ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, it has all the marks of fraud and impoſition; its ſole baſis is founded upon fable, and its rubric more irrational than the heathen wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>After theſe bold declarations, me thinks, I hear ſome Chriſtian exclaim, what, are we to have but one God; Are we to have no Jeſus Chriſt to redeem us; Are we to have no holy Ghoſt to ſanctify us; Are we to have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Demons to inflict torments? Why this would be to unhinge the whole order of our ſyſtem, and place at once the righteous and the ungodly upon an equal footing. Surely Sirs, little need be ſaid to prove that one true God, is better than a thouſand falſe ones: as for Jeſus Chriſt, he never redeemed you; neither has the holy Ghoſt ſanctified you; theſe are but the catch words of prieſt-craft. Men are as independent of theſe ſtep ladders, by which to climb up to heaven, as they were ten thouſand years ago. If Jeſus Chriſt has redeemed you, why terrify the vulgar with the fears of hell?
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030192_0039_0FE50A11B95DE1F0"/>
(as for the learned of all nations they have no fear about it.) If the holy Ghoſt has ſanctified you, in what manner does the ſanctification ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? Are Chriſtians more honourable or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in their way of dealing? are they freer from debauchery and vices of every kind than other men? With ſorrow I repeat it, the reverſe is the melancholy truth. A little Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh morality, annexed to the pureſt precepts of the Chriſtian goſpel, would conſtitute a better religion than any now in vogue.</p>
            <p>It requires a round faith indeed to credit the exiſtence of a monſtrous devil, or that there is ſuch a place as hell, I diſbelieve both: yet I am far from the opinion that the righteous and the ungodly will be upon an equal footing; for the ſame God who reſerves to himſelf the power to reward virtue, will alſo puniſh vice, independent to agents, demy gods, or infernal demons. As for unhinging the whole order of the Chriſtian ſyſtem, that can never be effected while the duplicity of the clergy, and the blind credulity of the laity are proof againſt reaſon and common ſenſe, for, truly, ſuch is the ſyſtem of piety preſerved by Chriſtians, that if a man, conſcious of the duty he owes his maker, undertakes to vindicate the moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the deity, in oppoſition to the corrupt
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030192_0040_0FE50A138EF8EA90"/>
paſſages of current orthodoxy, he is ſure to be ſtigmatiſed with the moſt opprobrous epithets, and none more contemptible than that of a <hi>Deiſt.</hi> It is a truth that I am a <hi>Deiſt,</hi> I wiſh to live a <hi>Deiſt,</hi> and hope to die a <hi>Deiſt,</hi> yet I ſhall reproach no man for being a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>The Bible on which the Chriſtian ſyſtem is founded, exhibits doctrines repugnant to each other, and inculcates principles highly injurious to the moral happineſs of man, it delivers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of doubtful meanings, and are therefore liable to be diſputed, neither do the trumpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the Bible's praiſe, think proper to be governed by it, but follow their own courſe of life as heedleſs as if they had no ſuch thing as a Bible to be governed by. This book is written in ſuch figurative and ambiguous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, hyperboles, and metaphorical phraſes, that it appears only calculated to puzzle creed-makers, miracle men, and ſoul-ſaviours.</p>
            <p>When the church of Rome had the Bible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lock and key cloſely concealed from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, mankind were anxious to know the contents of the ſacred depoſit, but the moment it were divulged its frivolty appeared, and the more this book is read, the leſs it is regarded. I firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that if this Bible could be generally
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030192_0041_0FE50A1517A4EEC8"/>
read without prejudice, there would not be a Chriſtian in exiſtence fifty years hence; it lays down no ſyſtem of religion whatever, but is equally calculated to eſtabliſh Atheiſm as Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and is but a wanton burleſque upon God and his providence. It has done leſs real good, and more real miſchief, than any other book that ever was printed.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Read the Bible without prejudice,</hi> and if any thing is calculated to ſhock the human heart, or blacken the character of the Deity, the Bible ſeems evidently intended for that purpoſe. It was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with blood, and is a continued hiſtory of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and debauchery.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If Chriſtianity was inſtituted for the purpoſe of making men better than they would otherwiſe be, to curb their unwiedly paſſions, and prevent thoſe murders, maſſacres, and inhuman butcheries, ſo frequently committed by Chriſtian againſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, we find it has entirely miſſed its aim, and woeful experience proves how prevalent ſuch cruelties are at this day in almoſt every corner of the Chriſtian world. Not leſs than two millions of Chriſtians including the ſlaves of deſpots, have been murdered, maſſacred, and ſlain in battle, in the ſpace of four years. Is not this in due conformity to Chriſt's words,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030192_0042_0FE50A182A156448"/>
               <q>Think not that I am come to bring peace upon earth,</q> no, but to ſet families and friends at variance: the true character of a Chriſtian then, is to live in a continual ſtate of warfare. And behold one of the moſt gracious kings in Europe, in juſtice to his profeſſion, proclaims to the world that he is called upon by his religion, to proſecute with vigour the moſt infamous war, that ever degraded the page of hiſtory. If then the Chriſtian religion is of a celeſtial origin, as its profeſſors proudly boaſt it to be, would it, or could it, poſſibly admit of ſo many enormities. In ſhort, view it in every direction and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a monſter in full perfection.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is repreſented to us as <hi>the Prince of peace,</hi> though he ſays himſelf, that <hi>he is not come to bring peace upon earth.</hi> O ſublime contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, peace in one hand, and war in the other, welcome moſt noble prince to this world below.</p>
            <p>It is not, I am perſuaded the ſublimity of the Chriſtian ſyſtem that invites ſo many to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, when children, our parents lead us to their reſpective churches, and train us up to their different ceremonies; but when we begin to think for ourſelves, diſcovering errors not eaſily digeſted, we renounce our firſt rituals, and embrace another doctrine, in order, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to arrive at ſome rational certainty; inſtead,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030192_0043_0FE50A2089FF6708"/>
however, of improving here, we find other tenets equally diſguſting, from this we change perhaps to a third, where ſimilar errors ſtill exiſt, at length, fatigued by making fruitleſs reſearches after rational and comprehenſive doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, we abjure our reaſon, and join the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cry that <hi>"all is myſtery."</hi> This was abſolutely the caſe with me for near forty years, till finding with all my endeavours to ſift out ſome conſiſtent mode of worſhip, I was only changing from one abſurdity to another, at length I ſolemnly renounced them all. Is it not the ſame with the people of this continent, as it is with thoſe of other countries, who take their religion by chance, not by choice.</p>
            <p>If the grand Turk of Conſtantinople had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a colony in America, inſtead of the king of Britain, we ſhould be all Mahometans, we ſhould then ſay of Chriſtians, as the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians now ſay of the Mahometans. The reaſon why a child is brought to the ſynagogue to be circumciſed is becauſe his father was a Jew, and he becomes a Jew himſelf for the ſame reaſon that his father was a Jew before him.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe we were in a mere ſtate of nature, deſtitute of any religion whatſoever; and that all the religious extant were laid before us to choſe from among them one; it is a query which
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030192_0044_0FE50A2271FE3BA8"/>
we ſhould prefer; probably that which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt rational. In this caſe, I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Chriſtian religion that would give it the preference to the <hi>Pythagorian</hi> ſyſtem; and it is probable <hi>Mahomet's coran</hi> would take the lead of the <hi>Moſaic Bible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Chriſtian religion I know not what it is; Chriſt never inſtituted any, he only taught a few ſcraps of moral philoſophy; the whole hiſtory of his life, and doctrines might be compriſed in a ſix penny pamphlet, who taught us then that this man was God? Did he ever ſay ſo himſelf? No. Did any of his diſciples ſay ſo? certainly not. Chriſt has not left a ſingle paragraph on record by which we may know his real ſentiments; he had no learning in conſequence of his poverty, of which he made great merit, and wiſhed none to follow him, but thoſe who are equally poor as himſelf. But we diſcover a ſtriking contraſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of his doctrines. He was illeterate, they are learned; he was poor, they are rich; he was humble, they are arrogant. In ſhort, he was deſtitute, but they have abundance.</p>
            <p>Having ſtretched this ſecond propoſition to ſome length I now proceed in the third place to analize the venerable ſyſtem of Chriſtianity,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030192_0045_0FE50A24260A7AC8"/>
and here I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate three propoſitions:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the Chriſtian religion is impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</p>
            <p>Second, that it is inconſiſtent with reaſon, and</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that it is unnatural.</p>
            <p>Firſt then; that the Chriſtian religion is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, appears from the following precepts, which enjoins us <hi>to pray without ceaſing, to ſell all and follow Chriſt, to cut off our hands and pull out our eyes, in caſe they ſhould offend us, to love our enemies; bleſs them that curſe us, and pray for them that perſecute and deſpitefully uſe us, &amp;c.</hi> Great ſtreſs is laid upon the firſt of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, but we are aſſured from long experience, that our prayers are ineffectual, and perhaps the reaſon is beſt aſſigned by the apoſtle, who tells us, that <hi>we receive not, becauſe we aſk in vain:</hi> What then is the uſe of aſking? have we not innumerable inſtances that human petitions never altered the divine will? David was three days and nights in prayer for the recovery of his child; the anſwer was, <hi>thy child ſhall die.</hi> Are not all the kings of Europe, aſſiſted by their clergy, almoſt inceſſantly ſupplicating the deity in the name of Jeſus, for the ſucceſs of their reſpective armies. But the God of battle hears them not; neither is it poſſible to pray without
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030192_0046_0FE50A27D119AB98"/>
ceaſing, becauſe the time required to procure the neceſſaries of life, is about two thirds, and the remaining time is ſcarce ſufficient for reſt and refreſhment; therefore to ſuppoſe a man can be in prayer continually, is to ſuppoſe an impoſſibility.</p>
            <p>"To ſell all and follow Chriſt, is a precept delivered to the laity only, it does not effect the clergy, as appears by their love of riches, and in general this doctrine has had a contrary tendency, for the more pious and religious the Chriſtian, the more greedy after gain; point out to me a devout Chriſtian, and I will point out to you in the ſame perſon, a miſerable world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muck-worm.</p>
            <p>"To cut off our hands, or pull out our eyes," may be a kind of hyperbole, or figurative ſpeech, it is therefore the province of ſome learned doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of divinity to explain how far theſe precepts can be compiled with.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To love our enemies, bleſs them that curſe us and pray for them that perſecute and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitefully uſe us,</q> are precepts that look well on paper, though it is not the weakeſt part of Chriſtian philoſophy that can ſtrengthen our reſolution, or reſtrain our reſentment of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done unto us; nor is it common among Chriſtians to kneel down and pray for the being
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030192_0047_0FE50A30CC7164F0"/>
who is at the ſame moment curſing them. "To love our enemies," is a precept ſtrongly urged by the pleaders of the pulpit, but the pleaders of the bar preach a different doctrine; and if the greater number of adherants amounts to a proof in favour of any precept, we muſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare for the latter; conſequently the preachers of the bar not thoſe of the pulpit, are inſpired by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the Chriſtian religion is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent to reaſon, will appear by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>"If a man ſmite you on one cheek turn unto him the other: he who ſteals your coat, give him your cloak alſo: take no thought of to-morrow, neither ſeek what ye ſhall eat, drink, or wherewith ye ſhall be cloathed."</hi> All theſe precepts are truly Chriſtian, and how far they can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled with, common experience plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. That they are inconſiſtent with moral happineſs, is beyond all doubt. As for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging a thief, or tamely ſubmitting to aſſault and battery, as applied by the two firſt articles, it is contrary to the principles of moral juſtice, or public order. The law of retaliation, as thought by Moſes, is far more rational, and, I need not ſay, more univerſal. He who takes no "thought for to-morrow, nor ſeeks what he ſhall eat, drink, or wherewith he ſhall be cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,"
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030192_0048_0FE50A326BC68EE8"/>
would be conſidered as an idle vagabond; he would be deſtitute of credit or reſpect; he would be covered with rags and poverty, and diſcarded from all ſociety. Nay, where is the Chriſtian, be he ever ſo pious, that is not anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to day, for the bread he hopes to conſume to-morrow. Even the clergy, the moſt righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of all men, are particularly nice in their table furniture; reſembling the rich man talked of in the goſpel, <hi>"They are cloathed in purple and fine linen, and fare ſumptuouſly every day."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed thirdly, to ſhew that the Chriſtian religion is unnatural. "<hi>When thou makeſt a feaſt, call not thy friends, nor thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, nor thy kinſman, nor thy rich neighbours</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But when thou makeſt a feaſt, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the halt, and the blind. Except ye eat the fleſh of the ſon of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Except ye are born again, and become as little children, ye can never enter the kingdom of heaven</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the expreſs words of Chriſt, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they are poſitive rules, proper to be obeyed by every profeſſor.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe precepts denies a Chriſtian the ſocial enjoyment, which naturally reſults from friendly viſits, and rational entertainments;
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030192_0049_0FE50A33F5665960"/>
it confines a Chriſtian to the company of poor, lame, and blind beggars. This precept is ſo unnatural, that thoſe who have voluntarily cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Chriſt for their head, never obey it. Even thoſe who pretend to have obtained patents from heaven, for being uſhers in Chriſt's ſchool, pay no regard to it, but run through life with as little remorſe, or ſhame at a breach of it, as the moſt obſtinate unbelievers. Can we ſuppoſe that a right reverend father in God, by divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a true diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a ſumptuous entertainment, and ſit down to glut and gormandize with his rich neighbours, to the total excluſion of the poor, the lame, the maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the halt, and the blind, when conſcious that he is thereby violating an expreſs command of his lord and maſter. Or ſhall we ſuppoſe that theſe right reverends are concealed infidels who believe nothing of the matter? The words of Chriſt are plain and expreſs, they are not in a lofty ſtile of language, neither are they hyperboles, or figurative ſpeeches, that mean more than is expreſſed; they are plain words that do not admit of double deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If then theſe rules of life, laid down by Chriſt himſelf, are improper, as well as unnatural, and profeſſors indulge themſelves in a total neglect of them, is it not the duty then of our firſt rate divines to unfold this riddle?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:030192_0050_0FE50A359FE85D90"/>"Except ye eat the fleſh of the ſon of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you." It is impoſſible to enumerate the volumes of contraver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy this text has given riſe to, the contentions it has created, or the tuns of human blood it has ſhed. To ſuppoſe that Chriſt offered his diſciples real human fleſh to eat, and natural human blood to drink, is in itſelf ſo barbarous and inhuman as to ſhock our groſſeſt feelings. This is one of the chriſtian myſteries never to be underſtood, and becauſe of its ſublimity it is conſtrued into a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein bread is, by the conjuration of a prieſt, <hi>tranſubſtantiated</hi> into fleſh, and wine <hi>eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtiſed</hi> into blood, and this bread and wine is taken and received by the faithful "as the real body and blood of Chriſt." Thus a ſyſtem of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaliſm ſpiritualized, is the moſt fundamental tenet in the Chriſtian religion.</p>
            <p>"Except ye are born again, and become as little children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven." If by being born again, ſignifies changing from one rule of faith to another, there are few Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians who have not been born and reborn over and over again. Whether Chriſt means this kind of re-generation, I know not, it is however unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in the extreme, to ſuppoſe we can grow downwards, ſhrink into children, become as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle infants, re-enter our mother's womb, and put
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030192_0051_0FE50A4105BBD5A0"/>
her to the painful operation of giving us a ſecond birth. This is ſo repugnant to the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo great an inſult to reaſon, that I ſhould think it a waſte of time and paper to ſay more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>There are a variety of other paſſages equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, inconſiſtent, and unnatural as thoſe already quoted, but it would require a book as large as the Bible, to do them juſtice. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wave all further animadverſion, and proceed to ſome curſary obſervations.</p>
            <p>There are a ſect of Chriſtians, commonly called Quakers, who profeſs the ſtricteſt obſervance to the chriſtian precepts, particularly theſe; <hi>reſiſt not evil, ſwear not at all, let your charity be in ſecret, place no dependance in long prayer, &amp;c.</hi>" but ſurely he who preſcribed theſe rules alſo ſaid, <hi>"lay not up for yourſelves treaſure upon earth."</hi> The friends probably think they may ſafely indulge themſelves in the breach of this latter precept, upon condition that they attend to the former rules. Chriſt, if I miſtake not, cautions his diſciples, againſt making an outward ſhow of their profeſſion, by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form, or dreſs, yet the moment we behold a man in a drab coloured coat, or an horizontal hat, we immediately think of a Quaker.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Paine aſſerts that theſe people are <hi>Deiſts,</hi> but I hope he will excuſe me, when I ſay that this is paying them too high a compliment, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Deiſt</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> which denote noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a Buckram pride, as rediculous, as it is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.</note> The
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030192_0052_0FE50A42DEF6E140"/>
enlightened and well informed Methodiſts, are gradually declining into the ſame maxims, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their profeſſion by outward apparel: but I will not ſay of them, as Chriſt ſaid to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſees in a parallel caſe, <hi>"Woe be unto you hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites for ye have your reward!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the monſtrous heap of abſurdities, thus briefly ſtated, it is to be hoped that, in future, Chriſtians will not take the liberty to contemn Deiſts, in the manner they have uſually done.</p>
            <p>Were I diſpoſed to diſpute doctrinal points, my eſſay would be extended to an enormous ſize in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, yet I would wiſh to know what benefit ariſes from the frivolous ceremony of infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or ſaying a few prayers over a dead perſon? For my part, I know of none, except good eating and drinking, in the former, and the parſon's fees in the latter, be conſidered as ſuch. If ſprinkling a little water upon the face of an infant, or ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few prayers over a corps, could operate by way of a charm, theſe ceremonies would be of
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030192_0053_0FE50A4467DAFCD8"/>
infinite utility; but as they appear to be founded in prieſt-craft, no good can be expected to reſult from them.</p>
            <p>The clergy 'tis true are civil enough to conduct us to the grave, and wiſh us a good journey to the other world, being confident that when they have depoſited our remains in the ſilent vault, their deceptions have thus far eſcaped detection, and this accounts for their ſucceſsful duplicity. But we will develope the dark deſigns of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impoſtors and decry the cunning artifices of fictitious theologiſts.—In ſhort</p>
            <p>There appear to be ſo many abſurd and whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical ceremonies in the chriſtian inſtitution, that I am now ſtimulated to aſk the candid reader, (even ſuppoſing him to be a Chriſtian,) what apology he can make for the many contradictions and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies, of which the chriſtian ſyſtem conſiſts? Will he anſwer, that he principally depends upon the faith and virtue of the good clergy, who would not preach a doctrine, knowing it to be falſe, and as they are a very learned body they are the beſt judges. That this is the plea of millions of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian profeſſors I verily believe, and I am no leſs certain, that the clergy are a very learned body, who will do any thing that ſerves their preſent intereſt, and this is the plain reaſon why religion, and the Bible, are what they are. For inſtance,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030192_0054_0FE50A45EFF8E240"/>
if you apply to a doctor of divinity concerning ſome doubtful tenet, you ſhould firſt recollect that he is bound by oath of office, and intereſt, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, at all events, true or falſe, the doctrine of that church to which he belongs, and from which he receives his revenues. A popiſh prieſt will defend the doctrines of tranſubſtantiation, purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and the works of ſuperorogation, &amp;c. A Preſbyterian prieſt<note n="*" place="bottom">I denominate all under the term Prieſts, or Drs. of duplicity.</note> will ſupport the doctrines of election and reprobation. An Epiſcopalian prieſt will maintain the doctrines of free grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the blood of Chriſt. Each of theſe prieſts will take his oath that his doctrines are true and that all the reſt are falſe, ſo that, lay piety aſide, and the clergy are a very learned body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>I am informed that in England when a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man takes up holy orders, he is qualified to keep a pack of hounds, and the buſineſs of a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being but an idle calling, moſt of their time is occupied in hunting, ſhooting, or gambling, ſo that it is a myſtery to know whether thoſe men live to play, or play to live. The clergy of France ſwore by the four Evangeliſts that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the <hi>Holy Goſt,</hi> and endowed with the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030192_0055_0FE50A50C32DB498"/>
gift of continency; but ſince the revolution of that country, they have diſcovered a propenſity to women equal to other men. Thus much for the oath and veracity of the holy order of clergymen.</p>
            <p>I find in hiſtory that the clergy of England changed from popiſh to proteſtant in one reign, from proteſtant to popiſh in the next, and from popiſh to proteſtant in the third. Who will ſay that all this ſhifting and changing was in ſearch of purer doctrine, and not in ſearch of <hi>loaves</hi> and <hi>fiſhes?</hi> It would be a diſgrace to my profeſſion if theſe men were called <hi>Deiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe people ſeem wonderfully affected, while deploring the ſufferings of a poor unfortunate God. But can a rational being ſuppoſe for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the creator of the world ſhould reſide for three and thirty years upon this earth, in the contemptible manner aſcribed to him, one part of the time neceſſiated to work with his father at the buſineſs of a carpenter, at another time ſo deſtitute as not to have whereon to lay his head, and at laſt to be put to a ſhameful death by a few of his own creatures? Is it not a fact, that God is as far above the power of human cruelties, as the heavens are above the earth? Can the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have power over the Creator? Certainly not: if then it ſhould be ſaid in the cant way, the better to get over theſe difficulties, that there
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030192_0056_0FE50A5264CB5B78"/>
is nothing impoſſible to God: I anſwer in the negative, not but I acknowledge the divine will, and admit the power and attributes of the <hi>Deity</hi> in the fulleſt latitude, yet I am of opinion that there are many things abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to God. He cannot create another God as old as himſelf—he cannot act inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with himſelf—he cannot divide his own eſſence,—he cannot put a period to his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, nor ſuffer it to be done by others.— Theſe plain truths, without any comments, will, I preſume, convince the candid, that there are many things impoſſibe to God.</p>
            <p>Is it not time to aboliſh for ever the ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous remembrance of ancient frenzy, and renounce the dreadful cuſtom of commemorating a tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. Our thinking faculties enable us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large our circle, and we diſcover few truths but what a beneficent <hi>Deity</hi> has permitted us to ſee. It is therefore by communicating our ſentiments through the medium of the preſs, that we benefit ſociety in a thouſand different forms. To exalt the mind to a true ſenſe or omnipotent wiſdom, to repreſent the <hi>Deity</hi> in the high plenitude of power and of goodneſs, and ſhow his wondrous works in the rapid movement of blind matter, has been the work of philoſophers for many ages, far from the narrow and contracted notions of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030192_0057_0FE50A53EEE203A0"/>
crucifying to death a <hi>God</hi> who was from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,—far from the magic tricks of putting him in a hollow ſtone,—ſending him down to hell,— bringing him back again,—and then ſending him to heaven in a whirl-wind. A <hi>Deiſt</hi> laughs at theſe contemptible tales, and pities thoſe who are dupes to fables and to myſteries, to prieſts and impoſtors.</p>
            <p>If there is any thing which can aſtoniſh the contemplative philoſopher, it is the length of time which theſe magic deceptions are permitted to impoſe upon the credulity of man, and it is no leſs ſurpriſing that any being of ordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities ſhould abjure his reaſon, his liberty, and his fineſt faculties, to embrace ideas incompatible with nature, reaſon, and all human comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>The word Goſpel ſignifies truth, but why the new teſtament ſhould be conſidered as ſuch, is difficult to determine, ſince it is all fable, myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and metaphor. The parables ſaid to be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt himſelf are allowed by all the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian clergy to be only figurative ſpeeches, which repreſent things in a foreign ſenſe, after the eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern ſtile. No ſuch perſon ever exiſted as the <hi>prodigal ſon,</hi> though it is the moſt ſtriking fable in the whole Bible, and fully expreſſive of the natural conſequences of prodigality, wantoneſs,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030192_0058_0FE50A573AD007C0"/>
and diſſipation. As for the fable of <hi>Dives and Lazarus,</hi> it is a moſt extravagant thought. I have often amuſed myſelf in the idea, what a roaring and tremendous voice <hi>Dives</hi> muſt have had, to be heard from the lowermoſt pit of hell by father Abraham, who was at the ſame time in heaven, dandling <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his arms, as a nurſe would a child. In ſhort, this parable is too romantic, and all the reſt are too inſignificant to admit of ſerious animadverſion. If <hi>Aeſop's fables</hi> were bound up in the Bible, and called the <hi>book of parables,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Then might our pious and learned clergy ſay, the word of God which you will find written in the 6th chap. of Aeſop's parables, <hi>and the fox ſaid to the grapes thou art ſour.</hi>
               </note> they would convey more moral inſtruction to man, than any thing we read of in that vaſt volume. I ſhall paſs by thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written by the Saints, which we call Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, becauſe they are no more to be conſidered holy writ than the letters written by one clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to another. As for Jacob's ladder,—the miraculous pillar,—Peter's viſion,—St. John's dreams,—his white horſe,—the ſheet full of wild beaſts,—and the ſeven golden candleſticks,—I throw them as lumber into the bargain.</p>
            <p>Thus, the Bible running through a tedious
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030192_0059_0FE50A60C4A312A0"/>
and unintereſting narration of contradictory cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, empties itſelf in a round aſſertion, <hi>"Were all the works that Chriſt had done written in a book, the world could not contain it."</hi> What a pitiful notion of the world the people of thoſe days muſt have had, to ſuppoſe it might be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with a manuſcript.</p>
            <p>Citizens, rouſe from your lethargy, be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger amuſed with the remnants of fuſty tales, or the genealogical tree of Eden, diſregard at once all antiquated folly, and become the cotemporary of future ages. Contemplate that revelation, which the God of nature and reaſon has given us, in the bounties of his creation; there you will read a language that requires not the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theological drones, nor the comments of divine Simonites; you ſee that religion which has poiſoned the world is founded upon a rotten baſis, and it appears high time to give to morality a much better ſupport.</p>

            <p>Oh ye clergy! ye learned men! inſtigated by ſome untoward deſtiny to deceive the world, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to addreſs theſe my laſt lines to you. What ſay you to thoſe goſpel precepts, do you really believe them to be either <hi>practicable, ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> or <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with <hi>nature</hi> or with <hi>reaſon?</hi> Do you patronize after the model of him whoſe diſciples ye profeſs to be? Are you like him, free from paſſion, anger, or deſpair? Have you diſgraced the reformed pulpit, or profaned the Roman al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, when an <hi>unitarian lecturer</hi> expoſed the folly of your dogmas? Oh ye clergy, are you the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that unreaſonable man who laid down rules of life impoſſible to obey? Do you take thought for to-morrow, what ye ſhall eat, drink, or wherewith ye ſhall be cloathed? Do you pray without ceaſing? Do you do good for evil, bleſs them that curſe you, and pray for them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute and deſpitefully uſe you? Do you invite the poor, the lame, the maimed, the halt, and the blind to your ſumptuous tables, to the utter excluſion of your rich friends and neighbours? Do you ſwear not at all, and reſiſt not evil? In
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030192_0061_0FE50A640C4C0E58"/>
a word, Do you do unto all men as you wiſh they ſhould do unto you? If Sirs, you do not attend to all theſe precepts, which are truly Chriſtian, what pretenſions have you to be the obedient ſervants of him, who, as your maſter, allotted you theſe ſeveral taſks and duties to perform, without exception.</p>
            <p>He who told you to ſell all and follow him, do you not rather acquire all and forſake him? did he not forewarn you againſt covetouſneſs? And are you not as covetous as if you were to live a never ending life? You who ſhould lay no ſtore on the good things of this world, are you not as particularly nice in your eatables and wearables, as if your bodies were formed of purer clay than thoſe of other mortals? Do you not in direct contradiction to the precepts of your Lord, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your rich friends and neighbours to the total excluſion of the poor and blind, nay, have you not under the ſanction of a reformation, even robbed the poor to enrich your own revenues. If then, what you tell us be really true, <hi>that we ſhall all appear before your divine maſter at the laſt day, to receive judgment according to our works,</hi> what account can you give of yourſelves, ſeeing that you deviate from thoſe commandments which he ſet before you; muſt you not ſay that they were

               <hi>impracticable, inconſiſtent,</hi> and <hi>unnatural,</hi> or elſe that you did not approve of them.</p>
            <p>Remember then the language of my fellow creature whom you ſtile your God: <hi>"If ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in my word then are ye my diſciples indeed."</hi> Divines, we ſee you eternally conſpiring againſt reaſon, againſt liberty, and againſt the freedom of conſcience, we liſten to your declamations againſt us <hi>Deiſts,</hi> whom you inviduouſly ſtile the ſons of infidelity, you prevail upon your flock, to believe that we wiſh to deſtroy all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and morality, but the reverſe is the fact, we inculcate virtue and ſound morality, founded upon reaſon and the being of a <hi>God.</hi> We <hi>Deiſts</hi> are not aſhamed to own our profeſſion; we will convince our Chriſtian adverſaries, by our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the world, by our lives, conduct, and converſation, that we are virtuous, mild, gentle, and humane.</p>
            <p>Clergy, we liſten to your deſcription of a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible heterogeneous monſter whom you ſet up as the terror of man. At one time he is fomenting ſedition in heaven,—at another time he is in open rebellion againſt the Deity,—at another time he is hurled into a pit, and chained for a thouſand years,—at another time he is at large going about like a roaring lion ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,—in ſhort, he is but every where: can a

reflective mind ſuppoſe for a moment that ſuch a monſter does exiſt, or that he has the power which divines attribute to him. It was to deſtroy the power of this fiend that the mighty Jeſus came into the world, yet he never was more om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent than ſince the commencement of the Chriſtian aera, and divines render him more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty than the Deity himſelf.<note n="*" place="bottom">Perhaps of all the ſcarecrow doctrines that ever afflicted an enlightened nation, this is one of the groſſeſt impoſitions on the human underſtanding. <hi>Fooliſh man</hi> there is no roaring lion, the clergy who terrify you with this idea know it to be a fraud, yet they carry their deception to ſuch a length, as to count it profane to take his ſooty majeſty's name in vain.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As it is with Satan, ſo it is with man, at one time he is the high and mighty Lord of God's creation,—the nobleſt of God's creatures,—the image of God himſelf,—but one degree below the angels in heaven,—having dominion over all things, &amp;c. at another time he is but duſt and aſhes,—a crawling worm,—a filthy animal,—a helpleſs wretch unworthy of God's favours &amp;c.

and various attributes, as man and Satan. You Deify a man and call him very good, who tells you, <hi>"There is none good but one,"</hi> evidently meaning <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude. Charity will not permit a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that a well informed people can yield im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit credit to a book which exhibits in almoſt every leaf ſome ſtrange and unaccountable para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, a book crouded with indelicate and obſcene matter, unworthy a ſerious reading, it leads the credulous into numberleſs errors, and involves them in a multiplicity of incoherent doctrines. To attribute ſuch a production to an <hi>all-wiſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity</hi> is offering the groſſeſt inſult to his <hi>omnipotent wiſdom,</hi> it being a maſs of iniquity, the fountain of inviduous controverſies which uſually termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the effuſion of human blood, whoſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing torrents have deluged the world, as well under the Moſaic theocracy, as under the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian diſpenſation: it is a volume of knavery, purpoſely contrived to anſwer the ſiniſter views of prieſts and princes, who alone fatten on its impracticable precepts.</p>
            <p>Would it not then, be a felicity to future ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, were this book and the blind tenets deduced from it, ſcouted from the earth, and bloated for ever from the memory of man, will

not an unborn poſterity, at the peruſal of this volume, bluſh at the folly and blind credulity of their anceſtors. But alas we fear, while the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of duplicity feel an intereſt in ſupporting the pious fraud, and live in ſumptuous indolence upon the bounties of a credulous laity, the world will be too long infected with a nuiſance ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting to every enlightened mind. Chriſtians, we <hi>Deiſts</hi> are not poſſeſſed of vain oſtentation, and, though we act upon a different principle, and found our hopes upon a different proſpect, we acknowledge you to be our brethren, we pity error, we defy envy, but we never perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute opinion.</p>

            <head>ADDRESS, TO THE SOCIETY FOR PROMOTING CHRISTIAN KNOWLEDGE AND PIETY.</head>
            <p>DURING the imbecility of childhood I had not the capacity to judge, and in the juvenal days of immatured manhood I thought it a crime to doubt the divinity of thoſe preceptorial doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, the knowledge of which you wiſh to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, but now, finding my chin graced with a grizly beard, my head ornamented with grey locks—my mind free from the ſhackles of eccleſiaſtical ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,—and my heart panting for the good of man,—I became moved by an indiſcribable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe to compare the principles of your religion with the practice of its profeſſors. I ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a contraſt, which gave me a ſtimulous to further enquiries, the reſult of which proves the utter impracticability of the chriſtian ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>My duty as a citizen of the world, leads me to publiſh a few ſtrictures on a chain of dogmas, and whimſical myſteries, ſo much at variance againſt nature,—incompatible with rational conſiſtency,— irreconcileable to common ſenſe,—and diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to an <hi>all-wiſe Deity.</hi> Motives of pity might

be the baſis of your inſtitution, but your zealous efforts to promote the cauſe of God, and the good of man, would be leſs in vain, were you to abandon folly, and inſtitute a ſociety for the promotion of <hi>uſeful knowledge and ſcience,</hi> inſtead of encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the breed of ſaints and fanatics.</p>
            <p>Is it now after a religion has been in faſhion near 1800 years that we are to acquire a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of its ceremonious punctilios, and extract from it a little piety, what it really produces? is it now, we are to open our eyes, and gaze with aſtoniſhment on the beautiful fabric of blind myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, or look with a pious admiration on the divine ſublimity of a ſyſtem which has confounded the inquiſitors of all ages.—A ſyſtem founded upon fable, and eſtabliſhed upon fanaticiſm, and perſecution:—a ſyſtem that never conſults reaſon, but always oppoſes it:—a ſyſtem that approves poverty, yet commits ſymony and rapine to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its pomp:—in ſhort,—a ſyſtem inconſiſtent with every thing but contradiction. How are our thinking faculties confounded at the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of ſuch a ſyſtem,—ſtrange that a ſociety ſhould be inſtituted to promote the knowledge of a religion, to the bottom of which no Chriſtian dare venture; it is criminal for a chriſtian to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the origin of his religion, and to doubt the truth of the Bible, is an excluſion from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

            <p>Theſe facts are well know to the chriſtian cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of all nations, but inſtead of giving their flock ſuch information, they fondly conceal the fraud, under the maſk of piety: how then are we to obtain a knowledge of the chriſtian religion, aſk one ſect of chriſtians, <hi>"how many ſacraments hath Chriſt ordained in his church?"</hi> You will receive for anſwer, <hi>ſeven:</hi> aſk another ſect, the ſame queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and you will be informed, <hi>two:</hi> aſk a third ſect, and you will be told, <hi>none at all:</hi> what ſhall we ſay to ſuch glaring contradictions. Each of theſe profeſs to be of found orthodox principles, yet they differ from each other, as much as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive differs from a nonentity. It appears to me then, that inſtead of promoting <hi>chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> your ſociety is inſtituted for the promotion

of <hi>chriſtian ignorance,</hi> by which reaſon is degraded; and thoſe who are dupes to a pretended revelation, are completely hag-ridden by the magic charms of prieſt-craft. Thus we may diſcover, that while the deluded Mahometans are coranized the infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſtians, are <hi>bibleized</hi> to a miracle, and the pious miniſters of a poor unfortunate God fail not to pronounce an eternal anathema on thoſe who do not abjure reaſon, and embrace dogmas repugnant to ſenſe and nature.</p>
            <p>Divines? You who aſſume ſuch powerful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the ſouls of men; you who can tranſport us either to heaven or to hell at your pleaſure, why not work ſome mighty miracle, after the manner of your lord and maſter, from whom you received your divine miſſion, to convince us of your authority over us, but, why talk of miracles, when pious duplicity informs us that miracles have ceaſed; all we have to do then, is to believe, and this belief leads us to imagine, that we are dead when alive, and that we are alive when actually dead. This belief reverſes the whole order of creation; this belief will ſave us to eternity, with all our imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without which the moſt righteous muſt endure, a bitter portion of never ending miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Oh! horrible doctrine! eſtabliſhed by the

Will my believing a fable conſtitute it a fact, or will my believing in a nonen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity conſtitute it a ſubſtantive? Suppoſe I believe a horſe is a dog, or a dog to be a pig, will this alter the nature of theſe animals? If I believe that <hi>one is three,</hi> or that <hi>three is one,</hi> this is repugnant to the ſcience of numbers, or if I believe that a virgin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſon, and that this ſon was his own father, being <hi>4000</hi> years older than his mother, nature and reaſon inſtantly revolts and ſays this cannot be. It would be well then to throw aſide blind faith, and believe in nothing but what can be clearly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Will you, Sirs, deem it criminal to expoſe the foibles of a ſyſtem which has filled the world with blood and terror for eighteen centuries, during which period, ſcarce a moment's interval of peace can be traced out by the moſt zealous partizan;—hoſtile wars,—carnage,—deſolation,— famine,—and infidelity, mark the gloomy pages of the Chriſtian hiſtory,—thus the divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030192_0071_0FE50A9A65034BC8"/>
of a celeſtially begotten man, has tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Chriſtians into devouring monſters, who make the earth groan under the weight of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, bigotry, fanaticiſm, and perſecution.</p>
            <p>Divines, you call theſe enormities, only an abuſe of power, flowing from the corruption of Chriſtianity; but it is not your bountiful ſtock of divine grace, nor all your rhetoric, nor pulpit admonitions, that can prevent the evils, nor wipe away the odium: know you not, that you are the time ſervers of every nation: the engines of deſpotiſm: the tools of ſtateſmen, and of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns: even to aſſaſſinate where occaſion requires, whatever is the will of your prince, you chearfully obey, and thus you piouſly ſerve God and Mammon. You profeſs a dependance upon the mercies of your God, a reliance upon his providence, and a chearful reſignation to his will; but the moment an epidemic appears you abandon all your profeſſions, deſert your church, and miſtruſt the goodneſs of your God, whoſe mercy and providence is no longer to be depended upon. I had an opportunity of making theſe obſervations in the caſe of the Philadelphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the year 1793, and of the New-Yorkers in 1795, when the moſt religious were the moſt apprehenſive of danger, and the firſt who fled from the contagion. Family attachment had no
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030192_0072_0FE50A9C60509158"/>
check upon their fears, humanity yielded to ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh brutality, they no longer truſted to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a divine providence, and the God of Chriſtians was no longer the God of hope, at that awful criſis. Chriſtian piety diſcovered that the rural Gods were more propitious than the great ruler of populous cities.</p>
            <p>Let us now liſten to the language of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine maſter, <hi>"whatſoever ye aſk the father in my name, he will give it."</hi> Needs there any more to confute this vague aſſertion, than a reference to long experience, and well known diſappointments. It is freſh in the recollection of every man, that all churches and chapels of every ſect through the Britiſh dominions, were for ſeven ſucceſſive years importuning the Almighty, to turn the hearts of the <hi>rebellious ſubjects in America.</hi> Why where not their prayers immediately anſwered, after heaven and earth were ſo piouſly moved to that effect, or why are not all Chriſtian petitions complied with, after being echoed from one nation to another, eſpecially ſince they are fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently offered up in the name, and for the ſake of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt their Lord and Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He again tells us that, <hi>"his yoke is eaſy, and his burthen is light,"</hi> and invites "thoſe who are <hi>weary and heavy laden to come unto him, and he
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030192_0073_0FE50A9DEF638BC8"/>
will give them reſt.</hi>" Now, though it is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of an humble God, to his poor diſtreſſed diſciples, I challenge the aſſertions. His yoke, if ſuch may be conſidered the obligation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his precepts, is ſlaviſh beyond compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, impoſſible to be complied with, being repugnant to human nature, and his burthen, if ſuch may be conſidered the expence of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting his religion, is arbitrary, oppreſſive and tyrannical, eſpecially in countries, where eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed churches, have the excluſive right to expound the word of God, and where every individual is obliged to contribute to the religion which is moſt faſhionable at court; in ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the clergy reſemble the imps of infernal deities, rather than the meek diſciples of an <hi>humble, penitent, and ſuffering Saviour.</hi> What reſt can the weary and heavy laden find, by ſubſcribing to a religion, bearing no proportion to itſelf, —a religion that confounds both ſenſe and nature, and petrifies all human underſtanding,—a religion that humbles a God to a man, and proudly exalts man to a God,—a religion that makes the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a creator, and the creator a mere creature.</p>
            <p>Is it to promote the knowledge of ſuch a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem that ſocieties are formed. Yes, you will ſay, it is neceſſary to keep up a ſyſtem of religion. Granted; but is it neceſſary to keep up a ſyſtem
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030192_0074_0FE50A9FEB521A68"/>
of fraud, would not a more rational ſyſtem be equally effectual, both in its moral and political tendency. What benefit ariſes to man by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding <hi>divinity</hi> with <hi>humanity,</hi> or worſhipping a feeble man, who diſclaimed the title of a God. Are you afraid to offend the <hi>deity;</hi> by diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to honour him. You will anſwer perhaps, that it is no wiſe criminal to worſhip a being who had, <hi>"all power given him, in heaven, and upon earth:"</hi> but how has Chriſt made it appear that ever ſuch power was delegated to him? upon what authority do you believe he poſſeſſed ſuch power? upon the authority of a blind aſſertion; one man relates the ſtory to another, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it again as an <hi>ipſo facto.</hi> Would ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity eſtabliſh a fact now a days? certainly not. Were I to ſay I was born unbegotten, or begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not made, or that I was older than the man who was at my chriſtning, would any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me.</p>
            <p>Strange indeed that a man who had all power in heaven and upon earth, the ſaviour of a whole world, could not ſave himſelf, and prolong a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial exiſtence, to the more ſolid ſatisfaction of future generations. Was eighteen months the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly time allotted this ambaſſador plenipotentiary extraordinary, to ratify a treaty between the prieſts of this earth, and the high court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030192_0075_0FE50AB47AE52218"/>
That the all powerful God of nature could perform more in eighteen ſeconds, than Chriſt had done during his earthly reſidence, all reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men will allow, yet this man is repreſented to us as a <hi>God of worſhip and adoration,</hi> and though he was miſerably wretched, we are taught to believe he poſſeſſed <hi>all power in heaven and upon earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were not his diſtreſſes inſupportable; did he not labour for a miſerable exiſtence like many others; was he not as deſtitute as the itinerant mendicant:—and did he not ſuffer a degrading and ignominious death: but, you will ſay, all this was to ſet an example to the world, and his death was to ranſom ſinners from the wrath to come. Yes, he ſet an example which his moſt pious and zealous admirers ſtudiouſly avoid, and his death was evidently, becauſe he could not help it.—He preached up ſedition, and oppoſed the law of Moſes, he inſulted the Jewiſh Rabies, and obſtructed their tranquility, for which they accuſed him, and by legal proſecution ſentenced him to death agreeable to the cuſtoms of their country. Would to God the Chriſtian religion were exempt from crimes of equal abhorrence. Murder and felony were alike committed under the maſk of piety; racks, gibbets, and lighted faggots were the arguments oppoſed to thoſe,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030192_0076_0FE50AB70F8F6600"/>
who attempted to obſtruct the early progreſs of the Chriſtian ſyſtem. Even now, in the ſtates of Italy, or in the empires of Spain and Portugal, any perſon attempting to reform popery, would infallibly ſuffer death,—not as a redeemeer, but as an heretic,—not as a ſaviour, but as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Upon a clear examination, I find this ſaviour of the world is but a partial redeemer, his atoning merits extending but to a few of the human race. The number of people inhabiting Chriſtian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, does not exceed 136 millions; one fourth of them are <hi>Deiſts,</hi> conſequently they diſclaim all participation in the meritorious ſufferings of a ſaviour. The remaining number will not ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceed 102 millions. The whole globe has about 400 millions of inhabitants, ſubtract 102 millions of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and there remains 366 millions of people; who know not Chriſt, nor chuſe him for their head; muſt all theſe periſh eternally, muſt they linger in never ending torments, and wallow for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in fire,—brimſtone,—melted lead,—brandy and gun-powder,—with all the combuſtibles a vicious prieſthood can invent, becauſe they do not believe what is not true. Who but men blindly infatuated would ſubſcribe to ſuch a prepoſterous religion.<note n="*" place="bottom">The clergy may, For intereſted motives, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their rigid doctrines, but I have too great a ſenſe of their learning and underſtanding not to allow them to be <hi>Deiſts.</hi> I have a knowledge of three in Philadelphia, and two in New York, who are of that perſuaſion and one of the five is a <hi>biſhop.</hi> It is becauſe Deiſts are not formed into ſociety that they have not preceptors of the firſt rate talents.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:030192_0079_0FE50966EF0C2C98"/>The capricious temper of the Deity, as record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſcripture, is ſomewhat ſingular. At one time, to ſave the world and mankind, he deſtroyed it and them together by a mighty deluge: This not perfecting his intention to ſave loſt man, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed himſelf upon a gibbet. His third experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be to conſume the whole globe and all things in it with fire from heaven; ſuch romances paſs as current among Chriſtians. If ſin is to be deſtroyed by barbarous and inhuman cruelties, this latter experiment will undoubtedly prove moſt effectual. This will be a grand burnt-offering to the Lord of Hoſts. Here the gratifying flames of all things, animate and inanimate, will aſcend to heaven, and the Deity will conſole himſelf with the odoriferous effluvia, this, not like the partial offerings of the ancient prieſts, who ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed bulls, and goats, and kids, and lambs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon the holy alter, piouſly offering the fat and blood to God, but eat the fleſh themſelves. In
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030192_0077_0FE50ABA8E7510A8"/>
this laſt exhibition the whole earth with all its inhabitants, both prieſts and laity, both ſavage and civil, will be conſumed by celeſtial fire, while the almighty will delight in our torments, and like a Roman tyrant dance to the muſic of our ſhrieks and groans; well may the God of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians be called a devouring God, a God of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, who creates men only to deſtroy them: but, the ſcene is not yet cloſed: after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the earth, the moon ſhall be turned into blood, the clouds ſhall fall, and the ſtars drop from heaven. Here will be ratling works indeed; much better be a ſpectator than an actor in this pantomime. Perhaps this is the time, when thoſe who have died in the faith ſhall riſe trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and <q>play marbles with thoſe little ſtars, kick about the morn, and quench the blazing ſun; then ſhall the celeſtial gods, and goddeſſes meet, and fumble in the dark.</q> Unruly man, be cautious on that great day, how you come acroſs the virgin Mary.</p>
            <p>Pardon me Sirs, I am more at a loſs to apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize for this irony, than to expoſe the folly of your favourite ſyſtem—but to return</p>
            <p>The moſt potent evidence in favour of the Chriſtian ſcheme, are thoſe of Mary and Thomas, though it is a little remarkable that Thomas ſaid
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030192_0078_0FE50AC780F792E8"/>
nothing about the matter himſelf; other people tell the ſtory for him. As for Mary, ſhe gains greater credit, than would be given to a lady of more honour and veracity in thoſe days: it is rather ſtrange, that Mary and Thomas never fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the world with either an epiſtle or a goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel upon the ſubject. They, it ſeems, told the ſtory to others; others told it again to others, till at length the tradition, like that which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes gives us of the creation, becomes the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belief. Were an old Methodiſt woman to aſſert that ſhe ſaw John Weſtly, a certain time after his burial, that he was ſeen by many others of his moſt intimate friends, that he wrought many miracles before them, and then went up to heaven, would any one believe her; if ſhe had gone before a magiſtrate and taken her oath that it was a fact; would ſhe gain the more credit, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not: neither do I choſe to believe Mary, nor Thomas, nor . . . . .</p>
            <p>The primitive councils, who firſt founded the Chriſtian ſyſtem, took infinite pains to blend the virgin Mary with the God-head, and ſo make it conſiſt of four perſons inſtead of three; ſhe was however, rejected by a ſmall majority. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhe loſt her election, there are a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſect of Chriſtians, who, to this day honour
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030192_0080_0FE50ACE06DE2208"/>
her with divine worſhip and adoration.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Roman Catholics have it thus: Mary by the rights of a Mother, command thy ſon to intercede for us.</note> If then the motion for her union with the God-head had paſſed in the affirmative, would not our modern Chriſtians worſhip her among the catalogue of their Gods. All this proves to a demonſtration, that the world is governed by fraud, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by reaſon. The four following remarks will bring us to a concluſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Lords prayer is confeſſed by all Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to be of divine ſublimity, ſurpaſſing any thing of human compoſition, but this is far below the teſt of criticiſm. In the former part you direct the Deity to do his own will, the next ſentence demands bread for the day, what moſt people are already poſſeſſed of. Then proceeds a requeſt, that your treſpaſſes might be forgiven, as you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thoſe who treſpaſs againſt you: But I ſay unto all Chriſtians, woe be unto them, if heaven ſhews no more benignity on them, than they ſhew mercy on their offenders.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. <hi>If Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſpoke by divine authority, it is blowing hot and cold with the ſame breath, every propoſition of one being palpably contradicted by the other; however, the laws of Moſes, take the lead of Jeſus Chriſt's whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030192_0081_0FE50ACF9160DA40"/>
have no influence upon the paſſions, form no part of our municipal laws, nor are they atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to by any Chriſtian ſect whatever. Whether then, your Chriſtian religion is of divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or a trick played off in the dark ages of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it is an untoward ſyſtem, and deſerves to be admired only for its deformity.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. The Chriſtian religion was firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the terror of authority: the inſinuating arts of miſſionaries, perſecution and proſcription, &amp;c. All theſe conſpired to eſtabliſh Chriſtianity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ruins of the Moſaic ſyſtem. Did you ever conſult theſe truths,—did you ever inform your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the ſtratagems firſt adopted to propagate your holy religion, even in its reformed ſtate, or,—did you believe the hiſtories which tranſmit to poſterity theſe impartial facts, as implicitly as you believe the bible. It is probable your zeal would ſlacken,—your exertions to promote Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian knowledge would be leſs vigorous, and—your contribution would be appropriated to a more laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. Were I to ſay that blind men were very keen ſighted, and that deaf men are very quick of hearing, you would naturally think me a lunatic, yet ſuch ſentiments are as compatible with reaſon and commom ſenſe, as many precepts of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſyſtem. Can you reconcile thoſe ideas of a
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030192_0082_0FE50AD322C3FE70"/>
God in three parts?—a virgin in wedlock? a God in gibbets?—ſerpents and aſſes ſpeaking moſt eloquently in human language,—and thoſe heroic flights from earth up to heaven, in whirl-winds and fiery chariots;—yes, you believe all theſe, and a thouſand other like ſtories, but deny an equal fact that blind men can ſee, or that deaf men can hear. You bow down with reverence to the fables of antiquity, and conſider a modern farce as the effects of ſin and levity.—You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the adoration of an indiviſible God, and worſhip with enthuſiaſm, a mixture of deities, compoſed of many parts;—You confound <hi>finity</hi> with <hi>infinity,</hi> and <hi>divinity</hi> with <hi>humanity,</hi>—you humble the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>creation</hi> to a level with man, and proudly exalt man to the magnificence of a <hi>God.</hi> Believe me, ſirs, that <hi>Deiſm</hi> is yet trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, where deſpotic laws are not enforced, to maintain that whimſical, and metaphorical ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, the knowledge of which you wiſh to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.</p>
