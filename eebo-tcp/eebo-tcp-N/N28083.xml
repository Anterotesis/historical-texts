            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS anniverſary, we uſed to celebrate with joy, as the Birth Day of one of the greateſt and beſt men; but our joy is turned into ſorrow:—inſtead of the emblems of joy and feſtivity, we are ſhrouded with the inſignia of ſorrow and heart-felt <hi>grief:</hi>—for this great and good man is no more!—His death, which took place on the 14th of laſt December, has inervated and paralized all the ſprings of hilarity, which were ſet in motion at the remembrance of his birth-day, which (allowing for the alteration of ſtile) took place on the 22d of February, 1732.</p>
            <p>BUT why! why ſhould his death eclipſe all the joy of his natal day? for does not the wiſe king ſay, that a good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of ones death is better than the day of ones birth?<note n="*" place="bottom">Ecc. vii. 1.</note>—And who ſays the contrary? Certainly, the fragrancy of a good name, juſtly acquired, is more extenſively diffuſed, more beneficial in its influence, and more permanent in its duration:—It will live in the page of hiſtory, and continue to ſhed its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign influence to unborn generations, when the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ointment ſhall loſe all its perfume, and its ſubtle ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviae will evaporate into empty air.</p>

him with all that wiſdom and courage which enabled him to foreſee, face and conquer, or to eſcape from thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangers he could not overcome. He adorned and inriched him with all thoſe illuſtrious virtues which made him outſhine all his co-patriots both in the field and in the cabinet—at the head of a brave army, or as the firſt magiſtrate in the chair of ſtate. For it is thine O God to give both riches and honor, and in thine hand is power and might, and it is in thine hand to make great and to give ſtrength unto all." Let therefore the tear of ingenuous ſorrow which has bedewed the cheek of millions, be mixed with the tear of gratitude to God for ſuch a ſeaſonable, ſuch an accompliſhed inſtrument of his glory and our ſalvation.</p>
            <p>HE was but the inſtrument, and his wiſe and energetic adminiſtrations was the channel, through which flowed to us, the greateſt and the choiceſt national bleſſings "from the Father of Lights, from whom cometh down every good and perfect gift." Gratitude to the Father of the univerſe has a juſt claim upon us, for this tribute of reſpect which we this day pay to the memory of the "man whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to honor."</p>
            <p>IT is a debt due to departed merit, which can in no way be paid ſo well, as by the ſpontaneous effuſions of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere ſorrow;—by ſtrictly adhering to his wiſe counſels, and by immitating his amiable and illuſtrious virtues.</p>
            <p>IT is a rate thing to ſee true greatneſs and real goodneſs blended in one character:—We have heard of great men, an <hi>Alexander,</hi> a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> a <hi>Pompey,</hi> a <hi>Lewis</hi> and a <hi>Frederic:</hi>
               <pb n="6"

and from the buſtle and noiſe which they made, and the devaſtations and ſlaughter which they ſpread, they, with oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſimilar characters were called <hi>great</hi> but without an abuſe of language they could not be called <hi>good:</hi>—For whether they meditated <hi>peace</hi> or <hi>war</hi>— the tranquility or diſturbance of the world—whether they ſought the proſperity or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation of countries; whether they govern nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or command armies, ſtill intereſt, ambition or revenge, were their leading-motives; and while they ruled or tyranized over millions they had no rule over their own paſſions, and they ſet no bounds to their ambition and avarice.</p>
            <p>BUT rare as it is for great men to be good, we have one inſtance at leaſt and we hope we have many, but the great abilities of the good man whoſe death we this day lament, was combined and adorned with eminent virtues.</p>
            <p>WE ſaw him early riſe to eminence by the joint diſplay, of both great abilities and illuſtrious virtues. We ſaw him riſe and ſhine the <hi>Patriot,</hi> the <hi>Hero</hi> and the <hi>Saint.</hi> At the head of a victorious army, at the helm of government, and in the humble retreats of rural life.</p>
            <p>THOUGH ſurrounded with all the faſcinating alurements of ambition, intereſt, ſenſuality and licentiouſneſs, cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with glory, inveſted with power, and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in wealth; yet foregoing all ſelfiſh and mercenary views, he maintained that abſolute ſelf-government as gave him a juſt claim to the character of the pious, benevolent, juſt, meek, temperate, and <hi>good man.</hi>

            <p>THIS favorite ſon of fortune was unaffected with her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious <hi>favors</hi> or <hi>frowns</hi>:—He was undiſmayed at the moſt formidable aſpects, uncontaminated amidſt the ſtrongeſt temptations—"No bribe could ſeduce him, no terror could overawe him."

But it was his great concern to be found faithful to that Being, who had intruſted him with ſo many talents, "that he might give up his account with joy."

            <p>WE ſaw our WASHINGTON not a mere ſoldier, like other great warriors, graſping at empire by the deſtruction of foreign nations, or aſpiring to a civic crown, through ſeas of blood and ſlaughter; but the greater warrior who could blend the feelings of the citizen with thoſe of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and temper the ambition of the conqueror with the humility and meekneſs of the Chriſtian:—Such a rare combination of talents and virtues, admirably formed him for command and intitled him to the firſt diſtinction in the liſt of military fame.</p>
            <p>He ſhone equally in the chair of ſtate at the head of the national council, as he did at the head of the combined armies of America.

Not like the impious philoſophers and diſorganizers of the preſent day;—He made no ſeparation between the duties we owe to God and the duties we owe to our fellow men, or to ſociety at large.

            <p>THE period for a new election of a Citizen to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the executive government of the United States, being not far diſtant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts muſt be employed in deſignating the perſon, who is to be clothed with that important truſt, it appears to me proper, eſpecially as it may conduce to a more diſtinct expreſſion of the public voice, that I ſhould now appriſe you of the reſolution I have formed, to decline being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered among the number of thoſe out of whom a choice is to be made.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>THE acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your ſuffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform ſacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a defference for what appeared to be your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. I conſtantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power, conſiſtently with motives which I was not at liberty to diſregard, to return to that retirement from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The ſtrength of my inclination to do this, previous to the laſt election, had even led to the preparation of an addreſs to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical poſture of affairs with foreign nations, and the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous advice of perſons entitled to my confidence, impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me to abandon the idea.</p>

            <p>IN looking forward to the moment, which is intended to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to ſuſpend the deep acknowledgment o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

main pillar in the edifice of your real Independence, the ſupport of your tranquility at home, your peace abroad; of your ſafety; of your proſperity; of that very liberty which you ſo highly prize. But, as it is eaſy to foreſee, that from different cauſes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth, as this is the point in your political fortreſs, againſt which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be moſt conſtantly and actively (though often covertly and inſidiouſly) direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is of infinite moment that you ſhould properly eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the immenſe value of your National Union, to your collective and individual happineſs; that you ſhould cheriſh a cordial, habitual and immoveable attachment to it; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtoming yourſelves to think and ſpeak of it as of the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladium of your political ſafety and proſperity, watching for its preſervation with jealous anxiety; diſcountenancing whatever may ſuggeſt even a ſuſpicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the firſt dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the reſt, or to enfeeble the ſacred ties which now link together the various parts.</p>
            <p>FOR this you have every inducement of ſympathy and intereſt. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that country has a right to concentrate your affections.

You have in a common cauſe fought and triumphed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Independence and Liberty you poſſeſs are the work of joint councils, and joint efforts, of common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſufferings and ſucceſſes.</p>
            <p>BUT theſe conſiderations however powerfully they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves to your ſenſibility, are greatly outweighed by thoſe which apply more immediately to your intereſt. Here every portion of our country finds the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding motives for carefully guarding and preſerving the union of the whole.</p>
            <p>THE North in an unreſtrained intercourſe with the South, protected by the equal laws of a common govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, finds in the production of the latter, great additional reſources of maritime and commercial enterpriſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious materials of manufacturing induſtry. The South in the ſame intercourſe, benefitting by the agency of the North, ſees its agriculture grow, and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its own channels the ſeamen of the North, it finds its particular navigation invigorated—and while it contributes, in different ways, to nouriſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the general maſs of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime ſtrength, to which itſelf is unequally adapted. The Eaſt in a like intercourſe with the Weſt, already finds, and in the progreſſive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of interior communications, by land and water, will more and more find a valuable vent for the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which it brings from abroad, or manufactures at home. The Weſt derives from the Eaſt ſupplies requiſite to its growth and comfort—and what is perhaps of ſtill

greater conſequence, it muſt of neceſſity owe the ſecure enjoyment of indiſpenſable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime ſtrength of the Atlantic ſide of the union, directed by an indiſſoluble community of intereſt as <hi>one nation.</hi> Any other tenure by which the Weſt can hold this eſſential advantage whether derived from its own ſeparate ſtrength, or from an apoſtate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, muſt be intrinſically precarious.</p>
            <p>WHILE then every part of our country thus feels an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and particular intereſt in union, all the parts combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned cannot fail to find in the united maſs of means and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, greater ſtrength, greater reſource, proportionably greater ſecurity, from external danger, a leſs frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of their peace by foreign nations; and what is of ineſtimable value! they muſt derive from union an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from thoſe broils and wars between themſelves, which ſo frequently afflict neighbouring countries, not tied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſame government; which their own rivalſhips alone would be ſufficient to produce, but which oppoſite foreign alliances, attachments and intrigues would ſtimulate and imbitter.—Hence likewiſe they will avoid the neceſſity of thoſe overgrown military eſtabliſhments, which under any form of government are inauſpicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hoſtile to Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Liberty: In this ſenſe it is, that your union ought to be conſidered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preſervation of the other.</p>

of the UNION as a primary object of a patriotic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Is there a doubt, whether a common government can embrace ſo large a ſphere?—Let experience ſolve it. To liſten to mere ſpeculation in ſuch a caſe were criminal.

It is well worth a fair and a full expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment. With ſuch powerful and obvious motives to the union, affecting all parts of our country, while experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall not have demonſtrated its impracticability, there will always be reaſon to diſtruct the patriotiſm of thoſe, who in any quarter may endeavour to weaken its bands.</p>
            <p>In contemplating the cauſes which may diſturb our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it occurs as matter of ſerious concern, that any ground ſhould be furniſhed for characteriſing parties, by Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical diſcriminations—Northern and Southern —Atlantic and Weſtern; whence deſigning men may endevour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a belief, that there is real difference of local intereſt and views.

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>THERE is an opinion that parties in free countries are uſeful checks upon the adminiſtration of the government, and ſerve to keep alive the ſpirit of Liberty.—This within certain limits is probably true, and in governments of a monarchial caſt, patriotiſm may look with indulgence, if not with favor upon the ſpirit of party. But in thoſe of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a ſpirit not to be encouraged.—From their natural tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency it is certain there will always be enough of that ſpirit for every ſalutary purpoſe. And there being conſtant danger of exceſs, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT is important likewiſe, that the habits of thinking in a free country, ſhould inſpire caution in thoſe entruſted with its adminiſtration, to confine themſelves within their reſpective conſtitutional ſpheres, avoiding in the exerciſe of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The ſpirit of encroachment tends to conſolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real deſpotiſm. A juſt eſtimate of that love of power, and proneneſs to abuſe it, which predominates in the human heart is ſufficient to ſatisfy us of the truth of this poſition. The neceſſity of reciprocal checks in the exerciſe of the political power; by dividing and diſtributing it into different depoſitories, and conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each the guardian of the public weal againſt invaſions by the others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern; ſome of them in our country and under our own

eyes. To preſerve them muſt be as neceſſary as to inſtitute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the diſtribution or modification of the conſtitutional powers be in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the conſtitution deſignates—But let there be no change by uſurpation; for though this, in one inſtance, may be the inſtrument of good, it is the cuſtomary weapon by which free governments are deſtroyed—The precedent muſt always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or tranſient benefit which the uſe can at any time yield.</p>
            <p>OF all the diſpoſitions and habits which lead to polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical proſperity, Religion and Morality are indiſpenſable ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who would labor to ſubvert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and to cheriſh them.—A volume could not trace all their connections with private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic felicity. Let it ſimply be aſked, where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the ſenſe of religious obligation deſert the oaths which are the inſtruments of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation in Courts of Juſtice?—And let us with caution indulge the ſuppoſition, that morality can be maintained without religion.

            <p>As a very important ſource of ſtrength and ſecurity, cheriſh public credit—One method of preſerving it is to uſe it as ſparingly as poſſible; avoiding occaſions of expence by cultivating peace, but remembering alſo that timely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements to prepare for dangers, frequently prevent much greater diſburſements to repel it. Avoiding likewiſe the accumulation of debt, not only by ſhunning occaſions of expence, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, not ungenerouſly throwing upon poſterity the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then which we ourſelves ought to bear. The execution of theſe maxims belongs to your repreſentatives, but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that public opinion ſhould co-operate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is eſſential that you ſhould practically bear in mind that towards the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of debts there muſt be revenue—that to have reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue there muſt be taxes—and none can be deviſed which are not more or leſs inconvenient and unpleaſant—that the intrinſic embarraſſment inſeperable from the ſelection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties)— ought to be a deciſive motive for a candid conſtruction of the conduct of the government in making it, and for a ſpirit of acquieſcence in the meaſures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</p>

It will be worthy of a free, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and (at no diſtant period) a great nation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted juſtice and benevolence. Who can doubt that in the courſe of time and things, the fruits of ſuch a plan would richly repay any temporary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which might be loſt by a ſteady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent felicity of a nation with Virtue? The experiment, at leaſt, is recommended by every ſentiment which enobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impoſſible by its vices?</p>
            <p>IN the execution of ſuch a plan, nothing is more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies againſt particular nations, and paſſionate attachments for others ſhould be excluded; and that in the place of them, juſt and amicable feelings towards all ſhould be cultivated.—The nation, which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondneſs, is in ſome degree a ſlave. It is a ſlave to its animoſity or to its affection, either of which is ſufficient to lead it aſtray from its duty and its intereſt. Antipathy in one nation againſt another diſpoſes each more readily to offer inſult and injury, to lay hold of ſlight cauſes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental or trifling occaſions of diſpute occur.</p>
            <p>HENCE frequent colliſions, obſtinate, envenomed and bloody conteſts. The nation, prompted by ill will and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, ſometimes impels to war the government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the beſt calculations of policy. The government ſometimes participates in the national propenſity, and adopts

through paſſion what reaſon would reject; at other times, it makes the animoſity of the nation ſubſervient to projects of hoſtility inſtigated by pride, ambition and other ſiniſter and pernicious motives. The peace often, ſometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe, a paſſionate attachment of one nation for another induces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite nations facilitating the illuſion of an imaginary common intereſt, in caſes where no common intereſt exiſts, and infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or juſtification. It leads alſo conceſſions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the conceſſions; by unneceſſarily parting with what ought to have been retained; and by exciting jealouſy, ill-will, a diſpoſition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges are witheld:—And it gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote themſelves to the favorite nation) facility to betray, or ſacrifice the intereſts of their own country, without odium, ſometimes even with popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity; gilding with the appearances of a virtuous ſenſe of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WHY forego the advantages of ſo peculiar a ſituation? Why quit our own to ſtand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our deſtiny with that of any part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, entangle our peace and proſperity in the toils of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean ambition, rivalſhip, intereſt, humour or caprice?</p>

of my own conſcience is, that I have at leaſt believed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be guided by them.</p>
            <p>IN relation to the ſtill ſubſiſting war in Europe, my Proclamation of the 22d April, 1795, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your repreſentatives in both Houſes of Congreſs, the ſpirit of that meaſure has continually governed me, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.</p>
            <p>AFTER deliberate examination, with the aid of the beſt lights I could obtain, I was well ſatisfied that our country, under all the circumſtances of the caſe, had a right to take and was bound in duty and intereſt to take a neutral po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Having taken it, I determined, as far as ſhould depend on me, to maintain it with moderation.</p>
            <p>THE conſiderations which reſpect the right to hold this conduct, it is not neceſſary on this occaſion to detail. I will only obſerve, that according to my underſtanding o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the matter, that right, ſo far from being denied by any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Belligerent Powers, has been virtually admitted by all.</p>
            <p>THE duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred without any thing more, from the obligation which juſtice and humanity impoſe on every nation, in caſes in which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</p>
            <p>THE inducements of intereſt for obſerving that conduct will beſt be referred to your own reflections and experience With me, a predominant motive has been to endeavour to gain time to our country to ſettle and mature its yet recen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I am unconſcious of intentional error: I am neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs too ſenſible of my defects not to think it probable that I have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beſeech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I ſhall alſo carry with me the hope that my country will never ceaſe to view them with indulgence; and that after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its ſervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be conſigned to oblivion, as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt ſoon be to the manſions of reſt.</p>
            <p>RELYING on its kindneſs in this as in other things, and actuated by that fervent love towards it, which is ſo natural to a man who views in it the native ſoil of himſelf and his progenitors for ſeveral generations; I anticipate with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing expectation that retreat, in which I promiſe myſelf to realize, without alloy, the ſweet enjoyment of partaking in the midſt of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
