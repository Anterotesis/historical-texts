            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN the Year 1651, <hi>John Clarke, Obadiah Holmes</hi> and <hi>John Crandall,</hi> called Anabaptiſts, were proceeded againſt in <hi>Boſton</hi> Colony for their Faith and Practice in Religion, by Impriſoning, Fining, and Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; <hi>Obadiah Holmes</hi> was Whipt Thirty Laſhes, ſeveral of his Friends being preſent, among the reſt <hi>John Spur</hi> and <hi>John Hazel,</hi> who as they were attending the Priſoner back to the Priſon) took him by the hand in the Market-Place, and praiſed GOD for his Courage and Conſtancy, for which they were fined each of them <hi>Forty Shillings,</hi> or to be Whipt; they refuſed to pay the Money, but ſome of their Friends doing it for them they were diſmiſſed. Which may be ſeen in <hi>Daniel Neals</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>New-England,</hi> Vol. I. Pag. 279, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The People call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> came to <hi>Boſton</hi> about five Years after, and were alſo proceeded againſt, by Impriſoning, Fining and Whipping, but in a more barbarous and cruel Manner: But theſe Puniſhments proving inſufficient to keep them out of their Government: They proceeded to make many Laws, annexing many and grievous Puniſhments, 'till it came to cutting off Ears and Baniſhment upon pain of Death, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Death: As it is partly Recorded in <hi>Daniel Neals</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>New-England,</hi> Vol. I. but more fully in <hi>George Biſhop</hi>'s Hiſtory of <hi>New-England</hi> Judged.</p>
            <p>The Law of Baniſhment on pain of Death, was in theſe Words, (<hi>D. Neals Hiſt</hi> Pag. 306.)

without Warrant, where no Magiſtrate is at Hand, by any Conſtable, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, or Select-man, and conveyed from Conſtable to Conſtable until they come before the next Magiſtrate, who ſhall commit the ſaid Perſon or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to cloſe Priſon, there to remain without Bail until the next Court of Aſſiſtants where they ſhall have a legal Tryal by a ſpecial Jury; and being Convicted to be of the Sect of Quakers, ſhall be Baniſhed upon pain of Death; and that every Inhabitant of this Juriſdiction being Convicted to be of the aforeſaid Sect either by taking up, publiſhing, or defending the horrid Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Quakers,—or by taking up their abſurd and deſtructive Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, viz denying civil Reſpects to Equals, and Reverence to Superiours, and withdrawing from our Church Aſſemblies, and inſtead thereof frequent private Meetings of their own, or by adhering to, or approving of any known Quaker,—or condemning the Practice of proceeding of this Court againſt the Quakers—Every ſuch Perſon upon Examination and legal Conviction before the Court of Aſſiſtants, ſhall be committed to cloſe Priſon for one Month, and then, unleſs they chooſe voluntarily to depart this Juriſdiction, ſhall give Bond for their good Behaviour, and appear at the next Court of Aſſiſtants, where continuing Obſtinate, and refuſing to retract and reform the ſaid Opinions and Practices, ſhall be Sentenced to Baniſhment upon pain of Death: And in Caſe of the aforeſaid voluntary Departure, not to remain nor again to return into this Juriſdiction without the allowance of the Counſel firſt had &amp; publiſhed, on penalty of being Baniſhed on pain of Death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Four Quakers ſuffered Death by this Law as followeth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Robinſon, Marmaduke Stephenſon</hi> and <hi>Mary Dyar,</hi> coming from <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> 1659, were apprehended and Bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed on pain of Death.</p>
            <p>When they were Sentenced to Baniſhment, a Handkerchief was put into <hi>William Robinſon</hi>'s Mouth, to keep them from ſpeaking for themſelves; and when he yet attempted to ſpeak the Court in a great Rage cauſed him to be carried down, and Twenty cruel Stripes to be given him with a threefold corded Whip with Knots on his naked Back. They were allowed till the fourth of <hi>September</hi> to depart the Juriſdiction, the two Men went into <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> and the Woman to <hi>Rhode Iſland.</hi> But coming again to <hi>Boſton,</hi> they were all Three apprehended about the middle of <hi>October,</hi> and were demanded why they came again into the Juriſdiction being Baniſhed on pain of Death? To which they anſwered ſeverally, and declared, the ground or cauſe of their coming was of the LORD, and in obedience to Him; the Governor ſaid, he deſired not their Death, and that they had Liberty to ſpeak for themſelves, why they ſhould not be proceeded with as to the giving Sentence againſt

them; yet he bid the Jaylor, take them away; but the next Day, after their Worſhip was done being heated by their Prieſt, they brought them before the Court again and the Governour ſpeaking faintly, as a Man whoſe Life was departing, ſaid to this effect, "We have made many Laws, and endeavoured by ſeveral Ways to keep ye from us, and neither Whipping, nor Impriſoning; nor cutting off Ears, nor Baniſhment upon pain of Death, will keep ye from among us" and further ſaid, "I deſire not your Death," yet preſently he ſaid, "Give ear, and hearken to your Sentence ot Death," and then made a ſtop, whereupon <hi>William Robinſon</hi> deſired that he might be ſuffered to read a Paper amongſt them, Which was a declaration of his call to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and the Reaſon why they ſtayed in the Juriſdiction after Sentence of Baniſhment, which the Governor denyed, and ſaid in a great <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and giving no Anſwer, the Governor pronounced the Sentence of Death againſt him, ſaying. <hi>You ſhall be had to the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Gallows, and there be hanged till you are dead:</hi> Which being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>Marmaduke Stephenſon</hi> ſaid, Give ear, ye Magiſtrates, and all who are guilty, for this the LORD hath ſaid concerning you, who will perform his Word upon you, That the ſame Day ye put his Servants to Death, ſhall the Day of your Viſitation paſs over your Heads, and you ſhall be curſed forevermore: The Mouth of the LORD of Hoſts hath ſpoken it, therefore in Love to you all, I exhort you to take Warning, before it be too late, that ſo the Curſe may be removed, for aſſuredly, if you put us to Death, you'll bring innocent Blood upon your own Heads, and ſwift Deſtruction will come upon you.—After he had ſpoken this he was had to Priſon.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Mary Dyar</hi> was called, and the Governor ſaid to her to this Effect,—<hi>Mary Dyar, You ſhall go to the Place from whence
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008085_0004_102E26424C24B038"/>
you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, and be hanged there until you are dead.</hi>—To which ſhe replied, the Will of the LORD be done: The Governor ſaid, <hi>Take her away Marſhal:</hi> She anſwered, Yea, Joyfully ſhall I go.—They were all kept in Priſon while the <hi>Twenty-ſeventh</hi> of the ſame Month; and after their Worſhip was done, their Drums were beat, and theſe Three were taken out of Priſon, who parted from their Friends in Priſon full of the Joy of the LORD, who had counted them worthy to ſuffer for his Name; and having embraced each other in fervency of Love, and gladneſs of Heart, and peace with GOD, like innocent Lambs:—The Captain with his band of Men lead them to the Place of Execution, and cauſed the Drums to beat when they attempted to ſpeak, and placed them near the Drums for that purpoſe, that when they ſpake the People might not hear them, who in great Multitudes flocked about them; his Drums he would not ceaſe Beating, though he was deſired while they were ſpeaking, which (<hi>George Biſhop</hi> ſaith) <hi>was a barbarous Inhumanity never heard of before in the Engliſh Nation;</hi>—<hi>William Robinſon</hi> went chearfully up the Ladder to the very top above the Gallows, and ſpake to the People, that they ſuffered not as evil doers, but as thoſe who teſtified and manifeſted the Truth, and this was the Day of their Viſitation, and therefore deſired them to mind the Light that was in them, the Light of CHRIST of which he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and was now going to ſeal it with his Blood.—The Executioner put <hi>William Robinſon</hi> to Death, and after him <hi>Marma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke Stephenſon,</hi> who died both of them full of the joy of the LORD, and ſteadfaſt in Him. The Officers were ſo Barbarous that when their dead Bodies were cut down they fell to the Ground, with which the Skull of <hi>W. Robinſon</hi> was broke, his Body being ſtiff'ere it was cut down, their Shirts were ripped off with a Knife, and their naked Bodies caſt into a Hole of the Earth, which was digged without any covering; and when ſome Friends came, and deſired their Bodies to be put in Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins, the Executioner ſuffered them to wrap them in Linnen, and to put them into the Hole again, but to take them away he ſuffered them not, ſaying, <hi>he was ſtrictly charged to the contrary.</hi>

To which heavenly Voice I preſently yielded Obedience, not queſtioning the Lord how he would bring the Thing to paſs, being I was a Child, and Obedience was demanded of me by the Lord, who filled me with living Strength and Power from his heavenly Preſence, which at that Time did mightily overſhadow me, and my Life at that Time did ſay, Amen, to what the Lord required of me, and had commanded me to do, and willingly was I given up from that Time, to this Day, the Will of the Lord to do and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, whatever became of my Body: For, the Lord had ſaid unto me. <hi>My Soul ſhall reſt in everlaſting Peace, and my Life ſhall enter into Reſt, for being obedient to the God of my Life.</hi> I being a Child, and durſt not queſtion the Lord in the leaſt, but rather willing to lay down my Life, than to bring Diſhonor to the Lord: And as the Lord made me willing, dealing gently and kindly with me, as a tender Father by a faithful Child whom he dearly loves, ſo the Lord did deal with me in miniſtring his Life unto me, which gave and gives me Strength to perform what the Lord requires of me; and ſtill as I did and do ſtand in Need, he miniſtred and miniſtreth more Strength, and Virtue, and heavenly Power and Wiſdom, whereby I was and am made ſtrong in God, not fearing what Man ſhall be ſuffered to do unto me: Being filled with heavenly Courage, which is Meekneſs and Innocency, for the Cauſe is the Lord's that we go in, and the Battle

                  <p>IN the Beginning of the Year 1655, I was at the Plough in the Eaſt Parts of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> in <hi>Old-England,</hi> near the Place where
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008085_0009_102E264B41120C40"/>
my out-ward Being was, and as I walked after the Plough, I was filled with the Love and Preſence of the living God, which did raviſh my Heart when I felt is: for it did increaſe and abound in me like a living Stream, ſo did the love and life of God run thorough me like precious Ointment, giving a pleaſant Smell, which made me to ſtand ſtill; and as I ſtood a little ſtill with my Heart and Mind ſtayed on the Lord, the Word of the Lord came to me in a ſtill ſmall Voice, which I did hear perfectly, ſaying to me, in the ſecret of my Heart and Conſcience,—<hi>I have Ordained thee a Prophet unto the Nations.</hi>—And at the beginning of the Word of the Lord, I was put to a ſtand, being that I was but a Child for ſuch a weighty Matter. So at the Time appointed, <hi>Barbados</hi> was ſet before me, until which I was required of the Lord to go, and leave my dear and loving Wife, and tender Children: For the Lord ſaid unto me immediately by his Spirit, That he would be as a Huſband to my Wife, and as a Father to my Children, and they ſhould not want in my Abſence, for he would provide for them when I was gone And I believed that the Lord would perform what he had ſpoken, becauſe I was made willing to give up my ſelf to his Work and Service, to leave all, and follow him, whoſe Preſence and Life is with me, where I reſt in Peace and Quietneſs of Spirit (with my dear Brother) under the ſhadow of his Wings, who hath made us willing to lay down our Lives for his own Name ſake, if unmerciful Man be ſuffered to take them from us; and if they do, we know we ſhall have Peace and reſt with the Lord for ever in his holy Habitation, when they ſhall have Torment Night and Day. So, in Obedience to the living God, I made preparation to paſs to <hi>Barbados</hi> in the 4th Month. 1658. So, after ſome time, I had been on the ſaid Iſland in the ſervice of God, I heard that <hi>New-England</hi> had made a Law to put the Servants of the living God to Death, if they returned after they were ſentenced away, which did come near me at that Time; and as I conſidered the Thing, and pondered it in my Heart immediately came the Word of the Lord unto me, ſaying, <hi>Thou knoweſt not but that thou mayeſt go thither</hi>—But I kept this Word in my Heart and did not declare it to any, until the Time appointed. So, after that, a Veſſel was made ready for <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> which I paſſed in. So, after a little Time that I had been there, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Seed which the Lord hath bleſſed, the Word of the Lord came unto me ſaying. <hi>Go to Boſton with thy Brother William Robinſon.</hi>—And at his Command I was obedient, and gave up myſelf

            <p>At the laſt. General Court he had Liberty given him to go for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, or to go out of that Juriſdiction; and promiſing ſo to do and come there no more, he might ſave his Life.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Leddra</hi> was ſentenced to Death, and returned to Priſon in order to Execution; and on the 14th of the ſame Month, after their Lecture was ended, the Governor came, and a Guard of Soldiers to the Priſon; and <hi>William</hi> having taken his Farewel of <hi>Wenlock Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> his Fellow Priſoner, and the reſt of his Friends then in Bonds for the ſame Teſtimony, went forth to the Slaughter, willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned up to the Will of the Lord, whom the Guard encompaſſed round, to prevent his Speech with Friends, or his ſpeaking with any; which <hi>Edward Wharton</hi> perceiving, and how the Guard ſtrove to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his ſpeaking with <hi>William,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Friends, what will you ſhew your ſelves worſe than bloody Bonner's Brood? What, will you not let me come near my Friend, before you kill him? Chl</hi> ſaid one, <hi>Edward, it will be your Turn next.</hi> The Captain ſaid, <hi>If you ſpeak a Word, I will ſtop your Mouth</hi> He was brought to the Gallows, and his Arms pinioned; where he took Leave of his Friend <hi>Edward Wharton</hi> as he was about to aſcend the Ladder, to whom he ſaid, <hi>All that will be Chriſt's Diſciples, muſt take up the Croſs.</hi> And ſtanding where the Guard ordered him, with an exceeding freſh and lively Countenance, he ſpake to the People, and ſaid, <hi>For bearing my Teſtimony for the Lord, againſt Deceivers, and the deceived, am I brought here to ſuffer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was preſent one Thomas Wilkie, a Stranger, having heard in the Town, that William might go away if he would, and being moved with pity, believing he was Innocent; he cried aloud, begging that his Life might be ſpared, and alſo called, to William, to come down from the Gallows, ſaying, <hi>You may go away if you will;</hi> but the Captain ſaid, <hi>It is no ſuch Matter;</hi> and William looked upon him, and ſaid, <hi>Friend, know that this Day I am willing to offer up my Life, for the witneſs of Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As they were putting the Halter about his Neck, he ſaid, <hi>I commit my righteous Cauſe unto thee, O God.</hi> And as the Ladder was turning off, he cried, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>William Leddra being dead, his Body was cut down and E. Wharton,

and three Friends more, catched it in their Arms, and laid it on the Ground, until the Executioner had ſtripped it of the Cloaths, and they were ſuffered to lay it in a Coffin, and bury it where they thought mere, which it is like the Out-cry of the Country led unto, becauſe of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner's drawing the Bodies of William Robinſon, and Marmaduke Stevenſon, very barbarouſly by the Legs, into the Hole that was digged for them, after their Shirts were ripped off.</p>

Thou art come in amongſt us,</hi> ſaid one, <hi>in Rebellion, which is as the Sin of Witchcraft, and ought to be puniſhed</hi> — <hi>I came not in Rebellion,</hi> ſaid Wenlock, <hi>but in Obedience to the God of Heaven, not in Contempt to any of you, but in Love to your Souls and Bodies, and that you ſhall know one Day, when you and all Men, ſhall give Account of the deeds done in the Body. Take heed,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for you cannot eſcape the righteous Judgments of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſaid their Major-General Adderton, <hi>You pronounce Woes and Judgments, and thoſe that are gone before you pronounced Woes and Judgments, but the Judgments of the Lord God are not come upon us yet. — Be not proud,</hi> replied Wenlock, <hi>neither let your Spirits be lifted up. God doth but wait till the Meaſure of your Iniquity be filled up and that you have run your ungodly Race, then will the Wrath of God come upon you to the uttermoſt: — And as for thy Part, it hangs over thy Head, and is near to be poured down upon then, and ſhall come as a Thief in the Night, ſuddenly, when thou thinkeſt not of it.</hi>

            <p>She crying, <hi>Repentance,</hi> through Part of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> was by two Magiſtrates committed, whoſe Jailor thruſt her into a noiſome, ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dungeon, where there was nothing to lye on, or ſit on, and kept her there two Days and two Nights, without helping her to Bread or Water; and becauſe <hi>Benanuel Bower,</hi> a tender hearted Friend, brought her a little Milk in this her great Diſtreſs, (wherein ſhe had like to have periſhed) they caſt him into Priſon, for entertaining a Stranger, and fined him Five Pounds.
