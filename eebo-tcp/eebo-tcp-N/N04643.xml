            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Goſpel is CHRIST'S Goſpel, and ſhould be preached with CHRIST'S Spirit. It was ſo by his firſt Miniſters of it. The ſame Spirit which deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him came alſo upon the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when they were all with one Accord in one Place, on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> The like gracious Vouchſafement (tho' not in the extraordinary Manner and Effects thereof) is to be deſired by us, the Lord's Miniſters, who are met together in this Place, on the Day of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, brotherly <hi>Convention.</hi> And to prepare our Mind for it, a Diſcourſe on this Text may be ſeaſonable and uſeful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:005779_0005_10270CE5A24E64F8"/>This Record, which <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> Chriſt's Fore-runner, bare concerning him, refers to his ſolemn Inauguration into his mediatorial Office, at his Baptiſm. <hi>Heaven was</hi> then <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcended from</hi> thence, and lighted upon him. The viſible Appearance, in which the Spirit came, abode ſome Time upon him; the Spirit itſelf remain'd with him, was conſtantly reſident in him. This was not indeed the firſt of the Spirit's Coming upon our Saviour; but it was the firſt which <hi>John</hi> ſaw, and to which he gave Teſtimony. The Spirit of God formed Chriſt's humane Nature, with all it's congenite Principles of Grace and Holineſs, free from the leaſt Stain or moral Imperfection. And from his Birth the Spirit was with him, making him gradually, as Man, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Wiſdom, as he did in Stature. But when he was entring upon his public Miniſtry, the Spirit came upon him in a greater Abundance of Gifts, and Graces, and Influences, thoroughly furniſhing of him to his Work. Then was he eminently anointed with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt and with Power,</hi> ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him to the Diſcharge of his Office. And particularly as a <hi>Prophet;</hi> which he began with a Sermon on that Paſſage in Iſai. 61.1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good Tidings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This Day,</hi> ſaid he, (when he and read the Text) <hi>is this Scripture fulfilled in your Ears</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke 4.18.</note>. In him dwelt the Fulneſs of the Godhead bodily; and he was not, conſider'd in his divine Nature, of himſelf inſufficient for his Undertaking; there was no Defect of Power in him as a divine Perſon, the mighty God, to be ſupply'd by the Spirit's deſcending, and abiding upon him. The humane Nature of Chriſt was ſtrengthened with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power to his Work; and all the Aſſiſtance it had, was by Virtue of it's Union with, and derived from, his divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But ſtill the Holy Spirit is that Perſon in the Godhead, by which the Energy of the divine Nature, in its Operations on, and by, Chriſt's humane Nature was moſt immediately exerted. In the Power of the Spirit did he preach, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his Doctrine, and finiſh the Work, which his Father gave him to do on the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> ſaw the Spirit deſcending from Heaven, <hi>like a D<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſay the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> in the Account which they give of it. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt deſcended in a bodily Shape, like a Dove, upon him.</hi> Whether the Expreſſion imports,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005779_0006_10270CE8FB6C43D8"/>
that the corporeal Form which the Spirit aſſum'd and appear'd in, was the very Shape of a <hi>Dove,</hi> or only that the Manner of the Spirit's deſcending, was like a <hi>Dove</hi>'s coming down, with its Wings ſpread abroad, and ſo hovering over and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a Thing; may not be eaſy for us to determine, and it is not neceſſary for us to know. Yet, in which of theſe Senſes ſoever we underſtand it, it ſheweth that there was ſomething in the Spirit's viſible Deſcent upon Chriſt, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a <hi>Dove,</hi> which made the Eye-Witneſs and inſpired Writers make ſo particular mention of a Dove in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of it. And 'tis not unreaſonable to ſuppoſe a Myſtery in the Spirit's deſcending in a <hi>Dove-like Shape,</hi> or in a <hi>Dove-like Manner:</hi> Eſpecially ſince a <hi>Dove</hi> was reckon'd an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of the Holy Ghoſt by the ancient Jews. That it was ſo ordered by God, that there ſhould (as the Baptiſt and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts teſtify) be ſome Reſemblance of a Dove in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's deſcending and reſting on Chriſt, to ſignify <hi>what Spirit he was of,</hi> and ſhould exerciſe, in the Diſcharge of his Office, to which he was in that Manner deſigned and prepared; <hi>viz.</hi> a Dove-like Spirit. Such was the Spirit that deſcended and abode upon him, and ſuch was his humane Spirit, having the Characters of the divine Spirit impreſs'd upon it, when he was <hi>ſealed with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> at his Baptiſm; and ſo was ſolemnly inveſted into his Office, and perfectly accompliſhed for the Performance of it.</p>
            <p>The Obſervation, proper to be the Subject of the preſent Diſcourſe, from the Text, is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That a Dove-like Spirit is a requiſite and eminent Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Goſpel Miniſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It being the Spirit of the Lord, by whom the great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the firſt began to be ſpoken; it ſhould, in a good Meaſure, be found in every One, that after him, and in his Name, preacheth the Goſpel of Chriſt. As will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by conſidering the Properties of a Dove-like Spirit.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Dove-like, is a <hi>pure</hi> Spirit. The Dove was of the Number of clean Birds, in the ceremonial Diſtinction of 'em, and the only one that was uſed in Sacrifice to God. <hi>My Dove, my Undefiled,</hi> ſays the ſpiritual Bridegoom to his Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. A Dove is therefore a fit and ſcriptural Emblem of Purity, which was perfect in the holy and undefiled Jeſus,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005779_0007_10270CEBB2810420"/>
upon whom the Spirit deſcended like a Dove, qualifying him for, and actuating him in, his holy Miniſtration. A Dove like pure Spirit, is called in Scripture, <hi>a pure Mind, a pure Heart, a pure Conſcience.</hi> If any Diſtinction be conceived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe, yet each of 'em comprehends the other, and a pure Spirit all. It is (as renewed in fallen Man) a Spirit cleanſed from the Defilements of Sin, conſecrated, and made holy to God, thro' Sanctification of his Spirit, and in which there is no Guile prevailing: A good and honeſt Heart, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with Simplicity and godly Sincerity. Such ought the Spirit of a Goſpel Miniſter, conformable to his divine Maſter's, to be.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Relation</hi> to God ſuppoſes and requires it: Being aſſum'd into a near and conſtant Attendance upon him, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Evil. This is that the Lord ſpake with Reſpect to the Prieſt's eſpecially, his Miniſters under the Law, (and the Reaſon of it is the ſame, and ſtronger, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to thoſe under the Goſpel) <hi>I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Levit. 10.3.</note>; will be approached and ſerved as a holy God. There is no Man, no Miniſter, that hath a juſt and lively Apprehenſion of the infinite Purity of that God, with whom he hath to do, and before whom the <hi>Seraphim</hi> cover their Faces, and their Feet, crying one to another, <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> but will be ready to ſay as the <hi>Prophet</hi> did, upon the viſional Repreſentation thereof to him, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a Man of unclean Lips</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſai. 6.</note>, and 'till his Iniquity is taken away and Sin purged, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s was, wou'd dare to anſwer, as he did, when one was called for to go on a divine Embaſſy, <hi>Here am I, ſend me.</hi> Anſwerable to the relative Holineſs of a Miniſter, in his ſpecial Dedication to the Lord, there ought to be real Holineſs of Heart and Life, in a ſincere and intire Devotedneſs unto him.</p>
            <p>As he repreſents God by Office, he ſhould be like him in Diſpoſition: And being peculiarly God's Servant, be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by his Sanctity. Otherwiſe he diſparageth the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of that Majeſty, in whoſe Preſence he ſtands, and in whole Name he miniſters. If he ſerve God with any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcence, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o divine Acceptation, he muſt do it with a pure Conſcience.</p>

            <p>But ſuch a Spirit, not only <hi>correſponds</hi> with the Sacredneſs of this Work, but <hi>qualifies</hi> for the Performance of it. The Work indeed may poſſibly be done by a Man whoſe Heart is not right with God in it. And one of this Character may be an Inſtrument, in the Hand of God's free Spirit, of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and ſaving others. Yet, much every Way is the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a pure Spirit, toward the diſcharging this Office well, and to good Effect. 2 Tim. 2.21. <hi>If a Man purge himſelf from theſe</hi> (gnoſtick Pollutions, Luſts of the Fleſh, and of the Mind) <hi>he ſhall be a Veſſel unto Honour, ſanctified and made meet for the Maſter's Uſe, and prepared unto every good Work.</hi> He muſt be ſanctified, that he may be duly fitted for this Service of Chriſt; and prepar'd, in Reſpect of Ability and Inclination, to every Part of his Duty therein.—<hi>Be apt to teach:</hi> Furniſh'd with Knowledge, and <hi>ſhewing in Doctrine Uncorruptneſs, Gravity, Sincerity, ſound Speech that cannot be condemned.</hi> A pure Spirit ſearches impartially after Truth, and is beſt capable of diſcovering it: Being free from thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Affections, &amp; vicious Habits, ill Prejudices &amp; baſe Deſigns, which cloud and darken the Underſtanding, bribe and pervert the Judgment. What Clearneſs is to the Eye of the Body, That Purity is to the Eye of the Mind. A pure Heart receives the Love of the Truth: And the Myſtery of Faith is held in a pure Conſcience. Purity does not intitle any Man to Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, yet it does to the Promiſe of ſure Guidance into all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Truth. John 7.17. <hi>If any Man will do his Will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine.</hi> Such a Man is liable to err from the Truth, but ſhall not fundamentally and finally. He is moſt ſecure from all damnable Hereſies, and moſt likely to recover out of any conſiderable Miſtakes he may fall into. Faith and a good Conſcience are faſteſt held together: They who have put away the latter, <hi>concerning Faith have made Shipwreck</hi>

A Man of this Spirit, is conſiſtent with himſelf, is the ſame, as to his Faith and Practice of what is neceſſary and ſubſtantial Truth and Duty, in all Countries, in all Caſes, and in all Conditions—"The moral Reaſon of Things being every where, and always, the ſame".

His Preaching, like the great Subject of it, Chriſt Jeſus, is the ſame; not <hi>Yea</hi> at one Time, and <hi>Nay</hi> at another. 2 Cor. 1.18, 19. <hi>But as God is true, our Word toward you was not Yea and Nay. For the Son of God, Jeſus Chriſt, who was preached among you by us,—was not Yea and Nay, but in him was Yea.</hi> The Influence of ſuch a Spirit was ſuſpended in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when they withdrew from the <hi>Gentile</hi>-Converts, meerly to pleaſe ſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, they <hi>diſſembled, walked not uprightly, according to the Truth of the Goſpel,</hi> Gal. 2.11.

            <p n="2">2. A Dove-like, is a <hi>harmleſs</hi> Spirit. The Dove, an antient Emblem of Peace, is propounded by our Saviour as a Pattern of Innocence; <hi>be harmleſs as Doves</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. 10.16.</note>, ſaid he to his Diſciples, when he ſent them to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> A Dove like, harmleſs Spirit, is the Spirit of Love; which worketh no Ill to his Neighbour: A Spirit free from Malignity, and miſchievous Deſign: A Diſpoſition by which a Man is averſe from, and avoids doing wrong; to any. Tho' Purity and Innocence ſeem to imply each other, or to be the ſame Thing, yet in the Degree wherein they are found in imperfect Men, they are ſeperable Qualities, or, at leaſt, may have a diſtinct Conſideration with us. So far indeed as a Man is poſſeſs'd of the former, he is of the latter alſo; yet ſomething further is required to his having the latter than the former. His Spirit may he predominated pure, and yet not inculpably harmleſs. Its Purity is inoffenſive, yet may be accompanied with ſomething that is noxious. There may be true Sanctity, and godly Sincerity, where there is not a competent Meaſure of Prudence, to keep from offending. It is not enough, that the Spirit be free from damning Pollution, and reigning Hypocriſy, but alſo from whatever is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, tho' it be not in its own Nature, hurtful. Conſcience ſhould be void of Offence toward God, and toward Man. Purity might ſuffice to its being ſo toward God, if it were under no Obligation to be ſo likewiſe toward Men; who are apt to be offended at more than what is in it ſelf Evil, which, were it not for their Sakes, God would not be. A pure Spirit thinks on whatſoever Things are true, honeſt, juſt, pure; a harmleſs Spirit further, on whatſoever Things are <hi>lovely,</hi> amiable in the Sight of Men, and <hi>of good Report</hi> among them. This Ingredient therefore of a Dove-like Spirit, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther qualifies a Goſpel Miniſter; who, in the Diſcharge of his Office, need be more inoffenſive, than Purity (alone and imperfect) renders him. He ought to ſhun the <hi>Appearance of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005779_0013_10270CFDB34C00F8"/>
Evil,</hi> what ſeems and proves ſo to others, as well as that which is in it ſelf Evil.</p>
            <p>As this was a diſtinct Branch of our Lord's Character, ſo it may be conſider'd of a good Miniſter's of Chriſt, additional to that of Purity. Such an high Prieſt became us who is <hi>holy, harmleſs.</hi> It behoves every one that officiates in ſacred Things, to be ſo likewiſe; that he, after the Example of the innocent Jeſus, do <hi>no Violence,</hi> and give no <hi>Offence,</hi> in Caſes wherein we may with a pure Conſcience avoid it. Indeed, accidentally and eventually, thro' the Perverſeneſs of Men, Chriſt, who denounced Wo to that Man by whom Offence cometh, was a Stone of Stumbling and Rock of Offence. Yet he never gave any juſt Occaſion of the leaſt—for the Prevention thereof, we find him complying with received Cuſtoms, and paying of Tribute, not due from him. It may be impoſſible, but that Offences will come, upon a Miniſter's Fidelity in his Office: What is required of him is, to ſee to it, that they do not ariſe thro' his Default.—That he guard his Words and Actions with ſuch Care, guide his Affairs with ſuch Diſcretion, as that he may yield no Occaſion, yea, may cut off all Occaſion, of Diſguſt or Scandal—of any Man's falling into Sin, becoming diſaffected to Religion, or diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in the Practice of his Duty—<hi>Giving no Offence in any Thing, that the Miniſtry be not blamed,</hi> and Souls hurt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>A harmleſs Spirit makes a Miniſter to comport with the Weakneſſes of People, to forego his own Profit and Eaſe, to part with his juſt Liberty, Pleaſure and Satisfaction, rather than any Damage ſhou'd accrue unto them. It diſpoſes him to pleaſe them in all Things, wherein he may without diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, and for their ſpiritual Advantage, 1 Cor. 10.32, 33. <hi>Give none Offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God. Even as I pleaſe all Men in all Things, not ſeeking mine own Profit, but the Profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A harmleſs Spirit in a Preacher, that is wiſe, and would teach the People Knowledge, gives good Heed, and ſeeks to find out <hi>acceptable Words,</hi> as well as <hi>Words of Truth;</hi> Words that may not ſcandalize any againſt the Truth which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. A Miniſter may offend in Word, when he does not err in Doctrine: May occaſion many to ſtumble at the Law, by the uncooth Phraſes in which he expreſſes it. A great Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance

this is to the ready Reception of divine Truths, and much Hurt hath been done to Religion, by the unguarded or affected Language of hearty Friends to it.</p>
            <p>Tho' a harmleſs Spirit will not ſuffer a Miniſter to keep back any Thing, which is for the Profit of his Hearers; or ſhun to declare the whole Council of God, left they ſhould pervert it to their Damage; yet it may reſtrain him from ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Things, when they <hi>cannot bear them as yet;</hi> and the unſeaſonable inſiſting on 'em, wou'd be likely to hinder the Entertainment of more neceſſary Truths, and the Practice of greater Duties.</p>
            <p>Tho' it will not make him indifferent as to the Prevalence or Suppreſſion of any Errors and Diſorders, and neutral in all Controverſies that ariſe, yet will it make him, in oppoſing that which is bad, careful that he deſtroy not that which is good: And to bear with ſome Things amiſs, that are tolerable, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than occaſion others, that are more hurtful;—to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the ſilent Enjoyment of his own Thoughts about ſome Things, which are not of great Moment: And cautious of ſtirring up, or meddling with, any Strife, in which all that is contended for, is not worth the Time and Pains employ'd upon it: And all the Advantages gain'd by a Victory, will not countervail the Damages ſuſtain'd in the Combat.</p>
            <p>Tho' ſuch a Spirit <hi>cannot hear with them that are Evil</hi>—ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly ſo, yet is it not haſty to gather up the <hi>Tares,</hi> leſt it ſhould root up alſo the <hi>Wheat</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>This harmleſs Spirit, is not (according to the vulgar Idea of it) a weak Mind, an inſignificant Soul, an inept, inefficacious Temper; by which a Man is not capable of doing either Good or Hurt; but is rather a <hi>Wiſe Man's Heart, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth both Time and Judgment</hi>—a vigilant Spirit, a heedful Diſpoſition, by which a Man guards againſt whatever may Prejudice the Succeſs of the Goſpel, and Salvation of Souls. This Innocency dwells with Prudence—and Miniſters need be <hi>wiſe as Serpents,</hi> that they may be <hi>harmleſs as Doves.</hi>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:005779_0015_10270D04066A6908"/>Such was the Spirit of <hi>Jeſus</hi> moſt conſpicuouſly and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily, in his Management of the Work given him to do on the Earth. And ſuch ought the Spirit of every Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be, that he may diſcharge his Office well and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully. 2 Tim. 2.24. <hi>The Servant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle unto all Men, apt to teach.</hi> He muſt be gentle toward all Men, that he may he apt to teach. A meek Spirit is prediſpoſed to receive, and impart the Knowledge of divine Things. The <hi>Prophet</hi> was unfit for the Elapſes of God's Spirit, and to declare his Mind. 'till the ruffled Paſſions of his own were calm'd by a <hi>Minſtrel,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.15. The Spirit deſcends, in the ordinary Gifts of Prophecy, upon the Meek. Pſal. 25.9. <hi>The Meek will be teach his Way:</hi> And enable them to teach it. A gentle is the only effectual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Inſtruction to be uſed, not only toward the ſimply Ignorant, but alſo toward the perverſe Oppoſers of the Truth. <hi>In Meekneſs inſtructing theſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God per-adventure will give them Repentance is the acknowledging of the Truth.</hi> Which intimates, that gentle and meek Treatment, is the moſt likely Way to convert Men from Error to Truth, from Sin to Righteouſneſs. Soft Words are more efficacious to theſe good Purpoſes, than ſharp Invectives; calm Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, than contentious Wranglings.

            <p>He that winneth Souls is wiſe. Sinners are won to Chriſt, and their Duty, by the ſweet Invitations and Arguments of divine Grace; not driven with the boiſterous Wind of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Paſſion: Are drawn with the Cords of a Man, the Bands of Love: Are not meerly affrighted or forced, but charm'd into a Surrender to the Lord. And they to whom the Word of Reconciliation is committed, being Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as tho' God did beſeech Sinner by them, do <hi>pray them to be reconciled to God.</hi> Not but that there is always Occaſion for a Preacher to cry aloud, in ſhewing People their Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to rebuke them ſharply for their Awakening and Amendment. He ought to contend earneſtly for the Faith, and with ſome Warmth to plead for God's Honour. He is not to be mealy-mouth'd, and, as <hi>Ephraim, like a ſilly Dove without Heart,</hi> Hoſ. 7.11.

And it is well for the poor Church, that this Power is not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, ſince the infallible Direction of the holy Spirit is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn. Tho' a ſtrict Diſcipline is to be kept up in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church, yet the Nature and Deſign of it require this to be done in the Spirit of Meekneſs. A raſh and haſty Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, is as had as a cowardly, or careleſs, Relaxation of it. The <hi>Key</hi> ſeldom goes right in the Hand of a paſſionate, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Man. Diſcipline is an Edge-Tool, and mad Work is often made with it by angry Eccleſiaſticks. That Direction may be eſpecially intended for Governours of the Church, which the Apoſtle gives in Gal. 6.1. <hi>Brethren, if a Man be overtaken in a Fault, ye which are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch an one in the Spirit of Meekneſs</hi>—alluding to the Caution and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs uſed in the Reduction of diſlocated, and ſetting of broken Bones.</p>
            <p>A meek Spirit conducts a Miniſter to a ſuitable Behaviour under the ill Treatment he meets with, in the Diſcharge of his Office—helps to bear aright the cauſeleſs Hatred and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, Obloquy and Affronts, and all Kinds of Miſuſage, which he ſuffers from an ill-natur'd World, an ungrateful People, and peeviſh <hi>Brethren</hi>—Men of the ſame Profeſſion. It diſpoſes him to follow the Example of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who, <hi>when he was reviled, reviled not again: When he ſuffered, threatened not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly —endured the Contradiction of Sinners againſt himſelf.</hi>—And of his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> whoſe Demeanor under the greateſt Reproacnes and Injuries is thus ſet forth, 1 Cor. 4.11, 12, 13. <hi>Even unto this preſent Hour we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked, and buffeted, and have no certain Dwelling-Place; and Labour, working with our own Hands: Being reviled, we bleſs; being perſecuted, we ſuffer it; being defamed, we entreat: We are made the Filth of the World, and are the Off-ſcouring of all Things unto this Day.</hi> Continual and various Occaſion, hath a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter for the Exerciſe of Meekneſs: Eſpecially, when his People are froward, and will ſtrive with him; giddy, and forſake him; penurious, and with-hold Maintenance from him. Happy is it when none of theſe Things ſo diſturb, and diſcourage his Spirit, but that he goes on calmly and reſolutely in his Work; not being overcome of Evil, but overcoming Evil with Good.

            <p>Our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was a Man of Sorrows, of great Tenderneſs of Spirit, appearing in his mournful Reſentments of his own grievous Sufferings, breathing in all his Sermons, diſcover'd in all his compaſſionate Endeavours for the Relief and Salvation of a miſerable World of Sinners. Such a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ought a Miniſter of the Goſpel to have, mourning firſt for his own Sins, (which Chriſt had no need of) and then, after the Example of Chriſt, for the Sins and Sufferings of Others.—A Spirit apt to be affected and afflicted with the Miſeries of Mankind, eſpecially thoſe that are incident to their Souls.—A pitiful Diſpoſition toward them under the manifold and ſad Evils, which oppreſs them in this, and await them in a future World. This would engage his ſolicitous, faithful Endeavours to relieve and ſave them—to inſtruct the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; to warn the Wicked, Night and Day, with Tears; to ſeek the loſt, and bring back the ſtraying Sheep, to ſtrengthen the Diſeaſed, and bind up that which is broken; to ſpeak a Word in Seaſon to him that is Weary—to exhort and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and charge every One, as a Father doth his Children— to viſit and ſympathize with the Afflicted in all their Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, outward and ſpiritual, and offer up Prayers and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for them, with ſtrong Crying and Tears, according to their particular Neceſſities. The Miniſter that is endowed with ſuch a Spirit, can ſay as <hi>Paul</hi>

ſatisfied with any Degrees of Care and Watchfulneſs and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for their Salvation—counts not his Time and Strength, yea, Life itſelf too dear to be ſpent in ſuch charitable Service, how unworthily ſoever Men requite him therefor.

The Lord pardon us wherein we have been wanting in our Compaſſion to their Souls!

They are of all Men obliged moſt ſtrictly to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.

            <p>Miniſters are the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the Flock, and it is greater Conſequence, that there ſhould be no Strife between them, than it was of old, that there ſhould be none between <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's Herdſmen and Lot's.</hi> No wonder the Sheep are frighted and ſcatter'd from them, when they ſee them biting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring one another.

            <p>Unity betwixt the Miniſters of Chriſt, is of great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to convince Men of the Truth of their Doctrine, and to perſwade them to embrace it; as we may learn from Chriſt's Prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17.21. And the contrary, Experience ſheweth us, is a great Stumbling-block to People, and Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of their profiting by the Word. <hi>Behold, how good, and how pleaſant it is for</hi> ſuch <hi>Brethren to dwell together in Unity!</hi>

And we can't expect, that ordinarily Miniſters will come to our Churches in the <hi>excellent Spirit,</hi> which has been deſcrib'd, unleſs they do come out of the <hi>Schools of the Prophets,</hi> furniſhed with competent Knowledge, which they acquire by Induſtry in the Uſe of ſuitable Means, and receive not by meer Infuſion. The Scripture doth not repreſent thoſe as Goſpel-Times of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, in which Perſons that have been train'd up from their Youth only to ſecular Buſineſs, do undertake, and are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd in, that of the ſacred Miniſtry: But on the contrary, that when GOD ſhall cauſe the <hi>unclean Spirit</hi> to paſs out of the Land, and any ſuch ſhall yet preſume to Propheſy, his neareſt Relatives ſhall withſtand him, and he ſhall be aſham'd to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Habit, and further to attempt the Work of a Prophet; but ſhall confeſs, as in Zech. 13.5. <hi>I am no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,

I am an Huſbandman; for Men taught me to keep Cattle from my Youth.</hi> Whoever wou'd be an able Miniſter of the new Teſtament, muſt diligently improve all Advantages of a liberal Education to that Purpoſe. Yet if his Furniture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts only in the deſireable and uſeful Gifts of Knowledge, Elocution, and the like humane Acquirements and Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it may be ſaid to him, as in another Caſe it was to a well-bred young Man, <hi>One Thing thou lackeſt</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mark 10.21.</note>. And that is, a Dove-like, a Chriſt-like Spirit: A Soul form'd by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to Purity, Innocence, Meekneſs, Humility, and Love. The Graces which conſtitute this divine Temper, are ſo neceſſary to a Miniſter's approving himſelf to GOD, and to his own Conſcience, in his Work, that, if the Performance and Succeſs of it were leſs concern'd therein, than really they be, no conſiderate Perſon, who knew himſelf deſtitute of 'em, wou'd for all this World dare to meddle with ſo holy and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous an Office.</p>
               <p>What GOD ſaith to the Wicked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16. would, like a flaming Sword, keep the Way of the Pulpit from his entring thereinto? Verily, ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Danger and Calamity of the Church, to have unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unexperienc'd Paſtors: And to have ſo many become Preachers, before they are Chriſtians; to be ſanctified by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to the Altar as God's Prieſts, before they are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by hearty Dedication to Chriſt as his Diſciples."—Let every one deſign'd and preparing for the Miniſtry, remember the Exhortation, in 2 Tim. 2.22. <hi>Flee alſo youthful Luſts: But follow Righteouſneſs, Faith, Charity, Peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure Heart.</hi> Take heed alſo and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of an enthuſiaſtick, and of a Party-Spirit; the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of both which Kinds, are contrary and deſtructive to thoſe of the Spirit, which has been recommended.</p>

with Lowlineſs of Mind, Tenderneſs of Affection, and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of brotherly Love? There has been a Trial of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and have we diſcover'd ſo much of a Dove-like Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we ought? Was it not for want of ſuch a Spirit, in greater Meaſures of it, that there has been ſo much Offence given, and taken, to the Reproach and Damage of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry? That we have been ſo divided in our Work, and Way —ſo full of Jealouſies and raſh judging—ſo apt to divulge, and pleas'd to hear Things tending to one another's Diſgrace and Diſadvantage—that in a Difference of Sentiments, we did not guard more againſt the ill Conſequences thereof, and could not bear with one another in Love—that there have been ſo ſharp Conteſts between Fellow-Labourers, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Smitings of Fellow-Servants—ſuch intemperate Zeal, and ſatyrical Virulence, as hath brought much Smoke and Darkneſs into the Sanctuary? <hi>Only by Pride cometh Contention:</hi> To this is owing the Noiſe and Clamour of Controverſy, which hath greatly diſturbed the Peace of the Churches. To the ſame Cauſe muſt be imputed all undue Reſentment of Wrong done us by any, in cenſuring our State, diſparaging our Labours, and drawing away from among our People Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after them. It argues the Defect of a uniting Spirit among us, that when we were not all of one Mind in ſome Matters, we did not hold Communion and Correſpondency, and join together in the main, and do as much of God's Work as we could in concurrent Unanimity, according to the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Advice in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. But diſagreeing in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning ſome Appearances of Religion, and Methods of promoting it, we grew ſtrange to one another, left off aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating together as before, and ſhunn'd a Communication of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Labours: For the laſt of which our Excuſe is no Evidence of a peaceable Spirit among us—<hi>viz.</hi> Miniſters ſo often chuſing to inſiſt upon the offenſive Peculiarities of the Party they had eſpous'd, rather than upon the more weighty Things in which we are all agreed: And ſo we have ſeem'd to People as Preachers of two Chriſt's—Teachers of different Ways to Heaven.—In mentioning theſe Things, which breath not of a Dove-like Spirit, I intend not a Charge againſt all, but an Addreſs to the Conſciences of all, that we may reflect, and ſee how far we are all guilty before the omniſcient Heart-ſearching GOD. We have thoſe whoſe Moderation has been known unto all Men, in the late <hi>Provocation,</hi> the Day of Temptation, that has paſſed over us. But upon impartial

Enquiry may not the moſt of us diſcern great and manifold Defects, in this requiſite miniſterial Qualification; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that we have not taken Heed to our Spirit, as we ſhould if we have kept our Mouth with a Bridle, in the fierceſt Strife of Tongues?—That we have too much indulg'd the Ferments of Anger in our Boſoms, the Workings of Pride and Envy, tho' we may not have rendered Railing for Railing; and have eſcaped the Character <hi>Jude</hi> gives of heretical Teachers, who, in ſpeaking evil of <hi>Dignities,</hi> contumelouſly of the <hi>Apoſtles, Were like raging Waves of the Sea, foaming out their own Shame:</hi> Not uſing ſo much Modeſty in their Treatment of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church, as <hi>Michael the Arch-Angel</hi> did toward <hi>Satan</hi> (contending with him about the <hi>Body of Moſes</hi>) Can we anſwer our Judge, when he ſhall demand of us, what was it that ye diſputed among yourſelves by the Way? We muſt ſtand Speechleſs, if it was which ſhould be greateſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Mark 9.33.</note>. Alas! how often hath Pride and Ambition divided the Miniſters of the humble and meek Jeſus? How ſadly is it to be lamented, that a Spirit of Bitterneſs, Envy, and Malignity, ſhould ever ſo far prevail among them, as to give Occaſion for a <hi>Melanchton</hi> on his Death-Bed, to bleſs GOD that he was going to a Place where he ſhould be freed from the implacable Hatred of Divines!

                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. 55.6.</note>.
