            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The Influenza made its appearance here the laſt week in July, and the firſt caſe of the Malignant Fever that has been obſerved was about the 3d of Auguſt, in Water-ſtreet, between Arch and Race-ſtreets, where it has ſince raged with greater violence, and occaſioned a much greater proportion of mortality than in any other part of the city.</note> THE Fever at preſent prevailing in the city of Philadelphia (which is highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious and malignant) generally begins with, and may be diſtinguiſhed from every other ſpecies or form of fever, by the following ſymptoms, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:025366_0003_0FCD0DC96E51AE68"/>
THE patient firſt complains of wearineſs and weakneſs, which, in a few hours, is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a ſenſe of chillineſs, and an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive dull pain and giddineſs in the head, an oppreſſive weight and ſtricture about the breaſt, particularly at the region of the heart, as if the ſpace was too narrow for its pulſations. The breathing is performed with quickneſs and uneaſineſs.</p>
               <p>THESE ſymptoms in moſt caſes, are ſoon ſucceeded by a frequent propenſity to puke, and this by a quick, full, but ſoft and irregular pulſe; great heat about the head, neck, and breaſt; the ſkin generally hot and moiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the neck and forehead, but dry, and but little increaſe of heat about the feet and legs.<note n="*" place="bottom">The violence of the ſymptoms generally remit every morning.</note>
               </p>
               <p>IF, to theſe ſymptoms, we add an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary proſtration of ſtrength or ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the animal functions of the body, we have a perfect deſcription of the fever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, from the firſt day of its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack to the third of its progreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:025366_0004_0FCD0DCBAD4E4C10"/>
WHEN no amendment takes place by the 3d or 4th day, moſt of the recited ſymptoms become more diſtreſſing and alarming, with the pulſe low and ſunk. Frequent vomiting of matter reſembling coffee grounds in colour and conſiſtence, generally occurs before the diſeaſe terminates, when it proves mortal, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a cadaverous appearance of the countenance, ſucceeded by a deep yellow or leaden colour of the ſkin and nails; the eyes become ſuffuſed with blood, and the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance appears like that of one ſtrangled; but no ſigns of jaundice appear, either in the urine or feces. In ſome caſes, a profuſe diſcharge of blood from the noſe, concludes the cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe—A hiccup is a very frequent but not a conſtant ſymptom, nor does vomiting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways occur. The tongue is ſeldom very ſoul or dry, nor does the patient always crave drink. His intellects, though always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, are ſeldom ſo much diſordered as to amount to a delirium—Subſultus tendinum are very rare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:025366_0005_0FCD0DCD289B7648"/>
WHEN the diſeaſe terminates favourably, the ſymptoms generally abate on the third or fourth day, accompanied by a profuſe ſweat. When it ends fatally, it is generally between the fifth and eighth day, though ſome have ſurvived the tenth, and died afterwards.</p>
               <p>THE characteriſtic or leading ſymptoms of the diſeaſe, as has already been obſerved, are ſudden debility in the voluntary powers, oppreſſive pain, giddineſs and ſenſe of full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtention in the veſſels of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the head, and an oppreſſive weight, or an inexpreſſible ſenſation of tightneſs about the heart and lungs, accompanied with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating anguiſh and reſtleſſneſs.</p>
               <p>THIS fever, like all other varieties of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid fever, ariſes from, and is produced by ſpecific contagion, and may be communicated from thoſe labouring under the diſeaſe, to perſons in the moſt perfect ſtate of health.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:025366_0006_0FCD0DD0E325B9F8"/>
How the diſeaſe was introduced into the city, whether imported from ſome other country, in conſequence of the contagion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to goods or to the apparel of diſeaſed perſons, which is the moſt common ſource from whence infectious diſeaſes are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, or generated in the low and filthy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of ſome of the inhabitants of Water-ſtreet, can only be determined by a collection and faithful ſtatement of facts, and muſt be left for future inveſtigation.</p>
               <p>IT ought, however, to afford us much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, when we are aſſured, (and on this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance we may rely with the moſt perfect ſecurity) that the diſeaſe under conſideration, though certainly infectious is nevertheleſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicable under particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Thoſe circumſtances removed, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection can poſſibly take place.</p>
               <p>To ſuppoſe that the air in the ſtreets can be contaminated by the contagion ſo as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the diſeaſe through that medium, is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025366_0007_0FCD0DD1ACB74FB8"/>
contrary to, and is contradicted by, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and experience of the learned of the faculty of every age and country; and any apprehenſion of an infectious diſeaſe from that ſource, can only be excuſed in thoſe who have not had ſuitable opportunities of better information.</p>
               <p>BURNING heaps of odorous and noiſom ſubſtances in the ſtreets is therefore not only uſeleſs, but injurious, as it not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes or changes the quality of the pure or vital air of the atmoſphere, but conveys into it from the burning materials, a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantity of deleterious gas, commonly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fixed air.</p>
               <p>PEOPLE in walking the ſtreets, are by no means in any danger of infection, as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmata, or contagious exhalations from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the diſeaſed have never been known to be conveyed by the air many feet beyond the chamber of the ſick, except by means of clothes or other porous ſubſtances which have
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025366_0008_0FCD0DD3314EE108"/>
been in contact with, or very near to, the body of one labouring under the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>THE principal, and perhaps the only cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which render the preſent fever communicable, if analogy and paſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience are to have any weight, are the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, viz. Confinement for any length of time in the bed-chamber of the ſick, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the apartment is not large, and freely ventilated—coming in immediate contact with the patient, his body, or bed-clothes, or thoſe of the nurſe or other attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants before they have been for ſome time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the action of the open air, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the breath, or the ſcent of the ſeveral excretions of the ſick.<note n="*" place="bottom">Expoſure of the apparel of the infected to the open air ſome days, and afterwards baking it in an oven for a few hours effectually removes any riſk of diſeaſe from that ſource.</note>
               </p>
               <p>IF people rigorouſly ſhun the above cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, pay a ſtrict attention to cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025366_0009_0FCD0DD52B6C60F8"/>
to conſtant ventilation of their own as well as the apartments of the ſick; take mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and frequent exerciſe in the open air when dry and ſerene; make moderate uſe of reliſhing aliment copiouſly ſeaſoned with ſalt and culinary ſpices, and drink wine or other ſtrong liquors more liberally than cuſtomary; avoiding intemperance of every deſcription; but above all, the monſtrous and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vice of getting drunk—I venture to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with the moſt poſitive confidence, that the diſeaſe will not, cannot ſpread.</p>
               <p>WITH reſpect to the various expedients made uſe of by all claſſes to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from infection, ſuch as camphor bags, amulets of dried frogs, tarred ropes, ſpunge dipped in the vinegar of the four thieves, the ſalt of ſpices (as it is vulgarly called) the ſmoaking of ſegars—they are productive of more evil than good, becauſe they continually attract the mind to one melancholy object, and ſerve to keep alive fearful apprehenſions,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025366_0010_0FCD0DD8D5975418"/>
which might otherwiſe be diverted by other objects and a ſucceſſion of new ideas.</p>
               <p>THE beſt, and I believe I may ſay the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neutralizer or corrector of contagion yet diſcovered, is the pure vital air of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere. The putrid noxious effluvia confined in tombs and vaults (than which few things are more ſuddenly fatal to life) has been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered perfectly innocent by the copious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of vital air, or that portion of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere which ſerves the purpoſe of reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and combuſtion.</p>
               <p>THIS ſalubrious aeriform fluid may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be moſt uſefully employed for reſtoring to health the unfortunate ſufferers under the preſent malignant diſorder.</p>
               <p>SICK rooms may at leaſt be purified and rendered much more comfortable to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and ſafe to the attendants by frequently deflagrating nitre on burning charcoal in different parts of the apartment: this is known
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025366_0011_0FCD0DDA4E846A58"/>
to evolve conſiderable quantities of this vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying air. Pouring vinegar upon a hot iron produces the ſame effect in an inferior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as it undergoes a partial decompoſition, and a quantity of vital air, one of its conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts, is thereby ſet at liberty. The contaminated air may be alſo removed by frequently kindling fires in the chimney of the chamber of the ſick; the air thus rarefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the chimney aſcends, being compreſſed and followed by that in the chamber, and the place, which the contaminated air has left, is immediately occupied by a freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of that which is pure.</p>
               <p>WHITE-WASHING the walls of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber has been found by the late humane and benevolent Mr. Howard, highly conducive to the removal of infection, and is ſtrongly recommended by Dr. Blane.</p>
               <p>ALL kinds of plants in a ſtate of vegetation furniſh more or leſs pure air, at the ſame time that they abſorb and correct that which is
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025366_0012_0FCD0DDB804A3800"/>
contaminated. Veſſels of freſh water there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with cotton ſteeped in them, and the ſeed of pepper graſs ſown upon it, which will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately vegetate, may with propriety be placed in different parts of the chamber, with this caution that they be removed during the night, and the water renewed every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>MANY melancholy examples of a fever, with a complexion and features, nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the one under conſideration occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red during the late war, between United Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica and Great-Britain, in the military hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and priſon ſhips.</p>
               <p>THAT a contagious fever may be generat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any ſituation where freſh air is exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cleanlineſs neglected, eſpecially in the winter ſeaſon; and that the contagion or miaſmata ſo generated, is rendered active by the ſummer's heat in ſuch confined and filthy places, is now generally admitted by the moſt accurate obſervers: The account given of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025366_0013_0FCD0DDDD179C910"/>
the periodical riſe, progreſs and decline, of the plague at Aleppo by Dr. Ruſſel, renders this a matter of certainty. The miaſma or contagion thus generated, is propagated and ſpread by infection.</p>
               <p>IT is alſo generally admitted, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion by which putrid fevers are produced, is not like that of many other diſeaſes perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and conſtantly exiſting, but in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances juſt related, it is occaſionally gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and propagated. At the ſame time it is a rational inference to ſuppoſe, that all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ariſing in ſuch circumſtances are of the ſame ſpecific nature, however they may dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the number and violence of their ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and that ſuch difference may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the circumſtances of climate, ſeaſon, ſoil and conſtitution, concurring with the contagion and modifying its force.</p>
               <p>How far the fever at preſent prevalent here may be combined with, or modified by the contagion of the influenza, which has alſo

                     <p>A phyſician under the ſignature of Quaeſtor Veritatis, in the Federal Gazette of the 28th of August, aſſerts that the preſent malignant fever is only a modification of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enza, and has attempted to ſupport his opinion in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner: "That the long continued heat and drought have relaxed, debilitated and diſpoſed the bodies of perſons who lead indolent lives, are imployed in ſedentary occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or accuſtomed to intemperance, to fevers attended with ſymptoms of putrefaction muſt be obvious to every perſon acquainted with the animal oeconomy, and that diſeaſes of the moſt inflammatory nature will, in their progreſs, produce the moſt unequivocal ſymptoms of putrefaction, or a gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous tendency of the ſolids under ſuch circumſtances, is well known to every perſon converſant with the records of medicine.</p>
                     <p>It is under ſuch circumſtances that the ſmall pox and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles become highly putrid and malignant, and it is in perſons of this deſcription, that the ſcarlatina anginoſa aſſumes the form and features of the cynanche maligna.</p>
                     <p>It is however ſaid, that as a greater proportion of people have died in water-ſtreet, than in any other ſtreet of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there muſt be ſome local ſource of ſpecific contagion. But this may be explained more rationally from there being a leſs portion of pure air there than in any other parts of the city, owing to the ſituation of the houſes on the weſt ſide, being half buried under ground, the number of ſailor taverns and huxter's ſhops, which are receptacles of all kinds of filth, dirt and naſtineſs, and which from their ſituation are excluded from the benefit of free ventilation, &amp;c. Air de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of free circulation and frequently reſpired, is robbed of its vivifying principle, for want of which life can not be ſupported, nor fires kindled."</p>
                     <p>If upon a diſpaſſionate enquiry, it ſhall be found that thoſe affected with typhous and malignant ſymptoms, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the diſeaſe to thoſe reſiding in other parts of the city, who came to viſit them, or being themſelves removed to other parts, communicated it to their attendants, who were not previouſly affected with the typhous diatheſis, or had been previouſly affected with the influenza or other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, the opinion of this anonimous writer will be completely ſubverted. But on the contrary, if it ſhall appear, that thoſe circumſtanced as above mentioned, who have not had the influenza, have been attacked by it ſoon after intercourſe with thoſe labouring under the ſymptoms of malignant fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is a ſtrong preſumption in favour of his opinion. This is a queſtion which can only be decided by a collection and accurate ſtatement of facts, and till ſuch collection and ſtatement is made, every phyſician whoſe object is truth, will ſuſpend his judgment.</p>
                     <p>From the ſcrutiny which has been made by different phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and particularly by Dr. Hutchinſon, the phyſician of the port, there has not been found evidence ſufficient to afford any ſuſpicion that the diſeaſe was imported by the French e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migrants from the weſt-indies, or generated on board any of their veſſels.</p>
                     <p>And as there are no examples on record, ſince phyſicians became acquainted with the conſtituent parts and qualities of the atmoſphere, of putrid fevers being produced by the effluvia of vegetable ſubſtances putrifying in the open air, but by the effluvia of living animals under certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I am ſorry thus publicly to differ in opinion, on the preſent ſubject, from ſome of my fellow practitioners, for whoſe judgments and talents I entertain the higheſt venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</p>

The following method of cure has been hitherto found more ſucceſsful than any other,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025366_0016_0FCD0DE40FB2D450"/>
which I hope will plead my apology for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it at this early period.</p>

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <p>In the treatment of this formidable diſeaſe, much ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and caution are requiſite.</p>
                     <p>The activity of the pulſe and heat of the ſkin in its firſt ſtage, certainly call for the antiphlogiſtic regimen, and ſuch medicines as abate arterial action. As a ſtate of debility very ſoon and conſtantly follows this ſtate of increaſed acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and apparent power in the arterial ſyſtem, I have with others been deterred from employing blood letting. But have ſubſtituted purging, which diminiſhes arterial tenſion in a flower and ſafer manner. Some of my medical friends have informed me, that they have found calomel anſwer this purpoſe better than any other purgative.</p>
                     <p>Some patients in the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe have found more relief from wearing a linen turban on their heads (previouſly ſhaved) frequently wet with cold vinegar; and from affuſions of cold water over their heads and ſhoulders, than from warm fomentations.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as the activity of the pulſe, heat of the ſkin, and praecordial anxiety are moderated, the cortex and elexir of vitriol are the moſt certain remedies that can be employed, with the addition of wine, eſpecially claret, in ſuch quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as to prevent the vital powers from ſinking too much.</p>
                     <p>Should the vigour of the ſyſtem, the anxiety and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs ſuddenly increaſe, immediate recourſe ſhould be had to bliſters, to the unlimitted uſe of ſtrong Madeira wine, volatile ſalts, and every other cordial and exciting power that can be deviſed, provided there be no haemorrhagy.</p>
                  </note> The early exhibition of half a grain of tartar emetic every half hour, in barley water or camomile tea, till it operates either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025366_0017_0FCCDC48CD35D9E8"/>
or downwards, ſucceeded next day by a mild purgative occaſionally repeated, a ſudorific anodyne at night, with copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dilution, for the purpoſe of promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a free perſpiration, generally affords ſome alleviation of the moſt diſtreſſing ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. The patient, if his ſtomach will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and retain it, may alſo take a ſpoonful
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025366_0018_0FCD0DE7724FBED8"/>
of camphorated vinegar, or a ſolution of ſalt of tartar in lime juice, in a draught of barley water or gruel, every two hours, rather cold than warm, and ſhould drink copiouſly of lime juice, or tamarind beverage, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage perſpiration; his feet and hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time frequently immerſed in, or fomented with, clothes dipped in cool vinegar and water, and wiped very dry with a warm cloth; his body and bed linen to be changed regularly twice a day, previouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in vinegar, and afterwards gradually dried, ſo as to be perfectly free from moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. His bed to be in the middle of the floor, without curtains, all the windows, as well as the doors of the chamber to be kept open, and where practicable, he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the high lands in the country, upon the firſt attack of the diſeaſe. Perhaps lying in a tent placed in a dry verdant field would be preferable to the moſt ſpacious chamber.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as the violent determination to the head is diminiſhed, which may be known by
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025366_0019_0FCD0DE8E9000860"/>
the abatement in the action of the carotid and temporal arteries, the patient may take every night at bed time, half a grain of tartar eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, mixed in a peppermint or cinnamon draught, with 25 drops of laudanum, and 2 drachms or 3 of acetated ammonia, increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diminiſhing the proportion of the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum, according to circumſtances. This compoſition has generally the moſt pleaſing effect in procuring reſt, and promoting perſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration, particularly when the impetus of the blood in the veſſels of the head is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
               <p>WHEN the propenſity to puke in the early period of the diſeaſe is urgent, it may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be relieved by giving ſix or eight grains of calomel<note n="*" place="bottom">For this method of exhibiting mercurial purgatives I am indebted to the writings of Dr. Clarke of New-Caſtle.</note> combined with one or two grains of ſolid opium (made into a bolus with common ſyrup) every three or four hours, till it produces a copious diſcharge from the inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines; repeating the anodyne in an efferveſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neutral mixture at bed time.</p>

IF notwithſtanding the uſe of theſe means the diſeaſe does not give way, but on the contrary the patient's ſtrength evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, or ſooner if the activity of the pulſe is conſiderably reduced, recourſe ſhould be had to bliſters; one to be applied between the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and two to the legs. The ſudorific anodyne ſhould alſo be given at night, and the red bark ſhould be exhibited in as large doſes as the ſtomach can be made to retain it, and in ſubſtance if poſſible. Wine ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo now be exhibited (and not before) begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with a ſmall quantity, and gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing it as it is found to agree. When it aggravates the pain in the head, and diſtreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anguiſh at the breaſt, it ſhould be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed or diſcontinued for a time.<note n="*" place="bottom">The elixir of vitriol has been exhibited in ſome caſes from the beginning, with evident benefit.</note>

ſtomach and feet, and occaſionally repeated. At the ſame time the bark and wine, or where wine diſagrees, the bark mixed with a ſtrong peppermint julep, with the addition of a ſmall quantity of thebaic tincture ſhould be almoſt conſtantly given<note n="*" place="bottom">When the bark diſagrees, the beſt ſubſtitute is elixir vitriol given to the quantity of 20 drops in a cold infu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WINE and volatiles, as well as large doſes of opium, given at the commencement of the diſeaſe, have proved highly injurious, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in ſome inſtances, to have occaſioned, or at leaſt to have increaſed the profuſe haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhages from the noſe. But elixir of vitriol has produced more ſalutary effects.</p>
               <p>WINE and volatiles under ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, appear to render the action of the ſyſtem diſproportioned to its ſtate of power, for there muſt be a certain degree of ſtrength, to bear the action excited by ſtimulating and cordial me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and regimen: For nothing is more pernicious, or even fatal, than that any part or function ſhould be forced to make exertions
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025366_0022_0FCD0DF0706CC638"/>
incompatible with its ſtrength; and there is the more danger of ill-timed remedies in the preſent fever, as with the ſtate of weakneſs there is conjoined a ſtate of exceſſive irritabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for the firſt two or three days.</p>
               <p>In the latter ſtage of this fever, at which time the moſt common ſymptoms are great weakneſs, reſtleſſneſs, anxiety and impaired ſenſibility, nothing ſeemed to retard the fatal event ſo effectually, as a volatile aromatic ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep, with the addition of laudanum and the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of peppermint and the moderate uſe of claret or port wine.</p>
               <p>EVERY caſe where the ſkin became yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and the countenance appeared cadave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, has hitherto proved mortal.</p>
               <p>I not this the ſame as the ſynochus of Dr. Cullen? The treatment which has ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded beſt ſeems to indicate that it is.</p>
               <p>WHEN treating of the ſynochus, Dr. Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len expreſſes himſelf in the following terms:
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025366_0023_0FCD0DF40A093E90"/>
"In the ſynochus a <hi>violent</hi> reaction and phlogiſtic diatheſis appear, and prevail dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome part of the courſe of the diſeaſe; while at the ſame time, theſe circumſtances do not conſtitute the principal part of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, nor are to be expected to continue dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole courſe of it; and it is well known, that, in many caſes, the ſtate of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent reaction is to be ſucceeded ſooner or later, by a ſtate of debility, from the exceſs of which the danger of the diſeaſe is chiefly to ariſe. It is therefore neceſſary, that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes blood letting is to be avoided; and even although during the inflammatory ſtate of the diſeaſe, it may be proper, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take care that the evacuation be not ſo large as to increaſe the ſtate of debility which is to follow."</p>
               <p>THE fever however which I have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing, differs from the ſynochus of Doctor Cullen, in the time of its duration, as well as in the violence of its ſymptoms. "It is rare," ſays that great reformer of medicine, "in this

climate [Scotland] that caſes either of <hi>typhus</hi> or ſynochus, terminate before the eleventh day; and when they do terminate on this day, it is for the moſt part fatally.</p>
               <p>WHEN they are protracted beyond this time, I have very conſtantly found that their terminations were upon the 14th, 17th, or 20th day."</p>

               <p>SINCE the above was written, I have taken particular pains to inveſtigate the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the fever, deſcribed in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding pages, and have diſcovered that the firſt caſe of it occurred at Richard Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie's, who kept a lodging-houſe in Water-ſtreet, nearly oppoſite to Dr. Hodge's. A man and his wife of the name of Parkinſon, paſſengers in the brig Ann and Mary, from Dublin, took lodgings there the latter end of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025366_0025_0FCD0DF72D991C68"/>
June. They had one Engliſhman lodging with them at that time. Two young French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men afterwards took lodgings in the ſame houſe. The reſt of the family conſiſted of Richard Parkinſon, his wife and two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. On the 3d. of Auguſt Dr. Cathrall viſited Mrs. Parkinſon, labouring under a highly malignant fever, as will appear by the annexed letter.</p>
               <p>ON the 4th of the ſame month, Dr. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, at the requeſt of the overſeers, viſited the Engliſhman, who died ſuddenly the ſame night. The next day he opened the body, but could diſcover nothing except ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement in the colon and veſſica fellis, that could lead to a diſcovery of the nature of the diſeaſe or the cauſe of his death. On open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head, he found the veſſels of the brain uncommonly diſtended, and turgid with blood.</p>
               <p>MRS. PARKINSON died on the 7th of Auguſt. One of the French lads was taken
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025366_0026_0FCD0DFB593E7E70"/>
ill ſoon after Mrs. Parkinſon—was attended by a French phyſician who lodged at Mrs. Sage's in Front-ſtreet: but I was not able to aſcertain the day of his death.</p>
               <p>SOON after the death of the French lad, Mr. Dennie was attacked by the fever, and his wife two days after. They were both buried the ſame day—He ſurvived the attack ſeven, and ſhe only five days.</p>
               <p>MRS. PARKINSON's huſband, and Mr. Dennie's two daughters eſcaped the infection, but the other French lad who took freſh lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings higher up Water-ſtreet, died a few days after.</p>
               <p>ONE of the young women from whom I received the moſt circumſtantial part of the above account, now reſides at Dr. Hodge's who has humanely afforded her and her ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an aſylum in their diſtreſs.</p>

                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:025366_0027_0FCD0DFD5D13AE08"/>
THE moſt material parts of the above cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances have alſo been confirmed by the Rev. Mr. Keating.</p>
               <p>TWO of the family next door to the lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, died ſoon after of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. Dr. Hodge's maid-ſervant, a young woman from the country, and his little daughter, have alſo died ſince of the ſame complaint; and a number of others in the ſame neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>IT is alſo ſaid, but for this I cannot vouch, that a carpenter in Kenſington, who aſſiſted in breaking open the ſheathing of the cabin of Mr. Steinmetz's brig, which had 117 French Weſt-Indians on board, was ſoon after at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with feveriſh ſymptoms; of which he died in a few days; and that ſeveral Daniſh ſailors have been affected by the ſame diſeaſe at Kenſington.</p>
               <p>THAT the diſeaſe made its firſt appearance in the houſe already mentioned, is clearly
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025366_0028_0FCD0DFEAEEF1360"/>
eſtabliſhed; but whether it was imported and introduced there by the Iriſh family, or by the French lads, or was generated there, I have not been able to collect a ſufficiency of evidence to determine.</p>

               <p>IT appears from authentic documents, that the ſame kind of fever as the one which I have deſcribed in the preceding pages, has been prevalent in Philadelphia at two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent periods. The firſt, A. D. 1740; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been introduced by means of a quantity of wearing apparel brought in a trunk from Barbadoes, belonging to a gentleman who died of it in that Iſland.</p>
               <p>THE ſecond time of its appearance was A. D. 1762, introduced by a mariner, who arrived ſick with it from the Havanna, and communicated it to the family where he lodged; from whence it ſpread rapidly from
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025366_0031_0FCD0E078EC09898"/>
houſe to houſe as families had intercourſe with one another.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to the notes of Dr. Redman, the worthy Preſident of the Philadelphia College of Phyſicians (who has favoured me with the privilege of making uſe of them) it made its appearance the latter end of Auguſt of the year laſt mentioned. About the 20th or 25th of September, its progreſs ſeems to have arrived to its height. From the 27th it gradually declined, ſo that by the 10th of October, inſtead of 18 or 20 patients of a day, which Dr. Redman had before attended in it, he had now only two or three.</p>
               <p>THE fever at that period was circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed between Pine-ſtreet, northerly, and three or four ſquares from thence ſoutherly, and extended from Water-ſtreet, to Third or Fourth-ſtreet weſterly. Its firſt and greateſt ravages were about the New Market, which lay near the ſource of the contagion. The fever as it appeared at that time, is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025366_0032_0FCD0E08C41929F0"/>
by Dr. Redman in a communication juſt preſented to, and read in the College of Phyſicians.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>THE patients were generally ſeized with a ſudden and ſevere pain in the head and eye-balls, which frequently appeared a little inflamed, or had a reddiſh caſt, great pain in the back and limbs, and much dejection of ſpirits. A ſick ſtomach generally attended, but in various degrees of violence, with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent vomiting, more or leſs of green or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowbile, and was diſtinguiſhed from the cholera morbus by not having a purging with it. There was alſo a kind of cardialgia, or burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat about the ſcrobiculus cordis, with great oppreſſion; but if I remember right, not much pain like a colic; nor do I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect any chill <hi>generally</hi> preceding the above ſymptoms—however, it might be with ſome. The ſkin was dry with a diſagreeable burning heat in it, ſenſible to the hand of others. The tongue was not very dry at firſt, but rather
