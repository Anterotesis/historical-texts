            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>PECULIAR Difficulties and Perplexities having lately ariſen in ſome of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which greatly threaten their general Peace and Welfare, the Miniſters of Religion, who ought naturally to care for their State, and are under every Obligation to promote their Intereſt, have eſteemed themſelves called by the great Head of the Church to inquire with particular Attention into the Plan upon which our Churches were originally ſettled, and upon which they have ſo many Years happily flouriſhed.</p>
            <p>And as the Effect of our ſerious, and we hope Impartial Inquiry, we think proper to publiſh to the World the following Obſervations. This we do with a View not to infringe, but to ſtate and defend the Rights of the Churches; fairly to repreſent that noble Plan of Order, ſo pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly friendly to the Rights of Mankind, laid by our venerable Anceſtors, after the moſt ſerious and careful Inquiry into the ſacred Scriptures. Our only deſign has been, to find out its true Meaning; to compare its ſeveral parts with one another; to ſhew their conſiſtency with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with the Sentiments of the judicious
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012857_0003_0F8B94213ABB37A0"/>Compilers, expreſſed in their other Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with the Principles and general Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our Churches and Paſtors, from their firſt happy Settlement unto this Time.</p>
            <p>We have no Inclination to propoſe any new Canon, or to impoſe upon the Churches any Opinion of our own. We only mean to aid the Inquiries of our Brethren into the true Nature of our Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, and we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all to their candid and impartial Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whatever they find, after a ſerious and unbiaſſed Conſideration, oppoſite to this, they have an undoubted Right to reject. They will, however, allow us to entertain ſuch an Opinion of their Chriſtian Charity, as to rely on their kind Acceptance of our ſincere Intention, in this Publication, to ſtrengthen the Union of our Churches, to promote their Peace, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the good Foundation upon which they have hitherto had Reſt and been edified, and which we hope was laid for many Generations.</p>

            <p>THE Compilers of the Platform of Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline agreed upon Anno 1648 are evidently of Opinion, that there are no Churches inſtituted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New-Teſtament Diſpenſation, but <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational,</hi> and expreſsly diſclaim the name of <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents.</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Plat. Cap. 2. Sect. 5.</note> Now the grand Diſtinction between <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational</hi> Churches and thoſe which are erected on the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Eſtabliſhment conſiſts in this; The Independents manage their Eccleſiaſtical Affairs ſolely among themſelves, without ſuppoſing they are under any Obligation to aſk Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or Aſſiſtance of any other Churches: But the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Churches, of which our Platform treats, are by our Conſtitutions in all Caſes of Importance and Difficulty, to invite the Aid and Advice of neighbouring Churches, which our Fathers held to be an "Ordinance of Chriſt, though not abſolutely neceſſary to the Being, yet many Times, thro' the iniquity of Men and perverſneſs of Times, <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the well-being of Churches, for the Eſtabliſhment of Truth and Peace therein."<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Cap. 16. Sect. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe therefore that the Platform encourages the Churches upon its Eſtabliſhment to tranſact their Important Affairs, without conſulting the neighbouring Churches, where this Advice may be obtained, is directly to contradict the Judgment of our pious and learned Fathers upon this Point, to annihilate the Diſtinction which they had eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the Churches of the Independent and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Perſuaſion, to repreſent the Platform as inconſiſtent with itſelf, to deſtroy that Communion of Churches which they ſuppoſed ought ſacredly to be maintained, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Churches of an Inſtitution of Chriſt greatly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to their Order and Safety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:012857_0005_0F8B9422F80E47E0"/>
Our Fathers were too diſcerning to contradict themſelves, and overthrow that goodly Frame of Church Government which they had erected with ſo much Wiſdom and Judgment, after their matureſt Inquiries, on a Scripture Foundation.</p>
            <p>They with great Propriety and Juſtice aſſert,<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Vid. Plat. c. 8. ſ. 9.</note> That neither <hi>Dioceſan Biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Lay-Patrons,</hi> or <hi>Magiſtrates, as ſuch,</hi> have Power to appoint Officers to a particular Church. This is the unalienable Right of the Brethren by a Free Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yet they expreſsly declare, that, in the Exerciſe of this Right, it is agreable to Congregational Principles, "and much conducing to well-being and Communion of Churches; that, where it may conveniently be done, neighbour Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be adviſed withal, and their Help be made Uſe of."<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Vid. Plat. c. 8. ſ. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As the Platform evidently maintains that every Church hath Power, in the above deſcribed Method, to elect and proceed to the Settlement of their Officers, ſo it allows, that in Caſe <hi>of manifeſt Unworthineſs, Delinquency or incorrigible offending, they have Power to depoſe or remove them:</hi> But the Compilers of the Platform are ſo far from ſuppoſing, that a Church ſhould exerciſe this Power, without the Advice of other Churches; that in expreſs Terms they are directed to proceed in ſo Important a Tranſaction by Advice from neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Churches.—This is plain from the very Words of the Platform, <q>In Caſe an Elder offend incorrigibly, the Matter ſo requiring, as the Church had Power to Call to Office, ſo they have Power, <hi>according to Order (the Council of other Churches where it may be had, directing thereto)</hi> to remove him from his Office.<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Plat. c. 10. ſ. 6.</note>
               </q> Theſe Words muſt convince every unprejudiced Mind, that <hi>the removal of an Elder from Office, according to Order</hi> and the Method ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in our Platform, cannot be accompliſhed, but by the <hi>Council of other Churches, where it may be had, directing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> Should a Church therefore of themſelves, without aſking or receiving Advice in the preſcribed Method, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012857_0006_0F8B9423773DF7C0"/>to diſſolve the Relation between them and their Paſtor, they would not only deviate from the Conſtitution we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be under, but act in direct Oppoſition to it. And of Conſequence muſt be looked upon as irregular, and their Conduct muſt be in an higher Degree culpable, when they proceed not only without conſulting, but contrary to the repeated Deciſions of Eccleſiaſtical Councils regularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened.</p>
            <p>In Oppoſition to what has now been ſaid, it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the Platform<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Plat. c. 8. ſ. 5.</note> declares "that if the Church have Power to chuſe their Officers and Miniſters, then in Caſe of manifeſt Unworthineſs and Delinquency, they have Power alſo to depoſe them." —This we readily grant; and that this Power reſides in them only, and not in any <hi>Synod</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Council,</hi> according to our Conſtitution—But then our Platform plainly points out on what Occaſions, and in what Manner, they are to exerciſe this Power, viz. <hi>in Caſe of manifeſt Unworthineſs and Delinquency—a Council of other Churches where it may be had, directing thereto,</hi> which is the only preſcribed Method in which it can be done <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Order.</hi> To whom is this Delinquency or Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be manifeſt?—Is it to that Church only to whom the Perſon accuſed belongs?—Alas! the unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies which uſually uſher in every Attempt to remove an Elder from his Office, render them too much a Party to be the ſole conſtituted Judges in this Affair—The Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency muſt be manifeſt to the Council of other Churches, who are appointed to be called upon this Occaſion, as well as to the Church more immediately concerned: Without this it would be the greateſt Abſurdity for the Council to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and direct to the Diſmiſſion.—This Advice and Direction being obtained, the Church proceed to the regular Exerciſe of their Power, and diſſolve the Relation between them and their Elder. This is indiſputably the Meaning of our Platform: And to take it in any different Senſe is to charge it with the greateſt Inconſiſtency.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:012857_0007_0F8B942A1A2947E8"/>
Upon this Point it is very obſervable, that the Platform makes Uſe of a very different Form of Expreſſion, reſpecting the Introduction and Depoſition of Church Officers:—As to the former, the Words of the Platform are theſe <q>we judge it much conducing to the well-being and Communion of Churches, that where it may be conveniently done, Neighbour Churches be adviſed withal, and their Help be made Uſe of in the Trial of Church Officers in order to their Choice.<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Plat. c. 8. ſ. 8.</note>
               </q> But as to the latter, viz. the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of an Elder, the Platform riſes in Expreſſion, and uſes a much ſtronger Term,—<q>The Council of other Churches <hi>directing</hi> thereto;</q> moſt evidently ſignifying it to be their Mind of the Compilers, that a Church, even in Caſe of incorrigible Offence in an Elder, may not, <hi>according to Order,</hi> proceed of themſelves alone to his Depoſition, but that the Power they have, in ſo momentous a Matter, is to exerciſed under the Countenance and Direction of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of other Churches regularly called.</p>
            <p>Our illuſtrious Anceſtors had too much Acquaintance with the Paſſions and Prejudices incident to human Nature, and too warm a Zeal for the Safety of the Churches, and the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Miniſtry, to leave a Deciſion of ſo great and common Concern entirely to thoſe whoſe Minds may have been heated by previous Contentions, and their Judgments biaſſed by various Prejudices and Prepoſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>If this be allowed, every Church will have a Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Right, whenever they ſee fit, under the Pretence of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs and Delinquency in their Miniſter, after many Years faithful Service, to diſmiſs him from his Office, and reſign him and his Family to ſeek a Maintenance from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Charity.</p>
            <p>What a Diſcouragement would this be to well-qualified Perſons from entering into the Miniſtry under ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution—Soon
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012857_0008_0F8B942A4837D220"/>would our Pulpits be vacant, or filled with men, no ways prepared for that important Service.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, We are fully of Opinion, that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Spirit and Letter of the Platform, for any Church to exerciſe the Power of diſſolving the Relation between them and their Paſtor, unleſs they act under the Direction of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Churches, regularly called and convened, where ſuch Direction may be obtained; and where a Church is rent with Diviſions among themſelves, and do not conſult other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, they neglect to make Uſe of the Remedy which our Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Conſtitution hath in ſuch Caſes provided and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined.</p>
            <p>Theſe are not merely our own peculiar Sentiments as to the meaning of that Church-Order, which is pointed out in our Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, but they are confirmed by the Suffrages of the moſt eminent Divines of our Communion, who lived at or near the Time when the Order of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Congregational Churches was eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>We have made a careful Inquiry into the Practice of the Churches, with Reſpect to Church Order, which, if it hath been uniform, muſt be eſteemed a faithful Expoſition of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the venerable Synod who compiled the Platform, and have the Satisfaction to find the Conſtruction we have given of the Platform abundantly confirmed by the Writings of thoſe Divines who were preſent at that Synod, and of the Miniſters of the ſucceeding Age.</p>
            <p>Before the Synod of 1648, the Churches of the Province had no Platform of their Church Government.<note n="*" place="bottom">Magnalia, B 5. p. 20.</note> Till that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012857_0009_0F8B942B0D08F9A0"/>Time, the venerable <hi>John Cotton</hi>'s Book of the <hi>Power of the Keys,</hi> in which the learned Author endeavours to lay out the juſt Line and Bounds of <hi>all Church Power,</hi> was generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as the Directory of theſe Churches in this Matter.

               </q> He has given us the following remarkable Citation from it, which will help us to form juſt Sentiments of the Opinion and Practice of our venerable Fathers in the early Days of this Country. <q>It is an <hi>holy Ordinance of Chriſt</hi> for <hi>particular Churches</hi> to join together, in a Conſociation among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to adminiſter their Church Affairs, which are of <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Difficulty</hi> and <hi>common Concernment,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out common Conſultation and Conſent of other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches about them.

            <p>The next Authority is that of the renowned <hi>Hooker,</hi> in his Survey of Church Diſcipline.<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Preface, p. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012857_0011_0F8B942C855353B8"/>which when given, is not to be diſregarded and ſlighted. For refuſing to <hi>hear Counſel</hi> ſo given, is, according to him, juſt Cauſe for other Churches renouncing Fellowſhip with the Church ſo offending.</p>

               </q> It is plainly the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> that no Cenſure ought to be paſſed on a delinquent Elder without the good Advice of neighbouring Churches: though a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church is the higheſt Eccleſiaſtical Tribunal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt, yet it ought not to exerciſe its Power in ſuch a Caſe, till a Council of neighbouring Churches have adviſed them to do it.</p>

            <p>Before we proceed to the Synod of 1662, we ſhall cite a Paſſage from an Election Sermon of Mr. <hi>Samuel Danforth,</hi> formerly Miniſter of <hi>Roxbury,</hi> which throws great Light on the Practice of our Churches in early Times. This Sermon was preached A. D. 1670. "In our firſt and beſt Times," ſays he, <q>what pious Care was there for Siſter Churches,—that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012857_0013_0F8B94325B770D38"/>in thoſe that wanted Peace their Diſſentions might be healed? What Readineſs was there in thoſe Days to <hi>call for the Help of Neighbouring Elders and Brethren,</hi> in caſe of any Difference or Diviſion that could not be healed at home? What Reverence was there then of the <hi>Sentence of the Council,</hi> as being <hi>deciſive,</hi> and <hi>iſſuing the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy?</hi> According to that ancient proverbial Saying, <hi>They ſhall ſurely aſk Counſel at Abel, and ſo they ended the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We come now to the <hi>Synod</hi> of 1662. In that venerable Aſſembly, we have Authority from Dr. <hi>Increaſe Mather,</hi> who was one of the Elders in it, to aſſert, that in Anſwer to the Queſtion about Conſociation of Churches, there was a marvellous Unanimity; not <hi>one Elder,</hi> nor ſo much as <hi>two Brethren</hi> in all that Reverend Aſſembly <hi>diſſenting.</hi> In this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod it was directed, that <hi>Churches do ſeek and accept Help from, and give Help to, each other in Matters of more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Importance, as Ordination, Tranſlation, and Depoſition of Elders.</hi> 
               <q>Agreably to which, (ſays the Doctor) the Laws of the Colony once required the Approbation of <hi>three, or four Churches,</hi> to every <hi>Ordination.</hi>
                  <note n="(t)" place="bottom">Seaſonable Teſt. p. 10.</note>
               </q> And thoſe Divines who have <hi>ſeemed to be Pillars</hi> in the revived <hi>Congregational Diſcipline,</hi> eſpouſed by our Churches, have generally expreſſed the ſame Concern, that the <hi>Uſage</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Councils might be maintained.</hi> The Synod at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> earneſtly aſſerts, <q>That it is according to the Mind of Chriſt, that Churches holding Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion together, do by their Meſſengers meet in a Synod, or Council, to conſider and give Advice—on <hi>ſuch Occaſions</hi> as the Churches in this Country have alſo thought proper to come under ſuch a Cognizance.</q> The <hi>Depoſition</hi> of an <hi>Elder</hi> is one of thoſe Matters of <hi>more than ordinary Importance,</hi> which this our <hi>New-England</hi> Synod has deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to require the <hi>Help of other Churches.</hi> In ſuch a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012857_0014_0F8B94348BE2E860"/>Caſe the Synod has alſo determined, that it is the Duty of a Church, not only to <hi>ſeek,</hi> but to <hi>accept</hi> the Help of other Churches. It does not appear that this Synod ever thought any Church would proceed to depoſe their <hi>Elder,</hi> when a Council of Churches had <hi>adviſed his Continuance in the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip.</hi> The Doctor goes on, <q>The famous Apologiſts, Dr. <hi>F. Goodwin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nye,</hi> Mr. <hi>Simpſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bridge,</hi> aſſert an Obligation hereunto, in the <hi>common Law of Communion of Churches.</hi> Yea, they profeſs, they look upon it as the moſt to be abhorred Maxim, and the moſt contradictory and diſhonorable to Chriſtianity, that a ſingle and particular Society of Men profeſſing the Name of Chriſt, and pretending to be endowed with Power from Chriſt, ſhould arrogate to themſelves an Exemption from giving an Account, or being cenſurable by Neighbour Churches about them. So far (ſay theſe ſuper-eminent Divines of the Congregational Way) were our Judgments from that <hi>Independent</hi> Liberty, which has been imputed to us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As we have now mentioned the Sentiments of theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Apologiſts, who were not of this Country, it may not be amiſs to add the Opinion of the great and good Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> on this Occaſion. We do it the rather, becauſe he has ever been held in high Eſtimation among us, and alſo on Account of his having altered his Sentiments reſpecting Church Diſcipline, on his reading the celebrated <hi>Cotton</hi> on <hi>the Keys.</hi> In ſeveral of his Treatiſes he has advanced Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame Aſpect, on the <hi>Neceſſity and Authority</hi> of regular Councils, for the Welfare of particular Churches, with thoſe already alledged by us. In one of his former, he ſays,<note n="(u)" place="bottom">Vid. Catech. p. 224.</note> 
               <q>Churches ought to preſerve a mutual, holy Communion, and exerciſe it in making Uſe of the <hi>Advice</hi> of one another.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012857_0015_0F8B943554A293D8"/>Communion from them, in Caſe they perſiſt in the Error of their Way; and that becauſe in their Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and before their Miſcarriages, they were <hi>bound</hi> to have <hi>deſired the Advice of other Churches;</hi> which being neglected by them, the others are to recover the End of it to the utmoſt of their Ability.</q> In another of his Treatiſes<note n="(w)" place="bottom">Nat of Ch. part 2. p. 251.</note> the Doctor has theſe memorable Words, <q>No Church is <hi>ſo Independent,</hi> as that it can always, and in all Caſes, obſerve the Duty it owes unto the Lord Chriſt, and the Church catholic by all thoſe Powers, which it is able to <hi>act in itſelf diſtinctly,</hi> without a <hi>Conjunction with others.</hi> And the Church which confines its Duty unto the Acts of its own Aſſemblies, cuts itſelf off from the external Communion of the Church catholic: Nor will it be ſafe for any Man to commit the Conduct of his Soul to ſuch a Church.—Every particular Church, which extends not its Duty beyond its own Aſſemblies and Members, is fallen off from the principal End of its Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.

            </p>
            <p>The Sentiment of Doctor <hi>Increaſe Mather,</hi> on the Subject under Conſideration, fully appears from the Concluſion he draws from the immediately preceding Authorities, which he uſed on a ſpecial Occaſion; as well as from ſome other Declarations, which we ſhall hereafter notice. His words are theſe,<note n="(x)" place="bottom">Seaſonable Teſtimony, p. 15.</note> 
               <q>From whence it will follow, that if any Church preſume to tranſact their more <hi>weighty Affairs,</hi> and ſuch as are of <hi>common Concern</hi> to the Churches in their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, with a Contempt of ſuch <hi>Councils</hi> of them as ought to be adviſed withal; or if they ſhall upon <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Differences</hi> ariſen among them, refuſe the <hi>Advice</hi> of thoſe who urge them to make Uſe of the Remedy, which

               <q>It is requiſite, that the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the <hi>Removal</hi> be laid before <hi>authentick Judges;</hi> even ſuch as may be moſt likely to paſs an <hi>impartial Judgment</hi> upon them; and by theſe be pronounced ſuch, that the <hi>Removal</hi> thereupon may be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wiſely proceeded in. And, where it can be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we think, that nothing leſs than a Council of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Neighbourhood, ſhould have the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter laid before them. For, if ſuch a <hi>Council</hi> be, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of theſe Churches, always convened, for the <hi>Ordaining</hi> of a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> it ſtands to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that there ſhould as much be requiſite for his <hi>Remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> it being, as it was by a very conſiderable Number of eminent Divines on a great Occaſion in theſe Churches once pronounced. <hi>A very conſiderable Act of the Kingly Government exerciſed by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in his Churches.</hi>
               </q> From this Citation it is evidently the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctor, that the <hi>Removal</hi> of a Paſtor, if it be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Charge of another Church, ought not, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given, to be effected, without the Advice and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Neighbouring Churches.

            <p>Anno 1700 the Doctor publiſhed a Treatiſe, under the Title of <hi>The Order of the Goſpel.</hi> In this Treatiſe ſeveral Queſtions, relating to Church Diſcipline, are accurately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed.

               </q> The Dr. in anſwer, replies, <hi>This is both expedient and</hi> NECESSARY: And he aſſigns a Number of weighty Reaſons in Support of his Opinion, which are not neceſſary to be rehearſed.

It is evident from the preceding Quotations, that the venerable Fathers of theſe Churches, agree in Opinion, that Matters of more than ordinary Weight and Importance, and thoſe of common Concernment ought not to be tranſacted without Advice of Council. And many of them are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in aſſerting, that the Depoſition of an Elder, or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is a Matter of ſuch Weight and Importance, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Counſel and Advice of neighbouring Churches.— We do not find, on the moſt careful Enquiry, a ſingle In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any Congregational Church from the firſt Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Country to the preſent Day, which has depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or diſmiſſed its Teaching Elder, or Paſtor, without the Advice of a Council of neighbouring Churches; except when a Diſmiſſion has been effected by the mutual Conſent of the Elder and Church. And, even in this Caſe, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what has been before adduced, that ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is irregular, and contrary to the Conſtitution of theſe Churches.</p>
            <p>We cannot forbear, on this Occaſion, in the Meekneſs and Gentleneſs of Chriſt, earneſtly to adviſe theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in this land, attentively to conſider the Noble and truly Chriſtian Plan, upon which our Fathers have placed us; and to preſerve that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they had ſo much at Heart, as our trueſt Strength and Glory; and which is ſo neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Purity of the Miniſtry, and the Privileges of the Fraternity, both of which we are equally ſolicitous to ſupport; and as a ſpecial Means of this, to ſeek the Advice of neighbouring Churches in all Matters of common Concernment, more particularly thoſe of peculiar Weight and Importance, and when it is afforded them to receive it with Meekneſs, ſeriouſly and impartially to conſider it, and not lightly to depart from it, or pertinaciouſly to oppoſe it; reflecting how earneſtly our Fathers recommended this as a Goſpel Inſtitution for conveying Light and Peace to the Church; and what fatal Conſequences Inattention to, and much more a Contempt of ſuch an Inſtitution is likely to produce.</p>

From the ſame Conſiderations, we truſt, the Churches will be ever ready to afford their Aſſiſtance and Counſel to Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Churches, in all Seaſons of Darkneſs and Perplexity, and to act on ſuch Occaſions with Deliberation, Impartiality, and Solemnity, conſidering how much the Honour of Chriſt, and the Peace and Welfare of his Churches may depend on their Reſults.</p>
