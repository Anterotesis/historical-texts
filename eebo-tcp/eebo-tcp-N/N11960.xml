            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE DISEASES INCIDENT TO ARMIES.</head>
            <p>THE great and frequent inconveniences attending a military life, are of ſuch a nature, as to make the greateſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock even among the moſt robuſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. It is not, therefore ſurpriſing, that an Army is ſeldom or ever without a great number of ſick.</p>
            <p>NEVERTHELESS, it has been obſerved, that the diſtempers moſtly prevalent among the Troops are not in number very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
            <p>WE have, for this reaſon, thought it ſufficient to ſpeak of thoſe, whoſe attacks the ſoldier is moſt ſubject to, to deſcribe them in ſuch a manner, as they may be diſtinguiſhed from one another by certain ſigns; and at the ſame time to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſuch ſymptoms as characteriſe the decreaſe or increaſe of each diſorder; and laſtly, to ſpecify the medicines proper for the cure of the ſick, and the diet they are to obſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:015100_0005_0F95D31BAD5B63A0"/>IT will be perceived, that, in our little Eſſay on this ſubject, it was equally neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be ſhort, and to endeavour to avoid being obſcure.</p>
            <p>THIS Work, however, no wiſe regards the Phyſicians, who, maſters of their art, and in daily practice, ſtand in no need of the aſſiſtance of theſe firſt elements.</p>
            <p>BUT it often happens, in an army, that the number of ſick is ſo great, and they are diſperſed in ſo many different places, that it is impoſſible the phyſicians ſhould go every where, and give their attendance to each individual. In ſuch caſes, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity obliges the ſick to be entruſted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who cannot be expected to have the ſame knowledge with thoſe of the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>FOR the uſe of ſuch practitioners, not ſufficiently inſtructed, this ſmall Tract is deſigned, that, by the ſigns exactly deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they may underſtand the nature of the diſtemper, the conduct they are to obſerve, and the remedies proper to be adminiſtered.</p>
            <p>AT the end are inſerted the RECIPES or preſcriptions referred to in the courſe of the Work. They are rendered as ſimple as poſſible, and preference given to thoſe medicines that are eaſieſt to be procured, and eaſieſt to be prepared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:015100_0006_0F95D31C6A162798"/>IT may not be amiſs to premiſe ſome obſervations, by means of which, ſickneſs may in ſome degree be prevented, and the health of the ſoldier preſerved. We are ſenſible, that, in time of war, it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways poſſible to obſerve exactly all what we are going to ſay; but it cannot but be of uſe to know what is moſt advantageous, that it may be put in practice, at leaſt when circumſtances permit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> The ſoldier freſh liſted, and torn at once from his family, no ſooner loſes ſight of his village, but he becomes melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; and tho' a robuſt huſbandman, finds himſelf ſcarce able to bear the fatigues and inconveniences of a military life. It were to be wiſhed, that he could be uſed, little by little, to this new kind of life; but in the mean time nothing is better, than to procure him all kinds of amuſement and diverſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second.</hi> GARDEN ſtuff and freſh greens are a wholeſome nouriſhment for the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; ripe fruits are equally good, and never hurt but by their abuſe; but unripe and acrid fruits are very hurtful. The uſe of garden ſtuff and fruit prevents the ſcurvy, and even cures thoſe already attacked with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third.</hi> THE choice of water is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015100_0007_0F95D31E224C9BF0"/>
If there is none to be found abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely pure, the preference is to be given to that leaſt loaded with heterogeneous parts. There is an eaſy way to diſtinguiſh water that is pure, from that which is leſs ſo, by means of <hi>oleum tartari per deliquium.</hi> If you let fall a few drops of this in a glaſs of water, if not pure, it becomes inſtantly thick, and milky, whilſt the ſame opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produces only a ſmall cloud in that which is more pure.</p>
            <p>RIVER water ſhould not be drawn near the banks; that which is in the middle of the ſtream is always beſt.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES, indeed, Troops are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the ſad neceſſity of drinking bad water; in which caſe it may be much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, by mixing a certain quantity of vinegar. Six ounces, mixed with three quarts of water, will render the drink even more agreeable.</p>
            <p>THE water may alſo be rendered leſs hurtful by ſteeping in it ſome pieces of the root of the <hi>calamus aromaticus.</hi> This root is found every where, eſpecially in marſhy places, where commonly the water is worſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth.</hi> THE ſoldier ought to be well clothed and covered; his ſhoes of a thick and ſtrong leather. and the thread they are ſewed with well covered with wax:
<pb facs="unknown:015100_0008_0F95D31EAAD7E928"/>
if all the ſeams could be well waxed the water would be prevented from penetrating.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth.</hi> CAMPS ought to be pitched on a dry ſpot, as much as poſſible. That which appears ſuch is ſometimes quite the reverſe, becauſe the waters are but at a little diſtance below the ſurface. It is, however, very eaſy to know that, by digging the ground, or even merely by examining the wells of the neighbouring villages</p>
            <p>IF the water is high in the wells, the ſoil is damp,; if the water is low, the ſoil is dry.</p>
            <p>IT would likewiſe be proper to avoid the neighbourhood of thick foreſts; they prevent the wind from penetrating, and render the air of the circumjacent parts damp and cloſe.</p>
            <p>BUT if there is a neceſſity of encamping in a damp ground, the ſoldiers muſt have their ſtraw changed oftner than uſual. The officers will be much benefited by ſpreading a waxed cloth under their bed.</p>
            <p>IN times of rain, the tighter the tents are extended, the leſs it penetrates: ſmall trenches dug round the tents contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the dryneſs of the ſpot where the ſoldier lies, becauſe they receive the water that falls from above.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixth.</hi> WHEN an army remains long
<pb facs="unknown:015100_0009_0F95D31F6B581D78"/>
in the ſame camp, the unwholeſome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia from ſo many bodies always occaſion ſickneſs, unleſs there happen to be violent and frequent winds. Theſe exahalations are moſtly to be feared in a hot and moiſt air. The changes of camps on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, contribute much to the health of the ſoldier, more eſpecially when the bloody flux prevails. Hence ariſes one reaſon the more for avoiding the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of thick foreſts, which prevent the free paſſage of the winds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventh.</hi> NOTHING is more prejudicial to the ſoldier, when heated with work, than to ſtrip, expoſe himſelf to the cool air, and greedily drink cold water, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially well-water, which commonly is very much ſo. River water is leſs hurtful, as the rays of the Sun, to which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly expoſed, prevent its being ſo cold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighth.</hi> CARE muſt be taken, during the great heats, that the ſoldier on duty ſhould remain expoſed to the heat of the Sun as little as poſſible, and that he avoid ſleeping there. The cuiraſſiers, eſpecially, when once their cuiraſs is thoroughly heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are thoſe who ſuffer moſt by the ſun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninth.</hi> NEATNESS connot be too much inſiſted on. Let ſoldiers frequently waſh their hands, their face, and their feet;
<pb facs="unknown:015100_0010_0F95D3202A90B2B0"/>
and, if the ſeaſon permits, let them bathe as much as poſſible in running water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenth.</hi> GREAT care ought to be taken not to lodge many men together in a ſmall ſpace; and if it cannot be avoided, let the air be at leaſt renewed as often as it can, whether thoſe who lodge together are in health or ſickneſs; for from hence ariſe the moſt dangerous, and even the contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventh.</hi> THE bread ought to be well baked, and made of good and pure flour; for it is certain, that very dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers are occaſioned by muſty or ſpoiled bread.</p>

                  <head>OF THE DISEASES OF THE ARMY.</head>
                  <p>IF the troops encamp in the ſpring, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally early in the ſeaſon, there will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly be many ſick. The Diſeaſes, that principally prevail at that time, are, very troubleſome Coughs, ſore Throats, Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies, Peripneumonies, and Rheumatiſms.</p>
                  <p>THESE Diſtempers, tho' not contagious, do not admit of much motion in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, wherefore it ſhould be endeavoured to have the Hoſpitals nigh hand, and, if the ſtate of the Diſtemper requires it, to bleed the Patient, before he be moved, the delay of which may produce very troubleſome conſequences.</p>
                  <p>SOMETIMES alſo intermitting Fevers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail during this ſeaſon, but they generally are leſs obſtinate than thoſe that happen in Autumn. In Spring they are commonly Tertians, or Quotidians, but ſeldom Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, unleſs in thoſe ſubjects, who have been before attacked during the Winter, and in whom, properly ſpeaking, they are only Relapſes.</p>
                  <div type="part">

                     <head>COUGHS.</head>
                     <p>COUGHS are more troubleſome than dangerous: but if they continue any of time, and are neglected, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times degenerate into a <hi>Phthiſis Pulmonalis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>LET the Patient make uſe of the receipt No. 1. for his common drink, and drink it luke-warm; it will be of ſervice to add a fourth part of new milk.</p>
                     <p>THE Patient muſt abſtain from wine, from ſalt and acid food. Rice, and barley broth, and new milk, with the yolk of an egg, will be ſufficient nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>IF the Cough becomes too violent and troubleſome, ſo as to prevent the Patient from ſleeping, he may take the preſcription No 2.</p>
                     <p>IF the Cough is attended with a Fever, bleeding will be neceſſary to prevent an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, which is then to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the Cough diminiſhes, and the excretions, which before were without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, become thick, and are eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectorated, the diſtemper is at an end.</p>

                     <head>SORE THROAT.</head>
                     <p>IF the action either of ſwallowing or reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſuffer an impediment, attended with ſenſible pain, and the cauſe is in the neck, or throat, the diſorder is called a ſore Throat, (<hi>Angina.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>It is a very dangerous diſtemper, and ſometimes even mortal; it is known to be ſo, when reſpiration is greatly impeded, the voice extremely ſharpened, and the anxiety very conſiderable. A large bleeding is immediately requiſite, and cupping glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are to be applied, around and on the nape of the neck, which often give inſtant relief: the drink No. 1. muſt be kept conſtantly in the mouth warm; and the poultice No. 3. applied, and continued hot on the neck, night and day.</p>
                     <p>IF the Patient can ſwallow, let him take every hour a cupfull of the drink No. 1. made hot, with the addition of twenty grains of purified nitre to each pint. If the redneſs appears on the neck or breaſt, the Patient often recovers. Otherwiſe this Diſeaſe is frequently mortal; but it is not common. The following ſpecies is much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
                     <p>ONE of the <hi>tonſils,</hi> grows red, ſwelled,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015100_0015_0F95D323EDB2C6B8"/>
and painful, and the pain commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends itſelf to the internal part of the ear of the diſeaſed ſide. In a day or two, the Diſeaſe attacks the <hi>gland of the other ſide,</hi> while the ſwelling diſappears from that which was firſt affected. Sometimes the pulſe is hard and quickened, and ſometimes not at all</p>
                     <p>IN the firſt caſe, the urine appears of a deeper colour than it is in health; bleeding is then neceſſary; and if the redneſs, ſwelling of the throat, and difficulty of breathing do not give way, it will be proper to repeat it.</p>
                     <p>IN the ſecond caſe, viz. if the pulſe is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, there is no neceſſity for bleeding, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Patient be of a replete habit.</p>
                     <p>THE nouriſhment muſt be reſtrained to light broth, to which may be added rice or barley <hi>cream.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>LET the Patient take a tea-cup of the drink No. 4. every hour, warm, unleſs he ſleeps: and let him often keep in his mouth ſome of the medicated tea, No 5. warm, with which he is alſo to gargle his throat.</p>
                     <p>NEXT day let him be purged with the draught No. 6. which, if the diſorder does not abate, he may take it again after two days, continuing, in the mean time, the uſe of No. 4. and No. 5. till he can ſwallow
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015100_0016_0F95D324AE0547D0"/>
freely, and the redneſs hath diſappeared from the inſide of the throat.</p>
                     <p>IF the diſorder has continued too long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore relief was applied, or the inflammation is too conſiderable, (to give way,) ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will enſue.</p>
                     <p>THAT there will be a ſuppuration is known, by the ſwelling and redneſs in the throat continuing above three days, without any abatement. In this caſe, the Patient is to keep continually in his mouth ſome of the decoction No. 7. warm, which likewiſe may be lightly injected into his throat.</p>
                     <p>THE cataplaſm No. 8. is to be applied, and kept night and day round about his throat.</p>
                     <p>If the ſwelling of the throat then begins to grow ſoft, the abſceſs will ſoon burſt: if there appear a little ſpot elevated and white, the concealed lancet <hi>(pharyngotomus)</hi> may with all ſafety be uſed, to give, by this means, a freer iſſue to the pus.</p>
                     <p>The abſceſs being either broke of itſelf or opened by the lancet, the gargariſm No. 9. muſt be frequently uſed, and the cure will ſoon be compleated.</p>
                     <p>WHEN it happens that the ſwelling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents deglutition entirely, a gliſter of twelve ounces of new milk and ſix ounces of barley water is to be adminiſtered every four hours, which the Patient muſt retain as long as he
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015100_0017_0F95D3256C7A1BC0"/>
poſſibly can. By this means he may be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained till the abſceſs breaks.</p>
                     <p>THERE is ſtill another ſpecies of ſore throat, which, in the beginning, is eaſily cured, but by neglect degenerates into a ſort of mortification, and corrodes all the parts attacked, cauſing at the ſame time a moſt horrible ſtench.</p>
                     <p>THERE appears on the tonſils, on the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, on both ſides of the interior part of the mouth, or within the lips, one or ſeveral white ſpots, ſometimes yellowiſh, and even brown, according as the diſorder is more or leſs violent. The places round theſe ſpots are much inflamed and painful. It ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens that the patient has no fever; and the ſwelling is never ſo conſiderable in this caſe, as in the before deſcribed ſore throat.</p>
                     <p>THE laſt ſpecies generally goes off pretty ſoon, by rubbing every two hours lightly the parts affected with a pencil dipped in the mixture No. 10. and uſing for a gargariſm a ſimple infuſion of elder flowers. It is proper the Patient ſhould drink ſome cups of the ſame infuſion about four times a day.</p>
                     <p>It is to be obſerved, that the ſaid ſpots in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe very ſuddenly, when the ſtench of the mouth is great: in that caſe, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>ſp. ſal. mar.</hi> muſt be augmented, to ſtop the progreſs of this evil.</p>

                     <head>The PLEURISY.</head>
                     <p>THE Pleuriſy is known by a ſharp pain, and ſtitches, felt in the breaſt, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a fever.</p>
                     <p>THIS pain is increaſed by inſpiration, and leſſened by exſpiration, and by holding the breath; the pulſe is generally hard, as in all acute and inflammatory diſeaſes: in violent Pleuriſies the pain is ſometimes ſo ſharp, that the Patient ſcarce dares to draw his breath, the face grows lived, and he feels himſelf juſt ſuffocating; in this ſtate the pulſe is ſmall and low.</p>
                     <p>The Cough is almoſt continual, but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the violent pain: in ſome caſes, this Cough is dry, without any excretion; in others it is, from the beginning, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with excretions; leſs danger is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the laſt caſe than in the firſt.</p>
                     <p>THO' the ſides of the breaſt are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attacked in this diſtemper, yet the anterior and poſterior parts may be equally affected.</p>
                     <p>IF the pain is moſt ſenſibly felt exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and chiefly upon touching the part, the diſorder is commonly named a falſe Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy, and is to be treated as follows:</p>
                     <p>BLEEDING is the firſt and chief remedy:
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015100_0019_0F95D327010A1530"/>
let twelve ounces of blood, or even more, if the ſubject is replete and robuſt, be taken from the arm, on the ſide where the pain is. While the vein is open, let the patient reſpire ſtrongly, and cough. Bleeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly leſſens the pain, and ſometimes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it off altogether.</p>
                     <p>SOME hours after the bleeding, the glyſter No. 11. ought to be given.</p>
                     <p>FLANNELS dipt in the fomentation No. 12, are to be conſtantly applied to the place where the pain is felt; and as it would be troubleſome to apply this topic during the night, a plaiſter of Labdanum, ſpread on leather or linen, may be applied in its room.</p>
                     <p>IN the morning this plaiſter muſt be taken off, the part rubbed with the <hi>ung. altheae</hi> and the medicine No. 12. Let the patient take every half hour, if he be awake, a ſpoonful of the mixture No. 13. and drink after it a warm cupfull of the decoction No. 1. to each pint of which one ounce of honey ſhould be added.</p>
                     <p>IT often happens, that the pain, which after bleeding was much leſſened, or quite ceaſed, returns with as much violence as at firſt: in this caſe a ſecond bleeding is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but commonly not ſo large as the firſt, which always ought to be very copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015100_0020_0F95D327AEFFEFC8"/>
if after this the pain ſtill returns very ſenſibly, you muſt bleed a third time, and ſometimes even a fourth, according to the violence of the diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>IT muſt, however, be obſerved, that ſlight remains of pain, and ſuch as but little impede reſpiration, do not require freſh bleedings: the Patient might by them be too much weakened, and rendered languid a long time after.</p>
                     <p>BLEEDING, therefore, muſt only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in thoſe caſes where the pain is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent enough to obſtruct the breath conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably; the velocity of the pulſe, increaſed commonly at the ſame time, ſhows the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for this evacuation.</p>
                     <p>IT is a good ſign, when the pain changes its place, and affects the clavicles, the ſhoulder-blades, the ſhoulders and back; and that this new pain requires no bleeding. Theſe changes generally happen about the ſixth day: it is then ſufficient to chafe the parts in pain lightly, and then anoint them with the <hi>ung. alth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>LET the nouriſhment be light, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of thin broth, roaſted apples, and well fermented bread: the decoction No. 1. or plain barley water with one fourth of new milk, may ſerve for common drink. If the belly be conſtipated, the glyſter No. 11. may be repeated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="unknown:015100_0021_0F95D32966F261F8"/>As ſoon as reſpiration grows eaſier, and the pain is conſiderably diminiſhed, it will be ſufficient to give every two hours a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of No. 13. with a cupfull of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction No. 1. warm after it.</p>
                     <p>BUT if, notwithſtanding ſeveral bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the pain continues, without any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diminution; and above all, if the rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of the breaſt, and want of expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhew the lungs to be filling, a bliſter is to be applied to each calf of the leg.</p>
                     <p>A ſharp bliſter applied on the painful part has often been attended with very good effects, even when repeated bleedings had procured no ceſſation of the pain of the ſide.</p>
                     <p>CARE muſt be taken in this, as well as in all inflammatory diſtempers, that the Patient be not kept too hot, and that the air be often renewed.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the illneſs begins to grow milder, by the uſe of the above medicines, freſh ſymptoms will appear, which ſhow the morbific matter is concocted, and ready to be expelled.</p>
                     <p>GREAT care muſt then be taken, not to prevent its courſe, but, on the contrary, to facilitate it by all the means that art can ſuggeſt.</p>
                     <p>BLEEDING piles are of ſervice; a white, reddiſh, or ſometimes a browniſh ſediment
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015100_0022_0F95D329EAF71988"/>
in the urine is a favourable ſymptom: to encourage its continuance, the ſick muſt drink plentifully.</p>
                     <p>IF in the progreſs of the diſtemper, after the ſymptoms grow milder, the excrements are yellow, and bilious, it is a good ſign; but at the beginning it affords but a bad prognoſtic.</p>
                     <p>IN general this diſeaſe is carried off by expectoration, eſpecially if the excretions are plentiful and diminiſh the pleuritic pain, and above all, if they are ripe and reſemble pus. Sometimes they are glewy, tenacious, and ſanguineous; but there is nothing to fear from them, if the pain abates, the fever diminiſhes, and reſpiration becomes more free. Be cautious, however, not to repeat the bleeding, which, under theſe circumſtances, muſt be prejudicial. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the excretions are yellowiſh, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſtreaks of blood, and this alſo is a favourable ſign.</p>
                     <p>LASTLY, it may be laid down as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule, that expectoration is to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a happy ſymptom; whenever the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are thrown off with eaſe, they diminiſh the pain and fever, and render the reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eaſier.</p>
                     <p>IN ſuch a ſtate of the expectoration, the mixture No. 13. muſt be laid aſide, and the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015100_0023_0F95D32AAB442430"/>
linctus No. 14. ſubſtituted in its place; two ſpoonfuls of which are to be given once in an hour, and leiſurely ſwallowed, with a cup of the decoction No. 1, warm after it.</p>
                     <p>IF the expectoration does not continue, but ſuddenly ſtops, and there comes on a rattling in the breaſt, attended with anxiety, the danger is very great; bliſters on the legs muſt be applied immediately, the powder No. 15. be given every four hours, and the warm decoction No. 1. ſweetened with a little honey, be drank plentifully, till the ſpitting comes on again, and the breaſt is relieved.</p>
                     <p>THERE comes on ſometimes, but not often, a painful ſwelling behind the ears, or on the thighs, which pain is followed by a diminution of that of the breaſt: in this caſe, the immediate uſe of the cataplaſm No. 8. or ſuch like, is neceſſary, to ripen the ſwelling, which is to be opened with a lancet, as ſoon as it comes to a head, and be dreſſed afterwards as an ulcer.</p>
                     <p>THE violence of the diſtemper may be ſo great, that the moſt efficacious remedies are inſufficient to overcome it, and to expel the morbific matter. In this caſe, ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is always dangerous, comes on, and moſt commonly the illneſs degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into a conſumption, unleſs means be
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015100_0024_0F95D32B6AC55358"/>
found to evacuate the already formed pus.</p>
                     <p>THAT this is the ſtate of the caſe, may be known by the following ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p>THE pain is ſtubborn, and yet leſs violent than at the beginning: it is attended with a dry cough, or with unripe excretions; there is a continual quickneſs of the pulſe, which encreaſes towards night, or when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the patient takes any nouriſhment; the cheeks and lips become red; he has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſhiverings and night-ſweats; the urine is frothy and pale, and he ſoon becomes extremely weak and lean. The abſceſs, formed in the lungs, is ſometimes evacuated by excretions; when they begin to appear, and are purulent, the infuſion No. 16. ſweetened with a little honey, is to be given every hour: broths, in which freſh chervil, lettuce, and parſley roots, are boiled, may ſerve for nouriſhment; and for drink, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley water, with a fourth part of new milk, both to be continued till the purulent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is quite evacuated.</p>
                     <p>BUT this does not always happen; the pus is often formed in a bag; and in that caſe it muſt be attempted to draw out this collection of matter.</p>
                     <p>A SMALL plaiſter applied, and made to ſtick cloſely to the moſt painful place, will be very proper in the beginning of the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015100_0025_0F95D32C31C9ED08"/>
becauſe if the Pleuriſy ſhould dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into an abſceſs, the collection of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will point towards that place.</p>
                     <p>WHEN an Abſceſs is known to be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the ſigns that have been deſcribed, the marked place is to be corroded by a light cauſtic; and when open, care muſt be taken to keep up the ſuppuration. In ſuch a caſe, there is reaſon to hope, as the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is the leaſt at this place, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter collected will take its courſe, and be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by it; for theſe collections are often lodged between the Pleura and the adjacent parts.</p>
                     <p>FOR the ſame reaſon, a ſeton on the ſpot is ſucceſsfully uſed; and the pus has often been ſeen to diſcharge through ſuch a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage procured by art.</p>
                     <p>IF the matter contained in the abſceſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be drawn to the external parts, it will occaſion a ſwelling of the Pleura towards the cavity of the breaſt; whereby the lungs will be oppreſſed, the anxiety daily increaſe, the Pleura burſt, all the ſymptoms ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappear, but come on again ſoon, and the pus fall into the cavity of the breaſt.</p>
                     <p>UNDER theſe circumſtances, no other method can be uſed but the Paracentheſis, to diſcharge the breaſt from the pus there lodged, and prevent a mortal conſumption.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="unknown:015100_0026_0F95D32CEB5F7848"/>DURING this laſt trial; the uſe of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine No. 16. is to be continued. If, during the courſe of the diſtemper, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient can get no ſleep, a pint of the emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion No. 17. is to be adminiſtered, to which may occaſionally be added an ounce of the ſyrup of white poppies, or more if neceſſary.</p>

                     <head>PERIPNEUMONY.</head>
                     <p>THIS Diſtemper is, properly ſpeaking, an inflammation of the lungs: it is dangerous, and even more ſo than the Pleuriſy itſelf, which ſometimes degenerates into a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ripneumony, when the patient is forced, by exceſs of pain, to keep in his breath.</p>
                     <p>A DIFFICULTY of breathing, the load and oppreſſion of the breaſt, and an acute and continual Fever, indicate a Peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. In this diſtemper the patient feels no pain; or if he does complain of any, it is of ſuch a dull one as diſtinguiſhes the Peripneumony from the Pleuriſy; which laſt, in inſpiration, gives the patient a very acute pain.</p>
                     <p>THE pulſe is not ſo hard in the diſeaſe we are now deſcribing, as in the Pleuriſy and other inflammatory diſtempers; but, on the contrary, it generally found much ſofter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="unknown:015100_0027_0F95D32DADDC5758"/>IF the Peripneumony is violent, there immediately comes on a great weakneſs, the pulſe becomes ſmall, ſoft, unequal; the reſpiration is ſhort, frequent, difficult, and accompanied with a continual cough; the patient cannot lie down for fear of ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is obliged to ſit upright in his bed; his face, eyes, tongue, and lips, become red and inflamed: theſe ſymptoms are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by an inſupportable anxiety, and ſoon after by a delirium, and death.</p>
                     <p>ALL the ſigns, therefore, that we have recited, give us a very bad prognoſtic.</p>
                     <p>A GREATER hardneſs in the pulſe, a leſs difficulty in breathing, more eaſe in lying down, leſs redneſs and ſwelling in the face, the eyes, and the lips, are, on the contrary, favourable ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p>THIS diſtemper requires immediate help, for very ſoon it brings the patient into evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent danger.</p>
                     <p>YOU muſt begin by a large bleeding in the arm, and repeat it in the ſame manner as in a Pleuriſy, if the anxiety and difficulty of breathing do not diminiſh. If the blood, when drawn, remains fluid and thin, and ſcarce coagulates at all, and if after the bleeding the reſpiration is not freer, it is a bad ſign, which indicates, that the thicker parts are retained in the lungs, and the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015100_0028_0F95D32E6B74B9B0"/>
thinner only diſcharged. In this caſe, a freſh bleeding would produce no effect, and only evacuate that part of the blood which is leaſt thick, and could ſtill have made its way thro' the lungs.</p>
                     <p>SOME hours after the bleeding, it will be proper to give the glyſter No. 11. Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ointments, and plaiſters, may be applied to the breaſt, but it muſt not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that theſe ſort of things will be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with as good ſucceſs as in the Pleuriſy.</p>
                     <p>It will be better to apply frequently to the patient's mouth and noſtrils, a linen or ſponge ſoaked in warm water, the vapours of which may, together with the air, enter by inſpiration into the lungs.</p>
                     <p>THE diet ought, as in the Pleuriſy, to be extremely light, and the broths ſtill thinner.</p>
                     <p>Let the common drink be the decoction No. 1. or barley-water; but inſtead of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing milk with it, add to each pint half an ounce of pure honey.</p>
                     <p>WHILE the patient is awake, let him take every half hour a ſpoonful of No. 13. and drink after it a warm cup of the decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion No. 1.</p>
                     <p>IF, on the uſe of theſe medicines, the anxiety diminiſhes, the reſpiration becomes freer, the Fever leſs violent, the pulſe more vigorous and equal, the tongue moiſt, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015100_0029_0F95D32F2D02F6E8"/>
every part of the body, even to the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, of an equal heat; if, above all, the ſkin is moiſt and ſoft, we may hope for the beſt, and nothing more is required than a continuance of the ſame means, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the lungs is beginning to be reſolved, and gradually to decline.</p>
                     <p>BUT things ſeldom take this turn, unleſs the diſtemper is not violent, the ſolid parts are ſupple, and relief has been applied from the beginning. It oftner happens, that the matter of this Diſeaſe is evacuated by expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration.</p>
                     <p>The ſpitting muſt, therefore, be carefully attended to; and it is a very bad ſign, when at the ſame time the patient does not expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torate at all, and has a difficulty to breathe, with a rattling in his throat. The ſpittings are good, if diſcharged ſpeedily, copiouſly, and eaſily. They ſhould be of a proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; ſometimes they appear yellow, and ſtreaked with a little blood; which ought to give no uneaſineſs, for excretions of this ſort are always good, and grow white in time.</p>
                     <p>THE effect they produce is remarkable, by the diminution of anxiety, the freedom of reſpiration, and the alteration in the pulſe, which grows ſtronger and fuller.</p>
                     <p>LET the patient, at that time, take two
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015100_0030_0F95D32FEC0E1380"/>
tea-ſpoonfuls of the linctus No. 14. and after ſwallowing them ſoftly, drink a cup of the warm decoction No. 1.</p>
                     <p>NOTHING more is to be done under theſe circumſtances; and bleeding, purging, or exciting ſweats, would be detrimental.</p>
                     <p>WE ought chiefly to guard againſt the cold air, and cold drinks, for either the one or the other will ſtop the expectoration, and thereby throw the patient into imminent danger.</p>
                     <p>IF a ſuppreſſion of the ſpitting ſhould happen, and the anxiety be followed by the rattling of the throat, bliſters are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the legs, the powder No. 15. is to be given every four hours, and the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction No. 1. be uſed as was ordered for the Pleuriſy. The patient is alſo to inſpire by the mouth and noſtrils the vapour of warm water.</p>
                     <p>It ſometimes happens, that, during the courſe of the diſtemper, the patient voids by ſtool a yellow and bilious matter, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by it. This is alſo a favourable ſign, as has been obſerved, in ſpeaking of the Pleuriſy.</p>
                     <p>A LARGE and thick ſediment in the urine, at firſt red, afterwards turning white, is likewiſe a good ſymptom. When this happens, the patient muſt drink plentifully
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015100_0031_0F95D330AE2E8668"/>
as in the Pleuriſy. Nevertheleſs, it rarely happens that the cauſe of the evil is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged merely by urine; the ſpitting, which generally comes on about the ſame time, contributes greatly to the entire cure.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the patient, by the means of theſe evacuations, begins to find his breaſt diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, he may have his broth ſomewhat ſtronger; but he ſhould conſtantly take but little at a time and often, that the lungs may not afreſh be overcharged by a chyle, both too crude and too copious. Sometimes a plentiful bleeding of the noſe gives relief to the patient; but this ſeldom happens.</p>
                     <p>IF none of the evacuations here deſcribed are obſerved within the ſpace of a fortnight, if the Fever continues pretty ſtrong, and the Cough dry; if the heat extends to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the body; if the pulſe is quick, ſoft, and wavering; if a difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhiverings accompany theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; if the cheeks and lips are red, the thirſt great, and, laſtly, the Fever ſtronger towards night, it is certain that the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is turning to an Abſceſs.</p>
                     <p>THE indications of an Abſceſs already formed in the lungs, beſides the ſymptoms already deſcribed, are as follow: A dry continual obſtinate cough, which increaſes when the ſick moves, or takes any nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015100_0032_0F95D3316D2DF2D0"/>
he can only lie on the affected ſide, without its being poſſible for him to lie on the other; he has periodically a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Fever, which augments whenever he eats, drinks, or ſtirs, and is attended with a redneſs of the lips and cheeks; he has no appetite, but a violent thirſt, and complains of night-ſweats, eſpecially of the head, and the upper part of the breaſt; the urine is ſpumous, he is greatly emaciated, and extremely weak.</p>
                     <p>WHILE the Abſceſs remains whole, the purulent tumor increaſes more and more; it preſſes upon thoſe parts of the lungs which as yet are found; it obſtructs the reſpiration, and, after the moſt terrible anxieties, ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the patient.</p>
                     <p>IT is therefore eſſential, that the Abſceſs ſhould break, and be maturated, in order that the pus be evacuated. But it may happen to break in ſuch a manner, as to diſperſe the matter into the breaſt, and occaſion an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyema, which almoſt always proves mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. This is known to be the caſe, by the ſudden diminution of all the ſymptoms, ſometimes attended with ſlight faintings, and the total ſuppreſſion of purulent ſpittings. It is becauſe the Abſceſs is in effect burſt, that the ſymptoms proceeding from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the purulent bag immediately
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:015100_0033_0F95D3322C629C20"/>
ceaſe; but the matter ſpread in the cavity of the breaſt, growing every day more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and more acrid, ſoon occaſions new ſymptoms, worſe than the preceding ones.</p>
                     <p>THE Paracentheſis is the only means of help leſt; but as the ulcer has already cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded the ſubſtance of the lungs, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs will be very doubtful: and even tho' the pus is evacuated, the ſick perſon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dies after the operation.</p>
                     <p>MUCH more is it to be wiſhed, that the Abſceſs may break in ſuch a manner, as to let the pus fall into the bronchi or air veſſels of the lungs, that ſo it may be evacuated by ſpitting.</p>
                     <p>WHEN this happens, it is to be feared, leſt the bronchi be totally filled and ſtopped by the quantity of pus ſpreading itſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and all at once, and occaſioning thereby a ſuffocation: but if the pus that falls in theſe veſſels can ſtill be diſcharged, the patient often recovers, tho' the purulent conſumption is always to be apprehended.</p>
                     <p>THE following are the principal, ſuccours which art has found out to forward the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Abſceſs into the bronchi, and the evacuation of the pus by expectoration.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the ſymptoms of an Abſceſs, as deſcribed above, are perceived, let the ſick inſpire continually by the mouth and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015100_0034_0F95D332EDC15548"/>
noſtrils the vapour of warm water, to ſoften and relax the parts.</p>
                     <p>LET him take fatter broth, and in larger quantity than before, that the ſtomach being filled, the deſcent of the diaphragm may be more difficult, and the Abſceſs more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. The patient muſt be excited to cough, by applying warm vinegar to his noſtrils, or to cry with a loud voice. This may procure a chance of breaking the Abſceſs, which, if the ſtrength of the ſick perſon can bear it, may be ſtill forwarded by giving him an airing in a carriage, on a rough road, where he may be well ſhook.</p>
                     <p>AS it is impoſſible to know exactly the moment when the Abſceſs will break, you muſt repeat, from time to time, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts here deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>IF, when the Abſceſs is broke, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions are purulent, white, and ſmooth; if the fever diſappears, or diminiſhes conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably; if the appetite returns, the thirſt ceaſes, and, laſtly, the excrements are ſolid and natural, there is reaſon to hope that the ſick will recover.</p>
                     <p>IF, on the contrary, the excretions are ſtained of different colours, with a bad ſmell; if the fever doth not ceaſe, or, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceaſed, returns again; if the thirſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015100_0035_0F95D333AA703260"/>
and the appetite doth not increaſe, it is to be feared the patient will ſink under it.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the Abſceſs of the lungs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges itſelf by means of purulent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, a little rice, or oats boiled in milk, affords an excellent nouriſhment; but care muſt be taken, that the ſick take not too much at once, but little and often.</p>
                     <p>THE infuſion No. 15. with a third part milk and a little honey, will be a proper drink. He is to take thrice a day the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der No. 18. and as the lungs have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued by a continual cough during the day, ſome relaxation ought to be procured in the night; wherefore let the patient take two pills No. 19.</p>
                     <p>IF he is ſomewhat coſtive, it is not amiſs, but if he remains ſo ſeveral days, the glyſter No. 11. is to be given. If the excretions diminiſh little by little, appetite comes on, ſtrength increaſes, and the patient gets rid of his fever, a quick cure may be expected.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the excretions are conſiderably leſſened, the powder No. 18. and infuſion No. 16. are no more to be uſed; inſtead of which, three ſmall ſpoonfuls of the linctus No. 20. and after it three cups of the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion No. 21. may be taken thrice a-day.</p>
                     <p>IF, notwithſtanding this, the cough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015100_0036_0F95D3346AE049B0"/>
ſtronger towards night, the patient may continue to take the pills No. 19. which otherwiſe are alſo to be leſt off.</p>
                     <p>IF, after the Abſceſs in the lungs hath begun to be evacuated by excretion, this evacuation ſhould ſuddenly ſtop, an extreme anxiety ſucceeds, together with a rattling in the breaſt, and the ſick is in very imminent danger. This accident is commonly cauſed by the imprudent admiſſion of cold air, or by ſome violent emotion of the mind, as anger, fear, or ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>A SPEEDY relief muſt be given, by cauſing the patient to inſpire the vapour of warm water, both by the mouth and noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trils, making him drink freely of the warm infuſion No. 16. and giving him every four hours the powder No. 13. until the breaſt be diſengaged, and expectoration comes on again; after which the uſe of the powder is to be diſcontinued.</p>
                     <p>IT will be of ſervice to apply bliſters to the calves of the legs, as has been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Pleuriſy.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the purulent matter is reſorbed by the veins, it ſometimes occaſions a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den depoſit of matter in other parts of the body, and there cauſes an abſceſs, viz. about the ears, the arms, or thighs. The load of the breaſt ceaſes at the ſame time; and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015100_0037_0F95D3361F9F3318"/>
the ſame remedies are to be uſed, and the ſame rules obſerved, as in the caſe of an Abſceſs after a Pleuriſy.</p>
                     <p>AS the inflammations of the external parts may degenerate into ſchirrous hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the ſame accident is to be feared in inflammations of the internal parts: for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Peripneumony, there ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the lungs a ſchirrous and callous hardneſs, in which caſe there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always an adheſion to the Pleura. Reſpiration continues in that caſe difficult for the reſt of life, attended with a little cough, chiefly after meals, and after exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; and there is no appearance of any of the indications of an Abſceſs we have been deſcribing. This accident can rarely be got the better of; and the little relief that may be afforded is ſcarce to be expected in a military life, unleſs it be for the cavalry, by riding on horſeback.</p>
                     <p>LASTLY, if the Peripneumony be ſo violent, that the remedies have no effect, gangrene and death are the conſequence. This is foreſeen, when the patient labours with intolerable anxiety, falling into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and ſudden faintneſſes, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, feeble, and very quick pulſe, and the excretions without conſiſtence, ſtinking and black. All theſe ſigns indicate a ſpeedy and inevitable death.</p>

                     <head>RHEUMATISM, and RHEUMATIC PAINS.</head>
                     <p>THE general cauſe of the Rheumatiſm is the ſudden expoſition of the body to the cold after being conſiderably heated, either by work or the weather; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if a perſon, being overcome by the heat, throws off his cloaths, and reſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a damp and cold place,</p>
                     <p>THE ſoldier is moſt frequently liable to this diſorder, when heated by fatigue, and expoſed to rain, he is obliged to wear his wet cloaths, without changing them.</p>
                     <p>THE cold nights, which in Spring and Autumn ſucceed very warm days, are alſo a cauſe of the Rheumatiſm. This diſtemper begins with an univerſal ſhivering, followed by heat, thirſt, uneaſineſs and fever. After a day or two, and even ſometimes ſooner, the patient feels a ſharp pain, not confined to one place, but moving from one limb to another, viz. at the wriſts, the ſhoulders, the knees; and ſo different parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are in this manner ſucceſsfully affected; and the articulations, that are attacked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come red and ſwelled.</p>
                     <p>SOMETIMES, in this diſorder, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous expanſions covering the muſcles are
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:015100_0039_0F95D3376DCF2C40"/>
attacked, and occaſion an exceſſive pain off the leaſt motion of the part affected. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Fever ceaſes in a few days, though the pain continues. In general, it is a very troubleſome diſorder, eſpecially when it attacks the loins, as the ſick is then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a ſupine poſture, without motion, and, as it were, like a log. It often paſſes from the loins to the hips, or upper joints of the thighs; where, if it remains long fixed, the cure becomes very difficult.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the pain ſuddenly and often changes from place to place, it is to be feared that the cauſe of the illneſs will be drove inwardly, and attack the lungs or brain, which would be attended with the greateſt danger. This accident is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by a delirium, or a violent oppreſſion of the breaſt, ſucceeding a ceſſation of pain in the extremities.</p>
                     <p>THIS diſeaſe is ſeldom mortal; but the violence of the pains, and their continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon an improper treatment, induce us to employ quick and efficacious reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. When the diſorder is neglected, it often happens, that the articulations are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of motion, and there remains for life an incurable ſtiffneſs of the joint. <hi>(Anchyloſis.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE method of treatment is as follows,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="41" facs="unknown:015100_0040_0F95D3382C74B4F0"/>TAKE ten ounces of blood from the arm of the affected ſide.</p>
                     <p>LET flannels, imbibed in the warm fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation No. 12. be conſtantly applied to the part in pain.</p>
                     <p>THE diet ought to be light, conſiſting of ſmall broth, with decoctions of barley, oats, or rice, and with roaſted apples.</p>
                     <p>FOR common drink, uſe the decoction No. 1. or barley-water with a fourth part milk.</p>
                     <p>Two ſpoonfuls of the mixture No. 22. with a cupfull of the infuſion No. 23. warm, may be given every hour, unleſs the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be aſleep.</p>
                     <p>THE following day let him have the glyſter No. 11. and conſtantly continue the medicines No. 22. and 23.</p>
                     <p>IF the pain does not give way, and the Fever continues, the bleeding is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the next day, the fomentation No. 12. and the medicines No. 22. and 23. are to be continued; after which, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning, let the patient take the purge No. 6. omitting during this day the uſe of No. 22. and 23. and taking at night the anodyne draught No. 24. Let him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards continue two days longer the uſe of No. 22. and 23. and on the third day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:015100_0041_0F95D338F1143968"/>
the purge No. 6. and at night the draught No. 24.</p>
                     <p>BY this method, we commonly get the better of this diſorder. If a good deal of a brick coloured ſediment appears in the urine, attended with a general breathing ſweat, it is a good ſign.</p>
                     <p>IT will then be ſufficient to compleat the cure, to keep the patient warm in bed, and make him take the decoction No. 23.</p>
                     <p>BUT if, after the uſe of theſe remedies, the pain ſtill continues, and the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected grows red, leeches are to be applied upon it.</p>
                     <p>SOMETIMES the Fever ceaſes, the patient appears recovered, but the pain ſtill roves from one joint to another: in this caſe, let the patient take half a drachm of Venice ſoap made into pills, morning, noon, and night, drinking after it ſix ounces of the infuſion No 23. made warm. He muſt be kept from the cold, and the articulations lightly rubbed with a piece of dry flannel.</p>
                     <p>IT happens likewiſe ſometimes, that the patient, tho' otherwiſe recovered, has a fixed pain leſt about the articulation of the hip. Apply in that caſe a bliſter, about the ſize of a crown piece, upon the part for twelve hours, then take it off, and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:015100_0042_0F95D339AB073E58"/>
pierce the bladder it has raiſed, that the lymph amaſſed may flow out, and cure the wound by means of the plaiſter, called <hi>empl. allum coctum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>EIGHT days after the place where the bliſter was applied is healed, apply another, and proceed as before, and if the pain is then not entirely vaniſhed, this operation may be repeated four times. Obſerve, when you take off the bliſter, only to pierce the veſicle, and not take the epidermis, for the place thus made bare, would be extremely painful, and without any advance towards the cure.</p>
                     <p>THOSE who have ſuffered of this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Autumn, muſt take care, during the following winter, not to expoſe themſelves to the cold, and the injuries of the ſeaſon, for they would certainly have a relapſe.</p>
                     <p>WHEN by the pain continuing long fixed in the ſame place, the affected articulation begins to ſtiffen, let the part be twice a day held over the ſteam of hot water, then well wiped with hot linen, lightly rubbed, and anointed with <hi>ung. altheae.</hi>

                     <head>INTERMITTING FEVERS.</head>
                     <p>A FEVER is known by a quickneſs of the pulſe, uſually attended with laſſitude, languor, weakneſs, thirſt, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p>WHEN after a fit of ſeveral hours, it ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diminiſhes, with all its ſymptoms, and at laſt abſolutely ceaſes, but in ſuch a manner as to return again, it is called an Intermitting Fever.</p>
                     <p>THIS Fever has different appellations, according to the length of the interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſits.</p>
                     <p>IF it returns every day, it is called a Quotidian; if there is a day between each fit, it is called a Tertian; if the return is after two days free, it is named a Quartan.</p>
                     <p>THE Intermitting Fever comes on with gaping, laſſitude, debility, colds, ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, tremblings, paleneſs of the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, anxieties, ſickneſs, and ſometimes vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting. The pulſe is feeble and ſmall and the thirſt pretty great. Heat ſucceeds af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome time; it inſenſibly augments till it becomes extreme. The body then grows red, the anxiety diminiſhes, the pulſe is fuller and ſtronger, the thirſt exceſſive, and the patient complains of a violent headach,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:015100_0044_0F95D33B2CF5BC30"/>
and pain in all his limbs; laſtly, a general ſweat ſucceeds; all the deſcribed ſymptoms diminiſh, and the patient often falls into a ſleep, after which he wakes without Fever, his pulſe is natural, and there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but laſſitude, and weakneſs. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times during the hot fit of the Fever; bilious matters are thrown up with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of relief.</p>
                     <p>THE urine after the Fever, or during the ſweat, is reddiſh and frothy; and as ſoon as it is cold, there appears on the top a peli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, adhering to the ſides of the veſſel, at the bottom of which is depoſed a ſediment, in colour reſembling pounded brick or bole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac.</p>
                     <p>THIS appearance is, however, ſeldom obſerved in any other but autumnal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent fevers, and it is more ſo after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral paroxyſms. In the ſpring Intermittents, the urine is commonly leſs red, and rather yellowiſh, a cloud forms in the middle, and it depoſes a white ſediment, which is a good ſymptom.</p>
                     <p>OF the two ſpecies of Intermitting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers we have juſt mentioned, the vernal ones are eaſier cured than the autumnal ones, which are attended with more troubleſome ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p>THE Intermittents which prevail from
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:015100_0045_0F95D33BEEC027A8"/>
February to July, are called Vernal; and thoſe that begin in the latter end of July, or beginning of Auguſt, and ceaſe at the end of January, or ſometimes ſooner, are called Autumnal Intermittents.</p>
                     <p>AFTER the long and violent heats of the ſummer, if the troops have been much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued, there will be many Autumnal Fevers, and of the moſt dangerous kind, eſpecially if the military operations require camping in marſhy places.</p>
                     <p>IN September and October the number of theſe Fevers is commonly very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but there is great hope to ſee that number diminiſh at the fall of the leaf, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if the winds blow any thing hard.</p>
                     <p>AS there is a great difference between the Spring and Autumn Fevers, and as the method of treating them often differ much, we ſhall treat ſeparately of each.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>SPRING INTERMITTENTS.</head>
                     <p>SPRING Intermittents are generally Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, very often of a kindly ſort; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times double Tertians, but ſeldomer than in Autumn.</p>
                     <p>WE call that Fever a double Tertian, where a freſh paroxyſm comes on every
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:015100_0046_0F95D33CACE6F6F0"/>
day, but the fit is generally ſlighter on the alternate days.</p>
                     <p>DURING the paroxyſm, it will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to take a large quantity of any dilut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liquor, made agreeable to the palate, but always warm, ſince cold draughts would be hurtful.</p>
                     <p>THE patient may therefore drink of the ptiſan No. 25. keeping himſelf quiet and in a moderate degree of heat.</p>
                     <p>THE fit moſt commonly goes off by an univerſal ſweat, which muſt be kept up by warm drink, but ought not to be rendered exceſſive by too much covering, or other means that provoke heat.</p>
                     <p>JUST at this time, viz. on the going off of the fit, or as ſoon as it is over, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt have a meſs of broth with ſome lemon juice, or cream of tartar in it, to make it acid.</p>
                     <p>THE intermediate days that are free from Fever, he may take food ſomewhat more ſolid, viz. a little meat, provided the fleſh be of young animals: beef will not hurt, ſo it be but tender, but all ſorts of fat are to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>NOTHING is to be eat near the time that the return of the paroxyſm is expected; the nouriſhment then taken would load the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:015100_0047_0F95D33D6B82D6F8"/>
during the fit, and cauſe a bad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</p>
                     <p>FOUR hours, however, before the fit, the patient may take ſome light broth. As in ſpring Agues, the paroxyſms commonly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the time they ſhould return at, regard muſt be had thereto in the taking of nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>IF the day the patient is without Fever be ſerene, it will be proper for him to uſe a little exerciſe; but not to laſſitude; he ought likewiſe to endeavour to ſleep rather more than uſual.</p>
                     <p>IT is to be remarked, that thoſe ſpring Agues often turn to inflammatory diſorders, eſpecially in young and ſanguine ſubjects: bleeding is therefore proper, eſpecially if the ſick have a redneſs in the face, a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent head-ach, or feel ſome pain on the ſide of the breaſt.</p>
                     <p>IF attended with frequent flatulent erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if the tongue is charged, a bitter taſte in the mouth, or a light vertigo, it will be proper to give him an emetic.</p>
                     <p>LET him take four hours before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the fit the powder No. 26. or No. 27. if of a weaker conſtitution, as ſoon as he ſhall have vomited, let him drink warm water plentifully; he will ſoon throw it up, and vomit afreſh; he then muſt repeat his
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:015100_0048_0F95D33E2E21D080"/>
drinking, and go on in this manner till what is to be thrown off his ſtomach, be diluted, and his vomiting made eaſy.</p>
                     <p>AFTER vomiting ſeveral times, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drank commonly ſtays one hour: after the vomiting hath ceaſed, let the patient have the potion No. 24. and ſo wait for the paroxyſm, during which let him take the ptiſan No. 25. obſerving the rules before laid down.</p>
                     <p>IF he complains of pains croſs his back, of grumbling or wind in his bowels, if his belly is ſwelled or hard, he muſt be purged in the following manner.</p>
                     <p>EIGHT hours before the return of the fit, let him take the purge No. 28. and ſix hours after he hath taken it, that is, two hours before the fit, give him the draught No. 24.</p>
                     <p>IF the ſymptoms, that gave occaſion to the purge, or the vomit, continue, theſe remedies may be repeated, which however is but ſeldom the caſe in ſpring Fevers.</p>
                     <p>OBSERVE, that ſometimes emetics do not evacuate only by vomit, but by ſtool alſo, and that purges act likewiſe ſometimes by vomit. There is nothing to be feared when this happens, ſince the only object of theſe remedies is to evacuate the ſtomach and inteſtines. After the bowels are thus
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:015100_0049_0F95D33EEDC6A4A8"/>
cleanſed, let the patient take every two hours a ſpoonful of the mixture No. 29. drinking after it a cup of camomile flower tea. This remedy muſt not be uſed in the paroxyſm, but only whilſt the patient is without Fever, nor ſhould he be waked to take it.</p>
                     <p>THIS is the method of treating Spring Fevers: and there is ſeldom a neceſſity for uſing the bark.</p>
                     <p>IF after the third or fourth paroxyſm, ulcerated puſtules break out about the noſe or lips, it is a good ſign, and the fever quickly ceaſes: but this is not ſo ſure in Autumnal Fevers.</p>
                     <p>IT ſometimes happens, tho' rarely, that after ſeven or eight fits, the Spring Fever does not ceaſe, nor even conſiderably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, and that, on the contrary, the fit become longer and ſtronger. This is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the caſe, where the patients are ſubject to ſweat copiouſly, as ſoon as they are in bed. Here the bark becomes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                     <p>LET him take every three hours while the Fever is off, one of the powders No. 30. in ſome wine.</p>
                     <p>THIS method will ſoon complete the cure; and as in the ſpring the weather grows better every day, there is but little fear of a relapſe.</p>

                     <head>AUTUMNAL INTERMITTENTS.</head>
                     <p>THESE Fevers are more obſtinate than thoſe in the ſpring; and of theſe the worſt ſort happen commonly after a very hot ſummer.</p>
                     <p>THEY are alſo harder to be known; for when they firſt begin, the fits are ſo long, and the returns ſo frequent, that they ſeem continued Fevers, with little or no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
                     <p>SOMETIMES the Fever abates a little, and then returns in a few hours, after a light ſhivering. It is only when it begins to give way its character is firſt known; it then appears that the diſorder is a true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent. Theſe Fevers, which at firſt appear to be continued, often degenerate into Quartans.</p>
                     <p>SOMETIMES theſe Fevers, which in the beginning did intermit, after long and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled paroxyſms, are changed into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous continued Fevers.</p>
                     <p>THESE Fevers are always bilious; the ſtomach and inteſtines are filled with putrid matter, which muſt be diſcharged without delay; to poſtpone it would be detrimental.</p>
                     <p>LET the patient take the emetic No. 26. or 27, having regard, on this occaſion, to
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:015100_0051_0F95D340707BC610"/>
what has been ſaid on the ſubject of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Spring Fevers.</p>
                     <p>IF the ſkin of the face is tight and red, the eyes inflamed, and the heat great and general throughout the body, a bleeding muſt precede the vomit.</p>
                     <p>ON the contrary, if the face is ſhrunk and pale, and the pulſe not full, bleeding would hurt, and muſt be refrained from.</p>
                     <p>THE vomit muſt be given in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Fever; or if it does not ceaſe entirely, that inſtant is to be choſen when it is leaſt violent.</p>
                     <p>SOMETIMES alſo, in an Autumnal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is neceſſary to repeat the vomit, that is, when the nauſeous ſickneſs, the bitter taſte of the mouth, and the foulneſs of the tongue, continue.</p>
                     <p>THE day the patient takes no vomit, let him drink the decoction No. 25. adding an ounce of the oxymel No. 31. to every pint of the decoction.</p>
                     <p>AFTER the firſt or ſecond vomit, the powder No. 32. is to be taken every four hours.</p>
                     <p>THIS method will commonly ſucceed in theſe Fevers; and if before, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, they will become intermittent, ſo that there will be a conſiderable interval from one paroxyſm to another, let the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:015100_0052_0F95D3412A91C808"/>
then take the mixture No. 29. follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the directions given under the head of Spring Intermittent.</p>
                     <p>THE food ſhould likewiſe be the ſame as in theſe Fevers; broths made pleaſant with juice of lemon, or cream of tartar, roaſted apples or pears, and well fermented bread, ought to be the principal nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When he begins to recover a little more ſtrength, you may add ſome fleſh meat, either veal or lamb: a little wine taken moderately to recruit his ſtrength will do no harm.</p>
                     <p>BUT as in Autumn the days are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually growing colder, the recovering pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt guard with care againſt the incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the weather, otherwiſe a relapſe is much to be feared.</p>
                     <p>LET him alſo for a fortnight, on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, take the quantity of a nutmeg of the electuary No. 33. in the morning faſting, an hour before dinner, and an hour after ſupper.</p>
                     <p>WHEN he has been a month without fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, give him the pills No. 34. in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſting; repeat them a ſecond time in eight days, and a third time in eight days more.</p>
                     <p>IF, after the uſe of the emetic, and other remedies here deſcribed, the fever ſhould
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:015100_0053_0F95D342E2C2CDC0"/>
ſtill continue, without any diminution of the paroxyſms, and if the patient grows weaker, the uſe of the bark becomes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: this happens more frequently in Autumnal, than in Spring fevers.</p>
                     <p>THE powders No. 30. muſt then be made uſe of, as in Spring fevers, and in a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night be again repeated.</p>
                     <p>IF the eyes grow yellow, the ſick feel great anxiety at the orifice of the ſtomach, and the urine is icterical, you muſt then (unleſs the extreme weakneſs of the patient forbid) leave off the uſe of the bark during the ſpace of a fortnight; inſtead of which, for ſome days give him two ſpoonfuls of the mixture No. 35. every three hours, till theſe ſymptoms are abated: the fever will return; but during this interval, the ſick having recovered ſtrength, will better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, and it ſoon will abſolutely leave him.</p>
                     <p>IF the uſe of the bark in this caſe was obſtinately purſued, it would bring on ſome chronical and obſtinate diſorder. It muſt be obſerved, that when the fever has been driven away by the bark, the pills No. 34. are not to be made uſe of, for commonly they bring it on again.</p>
                     <p>IT ſometimes happens, that theſe fevers are from the beginning attended with the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:015100_0054_0F95D3436ADE9FE8"/>
worſt of ſymptoms, an unequal pulſe, a cadaverous countenance, frequent faintneſs, and cold ſweats. In ſome ſubjects, theſe ſymptoms are attended with a cardialgia, or violent pain of the ſtomach, and in others with a ſleepy heavineſs, ſometimes ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found that the patient can ſcarcely be waked.</p>
                     <p>IN this caſe the bark muſt be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given; for it is to be feared another fit could not be bore. The preſcription No. 30. may be uſed.</p>
                     <p>IF by this means the fever being ſuppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the face becomes of the colour of wax, and anxieties about the orifice of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach are complained of, let the remedy No. 35. be uſed in the manner before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>

                     <p>LET the patient take the emetic No. 26. or 27. before the fit comes on, following the method preſcribed in the Spring Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents.</p>
                     <p>BEFORE the next paroxyſm, give him the purge No. 28. and then the quantity of a nutmeg of the electuary No. 36, which
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:015100_0055_0F95D3442BEF6BD8"/>
he muſt leave off while the fever fit is on him.</p>
                     <p>IF, after eight fits, the fever does not diminiſh, and the patient grows weak, he muſt take the powders of bark No. 30. obſerving what has been before ſaid on that ſubject.</p>
                     <p>EIGHT days after the fever has left him, the ſame powders No. 30. are to be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a third and laſt time at the end of a fortnight, by which means there will be no fear of a relapſe.</p>
                     <p>IN the intermediate days of the paroxyſms, the ſick may be indulged with more wine and a freer nouriſhment, in this ſort of fever, than in any other.</p>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="unknown:015100_0056_0F95D344EADFEBF0"/>THIS illneſs is alſo a common conſequence of bad nouriſhment; and the ſoldier is moſt ſubject to its attacks, when a ſcarcity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions hath obliged him to live on meats of difficult digeſtion.</p>

                     <p>THIS method, followed ſome days, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally renders the body open, and procures relief; but it muſt be continued till the urine recovers its natural colour, and the yellowneſs diſappears from the eyes and the ſkin.</p>

                     <head>THE DROPSY.</head>
                     <p>WHEN the aqueous part of the blood is amaſſed together, and retained in any cavity of the body greater or leſs, this diſeaſe is called a Dropſy.</p>
                     <p>THE denominations of it are different, according to the parts of the body affected.</p>
                     <p>IF the water is detained in the adipoſe membrane, and thereby cauſes a general ſwelling, it is called <hi>Anaſarca.</hi> The ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling generally begins in the inferior parts, and gains inſenſibly the whole body; the eyes are languid, the face and body ſallow, the urine in ſmall quantity, and the patient never ſweats. On preſſing the ſwelled part, it pits. The ſwelled parts, and chiefly the thighs and feet, are always very cold.</p>
                     <p>IT is common enough in the Army for this diſeaſe to ſucceed Intermitting Fevers of long duration, eſpecially in autumn and winter. The ſoldier is alſo ſubject to it, when after having ſuddenly drank a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of cold water, he reſts himſelf in a cold place: it is alſo frequently the conſequence
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:015100_0058_0F95D3466B369B58"/>
of a conſiderable loſs of blood, either from wounds, or bleedings too often repeated.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the Anaſarca comes on after a long Intermittent Fever, evacuations are not extremely neceſſary; but it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured by giving thrice a day, viz. in the morning faſting, one hour before dinner, and one hour before ſupper, two ounces of the prepared wine No. 38.</p>
                     <p>TO finiſh the cure, the patient muſt be kept warm, either by the natural heat of the air, or by an artificial one; he ought to be well covered in the night, keep to dry food, ſuch as meat or fiſh roaſted; his drink ſhould be little and pure, and as much exerciſe be uſed as his ſtrength will admit of.</p>
                     <p>IT will be found uſeful to rub the ſwelled parts with warm flannels, as often as you can. If the patient voids urine in larger quantity, and begins to ſweat in bed, and the ſwelled parts come down, it is a very favourable ſign.</p>
                     <p>AFTER the ſwelling hath diſappeared, there remains ſuch a relaxation in the parts as threaten a relapſe; this may be prevented by cauſing the patient to wear his cloaths ſtraiter than uſual, and rolling his legs and thighs with bandages. Bodily exerciſe in the open air, and warm weather, does infinite good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="unknown:015100_0059_0F95D3472C74B8D8"/>IN this manner generally the Anaſarca that fucceeds Intermittent Fevers is cured happily enough. But when this diſtemper proceeds from other cauſes, it often is more obſtinate, and requires large evacuations of the ſerous humour. Many ways are tried to procure theſe evacuations, but experience ſhews the remedy No. 39. to be ſure and efficacious. The patient is to take a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of this in the morning; or if, as it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does, it brings on a vomiting, only half a ſpoonful. The moſt common effect is, however only a ſimple ſickneſs.</p>
                     <p>THE urine after the uſe of this remedy comes away in large quantity, and affords a conſiderable relief. It ſeldom purges; but if it ſhould, does no harm.</p>
                     <p>THIS medicine is to be taken every day, till all the ſeroſities are evacuated, and the ſwelling of the body entirely come down. If the doſe is not efficacious enough in robuſt conſtitutions, it ſhould be inſenſibly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented till it procures a large diſcharge by urine. When the patient is on the recovery, the ſame regimen muſt be obſerved as has been juſt deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>SOMETIMES the extravaſated lymph is accumulated in the lower belly, and the quantity increaſes ſo much as to cauſe it to ſwell exceſſively. When ſo, by preſſing
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:015100_0060_0F95D347EDB67038"/>
with one hand on one ſide of the belly, and ſtriking on the other with the other hand, the fluctuation is felt, and water is found to abound.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the diſtemper is recent, it is cured often enough only by the uſe of the remedy No. 39. but if the flux of urine does not come on in ſome days, nor the ſwelling of the belly diminiſh, haſte muſt be made to draw off the water by the punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The operation is ſafe, and ſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; but if attempted when the diſeaſe is more inveterate, it is leſs efficacious.</p>
                     <p>IT will be proper, as much as poſſible, to draw off all the water all together at once; which may be done ſafely, by ſtraiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the patient's belly with a bandage, by little and little, and more and more, as the water runs off: the faintings and other accidents will, by this means, be avoided.</p>
                     <p>AFTER the evacuation procured by the puncture, the belly muſt be bound tight with rollers, and the patient obſerve the diet we have deſcribed above.</p>
                     <p>THE uſe of the remedy No. 38. will be very proper here. Sometimes the belly ſwells again, and the puncture is then to be repeated.</p>
                     <p>AS it ſometimes, though but rarely, happens, that the ſwelling of the belly is
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:015100_0061_0F95D348ADB43DB8"/>
cauſed only by wind, and not at all by a collection of lymph, the moſt ſcrupulous attention muſt be uſed in obſerving what the caſe is, becauſe in this laſt the punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſcarce ever of uſe, and, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, generally accelerates death.</p>
                     <p>THIS laſt diſeaſe is called <hi>Tympanites,</hi> or Dropſy of the Belly.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. GENERALLY the belly is not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively ſwelled as in the Dropſy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. THE belly appears elevated before, and depreſſed on the lateral parts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d. WHEN the belly is ſtruck, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of water is not felt, but it gives a ſound ſomewhat reſembling that of a drum.</p>
                     <p n="4">4th. Tho' the ſick lie on either of his ſides, the form of the belly remains the ſame, the ſkin of which is white, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and elaſtic.</p>
                     <p n="5">5th. COSTIVENESS, and gripings about the navel, often precede this diſtemper.</p>
                     <p n="6">6th. THE body of the patient is lighter than in a Dropſy of the Belly, where the collection of water conſiderably augments the weight.</p>
                     <p>UPON the whole, this diſtemper is more dangerous than the other, and is often mortal.</p>
                     <p>THE cure may be attempted in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner. Let the patient's belly be
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:015100_0062_0F95D3496C317230"/>
rubbed with flannel, for a quarter of an hour at a time, twice a day; and after each friction, let it be anointed with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niment No. 40. and for ſeveral days let him at night take the powder No. 41.</p>
                     <p>If the wind begin to paſs by the anus, and the belly grows leſs, there is room to hope a cure.</p>
                     <p>It happens ſometimes, that the lymph collects in the cavity of the breaſt; and it has been often obſerved, that ſoldiers are ſubject to this kind of Dropſy, when, after having been heated by work, and all in a ſweat, they ſuddenly expoſe themſelves to the cold, and greedily drink cold water.</p>
                     <p>This diſeaſe is known by the preceding cauſes, by the difficulty of breathing, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the patient begins to ſleep, and by a dry cough; he cannot lie down, but is obliged to fit up in his bed, his body bent forwards, and has commonly his feet ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the beginning of this diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved, that the breaſt is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſengaged when the ſwellings of the legs and thighs become very conſiderable; and that, on the contrary, the bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more oppreſſed, when this ſwelling ſuddenly diſappears.</p>
                     <p>This ſort of Dropſy, eſpecially if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:015100_0063_0F95D34A2CE80478"/>
is often ſucceſsfully cured by the uſe of the remedy No. 39.</p>
                     <p>If this does not anſwer, nothing remains but the puncture; but we find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that this is but a doubtful means, and not always attended with ſucceſs.</p>

                     <p>The ſureſt remedy, in this caſe, is to cauſe a large quantity of warm water to be drank, to render the vomiting and evacuation of ſoul matter eaſier.</p>

                     <p>IT is a ſudden and immoderate evacuation of the humours, both upwards and downwards.</p>
                     <p>THO' this may happen, at all times of the year, in conſequence of overcharging the ſtomach, and a crapula; yet it is moſt frequent towards the end of the ſummer, and beginning of the autumn.

                     <p>THE thirſt is commonly violent, the anxiety great, the pulſe quick, ſmall, and often unequal. The patient has cold ſweats; his face is wan and cadaverous, and his extremities cold.</p>

                     <p>As the Diarrhoea ſometimes ſerves for the evacuation of bad humours, it follows, that it is not always hurtful, and that it may even be advantageous.</p>
                     <p>It is of ſervice when it does not affect the ſtrength, but, on the contrary, renders the body more light and alert. On the other hand, it is hurtful when it brings on langour and weakneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Diarrhoea, that at firſt appeared ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, may become detrimental, by its too long duration, viz. if it laſts four or five days; for then the body is worn out by too long a flux, the inteſtines excoriate, a lively pain of the lower belly, with

                     <p>A DIARRHOEA too long neglected often, degenerates into a Dyſentery.</p>
                     <p>BUT it moſt commonly happens, that it is not preceded by that diſorder; and in the army it reigns during the heat of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the beginning of autumn.</p>
                     <p>A FLUX of the belly, attended with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gripings, and very painful ſtrainings for ſtool, is called a Dyſentery.</p>

                        <pb n="69" facs="unknown:015100_0068_0F95D34DEC37D6E8"/>THE ſtools are not always accompanied with blood, as ſeveral phyſicians have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, who therefore have called this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order <hi>the bloody flux.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>NEVERTHELESS, the foecal matters are often reddiſh and bloody, eſpecially if the diſorder has laſted any time.</p>
                     <p>THIS diſtemper chiefly prevails among the troops. The cauſes that produce it are as follow:</p>
                     <p>THE bile grown acrid by the great heats and the fatigues of war; eſpecially if the ſoldier, when heated, ſuddenly expoſes himſelf to cold air, or ſleeps in his cloaths, ſoaked with rain: for which reaſon it is often brief in places, where cold nights ſucceed to hot days.</p>
                     <p>STAGNATING, or marſh water for common drink.</p>
                     <p>MEAT, or fiſh, beginning to be tainted, muſty bread, or bread made of muſty corn for food.</p>
                     <p>SURE and reiterated obſervations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that ſummer fruits ſcarce ever cauſe the Dyſentery; but the exceſs of them may do hurt.</p>
                     <p>THIS diſtemper proceeding from the cauſes juſt deſcribed, ſoon infects a whole army: the healthy ſoldiers are more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially infected by the putrid exhalations of
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:015100_0069_0F95D34EAE0D2F40"/>
the foecal matters, if they uſe the ſame bog-houſes as the ſick.</p>
                     <p>THIS point muſt therefore be carefully attended to, when the Dyſentery prevails among the troops: it would be proper to dig deep trenches to ſerve for neceſſaries for the ſick ſoldiers, to cover ſeveral times in a day the foecal matters with earth, and to have other trenches reſerved altogether for thoſe in health.</p>
                     <p>TO change the camp often would alſo be a proper means to ſtop the progreſs of this diſorder; and by what has been ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the cauſes, it will appear neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to take all poſſible care to avoid them.</p>
                     <p>THE manner of treating the Dyſentery is as follows:</p>
                     <p>IF the ſick is of a ſanguine habit, and has great heat all over his body, or much Fever, he muſt loſe eight or ten ounces of blood from the arm; but theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are rarely met with.</p>
                     <p>AS the Dyſentery is ſeldom attended with a Fever, and then bleeding is of no uſe, it will be ſufficient to give the patient the powder No. 46. in wine.</p>
                     <p>AFTER the firſt vomiting occaſioned by the powder, he muſt drink warm water with a little honey in it; this will excite freſh vomiting; after which he is ſtill to
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:015100_0070_0F95D34F6A7896D0"/>
be plied with warm water till he brings it up as clear as he drank it.</p>
                     <p>AFTER the patient ſhall have reſted two hours from his laſt vomiting, you may give him ſome ſmall ſlices of toaſted bread, ſoaked in four ounces of cold wine; and to make it pleaſant, a little cinnamon and ſugar may be added. At night let him take the pill No. 47.</p>
                     <p>THE ſame remedies are to be repeated next day; and if the diſorder is not entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or much abated, the third day again.</p>
                     <p>BUT if the diſtemper is conſiderably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed, it will be proper to leave a day's interval between the uſe of theſe remedies, before they are given a third time.</p>
                     <p>EXPERIENCE has ſhown, that inſtead of the powder No. 46. that No. 48. with the pill No. 47. at night, has been given with good ſucceſs. This muſt alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated three times, leaving the interval of one day, except the Dyſentery ſhould ſtop ſooner. If the remedy No. 48. be too weak for robuſt conſtitutions, the doſe may be increaſed to ten or twelve grains. After theſe evacuations, the patient may, for ſeveral days, take at morning, noon, and night, one drachm of the electuary No. 49.</p>
                     <p>HIS drink muſt be two parts in three of barley or millet water, and one of new milk; and this is to be uſed in large quantities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="unknown:015100_0071_0F95D3502BDCBAB0"/>FOR food, milk thickened with barley, oats, millet or rice, may be given; and when the exceſſive ſtench of the ſtools is ſomewhat abated, meat broth thickened with the ſame pulſes.</p>
                     <p>BUT if the malignity or duration of the diſtemper ſhould have, in a manner, anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated the ſtrength of the patient, evacuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing medicines muſt be laid aſide, as he is already but too weak.</p>
                     <p>THIS is known to be the caſe, by the violence of the gripings and ſtrainings, by the vacillating ſmall pulſe, by the pale countenance, by the nauſeating all food, and by an unextinguiſhable thirſt.</p>
                     <p>LET the patient take every hour one ounce of the medicated wine No. 50. and night and morning the pill No. 47.</p>
                     <p>AS the bad ſymptoms begin to diſappear, and ſtrength to come again, let the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der No. 44. be taken in the morning, and in the evening, the Pill No. 47. to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated thrice, with one day's interval, if the diſorder be not over ſooner.</p>
                     <p>FOR ſome days after, let the patient take one drachm of the electuary No. 49. thrice a day.</p>
                     <p>SOMETIMES the inteſtines having been excoriated, by the frequent paſſage of acrid matters, the patient is very much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded with a continual inclination to go
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:015100_0072_0F95D350E9AEAF50"/>
to ſtool, tho' he avoids little or nothing: in this ſituation he is to have the glyſter No. 51. and to retain it as long as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>IF, after the evacuations, there ſhould remain ſuch like pains in the lower belly, the patient would receive great relief, by ſwallowing, every day, an egg boiled ſoft, with a little freſh butter.</p>

                     <head>INFLAMMATION of the INTESTINES.</head>
                     <p>AN INFLAMMATION of the INTES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINES, a very dangerous diſtemper, often ariſes from the ſame cauſes as a Dyſentery.</p>
                     <p>IT is diſcovered by a violent pain of the lower belly, which often increaſes upon the touch; by the ſwelling of the belly, by vomitings, and by conſtipation. Theſe ſymptoms are attended, at the ſame time, with an acute and continual Fever, and a violent heat: the pulſe is hard, the urine clear, and of a bright red, and there is a ſudden proſtration of ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>IF the ſymptoms are violent, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly death is ſoon the conſequence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the patient expires, the pain ceaſes; but the extremities become cold and livid, the face cadaverous, the pulſe ſmall, quick,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:015100_0073_0F95D352A143E650"/>
and unequal. All theſe are ſigns of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death; altho' the ſick, and thoſe about him, are apt to draw an happy omen from the ceſſation of pain.</p>
                     <p>COPIOUS bleeding is immediately to be had recourſe to, and repeated boldly if the pains do not go off, or remit conſiderably; or if they return again.</p>
                     <p>LET the patient take the glyſter No. 52. three or four times in a day.</p>
                     <p>HIS belly muſt be conſtantly fomented with flannels ſteeped in the fomentation No. 12.</p>
                     <p>THE caul of an animal freſh killed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times produces a good effect.</p>
                     <p>LET the patient take every half hour a warm cup of No. 53.</p>
                     <p>IT is a good ſign if the pulſe becomes equal, and remains ſo, if the pain dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, the ſick break wind downward, and the glyſter bring away with it foecal matter.</p>
                     <p>SOMETIMES, notwithſtanding ſeveral glyſters, the belly remains obſtinately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipated: in this caſe the fumes of tobacco injected thro' the anus have produced very good effects.</p>
                     <p>THE drink is to be warm barley water, and light broths the whole nouriſhment,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:015100_0074_0F95D3532A5D0820"/>
until three days after the diſorder ſhall have entirely ceaſed.</p>
                     <p>AND even then it will be neceſſary to obſerve an exact diet for ſome time, leſt the Inteſtines, irritated anew by acrid food, occaſion a relapſe.</p>
                     <p>THIS diſtemper is indeed ſo violent, that if it does not quickly give way to proper application, it degenerates immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mortal gangrene. But, by the careful uſe of the above recited remedies, one may hope to reſolve the Inflammation of the Inteſtines.</p>
                     <p>IF this method has begun to be uſed too late, if the diſtemper laſts, without grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſe, three or four days, and a dead pain ſucceeds to the acute pain of the lower belly; if at the ſame time the patient feels an unuſual heavineſs, and has wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhiverings all over his body, it is certain there is an Abſceſs forming.</p>
                     <p>IN which caſe he muſt have the fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation No. 12. conſtantly applied on his belly during the day, and at night a plaiſter of labdanum.</p>
                     <p>IF the Abſceſs ſeems to be ready to pierce externally, which may be if the Inteſtines adhere to the peritoneum, it muſt be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcharge the pus. But this caſe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="unknown:015100_0075_0F95D353EB4773D8"/>IF the Abſceſs breaks in the cavity of the lower belly, the conſequence is much to be feared, unleſs the matter can be drawn off directly, which is very difficult to be done: nor is it eaſy to judge of the exiſtence of this caſe, becauſe the quantity of matter from out of this Abſceſs is not conſiderable enough to cauſe any remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſwelling of the belly.</p>
                     <p>THE pus is more frequently evacuated by the anus: the glyſter No. 52. repeated ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, after ſuppuration is perfected, facilitates its courſe. By the ſmoothing of the internal coat of the inteſtines the evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the matter becomes eaſier that way.</p>
                     <p>AFTER the pus is evacuated, whether alone or with the excrements, the patient muſt drink plentifully of the decoction No. 16. ſweetened with honey, and is to take the powder No. 18. three times a day.</p>
                     <p>LET endive, lettice, chervil, or ſuch like tender herbs, be boiled in broth for his food; but it muſt be ſtrained thro'a ſieve, leſt any thick ſubſtances ſhould col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect into a maſs in the inteſtines.</p>
                     <p>LET him continue this method for three days after the pus ſhall have ceaſed paſſing thro' the anus; and by degrees he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his former way of living.</p>

                     <head>PHRENZY.</head>
                     <p>A PHRENZY is a continued delirium, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with an acute Fever. It is thereby diſtinguiſhed from the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, which is ſometimes obſerved in the height of Intermitting Fevers, and which finiſhes with the fit.</p>
                     <p>AN extreme heat, and a violent inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory head-ach, commonly precede the Phrenzy: the eyes and face are red; the patients, when aſked queſtions, anſwer with ferocity; they pluck the knap of their cover-lids.</p>
                     <p>THE more frequent cauſes of this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are, the violent heat of the ſun, to which the ſoldier is expoſed, eſpecially if bare headed, ſleeping in that condition, long watches, extreme emotions of anger, exceſs of wine, brandy, or other ſpirituous liquors.</p>
                     <p>IN this diſtemper the pulſe commonly is quick, and reſpiration ſtrong, and not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>
                     <p>A Phrenzy is very dangerous, and often occaſions ſudden death, for it is a true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the meninges, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even of the brain itſelf.</p>
                     <p>GREENISH vomitings, frequent ſpitting, ſhiverings, crude aqueous and pale urine,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:015100_0077_0F95D35570D70958"/>
convulſions, and no thirſt, are bad ſigns: bleeding piles, a flux of the belly, a copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous haemorrhage of the noſe, give relief to the patient.</p>
                     <p>PAIN of the breaſt, or of the lower parts, is good in this illneſs: a ſtrong cough coming on, ſometimes alſo gives eaſe.</p>
                     <p>BLEEDING here is eſſentially neceſſary: it ſhould be large, and chiefly in the foot: if the Fever and heat continue, it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated: and it will be right, after the firſt bleeding of the foot, to open one of the jugulars.</p>
                     <p>THE bleedings muſt be repeated, till the extreme heat and the violence of the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium are abated. While the patient does not ſleep, he muſt take every hour a cup of the remedy No. 54. warm.</p>
                     <p>FOR his common drink, the decoction No. 25. may be uſed, and night and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glyſter No. 11. be given.</p>
                     <p>IF the haemorrhoids ſwell, let leeches be applied.</p>
                     <p>IT will be proper to ſhave the patient's head, and to make him rinſe his mouth often with warm water: let a compreſs dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in oxycrate, or vinegar, and water, in equal quantities, be applied on his forehead: freſh and temperate air is moſt proper for him, and he ought to be kept ſitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:015100_0078_0F95D3562C26DF28"/>
in his bed, with his head raiſed as much as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>IT would be alſo proper to make him riſe twice a day, to ſet him in an arm chair, and bathe his feet in warm water. After the night bathing, the paſte No. 55. ſhould be applied to the ſoles of his feet, and lie on till morning.</p>
                     <p>DURING the whole time of the illneſs, he muſt be confined to plain barley water, or water gruel.</p>
                     <p>IF, after the uſe of theſe remedies, the Fever begins ſenſibly to grow leſs, and the Delirium to wear off, but the patient can get no ſleep, let him have the emulſion No. 17. at night, with the addition of an ounce and a half of ſyrup of white poppies.</p>
                     <p>BUT anodynes muſt be carefully avoided, while the illneſs continues in its force.</p>
                     <p>AT the beginning of this dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, all the remedies here recited muſt be vigorouſly employed: but when the heat and Delirium are conſiderably dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, bleeding and glyſters are no longer neceſſary, the drink No. 25. will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and the nouriſhment may be a little ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the diminution of the ſymptoms, it happens often enough, that the Delirium does not entirely give way:
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:015100_0079_0F95D356EDA6E3C0"/>
but commonly it decreaſes inſenſibly, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if ſeveral times a day, and as much as his ſtrength will permit, the patient is made to ſit up in an arm chair with his body upright,</p>

                     <p>AS Bleeding of the Noſe is a pretty common ſymptom in ardent Fevers, almoſt always giving relief, and ſometimes even curing the diſtemper, it is eaſily apprehended, that it muſt not be too lightly ſtopped.</p>
                     <p>BUT ſometimes the Bleeding of the Noſe is ſo violent, both in ſick perſons, and in thoſe who are in health, that bodily ſtrength is ſo waſted, as to bring on total faintings, ſo that even death may enſue.</p>
                     <p>IN this caſe, the too violent Haemorrhage muſt be ſtopped. To judge when this ought to be done, requires a little attention to the following conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>WHILE the pulſe keeps full, and the heat of the body is every where equal, even to the extremities, and the lips and the face keep their red colour, there is no fear from the Haemorrhage, was it even violent.</p>

                     <p>THE means of ſtopping it are, applying bandages to the arms and thighs of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, becauſe the veins being thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the reflux of the blood to the heart is in leſs quantity. The Haemorrhage ſtopped, the bandages are not to be looſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all at once, but ſucceſſively one after another, in ſuch a manner as to leave the ſpace of a quarter of an hour between the looſening of each bandage.</p>

                     <p>A FEVER, that laſts from the moment of the firſt acceſs, without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the end of the diſeaſe, is called a continued Fever.</p>
                     <p>THE principal cauſes of Fevers of this ſort in an Army, are, exceſſive fatigue, and extreme laſſitude, which is its conſequence, eſpecially during the heat of ſummer, if the ſoldier is under the neceſſity of endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thirſt, or drink too much ſpiritous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors.</p>
                     <p>FOR the moſt fluid and lighteſt parts of the blood being by theſe means loſt; what remains, grown more thick and acrid, is in a ſtate to occaſion great diſorders, and above all inflammatory ones, becauſe the maſs of humours ſo thickened is now greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to inflammation.</p>
                     <p>WHEN a Fever of this ſort produces a topical inflammation, the diſeaſe takes its
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:015100_0082_0F95D3592B3E9268"/>
name from the part affected: for the Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy, Peripneumony, Phrenzy, ſore Throat, (<hi>Quinzy,</hi>) Inflammation of the inteſtines, are often preceded, and always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a continued Fever.</p>
                     <p>BUT when it happens that ſome of the above recited cauſes occaſion this Fever, and that it affects no part in particular, it is called ſimply a Continued Fever.</p>
                     <p>THIS Fever is known by the cauſes that precede it, by the vigour of the time of life, and a hot and ſanguine conſtitution, by a hard and quick pulſe, and chiefly by its extreme heat, which burns, as it were, the fingers of him who touches it. The urine is red, thick, turbid, the tongue dry, the thirſt great; often an intolerable pain of the head, and an obſtructed reſpiration.</p>
                     <p>THIS diſeaſe, always dangerous, is more or leſs ſo according to the violence of the deſcribed ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p>LARGE bleedings are neceſſary in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which are to be repeated till the great heat and dryneſs of the tongue begins to abate. Barley water is the common and proper drink; but to every pint ſhould be added an ounce of the remedy No. 31. of which let him take largely; let there be given him every two hours a cup of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:015100_0083_0F95D359EC1AAE10"/>
No. 54. and twice a day the glyſter No. 11.</p>
                     <p>THIS method is to be continued till the decline of the diſtemper, which is known by the diminution of heat, of the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the pulſe, and of thirſt; by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of the mouth and tongue, by the urine being not ſo high coloured, and by the ſediment it then depoſes. The ſame regimen to be obſerved as in the Pleuriſy.</p>
                     <p>AS the diſeaſe grows milder, the decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion No. 25. will be ſufficient for common drink, and let the diet be gradually aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented till he is quite well.</p>
                     <p>IT is highly neceſſary to obſerve, that there is alſo another ſort of Continued Fever, without an inflammatory thickneſs of the blood, but rather occaſioned by a putrid diſſolution of the humours. This laſt ſort is much worſe, and more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than the other, and very often this Fever proves contagious.</p>
                     <p>THIS happens moſt frequently, when, during the great heats, the Army is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped in marſhy places; for then they reſpire an air corrupted with bad effluvia. This ſort of Fever prevails alſo very much, where many men, even were they healthy, are lodged together in a narrow ſpace, where the air cannot be renewed
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:015100_0084_0F95D35AABF0DB08"/>
often enough. Ships of war and hoſpitals, where the ſick and wounded are much ſtraitened, are frequently viſited by theſe Fevers, eſpecially if the air cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed often enough; becauſe the air then to be reſpired is ſo corrupted by the effluvia from the bodies, the ſtink of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the putridneſs of the gangrened parts, that it engenders a very bad, and truly putrid Fever, which ſoon grows con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious. It is therefore ſometimes called the Jail or Hoſpital Fever. Its particular ſymptoms ſhould be exactly deſcribed, thereby to know this diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>IT begins by a ſhivering, followed by a heat, but not violent; ſoon after, the ſhivering again, after which the heat, and ſo the ſhiverings and heat alternately.</p>
                     <p>TOTAL loſs of appetite, ſleep diſturbed, and without refreſhment, a heavy pain of the head, affecting eſpecially the anterior part: the pulſe is almoſt as in a natural ſtate: the ſkin is not always very dry: the ſick languiſh on in this manner ſome days, without being able to attend their buſineſs, yet without being obliged to keep their bed. The tongue is ſeldom dry; it is more commonly ſoft, moiſt, and covered with a ſort of cruſt of yellowiſh green. The patient dozes much, ſleeps little, and ſeems quite abſorbed in profound reveries;
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:015100_0085_0F95D35B6CE9F878"/>
in the progreſs of the illneſs, comes on a trembling of the hands, hardneſs of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dimneſs of ſight; the pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to grow feeble, and the patient is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of cordials and wine. Towards night, all the ſymptoms grow worſe: laſtly, at different times during the courſe of this diſtemper, there appear purple ſpots of an irregular figure.</p>
                     <p>THE following ſymptoms are conſidered as mortal: A ſudden proſtration of ſtrength, weakneſs of the ſight: the poſture of the ſick, ſtretched on his back, and drawing up his knees to him; reiterated efforts to get out of bed, black aphthae, livid pete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiae, and ſtripes alſo livid, reſembling the blow of a whip ſpread over the body; the flux of the belly, with lead coloured or blackiſh ſtools, weaken the patient more and more.</p>
                     <p>DEAFNESS is not a bad ſymptom in this diſtemper. Nay, it has been obſerved, that patients on their recovery are apt to grow deaf, and that ſometimes they have an Abſceſs in the conduit of the ear.</p>
                     <p>BILIOUS ſtools, thick urine, a moiſt tongue, are good omens, eſpecially if the patient keep up his ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>A NUMBER of little red puſtules, or white and elevated miliary ones, are good,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:015100_0086_0F95D35C2D3E5DF0"/>
if at the ſame time expectoration is eaſy, and the urine depoſes a thick ſediment. Laſtly, it is counted a good ſign, when an eaſy ſweat comes on, and relieves the patient, or the parotids ſwell, or there appear white ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thae.</p>
                     <p>AS the cauſes here recited indicate that all things tend to putrefaction, and that the ſtrength is extremely exhauſted, bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can ſeldom be of uſe, unleſs in replete habits, and that but once: for large bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings abate the ſtrength immediately, and occaſion a Delirium. It is very neceſſary that the air be often renewed.</p>
                     <p>In caſe of a nauſea, or weight felt about the region of the ſtomach, or that the tongue be covered with a yellowiſh green cruſt, the patient muſt take the emetic No. 27. and after the firſt effect of this powder, let him drink plentifully of warm water, that he may vomit eaſy, which is to be repeated, as has been ſaid in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Intermittents.</p>
                     <p>THE evening after the emetic, let the patient take the bolus No. 58. and drink after it ſix ounces of the whey No. 59. If milk cannot be procured, the decoction No. 25. may be ſubſtituted in its room, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to add two ounces of wine, and half an ounce of oxymel, to every pin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. This whey,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:015100_0087_0F95D35CED1A8A10"/>
or decoction, may ſerve for common drink, eſpecially as the ſick are fond of vinous and comforting drinks, and that theſe drinks are ſuitable to this diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>LET him take every ſix hours the powder No. 60. with ſix ounces of the above whey, or decoction.</p>
                     <p>DEATH, preceded by great anxiety and convulſions, is often the conſequence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme languors, when the purples diſappear, or the miliary ſpots ſtrike in: in which caſe a ſpoonful of the mixture No. 61. is to be immediately given, with three ounces of the whey or decoction No. 25. to be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every three hours till he finds eaſe, and the purples appear again, or the miliary ſpots riſe; after which the ſame remedies are to be continued every four hours only. If, in conſequence of this method, an equal breathing ſweat comes on through the whole body, the patient finds great eaſe thereby. If the belly is conſtipated, let the glyſter No. 52. be given.</p>
                     <p>It is proper to diſcharge the patients from out of the hoſpital, as ſoon as they begin to recover, that they may breathe a purer air; otherwiſe a relapſe is much to be feared, which is ſeldom or never got over.</p>

                     <head>THE SCURVY</head>
                     <p>THIS is a common diſtemper, and of difficult cure, more eſpecially in ſieges and unhealthy places, where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the troops are obliged to take up their winter-quarters.</p>
                     <p>IT begins by a numbneſs of the limbs, with an unuſual laſſitude of the whole body: after walking, the limbs and muſcles feel quite fatigued, and, as it were, broken. In the increaſe of the diſtemper, reſpiration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſhort and difficult; ſometimes the thighs ſwell; at firſt the face is pale, then grows brown, and the ſkin is ſtained with ſpots of different colours, the mouth begins to ſmell, the teeth looſen in the ſockets, the gums ſwell, itch, grow painful, and bleed on the leaſt touch; laſtly, wandering pains affect different parts of the body.</p>
                     <p>IN the progreſs of the diſtemper, the gums putrify and exhale an horrid ſtench; the teeth grow yellow, then black and calious. Sometimes happen violent haemorrhages; very bad conditioned ulcers break out, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the thighs; the patient feels vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and painful ſhootings in all his limbs, which increaſe in the night, and the body is covered with black ſpots. At this period
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:015100_0089_0F95D35E6972D700"/>
the diſtemper ſuddenly grows worſe, Fevers come on of different kinds, every thing grows quickly putrid, and mortal haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhages break out of the mouth, the noſe, or about the anus; the viſcera putrify; and faintings ſucceed, which are ſoon followed by death.</p>
                     <p>THIS diſtemper is frequent in winter quarters, from the following cauſes.</p>
                     <p>NOISOME vapours, ariſing from marſhy, grounds and ſtagnating waters, inaction, ſcarcity of greens and vegetables, drinking of corrupted and ſtagnating waters, the uſe of ſalted and ſmoaked fleſh and fiſh, and of cheeſe too old and acrid; damp and low lodgings, and not being open to the courſe of the winds.</p>
                     <p>FEAR and ſorrow alſo occaſion this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, and increaſe it in thoſe already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with it. By that, and by bad food, it often makes ſuch ravages in beſieged places.</p>
                     <p>EXPERIENCE ſhows, that the humours in this diſeaſe are not only putrid and acrimonius, but alſo condenſed.</p>
                     <p>THEREFORE, in the cure, care muſt be taken to attenuate the viſcoſity of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and to prevent or correct putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>WE, are to lend all the aſſiſtance of art
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:015100_0090_0F95D360234F8148"/>
to prevent, or avoid the cauſes of this evil, and thereby preſerve the ſoldier from the ravages of this diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>FIRST, by correcting the impure waters. This is done by mixing two ounces of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and two ounces of brandy, to every pot of water. For want of theſe, ſome ſlices of calamus aromaticus may be ſteeped in the water. This is a ſort of reed, very common, growing almoſt every where, in ſuch low, marſhy, and damp grounds, as are moſt ſubject to the Scurvy.</p>
                     <p>STRONG purges, vomits, and bleeding, do no ſervice in this diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>BUT as bad nouriſhment is one cauſe that produces the ſcurvy, the ſtomach and inteſtines muſt be cleared, and evacuated, which is eaſily done, by gentle and reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated purges, ſuch as No. 34. to be taken three times, with the interval of a day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each.</p>
                     <p>THE food ſhould be broth, with chervil, ſorrel, ſpinage, lettice, endive, ſuccory, cabbage, eſpecially red cabbage, young nettle buds and tops, or any other ſort of tender herbage, boiled in it; the preference to be given to thoſe eaſieſt to come at.</p>
                     <p>FRUIT quite ripe, uſed moderately, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways produces a good effect: but if neither fruit nor greens can be procured, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:015100_0091_0F95D360AA7D6D18"/>
muſt have his broth with barley, oats, or rice; he may eat likewiſe a little veal, or fowl, but it muſt be moderately.</p>
                     <p>AFTER the uſe of light purgatives, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorbutics will be proper, but which are to be varied according to the different conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the patient.</p>
                     <p>IF he feels himſelf cold, his face pale, his legs ſwell, and his thirſt is not great, let him take two ounces, that is, about a tea-cup of the decoction No. 62. thrice a day.</p>
                     <p>IF he is hot, his pulſe feveriſh, his thirſt great, his breath bad, his gums bleeding and half putrid, the decoction No. 62 is not ſo proper as No. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. to the quantity of three ounces thrice a day.</p>
                     <p>RIPE fruits, and roaſted apples and pears, eaſy to be procured, are alſo very proper.</p>
                     <p>THE remedies are to be continued a great while. When the limbs move eaſier, and the pain diminiſhes, the diſtemper grows better, and then exerciſe and good food will be ſufficient to compleat the cure. To carry of all relicks, it will be proper, on recovery, to take fifty drops of the elixir No. 64. in wine and water, equal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities thrice a-day.</p>
                     <p>ALTHO' it be certain, that when the diſtemper is at an end, the ſymptoms
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:015100_0092_0F95D3616C92C828"/>
ought likewiſe to ceaſe; yet it is no leſs true, that after the ſcurvy, we often ſee thoſe who have been attacked by it ſubject to ulcers of the gums, lips, inſide of the cheeks, and of the palate, which ſoon ſpread, and corrode theſe parts, and in a little time turn to a gangrene. Theſe ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers often deceive thoſe who do not rightly underſtand them: they appear in form of white or yellowiſh ſpots, red, and inflamed round the border, and often very painful. A great ſtench accompanies them, and the ſpittle, which comes in plenty, is alſo of a bad ſmell. This evil requires an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate remedy, otherwiſe all would ſoon be infected with a gangrenous putrid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, the teeth would fall out of the ſockets, the jaws would be affected, and entirely corrupted.</p>
                     <p>BUT this diſorder is eaſily got the better of, by touching the parts lightly and often in the day with a little lint dipped in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration No. 65. Little compreſſes, imbued with the ſame, may alſo be applied between the gums and lip, and renewed from time to time.</p>
                     <p>CARE muſt be taken not to rub the parts affected too much, as is the bad cuſtom of ſome, for the evil and pain is thereby aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>

                        <pb n="94" facs="unknown:015100_0093_0F95D3622AA7B938"/>IF the ſtench is great, and the ulcers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelves rapidly, the quantity of ſpirit of ſea ſalt is to be augmented, till you get the better of the gangrenous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>

                     <p>AS mention has been made of the gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grane, it may be here proper to take notice, that the bark taken internally is a moſt efficacious remedy for this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, whatſoever part is attacked.</p>
                     <p>THE patient is to take every four hours one of the powders No. 30. till the gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene begins to ſeperate from the ſound parts, and a good ſuppuration comes on: at which time it will be ſufficient for him to take them twice a-day till the ulcer is mundified.</p>
                     <p>THE bark is equally proper, when the ſcorbutic ulcers of the inſide of the mouth threaten to gangrene.</p>

                     <head>LUES VENEREA.</head>
                     <p>VENEREAL diſorders are always cauſed by contact, communicated by the infected to, even, the ſoundeſt bodies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="unknown:015100_0094_0F95D362ED56B080"/>THIS contagion produces many different diſorders, which, according to the different parts of the body where it fixes, go under different denominations.</p>
                     <p>SMALL ulcers appearing at the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the penis, or on the prepuce, are called venereal ſhancres: if the nervous papillae of the genital parts form little eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions like warts, they are called venereal verrucae: if the internal ſuperficies of the urethra is affected, there ariſes a difficulty and pain in making water, named a ſtrangury, and a running of a yellowiſh, greeniſh, or ſometimes browniſh matter; it is then called a gonorrhoea; if ſwellings in the groins, buboes.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the virus having gained the blood circulates with the humours, where-ever it ſtops, it produces evils of different kinds, for inſtance, puſtules, and ſpots upon the ſkin, that ſometimes degenerate into filthy cruſts: ulcers in the adipoſe membrane, not giving way in the leaſt to ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as are proper in other ulcers; which corroding the adjacent parts, leave pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and frightful cicatrices: theſe ulcers no ſooner diſappear from one place, but they quickly ſhow themſelves again in ſome neighbouring part.</p>
                     <p>THE throat moſt frequently, and the
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:015100_0095_0F95D363A9BCAD58"/>
roof of the mouth, are corroded little by little by this diſtemper: there appears in theſe parts a ſpot, reſembling bacon; the voice becomes hoarſe, the action of ſwallowing is attended with pain, and the ſpot we ſpoke of gaining ground by little and little, deſtroys all the ſoft parts, and at length attacks the bones of the palate and mouth; which grow rotten and fall in, and leave for the reſt of life a deformity, for which there can be no remedy.</p>
                     <p>THIS diſtemper, eſpecially if it is inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, attacks alſo the bones, and cauſes ſwellings on them, which if loſt, are called tophi or gummi; if hard, nodes or vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real exoſtoſes; whence enſue very bad ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with intolerable pain, worſe in the night, the warmth of the bed increaſing it; but rather eaſier in the day.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the bones are corroded even to the marrow, the cure is extremely difficult, and tho' cured in appearance, it often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns.</p>
                     <p>THIS diſtemper may be eaſily known by the deſcribed ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p>THE following is a ſafe method of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                     <p>LET the patient take, night and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one ſpoonful of the medicine No. 66. drinking after it a pint of barley water with
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:015100_0096_0F95D3646B48F690"/>
a third of milk in it, uſing the ſame for his common drink: if milk is difficult to get, the decoction No. 67. may be ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in its room.</p>
                     <p>THIS medicine gives no manner of trouble to the patients; to ſome it procures ſome light ſtools, but this ſeldom; in others it works by urine and ſweat. Its uſe may be continued with the greateſt ſafety till all the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe have abſolutely diſappeared.</p>
                     <p>IF the weather is mild and temperate, the patient may go out; but in cold and damp weather, it is better he ſhould keep his room.</p>
                     <p>IF the medicine ſeems to act too ſlow in robuſt habits, or when the diſtemper is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate, the doſe may be augmented to a ſpoonful and a half: and if in ſome days the ſymptoms do not diminiſh, two ſpoonfuls may be given every night and morning, in all four ſpoonfuls a-day.</p>
                     <p>THE time the patient is to continue the uſe of this medicine, cannot be exactly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited: often, if the diſtemper is not very bad, the cure is performed in three weeks; if inveterate, it takes up more time. But it may certainly be uſed along while without the leaſt inconvenience.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the ulcers cleanſe, and cicatrize,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:015100_0097_0F95D3652C0881B8"/>
when the rotten parts of the bone ſeparate and fall off, and when the tumours and nocturnal pains diminiſh, the diſtemper gives way to the remedy.</p>
                     <p>AS to the regimen of the diet, let the patient have broths with barley, rice, or oats, or tender greens, his fleſh meat lean, milk diet, and ripe fruit.</p>
                     <p>FAT and ſmoaked or ſalted meat, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially bacon, are bad.</p>
                     <p>THE following remark is neceſſary to be attended to. Sometimes a ſalivation comes on from the uſe of this medicine, but this is but ſeldom, and almoſt only to thoſe who have before made uſe of mercury, either internally or externally: nevertheleſs, ſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation not being neceſſary to the cure, the uſe of the medicine No. 66. is to be left off immediately on the firſt ſigns of a ſpitting coming on.</p>
                     <p>BUT the decoction No. 67. may be ſtill continued.</p>
                     <p>THE ſigns of an approaching ſalivation are as follow.</p>
                     <p>THE gums begin to ſwell, to grow red, to itch, and become painful, and the breath to ſmell ill. As ſoon as theſe ſymptoms are remarked, the uſe of the remedy No. 66. muſt, as has been before ſaid, be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended: but if in eight or ten days theſe
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:015100_0098_0F95D365EE2B7540"/>
ſymptoms diſappear, and the patient is not cured, it may again be uſed.</p>
                     <p>IF he has a gonorrhoea, he muſt drink plentifully of the decoction No. 67. to take off the acrimony of the urine; he may bathe the penis thrice a-day, for a quarter of an hour at a time, in equal quantities of water and milk warm.</p>
                     <p>IF, by ſuppreſſion of the gonnorrhoea, or from any other cauſe, a teſticle becomes ſwelled and painful, and the ſcrotum red; let him be bled immediately, the fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion No. 12. applied to the teſticle, and let him drink plentifully of the decoction No. 1. adding twenty grains of nitre to each pint. After the redneſs, ſwelling, and Fever, which often attend ſwelled teſticles, are appeaſed, it will be proper to make uſe of the remedy No. 66.</p>
                     <p>IF venereal buboes grow hard, a plaiſter of galbanum is to be applied.</p>

It is not eaſy in the beginning to diſtinguiſh the Itch, unleſs one is well acquainted with this diſorder: but in its progreſs the puſtules augment both in number and ſize; and when opened by ſcratching, a diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cruſt is formed, and the evil gains the ſuperficies of the whole body.</p>
                     <p>HITHERTO the Itch hath its ſeat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the epidermis and the ſkin; but if it continues long, it makes way through the ſkin into the membrana adipoſa, where it forms ſmall ulcers, commonly in great number. This ſort of Itch is the naſtieſt and worſt, and at the ſame time extremely contagious.</p>
                     <p>IT is to be treated in the following manner.</p>
                     <p>THE body is to be kept clean, and linen often changed: if the ſeaſon of the year per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they muſt bathe, and in waters im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with ſulphur, if they can: if they cannot, experience ſhews, that to bathe

in running water will be of ſervice. The ſhirt, breeches, and ſtockings, are to be ſcented with brimſtone before they are put on: but this ſumigation muſt be made in the open air, leſt the ſulphurous vapours ſhould do hurt, if taken in by reſpiration.</p>
                     <p>LET the patient take the purging powder No. 68. in the morning faſting, and repeat it every eight days.</p>
                     <p>ON the intermediate days, let him take, morning, noon, and night, one of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders No. 69.</p>
                     <p>LET the parts affected be anointed every night with the ointment No. 70.</p>
                     <p>IF the Itch covers both the whole body and all the limbs, they muſt not all be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed together at once; but you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin by the hands, and the arms; continue the next day by the feet, legs, and thighs, and the third day the body; the fourth day to begin again by the hands and arms, the fifth the feet, &amp;c. and ſo on to the entire cure.</p>
                     <p>WHEN the puſtules are dry, the cruſts fall, and the ulcers diſappear and return no more, the patient is well.</p>
                     <p>SOME ſpots will, indeed, remain on the ſkin, but theſe marks wear off inſenſibly, and in time quite diſappear.</p>
                     <p>THE patient muſt abſtain from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſalt food during the cure.</p>

                     <head>WORMS.</head>
                     <p>SOLDIERS are frequently troubled with worms. Bad food, unwholeſome water, and other cauſes engender them. Vertigoes, nauſea, ſudden ſwellings of the lower belly, eſpecially after meals, the heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, grumbling in the bowels, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome itching of the noſe, are indications of Worms. Some have a voracious appetite, others loſe it entirely: the face is pale, and funk.</p>
                     <p>BUT all the ſigns here deſcribed are not all found at the ſame time in each patient; but the more of them are diſcovered, the more certainty we have of the diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>BUT, after all, the moſt convincing ſign is, when the ſick void Worms, by vomit or ſtool.</p>
                     <p>ALL the cure conſiſts in expelling them out of the body, but this is not eaſy; for Worms are found to ſtick, as it were, to the Inteſtines, ſince otherwiſe they would come away with the excrements.</p>
                     <p>IT will, therefore, be proper, in order to get the better of them, for a couple of days to give the patient ſomewhat, that by its ſmell may, in ſome manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

                     <p>LET the patient take five grains of aſa foetida in pills every three hours, for two days.</p>
                     <p>THE third day let him have the purging powder No. 71. in the morning faſting, taking after it a light broth, to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from time to time, till the medicine has done working.</p>
                     <p>IF, after this proceſs, the ſymptoms do not diſappear, in eight days time the whole muſt be repeated.</p>

                     <head>OF WOUNDS OF THE VEINS, ARTERIES, NERVES, AND TENDONS, WITH OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                     <p>IN Wounds of the Veins, the blood flows with a ſmooth even ſtream, of a groſs conſiſtence and dark color; and is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily reſtrained by the common methods, ſuch as dry lint, ſtyptics, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If an Artery is wounded, the blood flows impetuouſly and per ſaltum, and is of a florid color; to ſuppreſs which, if the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice be acceſſible, make a ligature on the Artery with a crooked needle and waxed thread, which is the ſureſt and beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: but the haemorrhage may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the torniquet, till the ligature can be made. If it be not acceſſible, and the Artery runs along the ſide of a bone, apply a ſuitable bandage, compreſſes, or bolſters. It is not neceſſary to compreſs it ſo much as totally to preclude the acceſſion of any blood, but only to impede its efflux, and retain the thrombus, ſo as to grow to the ſides of the divided arterial coats. It requires great judgment, however, not to let the compreſſion be too ſmall, to prevent an Aneuriſm. But if the wounded artery lies within a bone which prevents its late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral compreſſion, the only means remaining is to apply dry lint, and retain it forcibly againſt the divided orifice. Neither ſtyptics nor cauteries ſhould ever be uſed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs an haemorrhage when ligature or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion can take place.</p>
                     <p>If a large Nerve be totally divided, at
<pb facs="unknown:015100_0114_0F95D2F0EE488A90"/>
firſt it cauſes excruciating pain and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by contracting and ſtretching the other branches communicating with it; afterwards the part becomes paralytic, and either fades by an atrophy, or is conſumed by a mortification. For the arteries being no longer able to propel their contained fluids, for want of the Nerves which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their coats, the humors are accumulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtagnate, corrupt, and mortify the part. But if the Nerve (or even a Tendon) be only half divided, there follows a continual and ſlow laceration, a ſpreading inflammation, excruciating pain, fever, delirium, convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, &amp;c. with a gleet, or thick ſerous diſcharge; which ſymptoms are in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more violent as the Nerve is more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended or ſtretched.</p>
                     <p>In order to the cure, if the Nerve lie cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, under the ſkin and membrana adipoſa, dilate the Wound, that the medicaments may penetrate to the part. Dreſs with balſ. peruv. warm (dropped in) a pledget of ſoft digeſtive, and an emollient poultice, with a proper bandage to take off the diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wounds of the Tendons and Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be dreſſed after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, only the applications ſhould be more drying.</p>
                     <p>In the uſe of theſe, if the patient feel the heat of the topics moderate, then they are rightly fitted: if the part itch and ſmart, and the aperture become wider, the topics are ſtronger than they ought to be.</p>

                     <head>OF GUN-SHOT WOUNDS, THEIR NATURE AND TREATMENT, WITH OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                     <p>"GUN-SHOT Wounds, of all others, are more complicate, and much more difficult of cure than an inciſed Wound, even with lots of ſubſtance: becauſe here the fibres and veſſels being lacerated, their juices extravaſated, and their texture deſtroyed, a large digeſtion or ſuppuration is neceſſary to remove the injured parts, before the Wound can be incarned and healed; and hence alſo the ſymptoms of inflammation, pain, &amp;c. are commonly more violent in Contuſed Wounds."</p>
                     <p>"They are more or leſs dangerous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their extent, and the part in which they are ſeated. Thoſe which extend into the bones, viſcera, or joints, are of the worſe kind; and eſpecially when any of the wadding, cloths, or ſplinters are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the part together with the ball; for the conſequences, in theſe caſes, muſt be inflammations, gangrenes, caries, &amp;c. which make an amputation neceſſary. But Gun-ſhot Wounds in the cranium are above all the moſt malignant and fatal; though even here we have often ſurpriſing
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:015100_0116_0F95D2F26ABBD5A8"/>
inſtances of cures made by art and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of nature, when the caſe has appeared to be deſperate."</p>
                     <p>"The following method is extracted from Mr. Ranby's excellent Treatiſe on Gun-ſhot Wounds, whoſe penetrating judgment, and great experience in ſuch caſes, muſt be univerſally acknowledged."</p>
                     <p>"The firſt intention, in regard of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents cauſed by a muſket or piſtol ball, is, if poſſible, to extract the ball, or any other extraneous body that may be lodged in the wounded part. And whenever theſe caſualties are attended with a great effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood, from the rupture of ſome conſiderable arterial veſſel, it will be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, with all imaginable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, to reſtrain the bleeding by taking up the artery with the needle; and, at the ſame time, to be particularly careful that your held proves no way eluſive. There is no depending on any applications, however ſtyptic, on theſe occaſions."</p>
                     <p>"In order to get at the ball, or any other foreign matter that infeſts the wound, I would adviſe probing or poking to be uſed as ſparingly as poſſible; having conſtantly experienced, through the whole courſe of my attendance in theſe caſes, that ſuch a method is highly detrimental to the patient:
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:015100_0117_0F95D2F32C9DAD38"/>
and, indeed, where probing is neceſſary, I would always prefer the finger as the beſt and trueſt probe."</p>
                     <p>"If a ball, or any other body happens to be lodged near the orifice, or is found by the touch to lie under the ſkin, though at ſome diſtance from the mouth of the Wound; in the firſt caſe it is requiſite immediately to remove ſuch extraneous matter; and, on the other occaſion, to cut upon it, and take it out. But when it is ſunk deep, and lies abſolutely beyond the reach of the finger, I could never bring myſelf to thruſt thoſe long forceps the Lord knows where, with ſcarce any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of ſucceſs."</p>
                     <p>"A great number of inſtances have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to me, where balls have been quietly lodged in the body; till, after many years, they have worked themſelves a paſſage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſurface, and were conſequently very eaſily extracted. In caſe the wound be occaſioned by a muſket or piſtol ſhot, and conſequently but ſmall, it will be neceſſary to dilate it immediately: yet, I think, in Wounds near a joint, or in very membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous or tendinous parts, the knife, as well as forceps, ſhould be put under ſome reſtraint; nor any more opening made,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:015100_0118_0F95D2F3EDEC8010"/>
than what is abſolutely requiſite for the free diſcharge of the matter lodged within."</p>
                     <p>"Wounds in the joints are always dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, let them proceed from whatever cauſe, whether a bullet, or any cutting inſtrument; and membranous or tendinous parts muſt undoubtedly ſuffer from their being thus expoſed to the very ſenſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the air. I could produce many inſtances of balls going through muſcular parts, and the Wounds being healed with very little trouble. And I have known Wounds of the ſkull from a broad-ſword (both tables having been cut through, and a conſiderable piece looſened) which were ſuffered to bleed for ſeveral hours, and did well; nor were attended, at leaſt very ſeldom, with any feveriſh complaint; which was probably owing to the great quantity of blood loſt immediately after the parts had been injured. If the ball has gone quite through, both orifices are to be wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened (if in a part where it can be done with ſafety) and particular care is to be taken to preſerve both openings, that eſpecially which is the moſt depending. No tents are to be made uſe of, where there is any poſſibility of avoiding them; and I would, in general, recommend light, eaſy dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, with a ſlight, moderate bandage, juſt
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:015100_0119_0F95D2F4ABF80EC8"/>
ſufficient to keep them on the part. Thin flannel is what I would prefer, in caſe it can be got."</p>
                     <p>"Where the wounded perſon has not ſuffered any great loſs of blood, it will be adviſeable to open a vein immediately, and take from the arm a very large quantity, and to repeat bleeding, as circumſtances may require, the ſecond, and even the third day. This timely precaution will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a god deal of pain and inflammation, forward the digeſtion, and contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obviating a long train of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ſymptoms, that are wont otherwiſe to interrupt the cure, miſerably harraſs the poor patient, and too often endanger his life."</p>
                     <p>"For the firſt twelve days it will be proper to obſerve a cooling regimen, both in reſpect of medicines and diet: and as, in circumſtances of this kind, it is neceſſary that the body ſhould by all means be open, a ſtool ſhould be every day procured, either by emollient clyſters, or ſome gentle lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative. Whatever application is of a hot, ſpiritous nature, I find remarkably injurious on theſe occaſions, and what no wounded part can in any degree bear."</p>
                     <p>"Let the firſt dreſſing be with lint, dry, or moiſtened with a little oil, and a
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:015100_0120_0F95D2F56ED1E2B8"/>
very light bandage; the next with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive warmed, and over it the bread and milk poultice, mixed with a ſufficient quantity of oil to keep it moiſt: and, where there is a great tenſion, and the Wound large, a fomentation. This courſe is to be continued till the ſore is clean; and then it is to be healed according to art."</p>
                     <p>"This method will commonly promote a conſtant, eaſy perſpiration, abate the pain, very much facilitate the digeſtion, and remove all danger of any approaching inflammation. What induces me to moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the lint with oil, is the eaſe that is procured to a Contuſed Wound from ſuch an application, in compariſon with one of an abſorbent, drying diſpoſition; which, inſteed of giving free liberty to the ſanious blood to diſcharge itſelf, and conſequently preventing an inflammation by unloading the part, would poſſibly obſtruct the mouths of the capillary veſſels, and hinder nature from getting rid of that incumbrance, which ſhe endeavors to throw off."</p>
                     <p>"Should an inflammation ſeize any part, through the lodgment of a bullet, or any other foreign body, that could with ſafety have been more immediately extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; all attempts for diſlodging ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:015100_0121_0F95D2F62AA73850"/>
matter ſhould be poſtponed, till the ſwelling has in ſome meaſure ſubſided, and the inflammatory diſpoſition of the fibres is nearly vaniſhed: unleſs the ball, or other extraneous body, lies at no great diſtance from the orifice; and there is, on that account, a certainty of removing this incumbrance, without any material trouble to the patient."</p>
                     <p>"If a Wound be of ſuch a deſperate nature, as to require amputation (which is often the caſe, when it happens in any particular joint) it would certainly be of conſequence to perform the operation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately as ſoon as the patient is brought down; leſt by delaying it an inflammation, which one may very reaſonably expect, ſhould obſtruct a work that ought rarely to be entered upon during the continuance of ſo calamitous a circumſtance as that of a ſmart engagement. The neglecting this critical juncture of taking off a limb fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reduces the patient to ſo low a ſtate, and ſubjects the blood and juices to ſuch an alteration, as muſt unavoidably ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſubſequent operation, if not entirely unſucceſsful, at leaſt exceedingly dubious. And in Wounds even where no amputation is required, it is equally adviſeable not to defer me care neceſſary to be taken of them;
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:015100_0122_0F95D2F6EEF01D00"/>
leſt, by the parts being expoſed to the air; there might ariſe a ſeries of very dangerous ſymptoms."</p>
                     <p>"Wounds that border on any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able artery are very apt to bleed afreſh upon motion, or a return of a free circulation of the blood into the part which was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted at firſt by the violence of the injury offered it; and this is almoſt always the the caſe, when the ſlough begins to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: for which reaſon one ſhould never attempt to remove it by force; but wait, with patience, till there be a perfect ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this ſlough; nor be in the leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhocked at the accident of arteries thus opening themſelves, which a very moderate experience will convince one to be almoſt inevitable. The patient frequently gives warning of what is coming upon him, by complaining of a great weight and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the limbs, which are ever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with more or leſs pulſation in them: an infallible prognoſtic of the conſequences. Let the Wound afflict whatſoever part, if theſe complaints attend it, I inſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join bleeding and the bark."</p>
                     <p>"I have known ſeveral inſtances of perſons loſing their lives from the ſtarting of an artery before the ſurgeon could reach them; particularly where there has
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:015100_0123_0F95D2F7ADE0B870"/>
preceded an amputation. And I dare affirm, the quantity of blood loſt in ſome caſes, which I have obſerved to kill, has not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to twelve ounces; which I do not know how to account for otherwiſe, than by the drain which had been made from the maſs of blood both before and during the operation; whence a ſudden guſh, though of ſo moderate a portion of blood, after the great quantity already loſt, gives a check to the circulation, and cauſes immediate death."</p>
                     <p>"This reflection, I think, ought to be a leſſon to every practitioner, to be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly intent on the faithful diſcharge of his duty in regard of tying the veſſels. Repeated bleedings in the beginning draw after them many advantages: they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prevent, and always leſſen, any feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh attacks, and ſeldom fail to obviate impoſthumations."</p>
                     <p>"The body muſt ever be kept in a lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative ſtate; and, when pain puts it on the rack, immediate recourſe muſt be had to the ſovereign and almoſt divine powers of opium; next to this I likewiſe add the bark, a medicine which no human elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can extol with panegyric propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to its ineſtimable virtues. Of ſuch incomparable benefit is it to mankind!
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:015100_0124_0F95D2F86CAF8F58"/>
I have known it procure reſt, if given in large doſes, when even opium had been taken without any manner of effect."</p>
                     <p>"In all large Wounds, eſpecially thoſe made by a cannon ball, there is conſtantly a great laceration of the membranes, and parts endowed with an exquiſite ſenſation. Theſe are ever attended with an excruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating pain, and a diſcharge of a gleety mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which, if not reſtrained, proves often of the laſt conſequence."</p>
                     <p>"In this unhappy ſtate, the bark, given in doſes of a drachm each, and repeated every three hours (or oftener, if the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach will bear it) ſurpriſingly repairs the breach made in the conſtitution by theſe terrible accidents. Elixir of vitriol taken three times a-day, in a glaſs of water, I find to be of ſingular benefit, and to prove a very good aſſiſtant to the virtues of the bark. And if the body be coſtive, to each doſe of the bark I add four or five grains of rhubarb, till that inconvenience is remedied. Should the bark run off by more than four or five ſucceſſive ſtools, I take care to check this effect of it by ordering two or three drops of laudanum, or two ſpoonfuls of the diaſcordium mixture along with it, every time it is given".</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="unknown:015100_0125_0F95D2FA2D7E02E8"/>"Where the ſore diſcharges a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quantity of gleety matter, is flabby, looks pale and gloſſy (which appearances are ever conſequent to a loſs of ſubſtance) the bark continually relieves the pain that is predominant in this caſe, thickens the matter, leſſens its quantity, and quite changes the complexion of the Wound."</p>
                     <p>"It is very common in cachectic and ſcorbutic conſtitutions (which latter too much abounds in ſea-faring people, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in long voyages) for a ſore, the firſt eight or ten days after taking off the limb, to promiſe all imaginable ſucceſs: from which time it frequently begins to gleet prodigiouſly, looks pale, gloſſy, and flabby; and this gleeting, if not checked, ſoon proves mortal. In exigencies of this kind, the bark hardly ever fails to procure relief, and works an apparent change in a very ſhort ſpace of time; ſometimes in twelve hours."</p>
                     <p>From what has been here ſaid by Mr. Ranby, it is evident that the bark is one of the beſt remedies in contracting the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and reſtoring their due action upon the blood, when too great a quantity of that neceſſary fluid has been loſt by a profuſe haemorrhage, provided the wounded veſſels
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:015100_0126_0F95D2FACE730920"/>
are previouſly cloſed up, or well ſecured from a return of the haemorrhage.</p>
                     <p>It alſo not only ſecures the moſt tender ſolids and ſmall veſſels from being diſſolved by the acrimony of any matter abſorbed, and returned into the whole maſs of blood, from large Wounds or latent abſceſſes; but it likewiſe preſerves the texture of the blood itſelf from being too much broken, or rendered too watery from the ſame cauſe, which would otherwiſe inevitably produce a fatal and colliquative hectic. But where there is too great a fulneſs, or too great a ſtrength and contractile force of the ſolids, and an inflammatory tenacity or ſizineſs in the blood, it may occaſion obſtructions, pains, inflammations, and their conſequences, unleſs it be timely laid aſide upon the appearance of ſuch effects.</p>

                     <head>SOME BRIEF DIRECTIONS PREVIOUS TO, AND IN ENGAGEMENTS, &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>THE value of an able ſurgeon, and the neceſſity of his aſſiſtance, never more plainly appears than in dangerous wounds received in an engagement or battle; where many brave men muſt unavoidably periſh from loſs of blood and other cauſes, unleſs reſtored and ſnatched, as it were, from the jaws of death by the ſkill of their ſurgeon. And no doubt, the better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the officers and men conceive of their ſurgeon, the more ſpirits they have for the action; being confident, the wounds, &amp;c. they may chance to receive will be properly treated, and their lives (if poſſible) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Therefore a ſurgeon of a man of war ſhould have every thing needful, in a ſufficient quantity, always by him in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (but more particularly in time of war) placed in ſome kind of box or drawer by themſelves. His capital inſtruments ſhould be conſtantly kept clean, bright, and in good order. His apparatus ſhould conſiſt of ſeveral tourniquets (of which Petit's ſcrew tourniquet is the moſt convenient, as the patient can eaſily manage it himſelf, after it is fixed) crooked needles of all ſizes, threaded with proper flat ligatures, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the needle; a large quantity of
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:015100_0128_0F95D2FC2B047F38"/>
ſcraped (ſhort) lint, ſome mixed with flour in a bowl; double and ſingle headed rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers (or bandages) of all breadths and lengths, in good ſtore; for ſlight wounds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſions, thoſe made of bunting (the fly-part of an old enſign) will be ſufficient; but for caſes of more conſequence, ſuch as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, fractures, diſlocations, &amp;c. the linen rollers muſt be uſed. He ought to be furniſhed with common needles and thread, with pins in plenty; pledgets of tow, of what ſizes he pleaſes; after they are made, they may be wet with water, or oxycrate, on the ſame board, and dried either by the galley-fire or in the ſun. By this means he may the better lay them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (in a drawer or box) without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling, and they are both much better and readier to ſpread, when wanted, with any cerate, ointment, or liniment.</p>
                     <p>Splints of all ſizes muſt alſo be at hand, and when uſed armed with tow, or old linen cloth; likewiſe bolſters, or compreſſes of cloth, or coarſe tow; but theſe may be readily made as occaſion requires. To the above add yards of incle, or ſtrong tape, to ſecure your ſplints in fractures, and for other uſes. By this method a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon will always be provided againſt every accident which may befall his Crew.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="unknown:015100_0129_0F95D2FCED6E0CF8"/>When the enemy is in ſight, and you are like to come to an action, as ſoon as all hands are called to quarters (if your cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit is not ſufficiently large) you muſt deſire the firſt lieutenant, with the captain's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to order the carpenters to lay a platform for your wounded men; if the cables will not be wanted, in one of the cable tires, or otherwiſe in the after-hold, by clearing of all manner of lumber out of the way. On the top of a ſmooth and even tire caſk, let there be deals or planks laid cloſe together, over them an old ſail, and upon that ſome ſeamen's bedding from the purſer's ſtore-room (for which you are to have the captain's order, if he will not otherwiſe deliver them) ready made up, and laid one by another to place your wounded men on after they are dreſt, that they may lie quiet without being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed.</p>
                     <p>If the ſhip be ſmall, and there is no cock-pit, or ſuch as you have not room to perform your operations in, you muſt, as near the after hatchway as is convenient, have ſome caſk removed out (if there be not height enough for you to ſtand upright on the platform) that you may have a place of eight, ten, or twelve feet ſquare, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and dreſs your wounded men, and
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:015100_0130_0F95D2FDAC431DA0"/>
from thence to hand them to their beds: on one ſide of this place let there be fixed a cheſt of a proper height if you have no other convenient ſeat) to perform your ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations upon; and on another juſt by (or table) lay all your apparatus, ſuch as your capital inſtruments, needles, ligatures, lint, flour in a bowl, ſtyptic, bandages, ſplints, compreſſes, pledgets ſpread with yellow baſilicon, or ſome other proper digeſtive; thread, tape, tow, pins, new and old linen cloth, a bucket of water to put your ſpunges in, another empty to receive the blood in your operations; a dry ſwab or two to dry the platform when neceſſary; a water-caſk full of water near at hand, with one head knocked in, in readineſs for dipping out occaſionally as it may be wanted. You muſt alſo have near you your ung. baſil.—e gum. elem.—ſambucin; ol. lin.—olivar. c.—terebinth; balſ. terebinth, tinct. ſtyp.—thaebaic; ſp. c. c. per ſe.— vol. aromat.—lavend. c. Wine, punch, or grog, and vinegar in plenty.</p>
                     <p>A number of large candies ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately lighted, as ſoon as the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment begins, not forgetting to have your mates and aſſiſtants properly inſtructed in what part they are to act, that every one may know his ſtation, and what he has to
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:015100_0131_0F95D2FE6BDC2E10"/>
to prevent confuſion in time of action. Here it is neceſſary to obſerve, that the ſurgeon ſhould always take peculiar care to deſire the firſt officer to quarter a ſufficient number of hands with him in the cock-pit, that he may want no aſſiſtance in the day of battle, however bloody the engagement may be.</p>
                     <p>All things being ordered, and placed as above in readineſs, and the ſurgeon's and purſer's cabbin beds made up, to receive the captain, or any of his commiſſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who may chance to be wounded; if you have any ſick on board, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand to their quarters, let them be put down with their hammock and bedding into the hold, fore cockpit, or ſheet cable tier, out of the way before the action begins; but be ſure to keep your platform entirely for the wounded men. Let one of your mates or aſſiſtants go to them now-and-then to ſee how they are; or elſe order one of the ſtouteſt of the convaleſcents to come to you at times, if he is able, and acquaint you if any of them are worſe, and in caſe of faintneſs, to give them a little cordial, which he ſhould have by him for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>When the action is begun, if more than one wounded is brought down at a time,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:015100_0132_0F95D2FF2ED3E658"/>
always firſt take care of him who is in the moſt immediate danger; but otherwiſe dreſs them as they come, without diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: if any is brought down with a limb off, or a violent haemorrhage, and you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be in the midſt of an amputation, or other capital operation, and cannot that inſtant attend, order your mate or aſſiſtant (for the preſent) immediately to ſix a tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquet on the part, to reſtrain the flux of blood from being fatal to the patient, and do what elſe you may think neceſſary, till you have finiſhed the operation you were about, and laid the patient in bed.</p>
                     <p>Never encourage thoſe to ſtay below (after their wounds, &amp;c. are dreſt) who have been but little hurt, but inſiſt on their going up again to their quarters, otherwiſe threaten to report them when the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is over. I have many times known cowardly lubbers come tumbling down the ladder with moſt violent groans and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, though at the ſame time they have received little or no hurt; and all I could do or ſay would not prevail on them to make a ſecond trial of their courage, nor go up again till the action was all over. Nay, I have been told (by thoſe quartered at the ſame gun) that ſome daſtardly-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows have actually put their feet, or ſtood
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:015100_0133_0F95D2FFED518448"/>
in the way of the carriage, on purpoſe to be hurt, that they might have a plauſible pretence for going down to the doctor; which I muſt own I have great reaſon to believe, having ſometimes met with ſuch contuſions in the legs and feet, occaſioned (according to their own confeſſion) by the carriage, but at the ſame time ſo ſlight as was ſcarce worth mentioning; though ſometimes very violent, at other times there was ſcarce any injury or contuſion to be perceived, notwithſtanding the moſt grievous complaints of pain and uneaſineſs.</p>
                     <p>When you are entering on any capital operation, you ſhould uſe your utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to encourage the patient (if he is ſenſible) by promiſing him, in the ſofteſt terms, to treat him tenderly, and to finiſh with the utmoſt expedition; and indeed you ſhould uſe expedition but not hurry: you ſhould not make more haſte than the caſe requires, nor cut leſs than is neceſſary, or leave any miſchief unremedied; for the neglecting this critical juncture of taking off a limb, frequently reduces the patient to ſo low a ſtate, and ſubjects the blood and juices to ſuch an alteration, as muſt unavoidably render the ſubſequent opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if not entirely unſucceſsful, at leaſt exceedingly dubious. Therefore, if a
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:015100_0134_0F95D300ADA009D8"/>
wound be of ſuch a deſperate nature as to require amputation (which is often the caſe in ſea engagements) it is certainly of conſequence to perform the operation immediately as ſoon as the man is brought down: and in wounds, even where no amputation is required, it is equally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable not to defer the care neceſſary to be taken of them.</p>
                     <p>In regard to the wounded, you ſhould act in all reſpects as if you were entirely unaffected by their groans and complaints; but at the ſame time I would have you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have with ſuch caution, as not to proceed raſhly or cruelly, and be particularly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to avoid unneceſſary pain.</p>
                     <p>When the action is all over, you are then to go round your patients, and examine if the wounds have bled any thing conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſince they were dreſt; and if the haemorrhage ſtill continues, remove the dreſſings very gently and carefully, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply freſh ones.</p>
                     <p>It is not improper here to remark that the tourniquets ſhould ſtill remain on thoſe patients, who have had their limbs amputated or ſhot off; that they may be always in readineſs, in caſe of a freſh hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage; and in caſe there be no aſſiſtant preſent when it happens, the patient ſhould
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:015100_0135_0F95D3016D54B898"/>
be inſtructed himſelf how to tighten it, if he feels the wound bleeding, before help can be procured. You are likewiſe to ſee that their wounded limbs, &amp;c. lie eaſy, and as they ought; and that the patients are ſupported with proper diet and medicines ſuitable to the ſymptomatic fever, &amp;c. as mentioned under the various heads in Northcote's Marine Surgeon,</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as poſſible after the engagement is ended, and your wounded are all taken proper care of, acquaint the captain how many there are wounded, and the nature of their wounds, if they are like to prove mortal, &amp;c. And deſire he will pleaſe to order cradles forthwith to be made, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as you think neceſſary, wherein your wounded men muſt be placed, with their bedding, in a proper birth by themſelves. The cradles are firſt to be well cleated, and ſecured to the deck and ſides of the ſhip, placed ſo, as that you may eaſily go between to dreſs the people.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the ſhip arrives in a harbour, the ſick and wounded muſt be immediately ſent on ſhore, where their cures will be perfected in a much ſhorter time than it is poſſible on board in an inſalubrious air, and on ſuch diet only as the ſhip affords.</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſary the ſurgeon of the ſhip
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:015100_0136_0F95D3022D91F460"/>
ſhould give a more particular account of patients ſent to an hoſpital, than is the common practice in the navy, of merely filling up a ſick ticket with the general name of a diſeaſe, &amp;c. He ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the ſurgeon, or his aſſiſtant at the hoſpital, of the peculiar conſtitution of the patients, the manner they have been treated from firſt to laſt, the ſymptoms, &amp;c. that have occurred; and what ever other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances he ſhould be informed of, in order to enable him to perform a more ſpeedy cure.</p>

                     <head>PREVENTATIVES OF THE SCURVY AT SEA, &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>THE beſt method of preventing the Scurvy at Sea is a liberal uſe of acids (particularly thoſe of vegetables) and to avoid eating the ſhips ſalt proviſions as much as poſſible, to uſe friction daily, either with a fleſh-bruſh or coarſe cloth. Proper exerciſe, dry linen, and cleanlineſs, not a little contribute to health.</p>
                     <p>It appears from many repeated experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Dr. Lind, and a number of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons in the royal navy, that of all acids, oranges and lemons have the beſt effect in
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:015100_0137_0F95D302EEFA65D0"/>
preventing and curing the Scurvy (the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſhall here omit mentioning, it being already laid down in the Marine Surgeon, Vol. II. Chap. VIII. Sect. VI. Art. Scurvy, to which the reader is referred). Oranges, in my opinion, are better than lemons, for by theſe Lord Anſon's people were ſo ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily and ſurprizingly recovered at the iſland of Tinian. It is certain, when they are properly and ſufficiently uſed, they are an infallible cure in every ſtage and ſpecies of the Scurvy, if there is any degree of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtrength left; and where a diarrhoea, lientery, or dyſentery are not joined to the other ſymptoms. Some are apt to think tamarinds, vinegar, ſpirit of ſalt, elixir of vitriol, and other acids of the ſame kind, will do as well; but experience (that beſt of maſters) plainly ſhews the contrary; and though acids agree in certain proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they differ widely in others. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theſe fruits are given without ſucceſs, you may be fully aſſured the diſeaſe is not the Scurvy; for in the real genuine Scurvy they were never yet known to fail. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is neceſſary alſo to obſerve that freſh vegetables of all kind prove a great relief to ſcorbutic patients when ſet on ſhore.</p>
                     <p>But as oranges and lemons are apt to ſpoil in keeping, there is now to be had an
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:015100_0138_0F95D303AA4CB858"/>
excellent quinteſſence of theſe fruits, which may be very advantageouſly uſed as a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneum, being but little inferior to the recent juice.</p>
                     <p>When you are in countries where oranges and lemons grow ſpontaneouſly, and can be procured in great plenty at a ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, I ſhall here ſhew how to bring their juices, by a very eaſy method, into a ſmall quantity without prejudice to their virtues.</p>
                     <p>Let the juice of theſe fruits be well cleared from the pulp, and depurated by ſtanding ſome time; after which it may be poured off from the groſs ſediment: let it then be poured into any clean open veſſel of china or ſtone ware, which ſhould be wider at the top than at the bottom, that it may evaporate more readily. A china baſon or punch bowl is moſt proper on account of the form. Put this into a pan of water over a clear fire; let the water come almoſt to boil, and continue nearly in that ſtate, with the bowl full of juice in the middle of it, till the juice is found of the conſiſtence of a thick ſyrup when cold. The ſlower the evaporation of the juice is, the better; that is, it ought to continue twelve or fourteen hours over the fire: when it is cold it is to be corked up in a bottle for uſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="unknown:015100_0139_0F95D30563BC73E8"/>Two dozen of good oranges, weighing five pounds four ounces, will yield one pound nine ounces and a half depurated juice; and when evaporated there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main five ounces of extract, which in bulk will be equal to leſs than three ounces of water: ſo that twelve dozen of oranges or lemons may be put into a quart bottle, and preſerved good ſeveral years. When this is mixed with water, and made into punch, few are able to diſtinguiſh it from the freſh juice mixed up in the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>However, when the freſh fruit can be had, the fragrancy of the peel may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſomewhat to the cure of the Scurvy; and when theſe are wanting, the ſame thing may be obtained from a few drops of their chymical eſſence, or the aromatic oil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their rinds; and if a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of this be added to the extract, it will give it the ſmell and fragrancy of the freſh fruit in great perfection: or rather add a little of the outer peel to the extract, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before it is taken off the fire, and then the niceſt taſte will not be able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the difference between the freſh fruit and this. The virtues of this extract, thus made, lie in ſo ſmall a compaſs, that a quart bottle full will ſerve one man at ſea
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:015100_0140_0F95D305EB28D7E8"/>
ſeveral years. In making of it there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing flies off but the water.</p>
                     <p>It will likewiſe be of great uſe to all ſea-faring people to have always with them, bullace, ſloes, wild-plums, hips, elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, gooſe-berries, and the like, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in bottles, in the ſame manner as the paſtry-cooks keep the latter. Cabbage, French beans, &amp;c. may be preſerved by putting them in clean dry ſtone pots or jars, with a layer of ſalt at the bottom, then a thin layer of the vegetable covered with ſalt, and ſo alternately till the pot is full; then the whole muſt be preſſed down with a weight, and its mouth quite ſtopped with a cork or timber plug, well pitched over, that no air or moiſture may enter: thus the vegetable may be kept freſh and green for a whole year.</p>
                     <p>At the time of uſing, the ſalt is to be waſhed off with warm water. This is the manner by which they preſerve that never-failing remedy Greenland ſcurvy-graſs. Every common ſailor ſhould alſo lay in a ſtock of onions and muſtard, for they are a great preſervative at ſea. The Dutch ſailors are preſerved from the Scurvy by pickled cabbage. It muſt be obſerved, likewiſe, that a ſoup of boiled cabbage and onions will cure an adventitious Scurvy in
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:015100_0141_0F95D306AC4A0B10"/>
its firſt ſtage, either at land or ſea, in any part of the world; and what will cure will prevent.</p>
                     <p>Salt proviſions ſhould always be eaten with plenty of vinegar, muſtard, and onions, but as little of the meat as poſſible, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Scurvy begins to make its appearance in the ſhip. Thoſe who have been weakened by long illneſs ſhould be more particularly guarded againſt the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, by living on boiled biſcuit, with a few drops of the quinteſſence or extract of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or oranges, and a ſpoonful of wine; as alſo oatmeal and rice gruels, flummery, ſtewed barley, with raiſins or currants, ſago, and wine, &amp;c. But more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly pickled green cabbage or beans, as before mentioned, and ſmall onions boiled with the portable ſoup made weak. Moſt of their food ought to be acidulated with orange and lemon juice, their quinteſſence or extract.</p>
                     <p>The inſpiſſated juice of turnips (a thing very eaſily and cheaply procured) is on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent kind of ingredient in ſoup for ſea uſe. The water-dock (hydrolapathum) the berries mentioned above, and crab apples; alſo apples, pears, or any other fruit, either preſerved with coarſe ſugar (by being boiled in it) or elſe brought to a
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:015100_0142_0F95D3076AF4B828"/>
rob or extract, by boiling their expreſſed juices, &amp;c. as already laid down for that of lemons and oranges, by which means it may be kept good through the longeſt voyages. Apples, pears, &amp;c. when well cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and well packed in dry tight caſks, will keep very good for two or three months; or they may otherwiſe be cut in ſlices, and put upon ſtrings in dry weather, by which they will be dried without loſing their flavour or taſte; they are then to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtowed in very dry boxes, and aired ſometimes to prevent their mouldering or being damaged.</p>
                     <p>Good wine may be made by fermenting the before-mentioned extracts with water and ſugar; bullace and ſloes are preferable to any other (oranges and lemons excepted) being a noble antiſeptic aſtringent.</p>
                     <p>Poor people that winter in Greenland, under vaſt diſadvantages in point of air and diet, preſerve themſelves from the Scurvy by ſpruce beer.</p>
                     <p>The common beer brewed for the uſe of ſhips ſhould be imbittered with wormwood, chamomile flowers, or even gentian, rather than by means of hops; and by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer it will keep longer than with the latter, without acquiring any bad property, and have full as agreeable a taſte; but it ſhould be
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:015100_0143_0F95D3083009A350"/>
plentifully impregnated with thoſe ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients.</p>
                     <p>The ſhrub black ſpruce of America makes a moſt wholeſome drink, and affords a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam ſuperior to moſt turpentines; it is of the fir kind. A ſimple decoction of the tops, cones, leaves, or even of the green bark, or wood of theſe, is an excellent antiſcorbutic; but perhaps it is much more ſo when fermented, as in making ſpruce beer, which may be brewed freſh every two or three days. It is to be made by pouring boiling water on the tops, cones, leaves, bark, or wood of the ſpruce, or any other fir, dried or green; the latter may be eaſily carried in bags at ſea: but when theſe cannot be had, a little turpentine or worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood may be ſubſtituted; which ever be uſed, it is then to be fermented by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a proper quantity of molaſſes, which, by its diaphoretic quality, makes it a more ſuitable medicine.</p>
                     <p>Again, when ſpruce cannot be had, the common fir-tops uſed for fuel in the ſhip ſhould be firſt boiled in water, and then the decoction be fermented with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes; to which may be added a ſmall quantity of wormwood and root of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſh (when it can be got); the freſher it is drank the better. When other things
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:015100_0144_0F95D308EB465A98"/>
are wanting, tar-water may be fermented in the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>A drink may alſo be brewed the ſame way from the ſaſſafras chips, or from the branches or berries of the juniper plant: for if the benefit is ſuppoſed to depend (as it certainly does) upon the fermentative quality, or to be derived from an aceſcent, antiſeptic, corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borative, and balſamic virtue in the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what is more liberally endowed with theſe qualities than theſe ſubſtances I have mentioned?</p>
                     <p>Beſides freſh and preſerved fruits, vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, and the drinks above mentioned, fermented liquors of all ſorts are good, but more particularly cyder; among theſe are included many wines of every kind; or the juices of fruits (already taken notice of) may be fermented with ale, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The late very learned and juſtly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Doctor Huxham ſays, "Let all ſhips, that are to proceed on a long cruiſe or voyage, be ſupplied with a ſufficient quantity of ſound generous cyder; the rougher, provided it is perfectly ſound, the better."</p>
                     <p>If apples are found of ſuch vaſt ſervice in the Scurvy, ſurely the juice of them, when become a vinous liquor, cannot but
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:015100_0145_0F95D309ADDCBCE8"/>
be very ſalutary, and ſeems exceedingly well adapted, as a common drink, to correct by its acidity the alcaleſcent, putrefying quality of bad, corrupted proviſions. This cyder ſhould be at leaſt three months old before it is ſerved in, and quite fine; if it be too new, and foul, it is apt to give ſevere colics: it ſhould be racked off (once at leaſt) from its groſs ley into good and ſweet veſſels, which will contribute to its becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fine, and prevent it from growing ropy, in which ſtate it is good for nothing: but if ſome of it ſhould turn to vinegar, which may frequently happen, it will ſtill be very ſerviceable; but it is found, when well managed, to keep good and ſound even to the Indies. Every ſailor ſhould have at leaſt a pint of cyder a day, beſides beer and water.</p>
                     <p>The prize wines, which are commonly low and thin, and very frequently ſpoil by keeping, might be diſtributed among the ſhip's company (eſpecially in want of cyder) to very good purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The ventilators ſhould be conſtantly worked, once a day at leaſt; and the decks frequently waſhed or ſprinkled with vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. In caſe of ſtinking water, lemon juice, elixir of vitriol, or vinegar ſhould always be mixed with it, which will render it
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:015100_0146_0F95D30A6C522930"/>
much leſs unwholeſome. A ſmall drachm of garlic brandy, or the tincture of bark, taken in the mornings faſting, and when going on the night watch, is a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. See the next Chapter on the Preſervation of Health, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Cream of tartar, being the eſſential ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable ſalt of wine, is a very proper ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneum when fruit is wanting; and orange or lemon peel (or its eſſence) will greatly improve the flavour: beſides cream of tartar is the moſt grateful of all acids, ſubſtituted in the room of the juice of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and oranges, and beſt adapted to the conſtitution of mariners: it is alſo the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; for an allowance of the eighth part of an ounce a day will not coſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much more than one ſhilling yearly for each man, or eighteen pence at moſt. Two pounds and a half of cream of tartar will be ſufficient to acidulate an hogſhead of water; this, with rum and ſugar, will become a ſalutary compoſition of a cooling, ſtrengthening, antiſeptic, and diuretic na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for there is nothing more repreſſes the inflammatory and intoxicating power of ſpirits than acids. Such a liquor would prove infinitely more whoelſome than the grog, wherewith the navy is commonly
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:015100_0147_0F95D30B2C493438"/>
ſerved when ſpirits are uſed, both in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, and elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>The officers and men (that can afford it) ſhould always carry to ſea a very conſiderable quantity of pickles of different kinds, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly onions; and preſerves and extracts of all acid fruits, ſuch as ſloes, bullace, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp;c. They muſt all be properly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in glaſs bottles or ſtone jars well tied over; glazed earthen veſſels are very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous either for preſerves or pickles.</p>
                     <p>Allowing cyder, &amp;c. to the fleet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, may be deemed a very expenſive project; but where the lives of ſo many brave and uſeful people are in the caſe, I think (as Dr. Huxham very humanely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) the coſt ſhould by no means come into competition with the advantage that may be received from it. The Romans conſtantly carried with them vinegar and wine in their fleets and armies, and the common ſoldier and ſailor daily partook of both; nay, they were at many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable expences to preſerve the health of their armies, &amp;c. New, if that glorious prudent people thought the life of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoldier ſo valuable, and were at ſuch expence to preſerve it, why ſhould not we have as much regard to that of a Britiſh
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:015100_0148_0F95D30BEDCCCEC8"/>
ſailor, who is altogether as brave, and as uſeful to the Common wealth?</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſary here alſo to remark, that the uſual method of impreſſing ſeamen on their return from long and tedious voyages, void of neceſſaries, chagrined at not ſeeing their friends and families, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in a bad ſtate of health, and not allowed time and opportunity to recover it, hath been the bane of thouſands: and I moſt heartily wiſh, for the honor of the nation and the good of the public, that a method of manning our fleet could be found out more conſiſtent with common humanity and Britiſh liberty; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to have it ſerved with more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome proviſion, better beer, and a ſufficient quantity of ſound generous cyder on board every ſhip, to be uſed at diſcretion, and as neceſſity required; from the foregoing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks it is evident what advantages would accrue from it.</p>

                     <p>When a ſhip rides at anchor near marſhy ground or ſwamps, and the wind blows di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from thence in hot weather, the gun ports ought to be kept ſhut; and if ſhe rides with her head to the wind, a thick ſmoke ſail ſhould be conſtantly kept up to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt, to carry up the ſmoke of the galley, and prevent its coming aft over the ſhip: at ſuch times the men ſhould be injoined to ſmoke tobacco, and the ſhip ſhould often be fumigated with it, as well as with pitch and tar; the method of procuring tobacco to be ſo uſed, without any additional ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to the government, is, inſtead of burning the great quantities every year ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the coſtom-houſe and exciſe-officers, to order it to be preſerved, and ſent to the dock yards to ſupply the ſhips deſtined for foreign voyages; it may be either added to the boatſwain's or carpenter's ſtores, in ſuch large quantities as may be thought convenient for the above uſe of fumigating: to prevent
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:015100_0150_0F95D30D6B8C4508"/>
abuſe, it ſhould never be uſed without the captain's order, and always iſſued out by weight; it would likewiſe be proper that centinels ſhould attend the burning it to prevent embezzlement, which precaution in my opinion would be of infinite advantage on many occaſions, and a much more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent way than the preſent method of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming it, without the leaſt benefit accruing to any individual.</p>
                     <p>Boats crews and men employed on ſhore, being moſt expoſed to the open air, ſhould be often relieved, and never ſuffered to ſleep on ſhore, not even in tents or otherwiſe, if to be avoided; but ſhould always be obliged to return and lie aboard at night: but when this cannot be complied with, and men are obliged to remain on ſhore, their tents ſhould be very cloſe, and erected on the dryeſt ſpot they can find, that is, upon dry ſand, gravel, or chalk, near the ſea ſhore. The negroes, and ſome of the Indians on the coaſt of Guinea, both of whom ſleep on the ground, have conſtantly a fire producing a little ſmoke burning in the huts where they ſleep, which corrects the moiſture of the night, and renders the damp of the earth leſs noxious; therefore if your tent is made on the graſs, and at a diſtance from the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, it will be neceſſary to obſerve the ſame rule: the door of the tent ſhould be towards the ſea, and the back part ſecured
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:015100_0151_0F95D30E2CEF5390"/>
by double canvas. All old forſaken houſes, caves, and ſuch like places, ſhould be well purified with large fires; the men ſhould never ſleep on the ground, but in their hammocks, and be very well covered; every morning and evening they ſhould take a dram of the ſpirituous tincture of the bark: likewiſe the officers and men, when on ſhore, ſhould be allowed a more plentiful, but not immoderate uſe of vinous liquors.</p>
                     <p>Dr. LIND ſays, that people coming firſt from a cold into a hot climate, are apt to have plethoric ſymptoms (which in general I have found to be the caſe in many ſouthern voyages, with ſome few exceptions) a pain of the head, giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a ſenſe of the weight, and fulneſs of the breaſt, and ſome are apt to be ſeized with ardent fevers and diarrhoeas.</p>
                     <p>All practitioners have obſerved, that new comers into warm climates are at firſt liable to fevers tending to the ardent kind, and are very ſubject to fevers of the remitting and intermitting kind, which are the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics of all warm countries at certain ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the year; and after ſome time they are apt to fall into fluxes, the yellow-fever, and othe diſeaſes depending on a putreſcent ſtate of the juices.</p>
                     <p>Nothing has been found to be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of diſeaſes in thoſe warm climates, than indulging freely in the uſe of ſpirits and
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:015100_0152_0F95D30EEC570F18"/>
other ſtrong fermented liquors, lying on the ground, being expoſed to damps and dews, and working hard, or uſing violent exerciſe in the heat of the day.</p>
                     <p>The moſt dangerous diſeaſes in intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate climates, and voyages to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, proceed from a continuance of hot, moiſt, cloſe weather, or from heavy rains, common at ſome ſeaſons of the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tropics; at firſt a few of the men are ſeized with the bloody-flux, which is ſucceeded by a malignant fever of the remitting or intermitting kind, but moſt commonly it is like a double tertian: this is epidemic between the Tropics, and is the autumnal fever of all hot countries; the ſafety of the patient entirely depends on the fever's intermitting, or at leaſt on its remitting ſo much as to allow an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of throwing in the bark, which is the only ſovereign remedy in theſe ſort of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant fevers, though they put on differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent appearances.</p>
                     <p>The bark might be made extremely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latable by infuſing it in ſpirits with orange peel, and the billious fever and the bloody flux might be prevented by it: four ounces of bark and two ounces of dried orange peel will be ſufficient for a gallon of ſpirits; and two ounces may be allowed each man a day when there is an apprehenſion of theſe malignant diſeaſes: it will be beſt to
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:015100_0153_0F95D30FAD6F6C88"/>
take half in the morning on an empty ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and the other half when they are called out to their night watch.</p>
                     <p>The bark is an excellent medicine for ſailors on many accounts, it being the greateſt antiſeptic taken inwardly of any yet diſcovered; but as it is a very expenſive drug in England, it is not to be ſuppoſed that ſhips will carry ſuch a quantity of it as to be of common benefit to the whole crew: though this may unhappily be the caſe for the poor ſeamen, yet they may be ſupplied at the cheapeſt rate with a medicine of nearly equal goodneſs and efficacy from our own ſoil, and if prudently employed, the ſcurvy, that maritime peſtilence, will ſeldom or never make its alarming appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance among a ſhip's crew on long and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous voyages, proper care with regard to cleanlineſs and proviſions being obſerved; the medicine here recommended to their uſe is the fine bark of the Engliſh oak, which is eaſily preſerved, and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently taken in the quantity of a drachm at a time, occaſionally in powder, extract, decoction, or tincture. In intermittents (for poor people) it has been frequently uſed with ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſary to obſerve, that in ſultry climates, or during hot weather in all places ſubject to great rains, where the country is over-run by thickets, ſhrubs, or
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:015100_0154_0F95D3106A232F88"/>
woods, eſpecially if there are marſhes or ſtagnating waters in the neighbourhood (which are exceedingly pernicious to the health of all Europeans) the malignant diſeaſes above-mentioned may juſtly be dreaded: the fens and marſhes even in England are bad for ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>The ſhip ſhould never lie ſo near the ſhore, as that the mountains (if there be any) may intercept the ſea breezes (or in the ſea term, ſhe ſhould never be land lock'd); the ſame precautions are neceſſary in places, either during or ſoon after the rainy ſeaſon: in hot climates wind-ſails in in the day-time ſhould conſtantly be kept up, and at ſea in the night likewiſe; the ventilators ſhould be continually worked, and the lower deck ports kept open, when the weather will permit, from ſun riſing to ſun-ſet; the decks muſt be kept clean ſcraped and waſhed, but the latter never after ſun-ſet. When ſickneſs begins on board a ſhip, the ſick ſhould immediately be removed as much as conveniently may be from the ſound; the ſick-birth ſhould be as airy as poſſible, without expoſing the ſick to catch cold, and always kept as clean as may be; the centinels over the ſick ſhould conſtantly empty and waſh the buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets which the ſick make uſe of every watch.</p>
                     <p>The ſhip (particularly a new one) ſhould
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:015100_0155_0F95D31222EEE2E8"/>
be every day fumigated with the ſteams of tar or pitch, and in wet, damp weather, fires often lighted between decks, with proper centinels over them to prevent any danger.</p>
                     <p>To boil vinegar between decks or in the hold fills the whole cavity of the hull with a vapour that is ſalutary and antiſeptic to a very great degree; and this may perhaps be the beſt way of uſing vinegar to prevent a corruption of the air, or the ſpreading of diſeaſes; fumes of tobacco (as already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) may be employed to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>The cloaths of the ſick and the ſick birth ought particularly to be fumigated; their foul cloaths ſhould always be inſtantly ſprinkled with vinegar, or tied to a rope and plunged into the ſea, to waſh them from all ſeeds of contagion; vinegar ſhould alſo be diſperſed plentifully every where through the ſhip, cloths dipt in it hung up in all parts, and freſh vinegar frequently ſprinkled upon them, to keep the vapour of it continually afloat, but eſpecially the ſick birth ought to be daily well waſhed with vinegar.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of cold bathing-tubs under the fore caſtle, and bathing in the ſea early in the morning, have been found extremely beneficial in hot countries, for this practice
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:015100_0156_0F95D312AB0C2C10"/>
not only braces up the fibres, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to health but cleanlineſs likewiſe, and promotes perſpiration; but then the people ſhould not ſtay too long in the water, nor go in when overheated with work or liquor, nor when the ſtomach is full, or there is an eruption with a prickly heat on the ſkin. Diarrhoeas and other complaints, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of great heat, have been cured by bathing, and their returns prevented.</p>
                     <p>Wine is the beſt of all cordials in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of fevers, (provided it is ſound and good) and is a much better reſtorative than rum, or any other ſpirits however mixed or prepared; it is likewiſe an excellent means to prevent infection; ſome caſks of Madeira Wine (which keeps good in all climates) ſhould be preſerved for the uſe of the ſick in theſe voyages.</p>
                     <p>The ſwallowing large draughts of undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted ſpirits has always the moſt fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences in every climate; but when they are converted into punch, they become very ſalutary, preventing diſeaſes which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from hot and moiſt weather, and the tendency to corruption in the animal fluids, which is conſtantly induced thereby; as cleanlineſs alone greatly contributes to health, it may not be amiſs to propoſe, that when at ſea, the ſeamen and marines ſhould be muſtered when the ſeparate watches are called every Sunday, and paſs
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:015100_0157_0F95D3136D4E5BB0"/>
in review by the officer of the watch, and thoſe that are then dirty, having a foul ſhirt, trouſers, &amp;c. ſhall have their allowance of liquor, whether beer, wine, or grog, ſtopt for that day (by the captains order); for the ſecond offence to ſtand in the pillory on the quarter-deck, and for the third, to receive a dozen laſhes at the gangway: the ſame notice might be taken of their ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocks, when the captain thinks proper to have them examined; by this method the people would always be wholeſome and clean, and conſequently much healthier, for in every ſhip, there are a number of dirty lubbers, particularly among the waſte guard and marines; and the cooks mates and his attendants are generally as bad as any.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall here only mention that when men are ſeized with inflammatory ſymptoms on entering into warm climates, they may be blooded freely; afterwards they do not eaſily bear ſuch copious evacuations, but rather require to have them made in ſmaller quantities, and very early and frequent, as it flammations make a rapid progreſs in warm countries.</p>
                     <p>Doctor Lind ſays, many practitioners diſapprove of bleeding in thoſe countries which lie under the torrid zone, on a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that the blood is too much diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he thinks (very juſtly) that this
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:015100_0158_0F95D3142B0FF0E8"/>
rule will admit of many exceptions, and that ſailors being ſtrong and expoſed to greater viciſſitudes of heat and cold, and more exceſſes and other accidents, bear freer bleeding in general than any other ſet of people. After ſome time the diſeaſes in theſe warm climates tend to the putrid kind, and then muſt be treated as ſuch.</p>
                     <p>In warm climates the ſhips are generally moſt healthy at ſea, where the air is dry and ſerene, and the heat moderated by refreſhing breezes.</p>

                        </gap>hannel cruiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though the cold is intenſe, yet if the air is pure and dry and the men are well cloathed, there are few diſeaſes; but when the weather is unſettled, cloudy, wet and rainy, the uſual conſequences are colds, attended with feveriſh and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ſymptoms, and eſpecially rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic, pleuritic, and peripneumonic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, theſe iaſt require plentiful evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, but chiefly bleeding, which, when timely and freely uſed, will prevent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions and chronic rheumatiſms.</p>
                     <p>When the men are almoſt conſtantly wet and chill from bad weather, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo an uncommon degree of fatigue, it
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:015100_0159_0F95D314EF15D540"/>
will be proper to let them have the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mixture, viz. a pint of ſmall beer, and a quartern of brandy ſweetened with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes, to which may be added as much vinegar as will render the mixture palata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; or, inſtead of the laſt, cream of tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; this the Ruſſians call <hi>aſhbetten.</hi> Dry beds and cloathing are moſt neceſſary arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; for it is obſervable that the moſt naked ragged fellows are principally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with winter diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>The ſcurvy is a diſeaſe common in the winter and ſpring; the method to prevent which is already laid down in the preceding ſection, and to which the reader is referred.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Lind ſays, the moſt proper cordial dram a ſailor can uſe in the winter is gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic brandy, for a ſmall quantity of it, not only warms the ſtomach, but keeps the breaſt, kidneys, and ſkin free from obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but neither this nor any other dram ſhould be given to a man almoſt chilled to death with cold, having his limbs quite benumbed, and their extremities froſt bit (as it is called); for, in this caſe, it has often proved fatal; but he ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put into a warm bed, and have ſome warm gruel, ſage tea, or ſome ſuch diluting liquor, given him; after which a dram may be allowed, when it will prove leſs dangerous, and more beneficial.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="162" facs="unknown:015100_0160_0F95D315AD2EAE50"/>A very remarkable caſe to this purpoſe is related by Hildanus, viz. a man was found quite ſtiff and frozen all over; he was put into cold water, and immediately the icy ſpicula were diſcharged from all parts of his body, ſo that he ſeemed covered with an icy cruſt; he was then put into a warm bed, took a cordial draught, and a plentiful ſweat followed; after which he recovered with the loſs of the laſt joints of his fingers and toes. De Gang aena, chap. XIII.</p>
                     <p>People who are benumbed with cold in froſty weather, ought never to be brought immediately near a fire; for that has been found either to cauſe immediate death, or gangrenes of the extremities. Any kind of fruit frozen, when put immediately to the fire, will turn ſoft and rot; but if put into cold water, it throws out the icy ſpicula, and recovers ſo as to be almoſt as good as before, which, proves the above method uſed with the man to be right.</p>
                     <p>In cold rainy weather, tea made with ſage, ſaſſafraſ, or a few roaſted juniper ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with the addition of a little garlic brandy, will be very beneficial; likewiſe a man will never be ſo liable to catch cold when he is wet upon the deck, and uſes exerciſe, as when he is below in his wet cloaths, or ſleep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in them, or in a damp bed; when he goes upon deck he ſhould
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:015100_0161_0F95D3166DC4A8D8"/>
eat a bit of biſcuit, and drink a little aſhbet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and then the weather will probably have but little power to alter his health for the worſe.</p>
                     <p>When a ſailor happens to be dead drunk, his head ſhould be raiſed, and a ſpunge dipped in vinegar ſhould be held to his noſe; and if he can drink, he ſhould have warm water mixed with vinegar; bleeding will likewiſe be proper, and a gentle emetic which operates ſpeedily, ſuch as the oxymel. ſcillitic. ſal vitriol. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe dipping the feet in cold water will take off the preſſure from the brain; and ſolutive clyſters will abate the diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; it is but too well known how many people loſe their lives by exceſſive drinking, and ſpirituous liquors; the ſame treatment will be uſeful after a large doſe of opium.</p>
                     <p>Theſe methods here laid down (chiefly taken from Doctor Lind) but partly from others, I have practiſed for many years in the royal navy; and with the bleſſing of God it has in general been attended with great ſucceſs; for which reaſon I can the more ſtrongly recommend it; if it be true, as was publiſhed in December 1760, taken as is ſuppoſed from returns made to the Houſe of Commons, that of 185,000 men, raiſed for the ſea-ſervice during the late war, above 130,000 periſhed by diſeaſes; and that two thirds of this number may be ſafely charged
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:015100_0162_0F95D3172DA30390"/>
to the account of diſeaſes that take their riſe from putrefaction; ſurely every motive of policy and humanity ſhould excite men to endeavour at finding out ſomewhat to check that fatal and deſtructive diatheſis; for if ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men could be preſerved free from it other kinds of diſeaſes would ſeldom endanger them.</p>
