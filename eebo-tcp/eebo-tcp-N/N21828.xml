            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>EXTRACTS FROM "AN HISTORICAL NARRATIVE". WRITTEN BY THE LATE THOMAS HUTCHINS, ESQUIRE, GEOGRAPHER TO THE UNITED STATES; AND PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR 1784.</head>
            <p>IN his account of the river Mississippi and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent country, he says:</p>
            <p>"Is it not amazing, true as it is, that few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us know this to be the key to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern part of the western continent? It is the only channel through which that extensive region, bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its waters, and enriched by the many streams it receives, communicates with the sea. And here let us further observe, that the Mississippi river may truly be considered as the great passage made by the hand of nature for a variety of valuable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, but principally to promote the happiness and benefit of mankind; amongst which, the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the produce of that immense and fertile country, lying westward of the United States, down its stream to the Gulf of Mexico, is not the least.</p>
            <p>"The slime which the annual floods of the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Mississippi leaves on the surface of the adjacent shoses, may be compared with that of the Nile,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028743_0017_0FDBE9971F8A3030"/>
which deposits a similar manure, and for many centuries past has insured the fertility of Egypt. When its banks shall have been cultivated as the excellency of its soil and temperature of the climate deserve, its population will equal that, or any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the world. The trade, wealth and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of America will at some future period, depend and perhaps centre upon the Mississippi.</p>
            <p>"An objection has been often made by misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed men, otherwise of great abilities, who too credulously believed that the navigation of the Mississippi river, on account of its rapid current, was more difficult than it is in reality. It appears from the calculation made by several skilful and experienced travellers, that in the autumn when the waters are low, the current descends at the rate of about one and a half or two miles in an hour; and that the waters are in this state more than one half of the year. In the spring when the freshes are up, or at their greatest height, the current runs at the rate of five or six miles. It is true that the navigation would be difficult at that season, to those who sail or row up against the stream; but there is no example of such folly. When the waters of this river are high, the commodities and produce of the interior country are gathered and prepared for exportation with the descending current. And when the waters are low, the produce of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior country is growing to maturity. This is the time for the navigator's importation. Great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages are likewise taken then from eddy cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. At present there are few builders skilful enough to construct vessels better calculated for that navigation, than those already mentioned.—Time and experience will doubtless produce im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, and render the navigation of this river nearly as cheap as any other. But that the Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssippi can answer every purpose of trade and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028743_0018_0FDBE99AC704A180"/>
is proved to a demonstration, by the rapid progress the French, German, and Acadian inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants on that river, have made. They have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a state of opulence never before so soon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in any new country. And this was effected under all the discouragements of an indolent and rapacious government. It may be further asserted, that no country in North-America, or perhaps in the universe, exceeds the neighbourhood of the Mississippi in fertility of soil and temperature of climate. Both sides of this river are truly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the very great diversity and luxuriancy of their productions. They might probably be brought, from the favorableness of the climate, to produce two annual crops of Indian corn as well as rice, and with little cultivation would furnish grain of every kind in the greatest abundance. But their value is not confined to the fertility and immensity of champaign lands; their timber is as fine as any in the world, and the quantities of live and other oak, ash, mulberry, walnut, cherry, cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and cedar, are astonishing. The neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Mississippi, besides furnishes the richest fruits in great variety, particularly grapes, oranges, and lemons in the highest perfection. It produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces silk, cotton, saffafrass, saffron and rhubarb; is peculiarly adapted for hemp and flax, and in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of tobacco equals the Brazils; and indigo is at this present a staple commodity, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yields the planter from three to four cuttings. In a word, whatever is rich or rare in the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable climates in Europe, seems natural to such a degree on the Mississippi, that France, though she sent few or no emigrants into Louisiana but decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed soldiers, or persons in indigent circumstances, (and these very poorly supplied with the imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of husbandry) soon began to dread a rival in her colony, particularly in the cultivation of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028743_0019_0FDBE99C623FDE38"/>
vines, from which she prohibited the colonists un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a very heavy penalty; yet soil and situation triumphed over all political restraints, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, at the end of the war in 1762, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little inferior to the most ancient settlements of America in all the modern refinements of lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury."</p>
            <p>Of the river Amit, which runs through a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable part of the Company's lands, he says:</p>
            <p>"The river Amit falls into the Ibberville on the North side, about 21 miles from the junction of the Ibberville with the Missisippi. The water of the Amit is clear, with a gravelly bottom. It may be ascended with vessels drawing five or six feet water, about half a dozen miles, and with batreaux 100 miles further. Seventeen miles from the Ibber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville this river forks; the western branch, called the Comit, has its source near the country of the Natchez; and the eastern branch, which is the most considerable, rises near the Pearl river: both these branches run through a very fertile country, in some parts hilly, which, as well as the low lands, is covered with canes, oaks, ash, mulberry, hicko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, poplar, cedar and cypress."</p>
            <p>And of the river Pearl, which runs from north to south through the greater part of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's purchase, he says:</p>
            <p>"Near the entrance at the East end of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golets, and on the North side, are the principal mouths of Pearl river, which rises in the Chactaw nation, and is navigable upwards of 150 miles. There is 7 feet going into it, and deep water after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. In the year 1769, there were some settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on this river, where they raised tobacco, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo, cotton, rice, Indian corn, and all sorts of veg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etables. The land produces a variety of timber fit for pipe and hogshead staves, masts, yards, and all kinds of plank for ship building."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:028743_0020_0FDBE99DDAB1CD20"/>
In his description of the river Tom Bigby, (the Company's eastern boundary) and the adjacent country, he observes:</p>
            <p>"The river is navigable for sloops and schoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers about 35 leagues above the town of Mobille. The banks, where low, are partly overflowed in the rainy seasons, which adds greatly to the soil, and adapts it particularly to the cultivation of rice.—The sides of the river are covered in many places with large canes, so thick that they are almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable; there is also plenty of remarkable large red and white cedar, cypress, elm, ash, hickory and various kinds of oak. Several people have settled on this river, who find the soil to answer beyond expectation.</p>
            <p>"The lands near the mouth of the Mobille river are generally low: As you proceed upwards, the lands grow higher, and may with great propriety be divided into three stages. First, low rice lands on or near the banks of the river, of a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent quality. Secondly, what are called by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the country second low grounds, or level flat cane lands about 4 or 5 feet higher than the low rice lands. And, thirdly the high upland or open country. The first or low lands extend about an half or 3 quarters of a mile from the river, and may almost every where be easily drained and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into most excellent rice fields, and are capable of being laid under water at almost all seasons of the year. They are a deep black mud or slime, which have in a succession of time been accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or formed by the overflowing of the river.</p>
            <p>"The second low grounds being, in general, formed by a regular rising of about 4 or 5 feet higher than the low lands, appear to have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally the edge of the river. This second class or kind of land is in general extremely rich and covered with large timber and thick strong canes,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028743_0021_0FDBE9A1D1788CA8"/>
extending in width upon an average three quarters of a mile, and in general a perfect level. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for all kinds of grain, and well calculated for the culture of indigo, hemp, flax or tobacco.</p>
            <p>"At the extremity of these second grounds, you come to what is called the high or upland, which is covered with pine, oak and hickory, and other kinds of large timber. The soil is of a good qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, but much inferior to the second or low land. It answers well for raising Indian corn, potatoes, and every thing else that delights in a dry light soil. Further out in the country again, on the West side of this river, you come to a pine barren, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive reed swamps and natural meadows of savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs which afford excellent ranges of innumerable herds of cattle.</p>
            <p>"Whenever portages are made between the Mobille and Cherokee (or Tennessee) rivers, or their branches, which are probably but a few miles apart, the Mobille will be the firstriver for commerce, (the Mississippi excepted) in this part of the world, as it affords the shortest and most direct communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the sea."</p>
            <p>There are many other rivers besides those alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mentioned, running in different directions through that part of the western territory; some falling into the Mississippi, and others into the bay of Mobille; among which may be numbered the Chactaw river running nearly parallel to the Tom Bigby; the Yazou, which empties itself into the Mississippi just above the Walnut hills, and within the Company's northern boundary; also the Big Black (remarkable for the uniformly fertile soil in its neighbourhood) which likewise falls into the Mississippi below the Yazou, and above the Natch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ez; the whole forming a direct and easy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between the interior country and the sea board.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:028743_0022_0FDBE9A3DB89E188"/>
Mr. Hutchins in describing the <hi>soil</hi> of the Natch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ez district, (the whole of which lies within the limits of the Georgia Mississippi Company's Grant) says:</p>
            <p>"The soil, at this place, is superior to any of the lands on the boarders of the river Mississippi, for the production of many articles. Its situation being higher, affords a greater variety of soil, and is in a more favorable climate for the growth of wheat, rye, barley, oats, &amp;c. than the country lower down, and nearer to the sea. The soil also produces, in equal abundance, Indian corn, rice, hemp, flax, indigo, cotton, pot-herbs, pulse of every kind, and pastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and the tobacco made here is esteemed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to any cultivated in other parts of America. Hops grow wild; all kinds of European fruits ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to great perfection, and no part of the known world is more favorable for the raising of every kind of stock. The climate is healthy and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; the country delightful and well watered; and the prospect is beautiful and extensive, variegated by many inequalities and fine meadows, separated by innumerable copses, the trees of which are of different kinds, but mostly of walnut and oak. The rising grounds, which are cloathed with grass and other herbs of the finest verdure, are properly disposed for the culture of vines; the mulberry trees are very numerous, and the winters sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moderate for the breed of silk worms. Clay of different colours, fit for glass works and pottery, is found here in great abundance; and also a variety of stately timber fit for house and ship building, &amp;c."</p>
            <p>The Company is not in possession of any docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at present by which the exact limits of the Natchez district can be ascertained: It is, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, material to the interest of those concerned, to know, that the Indian title has been fairly and honestly extinguished, on a very considerable por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Company's lands, and that, on <hi>such</hi>

            </div>
            <div type="answers">
               <head>ANSWERS to the QUESTIONS proposed.</head>
               <p n="1">1. I AM well acquainted with the country in question, and have acquired that knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, by being employed some years as surveyor to the southern Indian department, under the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the superintendant of Indian affairs under the British Government.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The parallel of latitude 31, 18, strikes the river Mississippi two miles above the mouth of St. Catharine's Creek, at the upper end of the white Cliffs, and eight miles below the Natche Fort.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The distance, from the Mississippi along said parellel of lat. 31, 18, to the Tombeckbe, river is 213 miles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The parellel of lat. 32, 40, intersects the Mississippi river 24 miles above the mouth of Ya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zou river.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The distance along said parellel of lat. 32, 40, from the Mississippi to the Tombecbe, is 188 miles.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Natche district is bounded to the west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by the Mississippi river, and extends from Losthus's Cliffs up said river to the mouth of Ya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zou river the distance being 110 miles. To the north on the then reputed boundary of Georgia, extending from the mouth of the Yazou along said line, east 15 miles. To the east, by the Chactow boundary line, extending along said line, south 100
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028743_0026_0FDBE9B042B6DAD0"/>
miles, to the Manchac district line. To the south, by the Manchac district line, along said line west<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly 60 miles to the Lofthus's Cliffs on the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sissippi. The said district was purchased from the Chactaw nation by the British superintendant of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian affairs at a Treaty held at Mobille in May 1777, and the lines as above described, were marked and surveyed by me, in 1779.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Attold, or big ball ground, on the Yazou river, lies 15 miles south of lat. 32, 40.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Hateha Cornesa, the Hatcha, or Pearl river, and the Yazou river, runs through the said district of Country, and Hoslap Hateha, Hatcha Oosee, Hooma Chitto, and Loosan Chitto rivers, with St. Catharines Creek, Coals, Bayon Pierre, and other smaller Creeks take their rise within said territory.</p>
               <p>The Mobile or Tombeckbe is the only river that the tide runs up any distance, its influence being felt at times as far up as the sun-flower, 180 miles from the sea, and 16 north of lat. 31, 18.</p>
               <p>The Mississippi, the Pearl, Pasca Oocoola, and Tombeckbe are the only rivers in said tract of country that will admit the navigation of large batteaux.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The face of the country is in places hilly, with high ridges, not rocky nor stony, and in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces flat, and level, with extensive plains or Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahs, and low swamps; in general woody and well timbered: on the river banks, and for some distance back, are large and thick Cane breaks, and on the top of the ridges in many places, between the trees, is grown thick with reeds and small cane.</p>
               <p>The soil on the Mississippi, is in general of the first quality, and extends from 20 to 50 miles back, the timber on the high lands consists of a variety of oaks, black walnut, Mulberry, Hicko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wild cherry, &amp;c. on the flat and level ground
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028743_0027_0FDBE9B15F7CCE68"/>
grow different kinds of oak, beech, ash, maple, sasafras, pakan, the cotton, the locust, &amp;c. in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral large and lofty, and mostly thick with large canes: and the low swamps which are flowed by the river at every ordinary fresh, abounds with large cypress trees, gum &amp;c. in places thick with cane; the plains or savanas, and Indian old fields, are covered with good grass, and abundance of strawberries.</p>
               <p>The lands on the Tombeckbe river, consists of high, and low swamps, the soil good and rich, well timbered, and thick with canes, and high and flat lands, the soil in some places good, in others light, and sandy, in general well wooded with oaks, hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, gums, beech, pines &amp;c. in places thick with small canes or reeds, and is in most respects, simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to Savannah river in Georgia.</p>
               <p>The lands on the other rivers, consist of high and low swamps, and high and flat land, the soil in places good, in others but indifferent, in general well timbered with oaks, hicory, beech, pine, gum, cypress, tupelo, ash, maple &amp;c. and in places cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with large, and small canes.</p>
               <p>The land and soil, on the ridges between said rivers and branches, is in general light and grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly, in places mixed with some small stones; the timber, or woods, mixed with oak, hicory, pines &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The country in general is very well watered with numberless excellent springs, but on the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sissippi in very dry seasons, most of the rivulets, and branches run dry which make a great want of good water for drinking;but as the country becomes more clear and settled, new, never failing springs are discoved which promise a great plenty of good tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wholesome water, at any season. There are a great number of good mill seats within the tract of country here described; and has a most
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028743_0028_0FDBE9B6384F0A00"/>
excellent range for cattle, it being interspersed with a vast number of reedy branches and other good winter range.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE perused attentively your letter of the 7th instant, by which you acknowledge my letter directed to you on the 26th of November last past, it being an answer to yours of the same month. I fully accede to your opinion, that it is a matter of the greatest importance to establish between the United States and Spain, the wished for good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and friendship; and that both governments ought, without reserve, to communicate their mutual sentiments; and that it will in consequencee be indispensable that they be explained clearly. However that very principle points out to me the propriety to call your mind, that the demand made in your letter of the 21st, principally purports to be informed whether this court intends to interfere, in case as it was highly probable that the United States should find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obliged to repel by force, the hostile aggressions of the southern Indian nations. As on your part there has not been made, in your communications transmitted to me till this day, a distinction between the Indians residing within the territory of the United States, and those living in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's dominions; I do not therefore see why you should, in the least, expect it in my answers. As little do I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028743_0030_0FDBE9B906D9DC48"/>
how you could doubt, that in that letter those Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans alone were treated of who reside within the territory of Spain, with whom his Majesty has concluded a treaty of friendship; and that in no manner can be comprehended, those Indians who live within the boundaries of the United States. Therefore, Spain does not propose to herself, any other object, than the maintaining of the legal power in the territories which belong to her, and will not take a decided part in favor of the Indians, except when justice and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty call for the same. I am as firmly persuided as you are, that he uncertainty that has prevailed heretofore in those Indian affairs, originated from the want of fixing positively, the limits between the United States and Spain. And I can assure you, that his Majesty is likewise convinced of the same truth; and being desirous to give to the United States, an unequivocal proof of his sincere wishes to draw closer the bonds of friendship and of good understanding between the two countries, he will not permit the decision of the limits to be retarded, but will cause the same to be carried on with the utmost dispatch. I participate in the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your letter on the 7th instant, and repeat the assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my zeal to oblige you; remaining under prayers to God to preserve you many years.</p>

                  <p>WE received yesterday a letter from the Duke of Alcudia, saying, that since his last of the 26th of November, and 18th December, the letters so long expected from Louisiana and the Floridas, had arrived; and that by the intelligence giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in them by the Governor's of those Provinces, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was satisfied that the Indians bordering on Spain and the United States, had been really the aggressors against the peaceable inhabitants of Georgia, on whom they had exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their cruelty and barbarity; and that in consequence thereof, his Majesty had given orders to those Governors to give no assistance to the Indians, and had charged him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us thereof, that we might communicate it to the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as a new proof of the justice and impartiality of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,

and of his desire to strengthen his friendship with the United States. I have thought not a moment should be lost to give you notice of this, and therefore without waiting for the delay of a joint letter, I send this by the several channels of this days post. No mention was made by the Duke, of our letter of December 22d, and therefore nothing furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the limits.

                  <head>Explication of the Right of the United States to the navigation of the River Missisippi, and to the jurisdiction of the western part of the State of Georgia.</head>
                  <p>THE conferences which the commissioners plenipotenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of the United States have hitherto had with his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency the plenipotentiary of his Catholic Majesty, on the subjects of limits and the navigation of the Missisippi, have not had the issue expected. It is hoped that a more perfect and full examination of the right of the respective parties, and a comparison of the documents on which they are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, may give a different result.</p>
                  <p>WE, the commissioners plenipotentiary of the United States, therefore proceed to reduce to a more permanent form the claims of the United States, which we have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stated and supported in the conferences, and to shew the title from which they are derived.</p>
                  <p>The several states now composing the United States of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, were from their first establishments dependent on no other society of men whatever. They continued at the head of their respective governments, the executive magistrate who presided over the one they had left, and thereby secur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in effect a constant amity with that nation during the time of that connexion. In this stage of their government the several boundaries were fixed, and particularly the sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern boundary of Georgia, the one now brought into ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Spain. This boundary was fixed by the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King of Great-Britain, their chief magistrate, in the year 1763, at a time when no other power pretended any
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028743_0032_0FDBE9C029867A58"/>
claim whatever to any pars of the country through which it run. All the territory on the left side of the Mississippi, except the town of New Orleans, and the Island in which it is situated, having been previously yielded by the treaty of Paris, to which H. C. M. was one of the high contracting parties.</p>
                  <p>The boundary of Georgia was thus established, to begin on the Mississippi in 310 of lat. north of the equator, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eastwardly to the Apalachicola, thence along the said river to the mouth of the Flint, thence in a direct line to the source of St. Mary's river, and down the same to the ocean. The western boundary originally the Pacific ocean, was by the treaty of Paris reduced to the middle of the Mississippi.</p>
                  <p>In the late war which took place between Great-Britain and the consederated states, and in the course of which we were joined by France as an ally, and by Spain and Holland as associates, having a common enemy this boundary was the line of demareation to the south, between the country which engaged in the war against Great-Britain and that which continued under British government; Georgia having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the consederation, and Florida having remained in its former state. At the conclusion of hostilities Great-Britain (the only power against whom the United States had been engaged in war) acknowledged their boundary, and that without extending it to the prejudice of Spain, as is pretended; but on the contrary confirming that of Georgia in particular, as it had existed from the year 1763: In the treaty afterwards made with Spain, Great-Britain ceded the two Floridas (which had been defined in the proclamation of 1763) and Minorca; and by an express article of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Spain agreed to restore without compensation, all the territories conquered by her, and not included in the treaty either under the head of cessions or restitutions, that is to say, all except Minorca and the Floridas. According to this stipulation Spain was expressly bound to have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the possessions she had taken within the limits of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, to Great-Britain, if they were conquests only. Britain, who was to deliver them over to the United States, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spain, should have delivered them to the United States themselves as standing <hi>quo ad hoe,</hi> in the place of G. Britain. Spain was bound also by natural right to deliver them to the United States on a still stronger ground, as the real and only proprietors of those places which she had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en possession of, without having had any cause of war with the United States, to whom they belonged, and without having declared any; but on the contrary conducting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028743_0033_0FDBE9C2A78BA070"/>
in other respects as a friend and associate in a war against a common enemy. It is an established principle that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest gives only an inchoate right, which does not become perfect till confirmed by the treaty of peace, and by a renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation or abandonment of the former proprietor. Had G. Britain been that former proprietor, she was so far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming to Spain the right to the territory of Georgia, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Spain, that she expressly relinquished to the United States any right that might remain in her, and afterwards completed that relinquishment by further procuring and consolidating the agreement with Spain herself, to restore such territory, if comprehended within the conquests of Spain, without compensation. It is still more palpable that a war existing between two nations, as Spain and G. Britain, can give to neither the right to seize and appropriate the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of a third which is even neutral, much less which is an associate in the war, as the United States were with Spain. On the conclusion of the general peace, the United States lost no time in requiring from Spain an evacuation of their territory. This has hit her to been delayed by means which need not be explained here, but which have been equally contrary to the right, and to the consent of the United States. From what has been said it results—:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the boundary of Georgia now forming the south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern limits of the UNITED STATES, was lawfully estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in the year 1763.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it has been since confirmed by the only power who could at any time have had pretensions to contest it, founded on a state of war.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That GREAT-BRITAIN by the late treaty of peace obtained of Spain a renunciation to all pretensions within this boundary so as to have removed every pretext for ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the right of GREAT-BRITAIN, to have confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that boundary to the UNITED STATES.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That Spain can have no right to any claim by conquest within the limits of the UNITED STATES, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been in a state of war with them.</p>
                  <p>The right of the UNITED STATES, to participate in the navigation of the Mississippi rests on two separate and distinct foundations, either of which would suffice to estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish it clearly. These are</p>

                  <p n="2">II. The law of nature and nations.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The war of 1755, 1763 was carried on jointly by Great Britain, and the thirteen colonies now the United-States of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028743_0034_0FDBE9C4C2F5CC18"/>
America against France and Spain. By the treaty of peace which was negociated by our common chief Magistrate, and to which as has been observed, H. C. M. was one of the high contracting parties, a right was secured to the subjects of Great-Britain, (the common designation of all those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his government) to navigate this river in the terms fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. "The navigation of the river Mississippi, shall be equally free to the subjects of Great-Britain, and those of France, in all its breadth and extent from its source to the sea, and especially that part of it which is between the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Island of New-Orleans, and the right bank of this river, as well as the entrance and passage out through its mouth. It is moreover stipulated that vessels belonging to the subjects of the one or the other nation, shall not be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested, visited or subjected to the payment of any duty whatsoever."</p>
                  <p>Spain soon after received from France, a Cession of the Island of New-Orleans, and all country she held westward of the Mississippi, subject of course to our right of naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting between that country and the Island previously grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by France. Thus stood our right to navigate the Mississippi under the treaty of Paris. In the course of the late war in which the United-States, Spain and France were opposed to Great-Britain, Spain took possession of several posts held by the British in Florida. It is unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to examine whether the possession of half a dozen posts scattered through a country of seven or eight hundred miles extent, could be considered as the possession and conquest of that country. If it were, it gave still but an inchoate right as was explained above, which could not be perfected but by the relinquishment of the former proprietor at the close of the war. But certainly it could not be considered as a conquest of the river even against Great-Britain, since the possession of the shores, to wit of the Island of New-Orleans on one side, and Louisiana on the other, had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone no change.</p>
                  <p>Still less can Spain be considered as having conquered the <hi>river</hi> as against the United States with whom she was not at war. When this war commenced, we had a common right of navigation in the part of the river between Florida, the Island of New-Orleans, and the western bank; and nothing which passed between Spain and Great-Britain, either dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the war, or at its conclusion, could lessen that right. Accordingly at the treaty of Novemver 1782, Great-Britain confirmed the rights of the United States, to the navigation of the river from its source to its mouth, and in January
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028743_0035_0FDBE9C5B249EAA8"/>
1783 completed the right of Spain to the territory of Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, by an absolute relinquishment of all her rights in it. This relinquishment could not include the navigation held by the United States in their own right, because this right existed in themselves only, and was not in Great-Britain. It could only transfer that portion of right which Great-Britain had retained to herself in the treaty with the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States held seven weeks before, to wit, a right of using it in common with the United States.</p>
                  <p>So that as by the treaty of 1768 the United States had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a common right of navigating the whole river from its source to its mouth, so by the treaty of 1781 that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon right was confirmed to them by the only power who could pretend claims against them founded on a state of war. Nor has that common right been transferred to Spain either by conquest or Cession.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Independant of the right of the United States to navigate the Mississippi as above established, they are enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to it also by that code which is founded in natural jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, sanctioned by the usuage of all civilized countries, and strengthened by the morality of sovereigns.—The law of nature and Nations.</p>
                  <p>There is no principle of natural justice more strongly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than that seas are free to all men, and rivers to all their inhabitants. There is no man, savage or civilized, unbiased by habit, who does not feel and attest this truth. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in all tracts of country united under the same political society, we find this natural right universally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and protected, by laying the navigable rivers open to all their inhabitants. When their rivers enter the limits of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother society, if the right of the upper inhabitants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend the stream, be in any case obstructed, it is an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the natural right effected by some act of society.—Such an abridgement will necessarily be considered by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial observers, with a reference to the comparitive num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of persons above, and those below the limits of the two countries, the nature and extent of the river, and other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending circumstances.</p>
                  <p>It is easy to see that there are cases in which such an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement could be only by an act of force in a stronger society against a weaker one, which would be condemned by the Judgment of mankind.</p>
                  <p>Such an act of force is in some cases supposed to be modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the upper inhabitants, having bound themselves for some valuable consideration to renounce their natural right of navigating the river.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="unknown:028743_0036_0FDBE9CA6ADC4658"/>
It is not necessary to examine here how far this right be an alienable one, and what circumstances of necessity can justify such an alienation so as to be binding on themselves and their posterity.</p>
                  <p>The examples of history leave no doubt that this will unavoidably depend in some degree on the progressive rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of times and countries.</p>
                  <p>Whenever it be pretended however that an <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> so contrary to natural justice, has been made, it may be at least expected that the act of renunciation should be produced. Such an act would of course have been a solemn one, nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated by those duly authorised to act in the name of the society, and therefore easy to be produced if it existed. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be produced, it is fair to suppose that the rights of the upper inhabitants, anticedent thereto and founded on na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural justice, exist in all their integrity. With respect to the United States they have been so far from assenating this right, that the only acts in which the subject has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as respecting them, have as has been shewn above, expressly secured and confirmed to them by treaty, the rights of navigation to which they are entitled by natural law.</p>
                  <p>So far as this sentiment of right in favor of the upper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants depends on a comparison of the numbers above and below the limits, or in other words, of those certainly to be benefitted, and those supposed to be liable to injury from the freedom of the navigation, there is no case in which it can be more strongly marked than in the present.</p>
                  <p>The United States hold 600,000 square miles of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble territory on the Mississippi and its branches, and this riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and its branches afford many thousands of miles of navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable waters penetrating this territory in all its parts. The inhabitable grounds of Spain, below our boundary and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on the river, which alone can pretend any fear of being incommoded by our use of the river, are not the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth part of that extent. This vast portion of the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the United States, has no other outlet for its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, and these productions are of the bulkiest kind. And in truth their passage down the river may not only be innocent as to the Spanish subjects on the river, but from their nature might be made really advantageous to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial interests of Spain.</p>
                  <p>If we appeal to the law of nature and nations as express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those writers on the subject whose authority is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all, it is agred by them that were the river, where it passes between Florida and Louisiana the exclusive right
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028743_0037_0FDBE9CBA020C310"/>
of Spain, still innocent passage along it, is a natural right in those inhabiting its borders above; it would indeed be what those writers call an imperfect right, because the mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ification of its exercise would depend in a considerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree on the conveniency of the nation through which they are to pass. But it is still a right as real as any other right however well defined: and were it to be refused or to be shackled by regulations not necessary for the peace or safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its inhabitants, so as to render its use impracticable, it would then be an injury of which they would be entitled to demand redress.</p>
                  <p>The right of the upper inhabitants to use this navigation, is the counterpart to that of those possessing the shores be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and founded in the same natural relations with the soil and water; and the line at which their rights meet, is to be advanced or withdrawn, so as to equalize the inconveniences resulting to each party, from the exercise of the right by the other.</p>
                  <p>This estimate is to be fairly made with a mutual disposition to make equal sacrifices, and the numbers on each side are to have their due weight in the estimate—Spain holds so very small a tract of habitable land on either side below our boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary, that it may in fact be considered as a streight of the sea. For though it is 80 leagues from our boundary to the mouth of the river, yet it is only here and there, in spots and slips, that the land rises above the level of the water, in times of inundation. There are then, and ever must be, so few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants on her part of the river, that the freeest use of its navigation may be allowed to us, without inconvenience to Spain.</p>
