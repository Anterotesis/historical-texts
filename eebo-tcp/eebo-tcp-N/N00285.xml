            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THis Psalm is thought by some Interpreters to be pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>David</hi> after the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God had appeared to him, and designed the place where he should build an Altar at present, and where afterward the Temple was to be built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> pointing, as it were, to the place which the Lord had chosen to cause his Name to dwell there; as it is said, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 11.

his favour is restored to his People, after the darkness and calamities of former times were passed over.

many places in this lower world whither men may repair, so there are many paths or wayes that directly lead thereunto; but as to the other World, there are but two places to which all our actions tend, and to one of which they will certainly bring all that persist therein, <abbr>

that should be left to the second place: as our Saviour bids us <hi>seek first the Kingdom of heaven, and the righteousness thereof,</hi> Mat. 6. 33. He that seeks other things in the first place, and leaves the care of his Salvation, with <hi>Felix,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of <hi>Righteousness, Temperance and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come,</hi> to a more convenient season, doth not order his way aright, for that will bring him to an ill end at last. Thus <hi>Jehu</hi> ordered his way aright to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the ten Tribes, but quite wrong as to the Kingdom of God, when all his care was to walk in the way of <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> Idolatry, but took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of <hi>Israel</hi> with all his heart, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 31.</p>
                  <p>This ordering the way aright may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a threefold act of a Christian: <hi>First,</hi> of the mind, to judge and apprehend, what is the right, or the wrong way that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto life. To discern what is the principal thing to be desired. <hi>Secondly,</hi> an act of the affection to embrace, desire that way which is the most necessary and excellent. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An act of the Will,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000362_0014_0FA55558C8E75BA0"/>
for purpose and resolution to pursue that which is in it self most necessary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable. <hi>One thing have I desired of the Lord,</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>and that will I seek after,</hi> Psal. 27. 4. And our Saviour tells us, <hi>There is but one thing necessary,</hi> and he commends <hi>Mary</hi> for making her choice of that, and not cumbring her self with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that were not necessary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What is that Salvation of God which they shall see, who order their way aright? By salvation unto the people of God under the dispensation of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, was generally signified, preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or deliverance from any temporal evil that at any time they were pressed withal with obtaining the contrary good. Yet so as thereby, in a spiritual, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime sense was signified, Deliverance from all evil both of sin and judgment, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or eternal, which they had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obnoxious unto by their disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with the obtaining the favour of God towards them in the peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the good land, which they were possessed of, till they came to obtain

happiness of Gods Kingdom in the other World, of which the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a standing type and shadow. So Salvation is most frequently taken in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament; The obtaining of all that good both temporal and eternal, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily required to make any people or person, prosperous and happy, with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from all the evil which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereunto.</p>
                  <p>This is called Gods Salvation, not only as that which is in it self most eminent, or excellent; as excellent Cedars, are called Cedars of God: but because, 1. It is a Salvation which God only can give: as the Psalmist saith, elsewhere, <hi>Give us help from trouble, for vain is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And it is Gods salvation which his People seek for; and therefore <hi>David</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten stiles God <hi>his Salvation and his Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi> 2. A Salvation which God will give: For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

though it may seem never so improbable, and almost impossible; yet God will make them that order their way aright, to see his salvation at such a time. 3. It is also more emphatically expressed in the third person; <hi>Such a one shall be made to see the salvation of God.</hi> It was a time of great extremity in <hi>Samaria,</hi> in <hi>Jehoram's</hi> time: Death as well as Dearth was come upon them: There is a word of Salvation comes from the Lord by the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; which speaks of great plenty that should be forthwith in <hi>Samaria;</hi> God made it good, but the unbelieving Lord, though he saw it with his eyes, yet he never felt the good of Salvation, because he did not order his way aright, to give Glory to the God of Israel, by believing the word which he spake by his Prophet.</p>

                  <p>The words thus opened, do very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and of themselves run into this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or point of Doctrine:</p>
                  <q>Doct. A right ordered Conversation is the direct and necessary way for any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or person to obtain Gods Salvation.</q>
                  <p>The best improvement of this Doctrine will be, 1. By shewing wherein consists a well ordered Conversation. 2. By lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the salvation which such shall see. 3. Confirming this truth by such instances, and reasons, as may be found in our experience. 4. By answering such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections as look another way. 5. By ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such Application, as the nature of the truth requires.</p>

1. For the first of these, there are sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things necessary to a well ordered Conversation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A good beginning, or a sound prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within. He that doth not begin well, will never end well, if he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver alter his course. For he that sets out in a wrong way, the longer he continues therein, is gone further from the desired end (if Gods Salvation be that which was aimed at) then at his first entrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into. For so Christ tells the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that their proselytes are twofold more the Children of Hell, than they were before. They must not set out in the Flesh, that ever intend or hope to end in the Spirit. A good Tree is absolutely needful to good fruit; and so is a good heart unto a good life. If the Fountain be not clean, it will never send forth good Water in its Streams: for as <hi>James tells us, The same Fountain can never send forth sweet water and bitter.</hi> The heart must be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before the words and works will be found pure and perfect; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000362_0019_0FA5555EAFB36148"/>
the hands work, and the feet walks: the Index in a Clock points to those figures without, that the wheels within move un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The heart is the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> in this little World, that carries all the other <hi>Orbs</hi> of the <hi>thoughts, affections, senses,</hi> and <hi>Organs</hi> along with it. Since the <hi>Fall,</hi> the frame of every mans heart is bent to evil, <hi>only to evil, and that continually;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole frame of nature must be changed and turned about, before any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be made toward this salvation of God. There must be a gracious disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or inclination of the <hi>Will,</hi> whereby it comes to be determined to well-doing, before any hope of Salvation will be brought about: For as <hi>Ames</hi> saith well, It is the heart or will that is the proper seat and subject of virtue: Because, <q>

Lay before him as many Arguments, Reasons as may be of force to convince the most obstinate mind, and obdurate heart, so as he shall be forced to acknowledge that the precept is holy, just and good: the way directly tending unto life; yet till the heart be changed and over-poured by a work of supernatural grace, the life will alwayes be found barren of any good fruit, void of holiness, and sincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: yea many times none are found more vitious in their lives than such as have had the best advantage for piety, by their education? None ever proved worse Children than those who have had the best of men for their Parents, till their hearts were changed by the power of divine Grace, if ever they attained thereunto.

Thus as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 47, 48. <hi>The first man is of the earth earthy, the second man is of the Lord from Heaven.</hi> As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. Till there be a change wrought in the heart, that doth imprint the image of the heavenly <hi>Adam</hi> upon the Soul, there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an earthly Conversation, until we become born again from Heaven, it will never be said truly, that our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation is in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>This seems to be the reason why the Scripture lays so much weight upon the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000362_0022_0FA5556828D3F338"/>
uprightness, and obedience of the heart: <hi>My Son give me thy heart; And above all keepings keep the heart, for out of it are the issues of life,</hi> that is, the great wheel that carries all other powers and faculties along with it. And if the heart be nor changed by the infusing a new disposition, though you may by force imprint another moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the present, yet it will not hold long, unless it have a new nature stamped upon it. It will be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as a stone that may be by Engines forced upward, or as water heated by the fire, which retains their innate qualities, to which they will soon return again, and to that place of their center. Therefore he that would have his way set right, must begin with his heart, and get that changed, and put into a right frame, and then all the rest will follow. He that made the heart at first, and formeth the spirit of man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, must also make the heart anew, and renew a right spirit within every man, must renew it again: This is the sense of the Church of God in all ages as to this article of Religion, <hi>Turn us O God of our</hi>

The wrath of God which is revealed from Heaven, is against the ungodliness, and unrighteousness of Men, and therefore the way to enjoy the Salvation of God, and avoid the wrath which is to come, requires us in the first place to live godly in the present World, of which there are two Branches.</p>

How can two be said to walk together that are not agreed upon all the points of love and obedience, wherein they are concerned. As God was not liable to be taxed for breach of Covenant in any the least particular of his promises, so doth he threaten to make the <hi>Israelites</hi> know to their cost their insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the contrary; <hi>yea, shall know my breach of Covenant,</hi> Psal. 78.

                  <p>When of old the whole World dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from the true Religion and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and none was found Righteous but <hi>Noah,</hi> and a few in his Family; God
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000362_0058_0FA55592746089F0"/>
makes him and them only see the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</p>
                  <p>So afterwards, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. tis said <hi>David</hi> prospered whither soever he went, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst five several Nations at once, because his heart was right, and he ordered his way aright before God, he was made a lasting monument of Gods deliverance, as he had been a standing pattern of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Thus we may say with the Apostle in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> time would fail to speak of other Instances, upon whom this promise was made good, both before and after the captivity; who ever walked with God, and ordered their way aright before him, they were made to see the salvation of God in the midst of Armies, Lions Dens, Fiery Furnaces; and amongst multitudes of Enemies, who were all armed with envy and malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, as well as with force and power.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards as <hi>Ezrah</hi> ordered his way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in bringing up as many as he could perswade to attend thereunto out of the Captivity, and in seeking the face of God
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:000362_0059_0FA555936DA9D990"/>
by solemn Fasting and Prayer, so God caused him to see his Salvation more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately than if he had obtained a band of Horse-men from an Heathen; And <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> at another time, obtains favour in the sight of the man, as he desired, who had then all power under God in his hands, concerning the poor captive <hi>Jews;</hi> because he ordered his way aright, first to seek God by solemn Prayer, and then to go on couragiously without fearing the face of Man, especially such Sons of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and wickedness, as were <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> who though they pretended a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to help build the Temple of God at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> yet in their hearts were filled with rancour and enmity, and ready to gnash their teeth, that any came thither, that sought the welfare of the people of God.</p>
                  <p>As for the state of the Christian Church since Christs time, for the first three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, how mightily did the Word of God increase and prevail! The favour of the knowledge of Jesus Christ ever tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed in every place: the three mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:000362_0060_0FA55594023E7680"/>
of meal, <hi>i. e.</hi> the three parts of the World then known were leavened with the Doctrine of the Christian Religion; the whole World was in a manner over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread therewith, notwithstanding all the fury, rage and malice of their persecuting Enemies; he that sate upon the white Horse, with his Bow and his Crown, went on conquering to conquer, and did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. All this while they ordered their way aright; they set themselves by faith and patience to wait upon God, and were made to see his Salvation. When <hi>Israel</hi> came first out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if God had let them presently into the possession of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> before they had been inured to the difficulties of a War; God must miraculously have cut off all their Enemies to have put them in possession of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and then they would have been in danger to have been overcome with luxury, sensuality and security, as too soon came to pass afterwards: therefore God in his infinite wisdom did train them up to encounter with Marches and Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyings in the Wilderness, and then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000362_0061_0FA5559752660D70"/>
them with the difficulties of a long War, that they might learn Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by what they underwent: so in a manner were Gods dispensations toward the Christian World; God would not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously subdue them to the obedience of Faith; but by the labour and travel of the Ministry in holding forth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel, the word of Christs patience, least if it had been otherwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they should have grown secure and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and turned the Grace of God into lasciviousness; as many were too apt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: but presently after the winter of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity and Persecution was over and past, and the summer of prosperity came upon them, how soon were they, even the face of the whole Christian World over-run with a deluge of Impiety and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? how soon was the pure and choice Wine of the Gospel mingled with the <hi>Mara</hi> waters of the Curse, and their silver all become Dross?

But they that order their way aright, in the sense of the Text, shall sooner or later see the salvation of God.</p>

                     <pb n="56" facs="unknown:000362_0063_0FA5559CF9E09AC8"/>
The Reasons of this Point are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally these three:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. From the consideration of God, whose Name is engaged for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and salvation of his People. The perfections of the Almighty oblige him to shew his salvation to all them that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their way aright, and only to them that so do. His eyes run to and fro through the whole Earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect before him: then 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 9. his omnipotent arm is stretched out to save and deliver all such: <hi>walk before me, and be upright, I am God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient,</hi> saith <hi>God to Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17. 1. And as his hand is able to save them, so is his ear, as well as his eye open to their cry, <hi>Ps.</hi> 34. 15 yea, sometimes before they call God is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to answer, and whiles they are yet speaking he will hear, <hi>Isai.</hi> 65. 24. to the like purpose is that promise, <hi>Isai.</hi> 58. 9, 10. His word and faithfulness is engaged also, to save all the meek of the Earth: they whose hearts are lifted up in them, are not right before him, but humble, contrite
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:000362_0064_0FA5559DDCFC3250"/>
ones, are the people he is engaged to save and defend: yea he hath bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by his promise, in the 15 verse of this fiftieth Psalm, <hi>that if they call upon him in the day of trouble, he will answer them</hi> The face of the Lord is set against all them that do evil. He is an holy God, and therefore hath declared, that the evil shall not dwell with him: he hates the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Iniquity, and all them that turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side to their own crooked wayes: and his Justice is armed against them with ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to punish them. Not one <hi>iota</hi> of his threatnings shall pass away till all be fulfilled sooner or later upon all the wicked of the World, whose wayes are perverse before him. Yea, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared concerning all such, that when they spread forth their hands he will hide his eyes, and when they make many prayers he will not hear, because their hearts and hands are defiled with the guilt of sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. From the consideration of his People, who when they order their way aright, are in a meet capacity for mercy, and fit for salvation. In case of a peoples
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000362_0065_0FA5559E83829328"/>
continued obedience, they may plead Gods Covenant, that they are his People, he is obliged to be their God, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be their Saviour, and to do all that a God can do for them; and in case they have sinned, and done never so perversely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, yet if they order their way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, as to Repentance and Reformation, his Covenant doth then also oblige him to cause them to see his Salvation: this is expresly mentioned by <hi>Solomon</hi> at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Temple, when there was a solemn restipulation, or renewing of Covenant between God and his People, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. when God appeared unto <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> as is expressed in the 14<hi>th</hi> verse of the next Chapter; he seems to assent to all those Articles; <hi>If my People, who are called by my Name, shall humble themselves and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked wayes, then will I hear from Heaven and forgive their sin, and will heal their Land,</hi> in respect of all those Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties insisted on at large in the former cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, and briefly summed up in the former verse. They shall be made to see the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:000362_0066_0FA5559F302656F8"/>
of God delivering them from all those evils, or what ever else might be conceived to befal them. It may be said of such an holy, or such an humbled Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they are a people prepared for the Lord; ready for the salvation of the Lord, and it shall not be long before they see it. Salvation shall be for Gates and Bulwarks to such a People: so was it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and the people in his time; who had sought the Lord, and did by Faith rely upon him; <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is now walled about with Salvation: the proud <hi>Assyrian</hi> shall not be able to shoot an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row over such Bulwarks, much less shall he be able to break through those Gates of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>This is an experience confirmed of old to the Faith of a believing People, ever since <hi>Jacob'</hi>s time: no doubt he had been humbled for his deceiving his Father, and was reconciled to God, before he took his journey into <hi>Padan-aram,</hi> and therefore now he can plead the Covenant of God, and put the Almighty in mind of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; <hi>Thou saidst thou wilt bless me;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:000362_0067_0FA5559FF08D9890"/>
                     <hi>Jacob</hi> shall be made to see Gods Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in the midst of those dangers he is surrounded with. Thus if his People stir up themselves to lay hold of his strength, they shall see the salvation of God in their utmost perils.</p>
                  <p>God did afterwards make the way of his Precepts plain before his Servants in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomie;</hi> instructing them how they should walk before him in the enjoying, and improving that good Land they were going to possess; how they should till and dress it, how they should reap it, and dispose of the fruits thereof; if they could then say, when they came with their Oblations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 13, 14, 15. <hi>I have brought away the hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things out of my house,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I have not transgressed thy Commandments, neither have I forgotten them,</hi> &amp;c. Then might they also add what is in the 15<hi>th</hi> verse, <hi>Look down from thy holy Habitation, from Heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the Land which thou hast given us, as thou swa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>est to our Fathers:</hi> Thus having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their way aright, they might with
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000362_0068_0FA555A0CEABE7B8"/>
confidence and comfort, expect to see the Salvation of God. When a People so walk, as that they can approve themselves to God himself, as <hi>Abraham, I know</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>that he will not only himself keep the way of the Lord, but command his hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold after him to keep the same;</hi> It may then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> expected that God will bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the good which he hath spoken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. From the consideration of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the World. If such a People that order their wayes aright in their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walking with God, or that so frame their doings as to turn unto the Lord their God, if at any time they should humble themselves before him, and yet should not see the salvation of God, what would the wicked and ungodly of the World say, but that it is in vain to serve God? And what advantage is there in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, and keeping the whole Law of God? if they are like to be plagued as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; it will be in vain to alter their course and live otherwayes than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="unknown:000362_0069_0FA555A1741F3748"/>
This were certainly to sin against the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the just, in the midst of whom God is alwayes wont to be found. God will therefore have it known in the world, that there is great recompence of reward in keeping the Law of the Lord, and that though the righteous scarcely are saved, yet saved they shall be, whatever become of others. Let <hi>Balak</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire together to enchant the Tents of <hi>Israel,</hi> and lay stumbling blocks before their Feet, yet some shall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>nd in the midst of them, so to order their wayes, as that they shall be able to save the rest. They may else plead with God as <hi>Joshuah</hi> once did in such an exigent, when <hi>Israel</hi> did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the salvation of God in a Military expedition, <hi>And what wilt thou do for thy great Name?</hi> Josh 7. 9. But <hi>Joshuah</hi> is bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not to be discouraged; let God alone to look after the glory of his own, if his People do but look after themselves, and order their way aright, God will make all the rest of the Nations to behold the glory of his Salvation: God is able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Obj. <hi>But notwithstanding all these great and glorious things that are spoken of the City of God; there lies this great stumbling block in the way of natural men, that they never can get over; yea, which the Saints themselves are oft times at a great set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can see through it: they observe that though those who are called the people of God, order their wayes never so right; yet they see the salvation of God no more than other men. They bear them complain with</hi> Asaph, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. <hi>Though they cleansed their hearts, and washed their hands, yet all is in vain, they are yet plagued like other men all the day long, and chastened every morning. And with the Church in</hi> Psal. 44. We are counted but as sheep for the slaughter, yet is not our heart turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for thy sake are we filled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

dayes Pestilence in <hi>Davids</hi> time, the Lord, sends out an Inhibition to the Angel that destroyed the People. For now <hi>David</hi> and the people are sufficiently humbled, therefore God is willing to be reconciled, &amp; accept them into terms of favour again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and doth also then signally discover the place he had chosen for his Name to reside in. It may certainly be said unto every humbled, penitent, believing person, as Christ said to his Disciples, they shall see the Kingdom of God, and obtain his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and if they do not live to see a temporal salvation in this world, they shall be sure not to miss of eternal salvation at the last. Now let every one chuse what he would have, to be saved from the wrath that is to come, that shall destroy the world of the ungodly at last, or to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from trouble and danger here, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and all People: for some have observed that the long continued success, and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of their heathen Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> was a reward of their justice, temperance, and industry. So was it in the dayes of <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> and other good Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi> But if God should see cause for a time, out of his infinite wisdom and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, to change the hands of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and lay the left hand of favour and prosperity upon the younger &amp; less deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he is a soveraign Ruler and may do what he will with his own; he may afflict his people in this life, and prosper the wicked for a time, for ends best known to himself; yet all this while, he is near unto his people in all they call upon him for, to uphold and preserve them in, and carry them through all their sufferings, and make them see his eternal salvation at last. None of these things, <hi>sc.</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tribulations, and crosses moved the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> so he might finish his course with joy. They needed not much trouble themselves whatever become of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, if they can say with respect to their

If the body be lost, destroyed by the elements, returned to its first principles, or reduced into the minutest Atomes, yet all shall be gathered together again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and raised up in a state of greater Glory and beauty, than ever it was laid down in; 'Twas observed that the spirit of Glory rested upon the primitive Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and Confessors, so as there enemies were not able to behold the refulgence of them. 'Twas said of <hi>Stephen,</hi> that they were not able to resist the wisdom, and spirit, by which he spake; and that as he saw heaven opened, the Glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, so they saw his face, as if it had been the face of an Angel. This might be said to be extraordinary.

The Lord Jesus was never seen more glorious on earth, than in that apparrel which was dyed red, and stained with the blood of his enemies, when he speaks in righteousness, mighty to save.

So as notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing God may have made a Covenant with his People ordered in all things and sure, as to their eternal salvation, yet there may be cause for God to visit them with temporal calamities and evils which they

After the return from the captivity, when it might have been thought, that they had received double for their sin, and that therefore now their warefare should be accomplished, and that now from that time foreward, nothing but the oyl of comfort should be poured into their wounds; yet you will find their suffrings were not quite ended: many clouds of threatning evil did continually arise, which much darkned their hopes of a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led time of tranquility. A messenger that came from <hi>Judah</hi> informs <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that the remnant of the captivity who were left then in the province were in great affliction and reproach, which made him sit down and weep, and mourn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes: that in all that long tract of time, from <hi>Cyrus</hi> his dayes, to that time

Faith is the substance of things hoped for: It gives Subsistence, &amp; Being to the things that are hoped for: such as walk before God in a right way, may conclude he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful who hath promised, who also will do it.

to place his Engine upon, he would raise the whole body of the Earth out of its Center: it was a great speech, but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ingeny will never be able to out-vye Theology. Faith can do greater things than natural strength or skill. Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable word is a foundation for Faith to rest upon while it accomplishes all things that are needful for Salvation.

Therefore seeing God hath promised <hi>that such shall see his Salvation,</hi> they may believe it.

The cause of removal of such as these is the sin of those they belong unto. For the transgression of a People many are the Princes thereof.

                  <p n="2">2. Another part of wisdom is to pitch upon the right manner, after the

end is discovered; many a man fails in the compassing or bringing about the great and main design of his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and security for lack of this wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: He that foreseeth the evils if he doth not betake himself to a right shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may be overtaken therewith, though he hath foreseen it: When <hi>Israel</hi> saw his wound he sent to King <hi>Jareb;</hi> so did <hi>Ahaz,</hi> but that did not heal or help them, but plunged them further into the depth of their misery. Suppose we have rightly judged of the end, be it an evil to be avoided, that may be like to ruin us; or a good to be desired to make us happy; if we take an indirect course, for the one or the other, we may get a curse instead of a blessing or run into a greater mischief than that which we intended to avoid: He that makes use of lawful means, as one sayes, to bring about an unlawful end, doth as it were put God into the Devils service, as he that does evil, that good may come thereon, puts the Devil into Gods service

both which are abominable. True wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom brings all circumstances into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, which are to be weighed in the ballance; and what means, with all circumstances considered is the most proper to accomplish the end propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded is only to be made use of. When the Iron is blunt, wisdom must be had to direct, whether more sharpness in the Instrument, or more strength in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent be best to be improved: wisdome must teach men when to answer a Fool according to his folly, and when not. There is a time to speak, and a time to keep silence; wisdome must determine by circumstances, when the the time of the one, or the other is. <hi>Non minus est magna virtus scire desiner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the very hinge on which hung the weight of the whole business which none of the rest discerned but <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel.</hi> Thus a wise mans heart discerns both time and judgment as well the time when, as the matter, what is to be done.

                  <p n="3">3. He is a wise man that is cautious to redeem the time, as well as to discern it.

As on the other hand, he that is slothful in business is brother to a great waster; Through the slothfulness of the hands the house will drop through, and so be ruined, as well as if it were pulled down by the hands of foolishness. The vineyard of the slothful is over-run with Thistles and Thorns (which with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence might have abounded with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant fruits) so is the heart of the sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Professor with lusts of the Flesh.</p>

5. The prudent man is no changling: He that orders his affairs with discretion, doth not dance up and down like a meteor in the Air, <hi>but his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord:</hi> Those men of old called <hi>Homines quadrati,</hi> that are always steady, resting on their Basis, and not turning and rowling from one side to an other; not like quick-silver, running every way, but fixed no where.

There is nothing that more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tends to confusion in Church or State, than for persons of principal place

His wisdom will not let him be slack handed, for thereby he will run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind hand with his great Creditor: <hi>As</hi> his diligence maketh him take the fittest time wherein to sow his seed early or late, so his wisdom teacheth him so much liberality, as not to sow sparingly lest he reap sparingly; for according to our work shall be our Reward. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth suggest to him, that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to give than to receive; as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of him that lendeth, is better than of him that borroweth to whom the other is a kind of Servant. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence did suggest it as an advantage to the unjust Steward to bestow his Goods where he might receive after benefit
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:000362_0155_0FA5560B429B2CE0"/>
thereby, though his unrighteousness did not commend it as a Duty. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that <hi>David</hi> uses to encourage himself and his People to give liberally toward the building of the Temple, was because they were Strangers and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journers before God, as all their Fathers were, and their dayes on the Earth were as a shadow, and there was no abiding, 1 <hi>Chron</hi> 25. 15. As if they had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that by reason of the brevity of their lives, they could not perpetually enjoy those things that were in their possession, they did out of meer devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and piety consecrate the same to him from whom they had received all their Wealth and Estate, who they knew out of his meer bounty would requite them with eternal life and glory; there is no abiding of our time upon the earth nor of our riches in our hands, which may take them to their wings, and Fly away as a bird toward Heaven; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wisdom teaches them to give while they may. So also on the same ground

Wisdom makes men deliberate, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised in their actions, sedate and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in their spirits; with the well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised there is wisdom: They that do things over hastily, may have too much time to repent afterward. <hi>A man of understanding</hi> saith Solomon, <hi>is of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent spirit,</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>of a Cool,</hi> i. e. <hi>Sedate, Composed temper,</hi> not too much over heated with the fire of Anger: <hi>Be not hasty</hi> saith he also, <hi>to go out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of him who hath power to do what he pleaseth.

It was the Observation of</hi> Solomon <hi>the wisest of men, and seconded by the experience of all future times, that only by Pride cometh Contention, as it is written by a very learned Pen: And that emulation about wisdom, wealth and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness have put the whole Earth into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion.
