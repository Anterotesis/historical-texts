            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Since you could not hear, I am willing you should see (if you shall think it worth your Perusal) what I then delivered, not doubting but that you will <hi>Seek the Wealth of your People,</hi> who are dear to Christ, and by the Letters you were pleased to send to me when in <hi>England,</hi> I perceive that they are so to you.</p>
                  <p>In the first place I Congratulate your safe Arival to your <hi>Country,</hi> and to your Desirable Relations, after so long an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. A mercy which doubtless you

For He has trusted you with <hi>Five Talents,</hi> for every one of which you know Sir, that you must be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Him who has given them to you. He has blessed you with rare accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both natural and acquired; &amp; has now put into your hands a <hi>Talent</hi> of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Authority, as that there is no Person in all <hi>New England,</hi> so advantaged to Serve and Honour Christ, by promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Welfare of these His Churches, as you are.

                  <p>Your Honourable Father (whose Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is blessed) has a lasting Monument Erected for him in <hi>New-Englands Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>; wherein 'tis truly affirmed of Him, that <hi>He was a principal Founder and Pillar of the Colony of the</hi> Massachusetts, <hi>and that He was a Nursing Father to these Churches of Christ; one that loved the true Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, &amp; the pure Worship of God, &amp; Cherished as in his Bosome all Godly Ministers &amp; Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

Churches not long since a <hi>Testimony</hi> wherein were these words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concerning all sinful attempts to overturn the</hi> Order of the Gospel <hi>hitherto upheld in the Churches of</hi> New-England, <hi>and to spoil that Glorious Work of God which we have seen Him doing with a</hi> Series <hi>of</hi> Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Providence, <hi>in Erecting such</hi> Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational <hi>Churches, we would now bear our</hi> Testimony, <hi>That they are doubtless displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to our Lord Iesus Christ, who</hi> Walks in the midst of these Golden Candlesticks, <hi>and they will prove bitterness in the latter end.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Representatives</hi> of the <hi>General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi> then Sitting did express so much concern for the Churches, as to Vote their <hi>Thanks</hi> should be rendred unto those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Persons for this their faithful <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony.</hi> At which time also one of them, (namely Mr. <hi>Higginson</hi>) did in a Letter, all drawn up with his own hand recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that matter which is in the Sermon emitted here with again proposed. In which Letter are the following words.</p>

                     <hi>I look upon it as my Duty, in a few Lines (that may not be mistaken) to Declare unto your selves,</hi> That I did and do own that
<pb facs="unknown:001076_0007_0FAFDEDF765608C0"/>
Testimony [<hi>above mentioned</hi>] as my own Act and Deed, <hi>and also to give an Account of my Reasons for my so doing.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>First, Because I desire to be found among the number of the</hi> Witnesses <hi>of our Lord Iesus Christ, who said of Himself,</hi> Joh. 18 37. For this end was I born, &amp; for this cause came I into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth, <hi>and Act.</hi> 1.8. Ye shall be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses unto me. <hi>Now</hi> I believe with my heart, and do confess with my mouth; <hi>That the</hi> Platform of Discipline (<hi>for the substance, end and scope thereof) doth contain such a part of the Truth of Christ relating to his Kingdom, and the Order of His Churches that I dare not but bear witness unto it, and against any that shall Rise up in opposition thereunto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Because I desire to be found amongst the Number of the Followers of those Holy men of God who composed it, who were our Fathers and Elders, and who lived and dyed in the practice of the same Truth, and who yet speak to us from the Dead,</hi> Be you <hi>Followers of us, as we followed Christ.</hi> 1 Cor. 11.1.</p>
                  <p>

                        </gap>him</hi> a Son of the high Priest wrote this book at the desire of <hi>Mordecai.</hi> It is not necessary for us to know who was the Author, as long as we know that whoever it were, he was divinely &amp; so infallibly inspired in what he delivered unto us. The Church of the old Testament to whom were committed the Oracles of God, did with great care preserve them. And with them this book was not only esteemed as Sacred, but they had a more then ordinary veneration for it. It is (as indeed the greatest part of the Scripture is) Historical. We have therein an account of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001076_0013_0FAFDEE3F793BCC8"/>
as great a distress, and as wonderful a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Church of God, as ever hapned in any age of the World; which came to pass in the days of <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> one of the Kings of <hi>Persia:</hi> but which of those Kings is controverted: <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureus</hi> is a Persian word, signifying one that has Majesty. The dignity of the person is signified thereby, but it is not a proper name to distinguish one man from another. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a common name to all the Kings of Egypt, and <hi>Caesar</hi> to the Roman Emperors, so was <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> to the Kings of the <hi>Medes</hi>; and of such Persian Kings as were of the <hi>Median</hi> blood. But there are chiefly two persons concerned in the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Book, who were near Relations, both of them good, and at last great ones. One was <hi>Esther</hi> made a Queen of <hi>Persia,</hi> who was born for the welfare of her People. The Jews there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call this Book <hi>Megillath Esther,</hi> the <hi>Volumn of Esther,</hi> because she is the principal person spoken of in it. The other great and good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son treated of therein is <hi>Mordecai</hi> the Jew. Of whom three particulars are noted in this verse. (1) His advancement, <hi>He was next unto the King. i. e.</hi> next in Power and Authority. He was under the King the chief Ruler. (2) Here is noted the Esteem which he had with them that were both his own and also the Lords people: He was <hi>great among them, i. e</hi> greatly esteemed and honoured by them. <hi>And accepted of the Multitude of his brethren.</hi> Commonly if
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001076_0014_0FAFDEE4B93FC6E8"/>
a man is advanced he is envied of his brethren It was not so with him; his brethren rejoyced at his prosperity. (3) We have his behaviour under his Advancement, in the words before us to insist on. He did as became one in so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick a station. He shewed that he was a man of a Publick Spirit. The providence of God put into his hand a great opportunity to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage himself, as to his own secular Interests, but his heart was rather set upon promoting the welfare of his people. He <hi>sought good for them,</hi> as the Original carries it. <hi>i. e.</hi> He endeavoured both by word and deeds to promove those things which would be for their good. And this is written in the Book of God to the everlasting renown of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and for the instruction of others that shall read or hear of it.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine which the words afford unto us, is,</p>
                  <p>That as Rulers ought to be of a Publick Spirit, Seeking the Welfare of their People, so when they are such, it will be to their lasting Renown</p>

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001076_0015_0FAFDEE575D24E18"/>
concerning Truth. The Commandment which says, <hi>Love thy Neighbour as thy self,</hi> enjoyns this on every man. Therefore dos the Scripture say, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 24 <hi>Let no man seek his own,</hi> that is to say, not that only, <hi>but every mans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers wealth</hi> So then every man ought to be of a Publick Spirit.

                  <p>This will appear if we consider what things are implied in a Publick Spirit.</p>

of your particular friends, as for the Publick Calamity which is coming on the Nation: In this did our Saviour Christ give the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a publick Spirit: He shewed more concernedness for the misery of others, than for his own particular sorrows, though they were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ever any mans, when he said to the daughters of Jerusalem, <hi>Weep not for me, but weep for your selves and for your Children, Luk</hi> 23.28. And when he considered what was coming on that City, He wept over it, because they knew not the things that concerned their peace, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19 41. Most of all the concernments of the Church of God should ly near to our hearts. <hi>Vriah</hi> shewed that a pious and publick Spirit ruled in him, when he had more regard to the condition of the Lords People, and of the Ark of God, than to his own domestick concerns.

them by the King He was <hi>a man that sought the welfare of the Children of Israel, Neh</hi> 2 10. He endeavoured it with all his might. Saying and wishing without real endeavours and deeds, is not seeking.

So <hi>Mordecai</hi> in this way sought the wealth of his people; it is therefore said in the next words, that he did <hi>speak peace</hi> to <hi>all his Seed.</hi> When any of them resorted to him, notwithstanding his advancement, he received them with much courtesie and kindness; but the words may be read thus, <hi>Seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace</hi> for <hi>his Seed,</hi> that is for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men who were of the same blood with him. Then the meaning of the words is, that he improved his interest in the King and Court of <hi>Persia</hi> for the good of those that were both his and the Lords people. It is noted in the first verse of this Chapter, that the King laid a Tribute on all his Subjects, both on the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and in the Islands; which probably was by the advice of <hi>Mordecai:</hi> only some Writers have said, that <hi>Mordecai</hi> prevailed with the King not to impose that Tribute on his <hi>Iewish</hi> Subjects.</p>

The Jewish Writers have a Celebrated saying among them, <hi>That if the Sea were Ink, and the Heavens Parchment both would not be enough to Write down the Praises which are due to God for Liberty.</hi> Now civil Liberties are secured by the Establishment of Righteous Laws for that end.

I have often thought on what I heard a Worthy man (and a great Friend of <hi>New England</hi>) speak to the President of the Kings most Honourable Privy-Council.
<q>I (said he) know the people of <hi>New-England</hi> very well; I was once there, I know they are a weak peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and full of humors. Nevertheless they are a people that belong to God: And therefore let me pray your Lordship to be kind to them, &amp; the God of Heaven will reward you for it</q>
So let me say to Counsellors, to Ministers, to Representatives, &amp; to others also, do all that you can to promote the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the dear people in <hi>New England,</hi> because many of them are dear to God, who has purchased them with his own blood: Then Christ will take what you do to them as done to himself. All the men in the world will believe this to be true, in that day which is at hand, when we shall all see Jesus Christ the Son of God sitting on the Throne of his Glory, and hear him pronounce those words, with which I conclude.

                  <p>IN this Chapter we have an account of three men that came to <hi>Abraham</hi> when he dwelt in the Plains of <hi>Mamre</hi>; which men were indeed Angels, only called men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did appear in Humane Shape; <hi>Abraham</hi> supposing them to be Travellers, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously invited them to refresh themselves with him; and so did as the Apostle speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, <hi>Entertain Angels at unawares.</hi> He applied himself to one above the rest; the reason of his doing so is not mentioned, but probably he observed that the other Angels did show peculiar respect to that Person. And afterward he pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ceived that He was not a Created Angel, but Christ the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God; for he calls him, <hi>the Iudge of all the Earth,</hi> which Title is peculiar to the Son
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001076_0053_0FAFDF8CB63486A0"/>
of God. And in this Verse, and in several other places in this Chapter, He is called <hi>Iehovah,</hi> which is a name that may not be given to any Angel or Creature, but to Him alone who is the only true God. Two of the Angels went to the City of <hi>Sodom,</hi> so that <hi>Abraham</hi> was left with the Lord alone, who having intimated to him his purpose to destroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> because of the exceeding wickedness of that place, the Holy man with great humility and importunity beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of God, that he would spare them And that prayer he made no less than six times over: The argument he makes use of, is taken from the consideration of the merciful and equitable proceedings of God towards men.</p>
                  <p>He mentions it as a thing most undoubtedly true, <hi>That the Iudge of all the Earth would do right</hi>; whereas if he should inflict equal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment on those that have been unequal Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors, that would not seem to be right. He was concerned lest the Name of God should suffer, and therefore prays that God would for the sake of the Righteous spare the wicked, or however spare the Righteous themselves. This verse is the Lords gracious Answer to <hi>Abrahams</hi> first request. It may be (says he) there are fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty righteous men in the City, and wilt not thou spare them for their sakes. The Lord in the words before us declared that if he found so many in that wicked place, he would spare the whole City for the sake of such a small number
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001076_0054_0FAFDF8D763F7B50"/>
of Righteous Ones. The Doctrine which the words afford unto us, is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Wicked men while in this world fare the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the sake of Righteous men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We shall first premise some Conclusions for the clearing and right understanding of the truth now before us. And then proceed to mention some things which are evidences of it.</p>
                  <p>Conclusion 1. <hi>That God is sometimes so provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the sins of the wicked, that he will not spare them for the sake of the Righteous.</hi> So that this must not be understood as an universal <hi>standing Rule.</hi> The Lords condescending thus far to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> at this time, was not to intimate that if there be any Righteous men in a place, that then that place shall not fall under destroying Judgments. In the days of <hi>Elijah</hi> there were seven thousand who had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> Yet Drought, and Famine, and Sword, (destroying judgments) came on the Land, notwithstanding there were some thousands of Righteous men therein. A fatal overthrow came on the Land of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> by the Sword of <hi>Persia,</hi> when all the good men in the world were in that Land. Sometimes God is so highly provoked at the Sins of wicked men, at that although righteous men set themselves to deprecate impending Judgments, he becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001076_0055_0FAFDF8E374137C8"/>
no intreaties will prevail with him to stay his hand. When there was a sore drought upon the Land, the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> did ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly pray that the Judgment might be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. God gave him a flat denial, and told him, that instead of removing that Judgment, he would bring others that should be greater; and added moreover, <hi>though Moses and Samuel stood before him yet his mind could not be toward that</hi> people, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15 1. <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Samuel</hi> are instanced in, because God for their sakes had more than once spared a sinful people, but then he would not do it. There is a Scripture in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> like that in <hi>Ieremiah, viz.</hi> that, Ezek. 14, 14. <hi>Though these three men,</hi> Noah, Daniel <hi>and</hi> Job <hi>were in it, they should deliver but their own Souls by their righteousness.</hi> And many times it has been so, that destroying Judgments have come on Cities, Provinces, Nations, in which there have been not fifty, but many hundreds, it may be thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of righteous men; yea many holy Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Lord Jesus Christ. When once a sinful people have filled up the measure of their iniquity, there is no preventing the judgment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined against them. It is said, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.23, 24. <hi>When the Transgressors are come to the full, a King of fierce countenance shall arise and destroy wonderfully.</hi> When the transgressors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews were come to the full, <hi>Antiochus</hi> whom Historians describe to be one of a fierce countenance, was by the dreadful Providence of
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001076_0056_0FAFDF8EF6A9F520"/>
God set over them as their King, who proved a bloody Persecutor and Destroyer of that people, notwithstanding their being the holy People. So then that is the first <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Conclusion 2. <hi>Although when destroying Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come upon a People, the Divine Providence does sometimes make a difference between the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the Wicked, nevertheless it is not always so.</hi> Sometimes God in his Providence does ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry signally discriminate between those he has a favour for, and others. When the Egyptians were visited with ten plagues, the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were preserved. When <hi>Sodom</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, righteous <hi>Lot</hi> escaped. <hi>Barak</hi> had his life given to him for a prey, when others were swept away with a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>som of destruction</p>
                  <p>It was said to the Church in <hi>Philadelphia, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast kept the word of my patience, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world. Rev</hi> 3 10. When the <hi>Babylonians</hi> laid <hi>Ierusalem</hi> waste, some who were Mourners in <hi>Zion,</hi> experienced signal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Salvations. And so it was with the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Iews</hi> at that time when utter desolation came on <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the <hi>Roman</hi> Sword. God did by a miraculous Providence distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them from others, according to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi's</hi> Prophesy. <hi>Then shall ye return and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between the righteous and the wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him that serveth God, and him that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001076_0057_0FAFDF8FB63574E8"/>
him not. Mal.</hi> 3.18. Thus it came to pass. The Lord Jesus Christ had intimated to his Disciples, that when they should see <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> compassed about with armies, they should know that the destruction of it is near, and that therefore they should go out of the City to some other place for safety. When the <hi>Romans</hi> came to take the City, they did by a strange Providence withdraw their Seige. The Christians remembring the words of Christ went out of the City to <hi>Pella,</hi> a Town beyond the River <hi>Iordan,</hi> when they were gone, the Roman Army came again and never broke up the Seige until they had destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and utterly ruined the City. Thus did the Lord make a difference between the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the wicked; then also was another Prophesie fulfilled, <hi>viz.</hi> that, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>32. <hi>It shall come to pass that whoever calls upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved.</hi> The Christian <hi>Iews</hi> that <hi>Called on the name of the Lord Iesus Christ</hi> were saved, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were destroyed. And to be sure, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes on the world, God will secure &amp; save a number of Righteous ones: So that he will have a Church here on the Earth, whatsoever Confusions and Overturnings may come upon Nations and Kingdoms; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the seventh of the <hi>Revelations</hi> the first verse, we read of <hi>four Angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the winds that
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001076_0058_0FAFDF90862E0418"/>
they should not blow on the earth.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that a terrible Storm was a coming on the whole world, and such a stormy wind as should overset Kingdoms, and pluck up Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the roots, but says Christ in the 3d. <hi>verse, hurt not the Earth, neither the Sea, nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of our God in their foreheads.</hi> A Seal is sometimes for notification, as well as for confirmation; like that of the Blood being sprinkled on the doors of the houses of the Children of <hi>Israel.</hi> Hereby is noted, how God does sometimes signally preserve his Righteous ones. When the world is turning up side down, they are as safe as things that have the <hi>Seal Royal</hi> on them, which may not be medled with.

And which is a sadder truth, righteous men may through temptation fall into such sins as shall bring temporal judgments on themselves and others too.

The like is to be said of <hi>David</hi> when he numbred the people; and <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphat</hi> when he did too much comply with an ungodly Interest, 2 Chron. 19.2. <hi>Shouldst thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therefore wrath from the Lord is on thee:</hi> And what was that wrath? why in the next Chapter you see how there was a great force from beyond Sea, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Moabites,</hi> who dwelt on the other side of the <hi>dead Sea,</hi> and other E<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nemies coming to invade the Land, and this to punish <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> a good man for his sinful compliances; so then righteous men may suffer with the wicked.

13 29 the Servants would have been plucking up the tares, no says the Lord, let them alone, <hi>lest you pluck up the wheat also.</hi> The truth is, that the world stands for the sake of a few righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men in it.

Then 'tis for their sakes that the world stands; when all the Elect are called and snatched out of the world (as it will be at the last and great day) then devouring fire shall come and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all the wicked.

                  </p>
                  <p>We have the like comparison to this in other Scriptures. These words seem to allude to the 24th. of <hi>Numbers</hi> 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where it is said, <hi>A Star shall rise out of Iacob, and shall smite the corners of Moab</hi>; which words altho' they were partly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in <hi>David,</hi> who smote <hi>the Corners,</hi> that is to say, <hi>the Princes</hi> of <hi>Moab,</hi> nevertheless they are chiefly to be understood concerning Christ, and the Spiritual <hi>Moab</hi> that has been and shall be smitten by him. Again, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.28. Christ says, <hi>to him that overcomes I will give the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Star</hi>; when Christ gives himself with all his benefits to the Believer, than does he give him the <hi>Morning Star.</hi> For clearing the Doctrine, we shall, (1.) Inquire into the <hi>Similitude,</hi> &amp; (2.) The <hi>Dissimilitude</hi> which is in this comparison.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, <hi>In what respect is the Lord Iesus Christ compared to a Star, and in special to the Morning Star</hi>? For Answer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Stars are very glorious Creatures.</hi> Although there is a great difference among them as to their glory. Some Stars are of the first, others of the second, some of the sixth magnitude, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers are wont to distinguish. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle says, 1 Cor. 15.41. <hi>That one Star differs from another in glory</hi>; nevertheless, they are all glorious Creatures; and they are a glory and an ornament to that Heaven where God has set
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001076_0078_0FAFDFA1B72B0430"/>
them; therefore is it said, Job 26.13. <hi>He has garnished the Heavens</hi>; and how? namely with Stars that glitter there. How do the Heavens glitter in a clear Starry Night! Thus Christ is most glorious: When he appeared in Humane Shape to the Elders of <hi>Israel, Exod.</hi> 24 10. there seemed to be <hi>under his feet as it were a Saphire Stone, and the body of heaven in its clearness.</hi> A Saphire Stone is a glorious Gem full of beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful specks resembling Stars. In like sort did Christs glory then appear. And there is no Star tho' of the greatest magnitude that is such an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the second Heaven, as Christ is, yea as the Humane Nature of Christ is to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens where he now does shine with inexpressible glory. Therefore 'tis said, <hi>That the Lamb</hi> (that is Christ) <hi>is the light and glory of the Heavenly Ierusalem. Rev.</hi> 21.23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Stars are not subject unto such mutation as sublunary Bodies are.</hi> They are of perpetual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and therefore it is a phrase in Scripture, <hi>as the days of heaven,</hi> to intimate perpetual dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Some observe that it is commonly a sign of a fair day if the morning Star is seen. To be sure the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ did foretel a happy day unto the world. The Angel said to the Shepherds, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 2, 10 <hi>I bring you glad Tidings of great joy which shall be to all People, for unto you is born this day a Saviour even Christ the Lord</hi> So when Christ appears spiritually to the Souls of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This may be a special reason why Christ here in this Book of <hi>Revelation</hi> is represented as <hi>the Morning Star,</hi> because in this Book he does bring glad Tidings unto the World; He brings Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of his own coming, as in the Context be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, <hi>Behold I come quickly.</hi> In the Morning if you see this Star, you may conclude that the Sun will quickly arise upon the world.

When the Saints in glory shall come down from Heaven and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to their Bodies, and reside here on earth, during the glorious dispensation of Judgment, then comes the New Jerusalem down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And Christ brings to the Church glad Tidings of such a day. He is then fitly resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled unto the Morning Star: Thus for the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.

                  <p n="2">2. To the <hi>Dissimilitude,</hi> which is between Christ, and the Morning Star.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Morning Star shines with a borrowed light.</hi> It is in it self a dark body, as all the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets are. The Morning Star would have no Splendor at all in it, were it not for the Sun that shines on it: but Christ shines with a light that is from himself. And although 'tis true concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Humane nature of Christ, that the glory of it is received, yet tis received from himself, that is to say, from his Divine nature therefore Christ said to the Jews, <hi>Ioh</hi> 2 19 <hi>Destroy this Temple.</hi> No doubt but (as some have observed) that when Christ spake these words he pointed to his own Body, <hi>and in three days I will raise it up.</hi> Christs Resurrection, so his Ascension and Glorification was from himself, from his Divine nature.</p>

To worship the <hi>Morning Star</hi> as the Gentiles of old were wont to do, under the name of <hi>Venus,</hi> and as some <hi>Arabians</hi> do (at this day) is idolatry, and a horrible sin: but to worship the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is our duty.

It may be (as some of the Ancients thought) it was an Angel appearing in the form of a Star. But by this the Wise men of the East knew that it was their Duty to worship the Lord Jesus Christ. <hi>Where is he</hi> (said they) <hi>that is born King of the Iews, for we have seen his Star, and are come to worship him.</hi> There is not one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in Heaven, but what does worship our Lord Jesus Christ.

those will be a thousand times more miserable that have heard of Christ, but never had an heart to believe on him.

Christ as a Morning Star has been dispensing himself to his people in the two last ages of the World. When the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> began, then did Christ appear in his Providence as the Morning Star in respect of that light of knowledge which he blessed the world with. It was a dark day, (or a long night rather) during the Reign of Antichrist; but when the Providence of Christ began a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> in the Nations near two hundred years ago, there did appear the Morning Star. And the Light has been advancing and growing ever since that day. The Age wherein we now live is an Age of great light, (would to God it were
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:001076_0092_0FAFDEFBF90749F8"/>
an Age of great zeal and holiness too) but it is an Age of greater Light than the former. There are many dark and difficult places in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that formerly could not be understood, which of late have been opened with great clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And especially in this Book of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The first Reformers did very few of them search into it; and those few that did saw but a little. <hi>Calvin</hi> though I believe he was the greatest Interpreter that ever wrote ont the Bible, yet would not meddle with the Book of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> He professed he did no know what to make of it: When as in the last Century very many have looked into it, and made glorious discoveries; a blessed sign it is that all the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things spoken of therein shall be fulfilled in this very Age which God has now brought us to the beginning of. Inasmuch as the Book is unsealed, that is a sign the End is very near. There are two things which have lately happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which I would take notice of, and one may see the Morning Star in them. Though it is true, that we have cause to expect a dismal time. A little before break of day is the darkest time of all the night.
