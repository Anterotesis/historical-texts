            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Dare ſay, the reader has already concluded, that the author of <hi>Plain Engliſh</hi> can be no other than an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman; and, I can aſſure him, the further he advances, the more will he be confirmed in his opinion. It would then, be uſeleſs to deny the fact.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Democrats</hi> have loaded me with every name which they imagine to be opprobrious, (but of which I am very proud) ſuch, for example, as Ariſtocrat, King'sman, Loyaliſt, Roya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, Clergyman, Engliſhman, &amp;c. it is, therefore, no more than fair play for me to chooſe from amongſt them that which ſuits me beſt. <hi>Engliſhman</hi> is the one I have preferred on the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; becauſe, as an Engliſhman, I have not been obliged to declaim with enthuſiaſm on the inexhauſtible riches, the generoſity and humanity of the French Republicans; as an Engliſhman, I have not thought it neceſſary to my advancement, to varniſh over the follies and errors of a certain part of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028437_0005_0FD9011CCDA750C8"/>
in theſe States; as an Engliſhman, I ſhall be excuſed for not thinking my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon a level with every <hi>patriot,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>negro,</hi> and every <hi>democrat,</hi> that pleaſes to call me his <hi>fellow citizen;</hi> as an Engliſhman, as a calf of <hi>John Bull,</hi> I ſhall hope to be permitted, in ſhort, I will be permitted, to bellow out the truth without diſguiſe.</p>
            <p>Methinks, I hear the reader exclaim: <hi>what! the conduct of General Waſhington defended by an Engliſhman!</hi> For my part, I cannot ſee how it can be more offenſive to a real American to hear the conduct of the Preſident defended by an Engliſhman, than to hear it condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Frenchman. If meddling be at all commendable, it certainly is as much ſo in the former as in the latter caſe. But, the reader need not alarm himſelf. He will not be diſguſted with nauſeous panegyrics on GENERAL WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON. I have not treated him as the CRAWLING DEMAGOGUES of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try treat the ſovereign people. If the GENERAL'S character or conduct ſtood in need of defence, it would not find a defender in me. In my anſwer to Franklin, on this ſubject, I have had the ſame object in view, that I have had in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028437_0006_0FD90124CFDE4950"/>
view in every other ſentence I have yet publiſhed; what that object is, I ſhall leave for the ſagacious democrats to find out.</p>
            <p>From the volumes, or rather bales, that have already appeared againſt the treaty, I have ſelected the "Letters of Franklin," not becauſe they are the worſt things that have been written on the ſubject, and, God knows, it is not becauſe they are the beſt; but becauſe they contain upon the whole, the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſample, I have yet ſeen, of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and language of the oppoſers of the treaty.</p>
            <p>I will, with the reader's leave, cloſe this preface with an obſervation, which, though rather foreign to the ſubject before us, is nevertheleſs nearly enough connected with democratic affairs to be worthy of a place.</p>
            <p>This very day, a twelve month a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, the bells of this City were ringing, the cannons firing, <hi>Tom the Tinker</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, bawling, and dancing <hi>à la canibale</hi> round the altar of <hi>La Liberté,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blackguard in the City rolling drunk about the ſtreet, to celebrate that happy event the deſtruction of LOUIS XVI. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day there is none of all this: all is as ſtill
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028437_0007_0FD9012738C8F8D8"/>
as death! What can this mean? Is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm upon the wane, even after the taking of Amſterdam and the death of the Dauphin? Surely my dream <note n="*" place="bottom">See the firſt part of the <hi>Bone to Gnaw.</hi>
               </note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the laſt year's <hi>fête civique</hi> cannot have interrupted any thing? Can it be poſſible that conſcience has at laſt ſtruck <hi>Tom the Tinker?</hi> Was he afraid of ſeeing <hi>Old William Penn</hi> in reality? Oh! could I but flatter myſelf that I had worked a reformation there! Could I but hope, that I had ſcared POOR TOM into his ſenſes, I ſhould die in peace!</p>

            <head>A LITTLE PLAIN ENGLISH, ADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</head>
            <p>A TREATY of amity, commerce, and navigation, with Great Britain, is a thing which has been ſo long and ſo ardently deſired on your part, and ſo often ſolicited by your government, that one cannot help being aſtoniſhed that even the <hi>democratic,</hi> or <hi>French, faction</hi> ſhould have the temerity to raiſe a cry againſt it, now it is brought ſo near a concluſion. It is true, this perverſe faction is extremely contemptible, as to the property they poſſeſs, and the real weight they have in the community; and their diſſatisfaction, which is ſure to accompany every meaſure of the Federal Government, is a pretty certain
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:028437_0009_0FD9012D36A55D58"/>
ſign of the general approbation of thoſe who may be properly called <hi>the people:</hi> but, it muſt be acknowledged at the ſame time, that they have for partizans almoſt the whole of that deſcription of perſons, who, among us royaliſts, are generally deſignated by the name of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ob.</hi> Being an enemy to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, be it what it may, is always a ſufficient recommendation with theſe latter, and is looked upon as an ample compenſation for a loſt reputation or a want of talents. Thoſe who are ſimple enough to liſten to a demagogue, don't care much about his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character. With the rights of the <hi>citizens,</hi> their virtue, and their ſovereignty, eternally vibrating on his lips, he may, for ought they care, have a heart as black as Tartarus. If he writes, let him fill his pages with frothy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and vaunting bombaſt, with the canting jargon of modern republicans, and it matters little what arrangement he makes uſe of. Ambiguity and confuſion are even an advantage to him, they are a labyrinth in which he loſes the wretches whom he has enticed from their duty. In ſhort, his buſineſs is to awaken in his reader, jealouſy, envy, revenge, and every paſſion that can diſgrace the heart of man, to lull his gratitude, reaſon, and conſcience, aſleep, and then let him looſe upon ſociety. Such is the eloquence, and ſuch the object of <hi>Franklin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Far be it from me to pretend to a rivalſhip with this fawning mob orator; I would not for the world make one convert from his tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:028437_0010_0FD901322F359A10"/>
flock; unenvied I leave him to the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits of his cajoled <q>
                  <hi>fellow citizens,</hi> and the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal hugs of your <hi>inſidious friends and allies.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is become a kind of eſtabliſhed cuſtom, even among thoſe who are the firm friends of your government, to yield to the prejudice of the populace, in paſſing eulogiums on the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powers in France; or, at leaſt, in obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cautious ſilence with reſpect to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious, not to ſay hoſtile, conduct towards the United States. Theſe gentlemen have, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly their reaſons for this; for my part, I have none, and therefore I ſhall take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſay what, I am ſure they muſt think on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>On all hands it is allowed, that the paraſite of a prince is a moſt deſpicable character; a popular paraſite muſt then be doubly deſpicable. It is poſſible for the ſupple courtier to find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like an apology for his ſelf-humiliation; one may be dazzled by the ſplendour of a crown, or blinded by the munificence of a friend and protector; but what muſt be the man (if, indeed, he be worthy of the name,) who can crawl to the dregs of mankind? Who can make a voluntary ſurrender of the ſuperiority with which nature has endowed him; who can ſacrifice truth, honour, juſtice, and even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, to the ſtupid ſtare and momentary huzza of the populace, of the populace whoſe welfare affects him not, and whom, in his heart, he deſpiſes?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028437_0011_0FD90136F46350E0"/>The <hi>Letters of Franklin</hi> are a ſtring of philli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics againſt Great Britain and the Executive of the United States. They do not form a regular ſeries, in which the ſubject is treated in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation: the firſt ſeems to be the overflowings of paſſion bordering on inſanity, and each ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one the fruit of a relapſe. To follow the author ſtep by ſtep through ſuch a jumble, would be to product the ſame kind of diſguſt in you as I myſelf have experienced; I ſhall therefore deviate from the order, or rather diſorder, which <hi>Franklin</hi> has found it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to employ, and endeavour to bring the ſubject before you in a leſs complicated point of view.</p>
            <p>The cenſure of <hi>Franklin</hi> has three principal objects; the treating with Great Britain at all, the terms of the treaty, and the conduct of the Preſident relative to the negociation.</p>
            <p n="1">I. He aſſerts, that to form a commercial treaty, with Great Britain is a ſtep, at once unneceſſary, impolitic, dangerous and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:028437_0012_0FD9013B44612F70"/>If <hi>Franklin</hi> has made out any one of theſe aſſertions, if he has proved, that to treat with Great Britain is unneceſſary, impolitic, dangerous and diſhonourable, that the terms of the preſent treaty are diſadvantageous, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating and diſgraceful, or that the Preſident has purſued a conduct in the negociation for which he deſerves to be impeached, you will all do well to join the remonſtrating throng, that are now hunting the good Old General to his retreat at Mount Vernon; but if he has proved none of theſe; if all that he has ſaid on the ſubject be mere cavilling and abuſe, ſcolding, reviling, and execrating; if he be every where detected of miſrepreſentation, inconſiſtency, and flat contradiction; if, in ſhort it appears, that his ultimate object is to ſtir up the unwary to an indecent and even vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent oppoſition againſt the Federal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then, if you conſult your own intereſts, you will be upon your guard, and weigh well the conſequences, before you determine on ſuch an oppoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Franklin aſſerts, that to form a commercial treaty with Great Britain is a ſtep, at once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, impolitic, dangerous, and diſhonourable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> becauſe <q>commercial treaties are an artificial means to obtain a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral end. They are the ſwathing bands of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, that impede the free operations of nature.</q> This will not detain us long; it is one of thoſe chimerical notions that ſo well characterize the Pariſian ſchool. Nobody but a ſet of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical politicians ever imagined the plan of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028437_0013_0FD9013F50BEAEA0"/>
all the ports in the world to all the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in the world, <q>of interweaving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the intereſts of all nations, of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inhabitants of the earth into one vaſt republic, of rendering the whole family of mankind enlightened, free, and happy.</q> When this plan ſhall be put in execution with ſucceſs, I will allow that commercial treaties are unneceſſary, but 'till then, I muſt contend for the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The two countries, ſays <hi>Franklin,</hi> if neceſſary in their products to each other, will ſeek an intercourſe.</q> This is all I wanted him to admit, to prove that an exchange of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities between our countries is neceſſary; for that they have ſought an intercourſe with each other, and that they do now ſeek that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more than ever, is moſt certain; ſo much ſo with reſpect to this country that about one half of her exports are now made to Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and her dominions. But ſays he, <q>this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change ought to be left to itſelf; for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of nations ought to be like the trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween individuals, who deal with thoſe who give them the beſt treatment and the beſt bargains.</q> I ſubſcribe to the juſtice of the latter part of this remark with all my heart: nothing could be more convenient for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for if nations, like individuals, trade with thoſe who treat them beſt, and give them the beſt bargains, how much better treatment and better bargains muſt you receive from Great Britain than from other nations, when you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe from her three times as much as from all
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028437_0014_0FD90142387E91F8"/>
the reſt of the world put together? But, that this extenſive exchange, however neceſſary to both parties, ſhould be left to regulate itſelf, I cannot believe; for, keeping up the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the commerce of nations being like the trade between individuals, it will ever be found I believe, that treaties are as neceſſary to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of good underſtanding in the former as written contracts are in the latter.</p>
            <p>In obſervation preſerve itſelf here, which muſt not be omitted. <hi>Franklin</hi> objects to form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a treaty with Great Britain, becauſe, ſays he, <q>She is famed for perfidy and double deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, her polar ſtar is intereſt, artifice with her is a ſubſtitute for nature, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q> God knows if all this, and much more that he has ſaid, be true; but, if it be, I am ſure it makes ſtrongly for a treaty, in place of againſt one; for, proceeding ſtill upon his own compariſon, <q>that commerce between nations is like trade between individuals,</q> certainly no individual would ever think of dealing to any amount, with a perſon famed for perfidy and double dealing, without binding him down by written articles.</p>
            <p>Out of this observation grows another of not leſs importance. <hi>Franklin</hi> has taken an infinite deal of pains to perſuade you that the Preſident ſhould have formed a treaty with France inſtead of Great Britain? Your commerce with France, even in the faireſt days of her proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, never amounted to more than a fifth part of your commerce with Great Britain; and if what <hi>Franklin</hi> ſays be true, France is the moſt magnanimous, generous, juſt, honourable, <hi>(hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane!)</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:028437_0015_0FD901496A7C24F8"/>
rich, and powerful nation upon the earth; and can you then want a written bargain with France, when a mere trifle is the object, and none with Great Britain, when half you have is at ſtake? Shall it be ſaid that you diſtruſt France, that honourable, that <hi>rich</hi> nation? that you bind her down with "hard biting laws," while you admit Great Britain, "whoſe days," <hi>Franklin</hi> aſſures you, "are numbered," to a kind of family intercourſe, where the bands of affection are ſuppoſed to ſupply the place of law?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franklin</hi> incautiouſly acknowledges, <q>that you repeatedly ſolicited a commercial trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with Great Britain,</q> and this is very true. The firſt queſtion put to <hi>Mr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> on his arrival here, was to know, if he was authorized to treat on that ſubject. This was alſo the oſtenſible object of <hi>Mr. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon's</hi> famous reſolutions. <q>To force the nations of Europe, and particularly Great Britain, to enter into commercial treaties with you</q>. The words <hi>nations of Europe</hi> were afterwards changed for <hi>Great Britain.</hi> Theſe reſolutions were a long time and are ſtill, a favourite theme of panegyric among the French Faction; all the <hi>democratic ſocieties</hi> in the union have paſſed reſolves in approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of them; they have been toaſted at every patriotic dinner, every civic feaſt, and even our <hi>Franklin</hi> himſelf ſings forth their praiſes. How comes it then, that all theſe people now deprecate the idea of making a treaty with Great Britain? This will be no
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028437_0016_0FD9014A78D16900"/>
longer a ſecret, when <hi>Patriot Madiſon's</hi> real object is known, and to know this you have only to compare his reſolutions with a paſſage in <hi>Citizen Genet's</hi> inſtructions. The fact is is, <hi>Patriot Madiſon</hi> had no ſuch thing as a treaty in view; nothing on earth was further from his wiſhes. War was his object; but this he could not propoſe in direct terms, and therefore, he propoſed ſuch reſtrictions on the Britiſh commerce, as he was ſure, if adopted, would produce a war. He failed, and Great Britain, in conſenting to what he pretended was the object of his reſolutions, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and ſenate in ratifying it, are now load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the execrations of all his partizans. But what muſt be the <hi>Patriot's</hi> remorſe? What will he be able to ſay againſt treating with a nation, whom he wiſhed <hi>to force to a treaty</hi> with you?</p>
            <p n="2">2d. <hi>Treaties are impolitic, becauſe they lead to to war: and conſequently a treaty with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is exceptionable on that account.</hi> This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther idea borrowed from the legiſlators of your Siſter Republic, and ſurely it is not, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, leſs whimſical. "Treaties lead to war," ſays <hi>Franklin,</hi> "and war is the bane of republican government." Treaties of alliance offenſive and defenſive lead to war, it is their object; but how treaties of <hi>amity, commerce,</hi> and <hi>navigation,</hi> can lead to war; how a treaty like that under conſideration, made expreſly to terminate all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in an amicable manner, to produce ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and good underſtanding, to eſtabliſh
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028437_0017_0FD9014F35483A70"/>
univerſal peace and true friendſhip between the parties, how a treaty like this can lead to war, is, to me, inconceivable. With juſt as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might it be ſaid that treaties of peace lead to to war, that independence leads to ſubjugation, that liberty leads to ſlavery, and that good leads to evil.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Treaties, ſays our Demagogue, are like partnerſhips, they eſtabliſh intimacies, which ſometimes end in profligacy, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in ruin and bankruptcy, diſtruſt, ſtrife, and quarrel;</q> and then on he goes with an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſive apoſtrophe (which decency prevents me from copying here) inferring that you ought, on this account, to avoid a connection, as he terms it, with Great Britain. This compariſon is not ſo good as the laſt we quoted; treaties of amity and commerce do not at all reſemble part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhips. "The commerce of nations is like trade between individuals;" but commercial treaties reſemble contracts between individuals of ſeparate intereſts, and not co-partnerſhips. A co-partnerſhip implies an union of intereſts, a participation in profits and loſſes, in debts and credits. Are any of theſe underſtood by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial treaty? Aſſuredly not. In a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial treaty two nations ſay: <hi>on theſe terms we will buy and ſell, of and to each other.</hi> Had you made a treaty with Great Britain to club your merchandize and revenues, and to carry on trade under the firm of Madam Britain and Miſs America, ſuch a treaty would, indeed, have reſembled a partnerſhip, and would very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been attended with all the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028437_0018_0FD90151FB292C10"/>
ſtated by <hi>Franklin;</hi> but commercial trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are, I repeat it, among nations what written bargains are among individuals, and the former have exactly the ſame tendency as the latter, that is, to render miſtakes, diſputes, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, leſs frequent.</p>
            <p>But, however, even if treaties do lead to war, it is rather ſurprizing to hear <hi>Franklin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them on that account, when one third part of his book is taken up with invectives againſt the Preſident for not forming a treaty with France, the direct object of which was your tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part with her in the preſent war. <q>The treaty propoſed by Citizen Genet, ſays he, was a treaty on liberal and equitable princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</q> What were theſe liberal principles now? Citizen Genet came forward with an offer to treat, which offer, it muſt be confeſſed contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no expreſs deſire of involving you in a war; but what were the Citizen's private inſtructions concerning this treaty? for it is from theſe that you are to judge, and not from the contents of a mere complimentary letter. What were they then? "Citizen Genet," ſays the Executive Council, <q>ſhall open a negociation, which may become a national agreement in which two great people ſhall <hi>ſuſpend their commercial and political intereſt, to befriend the empire of liberty, wherever it can be embraced.</hi>—"Such a pact, which the people of France will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with all the energy that diſtinguiſhes them, will quickly contribute <hi>to the general emancipation of the New World.</hi>—But ſhould
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028437_0019_0FD9015883BF7900"/>
the American adminiſtration adopt a waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conduct, the Executive Council charges him, in expectation that the American Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will finally determine <hi>to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe with us,</hi> to take ſuch ſteps as will appear to him <hi>exigencies may require,</hi> to ſerve the cauſe of liberty and <hi>the freedom of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.—The guarantee of our Weſt India Iſlands ſhall form an eſſential clauſe in the new treaty which will be propoſed:</hi> the Executive Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, in conſequence, recommend to Citizen Genet to found early the diſpoſition of the American government, and to make it a <hi>ſine qua non</hi> of their free commmerce to thoſe Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, ſo eſſential to the United States.</q> Here then are the "liberal principles," ſo much boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by the partizans of France! A treaty on theſe principles is what <hi>Franklin</hi> would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of. For not forming a treaty on theſe principles he loads your Preſident with abuſe, while he declares, that his objection to treaties, is, <q>they lead to war, and war is the bane of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican government!</q> A demagogue, like a liar, ſhould have a good memory.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. <hi>To form a treaty of commerce with Great Britain is dangerous,</hi> he ſays; becauſe <q>it is forming a connection with a monarch, and the introduction of the <hi>faſhions, forms,</hi> and <hi>precedents</hi> of monarchical governments, has ever accelerated the deſtruction of republics.</q> Here we might aſk our demagogue, as the <hi>Clown</hi> did <hi>Malvolio:</hi> 
               <q>are you a fool indeed, or do you but counterfeit?</q> For, to ſuppoſe him in earneſt would be to believe him guided by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028437_0020_0FD90159833F11E8"/>
ſomething below even the imbecility of a frenchified republican. It would be to ſuppoſe him almoſt upon a level with a Member from the Southward, who gave his vote againſt a law, merely becauſe it appeared to him to be of monarchical origin, while, at the ſame moment, he repreſented a State, whoſe declaration of rights ſays; <q>The good people are entitled to the common law of England, and the trial by jury, according to the courſe of that law, and to the benefit of ſuch of the Engliſh ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, as exiſted at the time of their firſt emigration, and which, by experience, have been found applicable to their local and other circumſtances, and of ſuch others as have been ſince made in England, or Great Britain, and have been introduced here, &amp;c.</q> Can the people who have been ſo careful in preventing their future rulers from depriving them of the benefit of the laws of England, who look upon the being governed by thoſe laws as the moſt ineſtimable of their rights, be afraid of introducing among them the <hi>faſhions, forms,</hi> and <hi>precedents</hi> of England? Can it be poſſible, that they are afraid of introducing among them what they already poſſeſs, and what they declare they will never part with?</p>
            <p>It is not my object to intrude on you my opinion of the <hi>faſhions, forms,</hi> and <hi>precedents,</hi> as <hi>Franklin</hi> calls them, of the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they may be better or they may be worſe than thoſe of other governments; but be they what they may, they are nearly the ſame as your own, and they are the only ones, ever adopted by any nation on earth, to which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028437_0021_0FD9015B3477FDD8"/>
yours bear the moſt diſtant reſemblance; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, admitting, for a moment, what <hi>Franklin</hi> ſays to be true; <q>that you ſhould make treaties with no nation whoſe <hi>faſhions,</hi> and <hi>forms</hi> are different from your own,</q> it follows of courſe, that, if you ought not, on this account to make treaties with Great Britain; you ought to do it with no nation in the world.</p>
            <p>But this would not ſuit the purpoſe of <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> who, at the ſame time that he repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates the idea of making a treaty with Great Britain, inculcates the propriety and even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of making one with France. <q>If fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign connexions are to be formed, ſays he, they ought to be made with nations whoſe <hi>influence</hi> and <hi>example</hi> would not poiſon the fountain of liberty, and circulate the dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious ſtreams to the deſtruction of the rich harveſt of our revolution— <hi>Tell me your company, and I will tell you who you are.</hi>
               </q> And then he tells us, that <q>there is not a nation in Europe, with an <hi>eſtabliſhed government,</hi> whoſe example ſhould be our imitation,</q> but, that <q>France is our natural ally; that <hi>ſhe has a government congenial with our own,</hi> and that there can be no hazard of introducing from her, principles and practices repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to freedom.</q> Take care what you are about, Mr. <hi>Franklin!</hi> If there be none of the <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> governments in Europe congenial to your own, and if the government of France be congenial to your own, the inevitable conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, that neither you nor your Siſter Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic have <hi>an eſtabliſhed</hi> government! Do you
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028437_0022_0FD9015FB1F0CE28"/>
begin to perceive the fatal effects of your want of memory?</p>
            <p>But, I ſhould like to be told how <hi>Franklin</hi> came to diſcover a reſemblance between your government and that of France, or between you and the French. To ſay that ſuch a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance exiſts is a trait of ſlander that, were I an American, I ſhould reſent with the utmoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. Are you governed by an aſſembly of ignorant caballing legiſlators? An aſſembly of <hi>Neroes,</hi> whoſe paſtime is murder, who have defied the God of Heaven, and, in idea, have ſnatched the thunder from his hand to hurl it on a crouching people? And do you reſemble the republican French? Have you caſt off the very ſemblance of virtue and religion? Do you indeed, reſemble thoſe men of blood, thoſe profligate infidels, who, uniting the frivolity of the Monkey to the ferocity of the Tyger, can go dancing to the gallows, or butcher their relations to the air of <hi>ah, ça ira?</hi> If you do, you have not much to fear from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of the <hi>faſhions, forms,</hi> and <hi>precedents</hi> of other nations.</p>
            <p>Another ſource of <hi>danger,</hi> that <hi>Franklin</hi> has had the ſagacity to diſcover in treating with Great Britain, is, that, <q>ſhe meditates your ſubjugation, and a treaty will give her a footing amongſt you which ſhe had not before, and facilitate her plans.</q> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive council of France ordered <hi>Citizen Genet</hi> to tell you ſomething of this ſort, in order to induce you to embark in the war for the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and happineſs of mankind. <q>In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028437_0023_0FD901610250E928"/>
of affairs," ſay the Executive Council, "when the military preparations in Great Britain become every day more ſerious, we ought to excite, <hi>by all poſſible means,</hi> the zeal of the Americans, who are as much intereſted as ourſelves in diſconcerting the deſtructive projects of <hi>George III,</hi> in which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably an object.</q> I beſeech you to pay atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this paſſage of the inſtructions. When military preparations were making againſt France, ſhe wanted your aid, and ſo the good Citizen was ordered to tell you that you were the object of thoſe preparations. The Citizen was ordered to tell you a falſhood; for the war has now continued three years, and <hi>George III.</hi> has made not the leaſt attempt againſt your independence.</p>
            <p>You have the ſureſt of all guarantees that Great Britain will never attempt any thing againſt your independence, <hi>her intereſt.</hi> I agree with <hi>Franklin,</hi> that <q>her intereſt is the main ſpring of all her actions, and that, had not her intereſt been implicated, the commercial relation between you and her would long ſince have been deſtroyed</q> Her intereſt will ever dictate to her to keep up that relation, and certainly making an attempt on your independance is not the way to do that; for, as to her ſucceeding in ſuch an attempt, I think every American will look on that as impoſſible. The idea of your <q>again becoming colonies of Great Britain</q> may be excuſed in <hi>Franklin</hi> and the other ſtipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries of the French republic, but an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028437_0024_0FD90162839F23A8"/>
who holds the good of his country in higher eſtimation than a bundle of <hi>aſſignats,</hi> and who entertains ſuch a diſgraceful belief, muſt have the head of an idiot and the heart of a coward.</p>
            <p>Beſides, has not our Demagogue himſelf given a very good reaſon for your having nothing to apprehend from Great Britain? <q>Happy for this country, ſays he, the days of that corrupt monarchy are number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for already has the impetuous valour of our inſulted French brethren ruſhed like a torrent upon the Dutch Provinces, and ſwept away the dykes of Ariſtocracy. Perhaps <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> will direct their next ſteps to Great Britain itſelf, and by one deciſive ſtroke, relieve the world from the miſeries which that corrupt government has too long entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon mankind.</q> I ſhall not ſtop here to prove, that it was not an act of <hi>a corrupt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> to frame ſuch laws, as the people of theſe ſtates have bound their rulers never to depart from; nor have I time to prove, that peopling the United ſtates, changing an uncouth wilderneſs into an extenſive and flouriſhing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in little more than a century, was not <hi>entailing miſeries upon mankind.</hi> I haſten to my ſubject; and, I think, I need take no great deal of pains to prove to you, that, if Great Britain be in the ſituation in which <hi>Franklin</hi> has deſcribed her, you have very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to fear from her. A nation whoſe <q>days are numbered,</q> and particularly, who is in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028437_0025_0FD9016451A82440"/>
continual expectation of a <hi>domiciliary</hi> viſit from the French, is rather to be pitied than feared.</p>
            <p>And yet this ſame <hi>Franklin,</hi> who tells you that the <q>days of Great Britain are number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſhe is upon the point of annihilation, and that nothing can ſave her but repentance in ſack-cloth and aſhes;</q> this ſame <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> who ſays all this, and much more to the ſame purpoſe; this ſame <hi>Franklin</hi> winds up almoſt every one of his letters in declaring, that you have every thing to fear from her, and that nothing on earth can ſave you but France! <q>That gallant nation, whoſe proffers we have neglected, is the ſheet anchor who ſuſtains our hopes, and ſhould her glorious exertions be incompetent to the great object ſhe has in view, we have little to flatter ourſelves with from the faith, honour, or juſtice of Great Britain.—The nation on whom our political exiſtence depends we have treated with indifference bordering on contempt. —Citizens your only ſecurity depends upon <hi>France,</hi> and, by the conduct of your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that ſecurity has become precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</q> Now before I go any further, I ſhall bring another ſentence from <hi>Franklin,</hi> which will certainly give you a favourable idea of the veracity and conſiſtency of that Demagogue. <q>Inſulated as we are, not an enemy near to excite apprehenſion, and our products ſuch as are indiſpenſable, <hi>we need neither the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of other countries, nor their ſupport!</hi>
               </q> What! no enemy near to excite apprehenſion,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028437_0026_0FD90165DBE12D30"/>
no need of ſupport, and yet <q>France is the ſheet anchor of your hopes!" and yet your political exiſtence depends upon her!</q> and yet, becauſe your government has refuſed to make a common cauſe with her, <q>your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity is become precarious!</q> To a hireling writer nothing is ſo neceſſary as memory.</p>
            <p>If Great Britain had really been ſo fooliſh as to form a deſign upon your independence, and your political exiſtence had depended upon France, it would, I believe, have been at an end long before this time. <hi>Citizen Genet</hi> was ordered to promiſe you, that his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would <q>ſend to the American ports a ſufficient force to put them beyond inſult;</q> but, if they had defended your poſſeſſions no better than they have their own, they would have brought you into a poor plight. If the fleet, they were ſo good as to offer you had been no more ſucceſsful than the others they have ſent out, it might as well have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at home, blocked up, as their fleets now are, and left you to the defence of your own privateers. They have given but a poor ſample of their <hi>protecting talents,</hi> either at home or abroad. Letting two thirds of their colonies be taken from them, and making war upon the reſt themſelves, is not the way to convince me that you would have been ſafe under their protection. Nobody but a madman would ever commit his houſe to the care of a notorious incendiary.</p>

               <hi>Franklin</hi> proceeds exactly in the manner of <hi>Citizen Genet</hi> (of whom he is a pupil, as we ſhall ſee by and by); Firſt, he tells you that <q>Great Britain has contemplated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your miſery or ſubjugation, and that <hi>armaments were made to this end.</hi>
               </q> Then he tells you, that <q>France alone has ſaved you; that ſhe is now fighting your battles; that you owe her much; that <hi>ſhe gave you independence,</hi> and that <hi>ſhe alone</hi> is able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it to you.</q> After this, fearing that theſe weighty conſiderations may not have the deſired effect, he has recourſe to the laſt trick in the budget of a political mountebank, <hi>menaces.</hi> He tells you dreadful tales about the reſentment of France, and this he makes a third ſource of <hi>danger</hi> in treating with Great Britain.</p>
            <p>"The conduct of the French Republic," ſays he, <q>towards us has been truly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous, and, in all probability, ſhe would have made many ſacrifices to preſerve us in a ſtate of peace, <hi>if we had demeaned ourſelves towards her with a becoming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety;</hi> but can we calculate upon her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, when we have not only ſlighted but inſulted her? To enter into a treaty with Great Britain at this moment, when we have evaded a treaty with France; to treat with an enemy <hi>againſt whom, France feels an implacable hatred,</hi> an enemy who has neglected no means to deſolate <hi>that country,</hi> and crimſon it with blood, is certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult.</q> Then on he goes to terrify you to death.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028437_0028_0FD9016C366CF7D8"/>
               <q>Citizens of America," ſays he, "<hi>Sovereigns</hi> of a free country, your <hi>hoſtility</hi> to the French Republic (in making a treaty with Great Britain, he means) has lately been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the National Convention, and a motion for <hi>an inquiry into it</hi> has been only ſuſpended from prudential motives.—The book, of account may ſoon be opened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you—what then, alas! will be your proſpects!—<hi>To have your friendſhip queſtioned</hi> by that nation is, indeed, alarming!</q>— There ſpoke the Frenchman! there broke forth the vanity of that vaunting Republic!</p>
            <p>The above are certainly the moſt unfortunate expreſſions that ever poor demagogue launched forth. What he has here ſaid, completely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the poſition he meant it to ſupport. If you muſt be ſo cautious in your <hi>demeanour</hi> towards the French Republic, if you dare treat with no nation againſt whom <hi>ſhe feels</hi> an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable hatred, if to treat with a nation that has endeavoured to deſolate <hi>that</hi> country, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your conduct to an <hi>inquiry</hi> in the National Convention; if to have your friendſhip <hi>queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned</hi> by that nation is an alarming circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; if to refuſe treating with her, when and how ſhe pleaſes, is to open the dooms-day book of account againſt you; if all this be ſo, I can ſee no reaſon for apprehenſions on account of your <hi>independence,</hi> for your are no more than mere colonies of France. Your boaſted revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no more than a change of maſters.</p>
            <p>If you cannot enter into a treaty with Great Britain, without <hi>inſulting</hi> France, and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028437_0029_0FD90170C9623CA8"/>
expoſing yourſelves to her vengeance, neither can you with any other nation on whom ſhe thinks proper to make war, and againſt whom <hi>ſhe</hi> pleaſes to feel an implacable hatred. Thus ſhe might cut you off from all the nations in the world. An arrangement, for inſtance, with Spain, has long been looked on as a deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble object; but as ſhe is an enemy of France at this time, as ſhe has neglected no means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate <hi>that</hi> country and crimſon it with blood, you would not, according to <hi>Franklin,</hi> dare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a negociation with her, however oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune the moment and however advantageous the terms. Falſly, then, does he call you <q>the <hi>Sovereigns</hi> of a free country;</q> it is mere mockery to give you this title, if you dare not exerciſe any one act of ſovereignty, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing yourſelves to <hi>danger,</hi> without being lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to chaſtiſement.</p>
            <p>The fact is, as you ſtand in no need of the protection of France, ſo you have no cauſe to fear her reſentment. She may grumble curſes againſt you, but ſpeak out ſhe will not, ſhe dares not. She dares not make a ſecond at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to overturn your Federal Government, by <q>appealing from the Preſident to the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign people.</hi>
               </q> You are "the ſheet anchor" of her hopes, and not ſhe of yours. To you ſhe clings in her ſhipwrecked condition, to you her famiſhed legions look for food, and to you her little pop-gun fleets fly for ſhelter from the thundering foe. What have you then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, what to fear, from a nation like this? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, alas! but her <hi>inſidious friendſhip.</hi>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:028437_0030_0FD90175360623A0"/>4. <hi>Franklin aſſerts that it is diſhonourable to treat with Great Britain;</hi> becauſe ſays he, <q>her king is a tyrant that invaded <hi>our</hi> territory, and carried on war againſt us.</q> He ſeems to have made a ſmall miſtake here; for at the time the King of Great Britain invaded <hi>your</hi> territory, it was <hi>his</hi> territory, and you his <hi>lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubjects,</hi> at leaſt, you all declared ſo. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without recalling circumſtances, that can be of no uſe in the preſent diſcuſſion, admitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that has been ſaid on this ſubject to be true; that the fault was entirely on the ſide of Great Britain, that all her conduct was marked with duplicity and cruelty, and all yours with frankneſs and humanity; admitting all this, and that is admitting a great deal, yet, how long has it become a principle in politics, that a nation, who has once done an injury to another, is never after to be treated with upon a friendly footing? Is this a maxim with any other ſtate in the world? How many times have you ſeen France and England, after the moſt bloody conteſts, enter into an amicable treaty of commerce, for their mutual advantage. Have they not done ſo ſince the American war? and will they not do ſo again as ſoon as the preſent war is over? Nay; has not France very lately, unmindful of her promiſes and oaths, entered into a treaty of amity, and almoſt alliance, with His Royal Majeſty of Pruſſia, who had invaded <hi>her</hi> territory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having the leaſt ſhadow of excuſe for ſo doing? Is it for you alone, then, to ſacrifice your intereſt to your vengeance, or rather to the vengeance of France? Are you to make
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028437_0031_0FD90177308ECD28"/>
everlaſting hatred an article of your political creed, becauſe ſhe wills it?</p>
            <p>Your revolution certainly was not founded upon this baſis: all that was contemplated by it, was, a <hi>political</hi> ſeparation from Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The <hi>Declaration of independance,</hi> that act, paſſed by the <hi>Worthies</hi> of America, and of which you are ſo very proud, does not incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the doctrine of perpetual revenge; juſt the contrary. <q>Nor have we been wanting to our Britiſh brethren (not French brethren, obſerve): we have warned them, from time to time, of attempts made by their legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to extend an unwarrantable juriſdiction over us. We have reminded them of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our emigration and ſettlement here. We have appealed to <hi>their native juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and magnanimity</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">This Congreſs, you ſee, were not of opinion that their anceſtors were "treacherous, cruel, ſavage monſters." They were not like the patriots of the preſent day; but then, they were not animated by the gold of the French Republic; this circumſtance makes a conſiderable difference.</note>, and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred to diſavow theſe uſurpations, which would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably interrupt our connections and correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of juſtice and of conſanguinity. We muſt, therefore, acquieſce in the neceſſity, which denounces our ſeparation, and hold them, as we hold the reſt of mankind, <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in war—in peace friends.</hi>
               </q> Now, conform yourſelves to theſe good old principles, turn a deaf ear to the inſinuations of your <hi>new bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> and I am ſure you will ſee nothing in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028437_0032_0FD901784FD9BD40"/>
the King of Great Britain's invading his own dominions in the year 1776, to prevent you from making a treaty with him, upon honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms, in 1795.</p>
            <p>To this old grudge <hi>Franklin</hi> adds ſome injuries recently received from Great Britain. The firſt of theſe is, <hi>her depredations on your commerce.</hi> To urge the depredations on your commerce as a reaſon againſt treating is to find fault with a thing for being calculated to accompliſh its object; by treating you have guarded againſt ſuch depredations for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and have obtained a compenſation for the paſt. I ſhall enter more fully into this ſubject, when I come to ſpeak of the terms of the treaty: at preſent it is neceſſary to ſpeak of the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, only as they render a treaty with Great Britain diſhonourable.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place the injury does not appear to me to be of ſo outrageous a nature, as <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> would perſuade you it is. It was <hi>poſſible,</hi> at leaſt, that the orders of the Britiſh Court might be miſunderſtood, or miſconſtrued. It is alſo poſſible that great part of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels ſeized were really employed in a commerce, that would juſtify their ſeizure, by the law of nations. Admitting, however, that the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh cruizers and courts of admiralty have done no more than fulfil the intention of their King, and that none of your captured veſſels were employed in a contraband trade; yet, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow that the depredations committed on your trade is a ſufficient reaſon, or, indeed,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028437_0033_0FD9017CCD57F848"/>
any reaſon at all, for your not treating with the nation who has committed them. To maintain the contrary is to adopt that ſyſtem of eternal irreconcialition, which I ſhall ever deprecate, and which militates againſt every principle of juſtice and ſound policy. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans of France, and <hi>Franklin</hi> among the reſt, were for demanding ſatisfaction in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they knew it would not be granted, in a manner that Great Britain, conſiſtent with her honour (for I muſt be excuſed for think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe has ſome left) could not grant it; but, muſt not a treaty have been the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, at laſt? Suppoſe they had ſucceeded in plunging you into a war, that war itſelf muſt have ended in <hi>a treaty,</hi> and a treaty much more <hi>diſhonourable,</hi> perhaps, than the one now negociated; unleſs, indeed, their intention was to wage a <hi>bellum eternum,</hi> ſide by ſide with their French brethren, till there ſhould be no government left to treat with. Theſe people are always for violent meaſures; they wanted a commercial treaty with Great Britain, but then ſhe was to be "forced" into it; and now again they wanted ſatisfaction, but it is not worth a farthing, becauſe no violence has been uſed to obtain it. They are of the taſte of <hi>Swift's</hi> 
               <q>true Engliſh dean that was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a rape;</q> though they have all their hearts can wiſh for, their depraved appetites render it loathſome, becauſe it has been yielded to them without a ſtruggle.</p>
            <p>But, it is, or ought to be, the opinion of <hi>Franklin</hi> himſelf, that depredations on your
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028437_0034_0FD901808111AA98"/>
commerce ought to be no bar to your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the nation who has committed them; for he has exhauſted himſelf to perſuade you, that a treaty ought to have been made with France, and yet it is notorious, that her depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations have very far outſtripped thoſe of the Britiſh. Within the laſt five or ſix months the French have ſeized upwards of 200 of your veſſels, ſome they have confiſcated, others they have releaſed after having taken their cargoes, and others are yet in ſuſpence. Many of theſe veſſels have been ſeized in their own ports, where they went in full confidence, and with the moſt upright intentions. The mariners have been thrown into priſon, where many of them now are; the maſters have been robbed, ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and beaten, by ſome of the vileſt wretches that ever exiſted. They have the inſolence to call the American Maſters, <hi>the caned Captains;</hi> "Les capitaines á coup de bàton." Let <hi>Franklin</hi> find you, if he can, an inſtance of an American ſhip being ſeized at ſea, by the Engliſh, and burnt, without further ceremony. Theſe things the French have done, and yet he would not think it <hi>diſhonourable</hi> to enter into a treaty with them.</p>
            <p>I know, I ſhall be told, that the depredations of the French, here mentioned, have taken place ſince the departure of <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> for Great Britain; we will, then, confine ourſelves to the depredations, committed by the two nations at that epoch. And here, luckily, we have not to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028437_0035_0FD90181F2451460"/>
depend upon rumour, upon news-paper report: we have a ſure guide, the report of the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State to the Preſident, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Senate and Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives on the 5th, of March, 1795.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Againſt the French it is urged; 1ſt. that their privateers harraſs our trade <hi>no leſs than thoſe of the Britiſh.</hi> 2d. that two of <hi>their ſhips of war have committed enormities on our veſſels.</hi> 3d. that their courts of admiralty are guilty of <hi>equal oppreſſion.</hi> 4th that, beſides theſe points of accuſation, which are common to the French and Britiſh, the French have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed the treaties between the United States and them, by ſubjecting to ſeizure and condemnation our veſſels trading with their enemies in merchandize, which that treaty declares not to be contraband, and under circumſtances not forbidden by the law of nations. 5th. that a very detrimental em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo has been laid on our veſſels in French ports. 6th. that a contract with the French government for coin has been diſcharged in depreciated aſſignats.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If then the French privateers had harraſſed your trade no leſs than thoſe of the Britiſh, if their ſhips of war alſo had committed enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on your veſſels, if their courts of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty had been guilty of equal oppreſſion, and if they had, beſides, infringed the treaty already exiſting between you, had embargoed your veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and cheated your merchants by diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a contract for caſh in depreciated aſſignats, what could you ſee in their conduct to invite
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028437_0036_0FD90185F46D3808"/>
you to a treaty with them, whilſt a treaty with Great Britain would, on account of the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations committed by her, be <hi>diſhonourable?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this ſubject <hi>Franklin</hi> takes occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce one of his Conventional threats. <q>As long, ſays he, as we kept up the farce, that the negociation was deſigned to produce, an indemnity for the paſt, and ſecurity for the future, ſo long did France not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain;</hi> but now we have abandoned it to the ſame uncertainty as before, and have favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Great Britain at her expence, ſhe cannot, ſhe will not <hi>be paſſive;</hi> and then he ſays, if France ſhould act <hi>as our conduct merits,</hi> ſhe will <hi>now</hi> ſeize our veſſels.</q> Without enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here what reaſon France can have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain about <hi>your</hi> not having obtained an indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for <hi>your</hi> loſſes; without inquiring how your conduct merits <hi>her</hi> reſentment, becauſe you have abandoned <hi>your</hi> commerce to the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty as before; without inquiring what ſhe <hi>ought</hi> to do, you have only to look at what ſhe has done, and you have no reaſon to fear that the treaty will encreaſe her depredations. In ſhort, ever ſince the French found, that your government was determined not to join them in the war, they have neglected no opportunity of doing you miſchief, wherever they could, and dared to do it, and, perhaps, it is owing to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Freebooter (as <hi>Franklin</hi> calls <hi>Admiral Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi>), that you are not now blocked up in your ports. I know nothing of the Britiſh Admiral's inſtructions; perhaps they were no more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to you than thoſe of the French Miniſter;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028437_0037_0FD901874DF51EC0"/>
but I think, you ought to feel a conſiderable obligation to him for having rid your coaſts and towns of the ſwarthy red-cap'd <hi>citizens</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted them.</p>
            <p>Another injury which <hi>Franklin</hi> ſays you have received from Great Britain, and which renders a treaty with her <hi>diſhonourable,</hi> is <hi>her letting the Indians and Algerines looſe upon you.</hi> 
               <q>Great Britain, ſays he, urged on the Savages, by the mouth of Dorcheſter (it might have been <hi>Lord</hi> Dorcheſter in his mouth), to butcher our citizens, and deſolate our fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier; and, by <hi>her intrigues,</hi> let looſe a band of Algerine robbers, barbarous <hi>almoſt</hi> as Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, to prey upon our commerce, <hi>and make ſlaves of free men.</hi>
               </q> I have more than once obſerved, that having received an injury from a nation cannot, in itſelf, render the treating with ſuch a nation <hi>diſhonourable;</hi> if, therefore, the charge with reſpect to the Indians were well founded, it could make nothing againſt the preſent treaty. But, I deny that the fact has ever been proved. Governor <hi>Simcoe</hi> denies it poſitively, and no evidence has ever been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſubſtantiate it. It is, at beſt, then, but a matter of ſurmiſe; and when <hi>Franklin</hi> aſſerts, that, <q>In the action between <hi>General Wayne</hi> and the Indians at Fort Recovery, a number of <hi>Britiſh Officers and ſoldiers</hi> were joined with the Savages and led them on to the combat, and that they were <hi>painted</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their diabolical character,</q> he diſcovers a character full as diabolical as that of thoſe
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028437_0038_0FD9018F05B99B50"/>
perſons would have been, had his aſſertion been true.</p>
            <p>The populace of this country are eaſily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on by an obſervation that the French e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries never fail to make on this ſubject. They tell them, and which is very true, that the Indians receive their implements of war from the Britiſh: but they fail to tell them, at the ſame time, that theſe implements of war are the commodities, that the Indians receive in exchange for their furs, and that, to make ſuch an exchange a ſubject of complaint againſt the Britiſh, is to tell them that they ſhall not trade with the Indians, becauſe you are at war with them. Conſidering the temper which has been but too prevalent in theſe States during the preſent war; conſidering how convenient this accuſation againſt the Britiſh is to ſome of your military people, how many defeats it has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for; and how many more it may yet account for; conſidering how eagerly ſtories of this ſort are fought after, and how they are exaggerated, by a ſet of newſpaper printers, who have rendered a free preſs almoſt a public curſe; conſidering all this, people ought to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cautious how they form their belief on events at ſuch a diſtance, events, concerning which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is ſo eaſy, and detection ſo difficult, concerning which paſſion, character, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt all combine to propagate deception.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the charge againſt Great Britain and the Algerines, it is the moſt whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering, babyiſh complaint that ever diſgraced the lips of manhood, and when a Member of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028437_0039_0FD9019043063B20"/>
the Houſe of Repreſentatives made mention of it, he deſerved to have his backſide whipped. Great Britain, for her convenience, has, it ſeems, employed her mediation, and prevailed on the Dey of Algiers to make an arrangement with the Court of Liſbon, which arrangement gives the Algerines an opening into the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, where they take your veſſels. This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate for you; but how is it hoſtile towards you, on the part of Great Britain? How is it letting the Algerines looſe upon you? It is, indeed, letting them looſe upon the great ocean, where they may do what they can; but to call it letting them looſe on you, is mere childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. One would think, to hear <hi>Franklin,</hi> that Great Britain held the Indians and Algerines in a ſtring, like a brace of bull-dogs, ready to let looſe on whomſoever ſhe pleaſes. A clear proof that this is not the caſe, (a proof that pleaſes me the better, becauſe I am ſure <hi>Franklin</hi> and all his tribe will ſubſcribe to it) is, ſhe has not yet let the Algerines looſe on their French bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; a thing that ſhe moſt certainly would have done, if ſhe could.</p>
            <p>But, it ſeems, Great Britain is not only to refrain from every act and deed, that may give the Algerines an opportunity of incommoding you; ſhe is not only to ſacrifice her intereſt, and that of her allies, to yours; but ſhe ought to take an active part in your protection. A writer againſt the treaty expreſſes himſelf thus: <q>Our negociator has <hi>omitted</hi> to make any ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation for <hi>the protection and ſecurity of the commerce of the United States</hi> to Spain, Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028437_0040_0FD90196E536B008"/>
and the Mediterranean, againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations of the Algerine and Barbary cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſairs, although he knew that this forms one of the moſt beneficial branches of <hi>our</hi> trade.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the <hi>Aurorae</hi> of the 21ſt July, 1795.</note>
               </q> This writer certainly forgot, that you were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent.</hi> He talks about <hi>Mr. Jay</hi>'s making this ſtipulation, juſt as if it depended upon him alone. When he was about it, he might as well have ſtipulated for Great Britain to <hi>protect</hi> you againſt all the nations in the world, as ſhe uſed to do formerly. And do you then ſtand in need of Great Britain to protect you? Do you ſtand in need of the protection of this "ruined nation?" This nation whom "no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſave but repentance in ſackcloth and aſhes?" This "inſular Baſtile of ſlaves?" Do you ſtand in need of them to protect you, "the Sovereigns of a free country?" Is it <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable</hi> to treat with Great Britain, and yet is it <hi>honourable</hi> to accept of her protection? Prevaricating demagogues! You accuſe the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy Extraordinary of having made a humiliating treaty, while you blame him for not having made you drink off the cup of humility to the very dregs.</p>
            <p>The truth is, theſe depredations on your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce by all the belligerent nations, and by the Algerines, is what ought to ſurpriſe nobody; it is one of thoſe little rubs to which your ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion naturally expoſes you: independence, for ſome years, at leaſt, is not a roſe without a thorn. All that ought to ſurprize you in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028437_0041_0FD90197B3D57860"/>
this ſubject, is, that France, to whom alone you give ſhelter, for whoſe cauſe your good <hi>citizens</hi> have ever felt the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded enthuſiaſm, and for whoſe ſucceſſes they have toaſted themſelves drunk and ſung themſelves hoarſe a thouſand times, ſhould ſtand foremoſt on the liſt of the ſpoilers; and that, notwithſtanding this, your <hi>Patriots</hi> ſhould inſiſt upon a cloſe alliance with her, while they repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the treating with Great Britain as an act at once unneceſſary, impolitic, dangerous, and diſhonourable.</p>
            <p>Having now gone through Franklin's reaſons for not treating with Great Britain, I proceed to examine his objections to the terms of the treaty itſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Franklin aſſerts, that, if forming a treaty with Great Britain were conſiſtent with ſound policy, the terms of the preſent treaty are diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, humiliating, and diſgraceful to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the place to obſerve, that <hi>The Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Franklin</hi> were written, <hi>before the contents of the treaty were known.</hi> He introduces his ſubject in the following words: <q>The treaty <hi>is ſaid</hi> to be arrived, and as it will be of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſequence to us and to our poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, we ſhould <hi>analize it,</hi> before it becomes the ſupreme law of the land.</q> That is to ſay, <hi>before it be known.</hi> "It will be ſaid," continues he, <q>to be a haſty opinion which ſhall be advanced before the treaty itſelf ſhall be before us; but when it ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated for our conſideration, it will have
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028437_0042_0FD901993B294380"/>
all the force of law about it, and it will then be too late to detect its baneful effects.</q> Certainly no mortal ever heard reaſoning like this before; what a lame apology for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory publication, intended to prepoſſeſs the rabble againſt the treaty! What candour could be expected from a demagogue, who found it juſt and fit to <hi>analize</hi> a thing, before he knew what it contained? Who can be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to hear him aſſert, <q>that the Weſtern Poſts are <hi>the price</hi> of a commercial treaty, that <hi>no proviſion is made for indemnity to the merchants,</hi> that <hi>the French are ſacrificed to the Britiſh,</hi> that Great Britain has been <hi>meanly courted,</hi> and that <hi>all the eſſential intereſts</hi> of the United States are given up?</q>
            </p>
            <p>To anſwer objections, made thus at random, would be taking advantage of the poor Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; I ſhall, therefore, lend him the aid of thoſe that have been made ſince, by the <hi>citizens</hi> of Boſton, aſſembled in Town-Meeting.<note n="*" place="bottom">What deſcription of perſons theſe <hi>citizens</hi> were of and in what manner their deliberations were conducted, will be ſeen in the ſupplement.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is not my deſign to dwell upon every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that has been ſtarted, either by <hi>Franklin</hi> or the Town-Meeting; I ſhall content myſelf with anſwering thoſe only in which they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an extraordinary degree of <hi>patriotic</hi> preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or diſhoneſty.</p>
            <p>Art. I. <hi>Says that there ſhall be peace and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between the two countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As nobody but the French can have any thing to ſay againſt this article, and as I have already
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028437_0043_0FD9019E9944A4A8"/>
anſwered all that their emiſſary Franklin has ſaid on the ſubject, I look upon it as unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.</p>
            <p>Art. II. <hi>Stipulates, that the Weſtern Poſts ſhall be evacuated in June next; that, in the mean time the United States may extend their ſettlements to any part within the boundary line as fixed at the peace, except within the precincts and juriſdiction of the poſts; that the ſettlers now within thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts ſhall continue to enjoy their property, and that they ſhall be at full liberty to remain there, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move; that ſuch of them as ſhall continue to reſide within the ſaid boundary lines, ſhall not be compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to become citizens of the United States, but that, they may do ſo if they think proper, and that, they ſhall declare their choice in one year after the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of the Forts, and that, all thoſe who do not declare their choice during that time, are to be looked upon as citizens of the United States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>citizens</hi> of the Boſton Town-Meeting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this article, <q>becauſe it makes no provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to indemnify the United States for the commercial and other loſſes, they have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the heavy expences to which they have been ſubjected in conſequence of being kept out of poſſeſſion for twelve years in direct violation of a treaty of peace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The good <hi>citizens,</hi> before they talked about <hi>indemnity,</hi> ſhould have been certain that Great Britain was not <hi>juſtifiable</hi> in her detention of the Weſtern Poſts; becauſe, if it ſhould appear that ſhe was, to make a claim for indemnity would be ridiculous.</p>
            <p>By the treaty of peace, Great Britain was to
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028437_0044_0FD901A159D71CC0"/>
give up theſe Poſts, and, by the ſame treaty, the United States were to remove certain legal impediments to the payment of Britiſh Debts, that is to ſay, debts due to Britiſh merchants before the war. Theſe debts were to a heavy amount, and Great Britain had no other gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee for their payment than the Poſts. Your credit, at that time, was not in the moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſtate; and that the precaution of having a ſecurity was prudent, on the part of Great Britain, the event has fully proved. Nobody pretends that the impediments, above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are removed; nay, ſome of the States, and even their Members in Congreſs, aver that they ought not to be removed; what right have you, then, to complain of the Britiſh for not giving up the Poſts? Was the treaty to be binding on them only? If this be the caſe, your language to Great Britain reſembles that of <hi>Rouſſeau</hi>'s ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: <q>I make a covenant with you, entirely at your expence and to my profit, which <hi>you ſhall</hi> obſerve as long as it pleaſes me, and which <hi>I will</hi> obſerve as long as it pleaſes my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</q> This is not the way treaties are made now-a-days.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that the Federal Government has done all in its power to effect the removal of the impediments, according to ſtipulation; but to this I anſwer; that all in its power is not enough, if the impediments are not removed. Are they removed, or are they not? is the only queſtion Great Britain has to aſk. The States from which the debts are due (or rather a knot of intereſted individuals, devoid of honour, in
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028437_0045_0FD8BF522DF507A8"/>
each of them) having enacted laws, that count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eract thoſe made by the General Government, may be pleaded in juſtification of the latter, in a domeſtic point of view; but every one muſt perceive, that it would be childiſh in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme to urge it as an excuſe for a failure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards foreign nations. The very nature of a treaty implies a power in the contracting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to fulfil the ſtipulations therein contained, and, therefore, to fail from inability is the ſame thing as to fail from inclination, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders retaliation, at leaſt, juſt and neceſſary. Upon this principle, founded on reaſon and the law of nations, Great Britain was certainly <hi>juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable</hi> in her detention of the Weſtern Poſts. The foundation of <hi>indemnity</hi> being thus remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſuperſtructure falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>Another objection, though not to be found in the reſolutions of the Boſton <hi>citizens,</hi> deſerves notice. <q>That the leaving Britiſh ſubjects in poſſeſſion of their lands, &amp;c. in the precincts of the Forts, will be to eſtabliſh a Britiſh Colony in the territory of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, &amp;c. <note n="*" place="bottom">See the <hi>Aurora,</hi> 21ſt July.</note>
               </q> This is an objection that I never ſhould have expected from the <hi>true republicans.</hi> The treaty ſays that the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers in thoſe precincts ſhall have full liberty to chooſe between being <hi>ſubjects</hi> of the King of Great Britain and <hi>citizens</hi> of the United States: and can theſe republicans doubt which they will chooſe? Can they poſſibly ſuppoſe that the inhabitants near the Forts will not
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028437_0046_0FD901A910990600"/>
rejoice to exchange the humiliating title of <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> for the glorious one of <hi>citizen?</hi> Can they, indeed, imagine that theſe degraded Satellites of the tyrant <hi>George</hi> will not be ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with joy at the thought of becoming "ſovereigns of a free country?" Each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual of them will become a <q>Prince and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator</q> by taking <hi>the oath of allegiance</hi> to the United States; is it not then, ſacrilege, is it not to be a <hi>liberticide</hi> to imagine that they can heſitate in their choice? How came theſe enlightened <hi>citizens</hi> to commit ſuch a blunder? How came they to ſuppoſe, that the people in the precincts of the Forts were more capable of diſtinguiſhing between ſound and ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſhadow and the ſubſtance than they themſelves are. Thouſands of times have you been told that the poor Canadians were terribly oppreſſed, that they were ripe for revolt, that the militia had refuſed to do their duty, and, in ſhort, that the United States had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to receive them. And now, when a handful of them are likely to be left amongſt you, you are afraid they will chooſe to remain ſubjects to the King of Great Britain!</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe they ſhould all remain <hi>ſubjects;</hi> what will be the conſequence of it to you? Here are hundreds and thouſands of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſubjects on the eaſtern parts of the States; men who never have nor ever will take the oath of allegiance to the United States, and certainly they are none the worſe for it. An arrival from Ireland is boaſted of through
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028437_0047_0FD901AA859D9770"/>
the whole country, though perhaps it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of a hundred or two of poor devils, capable of nothing but eating and drinking; and is not a colony already ſettled, a colony conſiſting of perſons born in the country, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in the trade with the indians, and calculated to give that trade a ſtart in your favour, at once; is not a colony like this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to any thing of the ſort, you can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe in Europe?</p>
            <p>Art. III. <hi>Stipulates for a free intercourſe and commerce between the two parties, as far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards their territories in America. This commerce is to be carried on upon principles perfectly reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal; but it is not to extend to commerce carried on by water, below the higheſt ports of entry. The only reſervation in this article, is, the King of Great Britain does not admit the United States to trade to the poſſeſſions belonging to the Hudſon's Bay Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the <hi>citizens</hi> of Boſton object; <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it admits Britiſh ſubjects to an equal participation with our own citizens of the interior traffic of the United States with the neighbouring indians through our whole territorial dominion; while the advantages <hi>oſtenſibly</hi> reciprocated to our citizens, are limited both in their nature and extent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The word <hi>oſtenſibly</hi> is the only one of any weight in this objection. They could not ſay that the advantages were not reciprocal, as ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for; they, therefore, found out the word <hi>oſtenſible</hi> to ſupply the plan of contradiction. The article provides for advantages <hi>perfectly</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:028437_0048_0FD901ABF7E860C0"/>
reciprocal, and to ſay that they are only <hi>oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly</hi> ſo, is to ſay; <hi>the treaty ſays ſo, to be ſure, but it does not mean ſo.</hi> The fault then natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls upon the words, which ſay one thing and means another.</p>
            <p>Art. IV. <hi>Relates to a ſurvey of a part of the Miſſiſippi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Art. V. <hi>Relates to a ſurvey of the River St. Croix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would have been extremely hard, indeed, if theſe articles had not eſcaped cenſure. I cannot, indeed, ſay that they have eſcaped it altogether; for, I have been informed that the Democratic Society of Pennſylvania have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that the United States ſhould be bounded <hi>by nothing but the ſea.</hi> This, we may preſume, is in conſequence of the intimation of the Executive Council of France, who ordered Citizen Genet to aſſure the Americans, that <hi>with their help,</hi> nothing was eaſier than to finiſh <hi>the emancipation of the New World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Art. VI. <hi>Relates to debts due by citizens of the United States to Britiſh ſubjects, and provides,</hi> 
               <q>that by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of various lawful impediments ſince the peace, not only the full recovery of the ſaid debts has been delayed, but alſo the value and ſecurity thereof have been, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inſtances impaired and leſſened, ſo that by the ordinary courſe of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial proceedings, the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028437_0049_0FD901B1F7B546B8"/>
Britiſh creditors cannot now obtain, and actually have and receive full and adequate compenſation, for the loſſes and damages which they have thereby ſuſtained: It is agreed, that in all ſuch caſes where full compenſation for ſuch loſſes and damages cannot, for whatever reaſon, be actually obtained, had and received, by the ſaid creditors in the ordinary courſe of juſtice, the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States will make full and complete compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſame to the ſaid creditors.</q> 
               <hi>Then the article provides for the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of commiſſioners, who are to be inveſted with full power to determine finally on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral claims. Two commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are to be appointed by each party, and theſe four are to appoint a fifth.</hi>—<q>18 months, from the day on which the commiſſioners ſhall form a board, ſhall be aſſigned for receiving complaints and applications.—And the United States under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to cauſe the ſums ſo awarded to be paid in ſpecie, &amp;c.</q>

Art. VII. <hi>Relates to the ſpoliations on your commerce by Britiſh ſubjects, and provides,</hi> 
               <q>that during the courſe of the war, in which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is now engaged, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain citizens of the United States have ſuſtained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable loſs and damage by reaſon of irregular, or illegal captures or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of their veſſels and other property un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of authority or commiſſions from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028437_0049_0FD901B1F7B546B8"/>
and that from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious circumſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſaid caſes, adequate compenſation for the loſſes ſo ſuſtained can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now be actually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, had and received, by the ordinary courſe of judiciary proceedings; It is agreed, that in all caſes where adequate compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation cannot, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reaſon, be now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually obtained, had and received, by the ſaid mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and others in the ordinary courſe of juſtice, full and complete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the ſame will be made by the Britiſh Government to the ſaid complainants."—"And for the purpoſe of aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the amount of ſuch loſſes and damages five commiſſioners ſhall be appointed, and authorized to act in London, <hi>exactly in the manner directed with reſpect to thoſe mentioned in the preceding article."— "The ſame term</hi> of 18 months is alſo aſſigned for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of claims, and they are <hi>in like manner</hi> authorized to extend the ſame."—"And his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic Majeſty undertakes to cauſe the ſame to be paid to ſuch claimant in ſpecie, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have placed theſe two articles oppoſite to each other to give the reader an opportunity
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028437_0050_0FD901B4DD9322F0"/>
of comparing them; becauſe the <hi>citizens</hi> of Boſton Town-meeting ſeem to found their objection to both on the diſſimilarity between them. <q>The capture, ſay they, of veſſels and property of the citizens of the United States, made under the authority of the government of Great Britain is a national concern, and claims ariſing from ſuch cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ought not to have been ſubmitted to the deciſion of their admiralty courts, as the United States are thereby precluded from having a voice in the final determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſuch caſes. Beſides, the indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication propoſed to be made, is to be ſought by a proceſs tedious and expenſive, in which juſtice may be delayed to an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time, and eventually loſt to many of the ſufferers from their inability to purſue it; and <hi>this mode of indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication bears no proportion to the ſummary method, adopted for the ſatisfaction of Britiſh claims.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>You will not be able to account for this, 'till you are told, that the Town-meeting <hi>citizens</hi> never read the treaty, before they had ſanctioned theſe reſolutions. You ſee by the 6th and 7th articles, that the mode of indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification to the Britiſh ſubjects and American citizens is one and the ſame, that both are to be finally determined by commiſſioners, and both paid punctually in ſpecie; and yet the <hi>citizens</hi> of the Boſton Town-meeting ſee a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in every part of it. They complain
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028437_0051_0FD901B912EFDEB0"/>
that the deciſion of American claims is left to the Engliſh courts of admiralty, when the treaty ſays it ſhall be left, in caſes where ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction cannot be obtained in the ordinary courſe of juſtice, to commiſſioners, with full power to determine finally. They oppoſe things to each other which are not only the ſame in ſubſtance, but almoſt word for word. What muſt the Preſident think of the Town-meeting, when he received from them a ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs memorial, or rather ordonance, like this?</p>
            <p>It would be truely curious to know what mode of indemnification theſe <hi>citizens</hi> would have wiſhed for. Can there be a fairer, more honourable mode, than that fixed on by the treaty? It is likely they would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, if <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Pitt</hi> had been made to aſk pardon of their Majeſties the ſovereigns of America. I do not think it is at all improbable that they might believe, that this was eaſy for Mr. Jay to accompliſh. They have been ſo long cozened and cajoled by their <hi>public ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> as ſome of their <hi>maſters,</hi> have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to call themſelves, that they begin to think themſelves the ſovereigns, not only of the United States, but of the univerſe.</p>
            <p>What do they mean by the mode of indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification bearing no proportion to the <hi>ſummary method,</hi> adopted for the ſatisfaction of Britiſh claims? Can any method be too ſummary in the payments of debts, that have been due for <hi>twenty</hi> years? I think not. However, as I have already obſerved, ſummary or not ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, the method is exactly the ſame as that
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028437_0052_0FD901BAF8ADBC30"/>
adopted for the ſatisfaction of American claims, and, therefore, if you have reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, ſo have the Britiſh, and this would be ſingular, indeed.</p>
            <p>Art. VIII. <hi>Provides for the payment, &amp;c. of the above mentioned commiſſioners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Art. IX. <hi>Stipulates, that the ſubjects of Great Britain holding lands in the United States, and the citizens of the United States now holding lands in the dominions of his Britannic Majeſty, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to hold them, and, in what reſpects thoſe lands, ſhall not be regarded as aliens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Boſton Town-meeting <hi>citizens</hi> ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about this article. It was for ſome days a ſubject of newſpaper abuſe; but the oppoſers ſoon began to perceive, that they were fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt nothing; the article not being made to introduce a new ſyſtem, but merely to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh an old one.</p>
            <p>Art. X. <hi>Stipulates, that neither the debts due from individuals of the one nation to the individuals of the other, nor ſhares, nor money which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks, ſhall ever, in any event of war, or nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional differences, be ſequeſtered or confiſcated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That people who diſapprove of paying debts that have been due twenty years, ſhould alſo diſapprove of this article is not at all ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; accordingly the <hi>citizens</hi> of the Boſton Town-meeting highly diſapprove of it; <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſay they, the exerciſe of this <hi>right</hi> (the <hi>right</hi> to <hi>confiſcate</hi> &amp;c.) may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028437_0053_0FD901BCE4F4FBB8"/>
to preſerve the peace of the country, and protect the rights and property of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is well known (and will be well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered too) that, before <hi>Mr. Jay's</hi> departure for England, a reſolution was entered into by the Houſe of Repreſentatives, on the motion of <hi>Mr. Dayton,</hi> to ſequeſter all debts and funds, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> property of Britiſh ſubjects: The article before us guards againſt this, and as there was not an honeſt man in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on (a majority of the Houſe of Repreſentatives excepted), who did not execrate <hi>Mr. Dayton's</hi> plundering motion, as it was called, ſo, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is not one of that deſcription, who does not moſt cordially approve of the article which will, for the future, render ſuch moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons abortive.</p>
            <p>It was eaſy to foreſee that the King of Great Britain would never come to any arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without a proviſion of this kind. It would have been much better for his ſubjects to break off all communication with you at once, than to have not only their profits but their capitals depending on the arbitrary will of your government. Where would be the ſecurity of merchants trading to this country, if the debts due them might at any time be ſeized to pay for damages, received by Americans from ſomebody elſe.</p>
            <p>Credit is with nations as with individuals; while unimpaired it is almoſt unbounded, it can perform any thing; but one ſingle retrograde ſtep, and it is blaſted, it is nothing.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028437_0054_0FD901BDFB0D08F0"/>
Your credit has ſuffered much from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Mr. Dayton,</hi> and had the ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion become a law, or had the mercantile world been left in doubt concerning what might happen in future, one half of the great capitals that now give wings to your commerce. would have found their way to other countries, Riches ſeek ſecurity, as rivers ſeek the ſea.</p>
            <p>It is pretended by the Town-meeting, that a power to confiſcate might contribute <hi>to the peace of the country.</hi> This was certainly a very curious reaſon on which to found an objection to the article, and not leſs ſo, as coming from a faction, who have conſtantly cenſured the Preſident <hi>for not joining France in the preſent war.</hi> But, in place of contributing to the peace of the country, would it not be an eternal ſource of war? and is not this the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why all <hi>the old committemen, privateerſmen,</hi> and <hi>confiſcators</hi> are loath to abandon it? I think ſo. It is to be ſuppoſed that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will, for ſome years, conſiſt, partly, of men who would prefer the glutting of their impotent revenge to the good of their country; and of others who, while your connexions with France continue, will, for ſolid reaſons too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to need a mention, prefer her intereſts to yours. Theſe men will ever ſeek a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with Great Britain. With reſpect to war, however, they will be cautious, as far as open profeſſions go. The people have not yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got what war is. But, armed with confiſcating powers, they would brandiſh them at every turn; and plunder is a thing that pleaſes the

               </gap>, than to beat a Britiſh fleet or army, there is very little fear of their confiſcating meaſures being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the majority <hi>in number.</hi> But, would all end here? Would the Britiſh look tamely on? I am of opinion they would not. If the object of Great Britain, in offending you, ſhould be to provoke a war, ſhe would diſregard five or ſix millions of dollars; ſhould it not be war, an act of ſequeſtration or confiſcation would certainly produce a war. Thus, in both caſes, you would have war, and with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, that you would give your enemy a a fair pretext; from being the injured party, you would become the aggreſſors, unite every heart and hand againſt you in Great Britain, and excite the miſtruſt and contempt of other nations.</p>
            <p>To ſay that you have no other means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending <q>the rights and property of your ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,</q> is beyond expreſſion degrading; but the Town-meeting are not ſingular in this opinion. A writer in the <hi>Aurora</hi> of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, obſerves, that <q>confiſcation may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as <hi>the American weapon of defence,</hi> and that to abandon it, is an outrage on <hi>humanity, policy, juſtice, and natural right.</hi>
               </q> What! a nation of ſovereigns no weapon of defence but that of a ſwindler! Tell us no more, then, that you are a <hi>great</hi> people; give up all pretenſion to a place among the nations of the earth, for none of them have ever avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo vile, and puſillanimous a principle.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028437_0056_0FD901C8AE3BF3E8"/>
"<hi>Juſtice</hi> is outraged," becauſe you have ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>not</hi> to make the innocent ſuffer for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds of the guilty!

            <p>"The capture" (ſay the Town-meeting in another of their reſolutions) <q>The capture of the veſſels and property <hi>was a national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</hi>
               </q> Here, then, there is a good reaſon for depreciating <hi>Mr. Dayton's</hi> motion, in place of approving of it. But, <hi>Franklin</hi> has ſomething ſo very ſtriking on this ſubject, that it muſt not be paſſed over in ſilence. In one place he blames the Preſident for preventing the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Mr. Dayton's</hi> reſolution, which he calls a <hi>dignified meaſure;</hi> and in another place, ſpeaking of the indemnity obtained by the treaty he ſays, <q>The aggreſſion was an offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nation, and therefore <hi>no private compenſation</hi> ought to be deemed competent. As the depredations on our commerce and the indignities offered to our flag, were a <hi>national outrage,</hi> nothing ſhort of <hi>national ſatisfaction</hi> ought to be admitted. The pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies of Great Britain were committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the authority of the government, <hi>the government therefore ought to be anſwerable for them.</hi>
               </q> And yet, the ſame man that has made this plain, unequivocal declaration, has alſo declared, that it was a <hi>dignified meaſure,</hi> to

ſeize the property of <hi>innocent individuals,</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the banks, and the funds of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or in the hands of their friends! He has declared it to be a dignified meaſure, to rifle the bureau of the merchant, pry into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the friend, ſanction the proceedings of the villain, and forbid the honeſt man to pay his debts.</p>
            <p>One thing, above all, ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on this ſubject: that an act of ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or confiſcation muſt ever fail in its operation, or eſtabliſh the moſt conſummate tyranny. Do theſe <hi>humane citizens</hi> think, that I, for example, would give up what had been entruſted to me by a friend, or what I owed to a correſpondent? No; I ſhould look upon the oaths they might impoſe on me, as taken with a dagger at my breaſt. In ſhort, their plundering law, could never be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, except under the government of a French Convention.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Art. XII. <hi>Is to be the ſubject of a future nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, and, therefore, is not a part of the treaty as approved of by the Senate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Art.

               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:028437_0058_0FD901CED478AD48"/>To this the Town-meeting object; <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the commerce we have hitherto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in India, in common with other nations, is ſo reſtricted by this article, that, in future, it will be of little or no benefit to our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.</q> This objection ſeems to have been founded on a miſtake (perhaps a willful one), that has been propagated with a good deal of induſtry: <q>that this article prevents you from re-exporting the merchandiſe brought from the Britiſh territories in India.</q> It was excuſable in the <hi>citizens</hi> to follow up this error, becauſe they either did not, or could not, read the treaty; but, I hope, they will now take my word, and aſſure themſelves, that if ever any of them ſhould acquire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty enough to be concerned in mercantile affairs, and ſhould receive a cargo from India, they may ſhip it off again as ſoon as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Art. XIV. and XV. <hi>Stipulate for a free inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between the Britiſh dominions in Europe and the United States. The advantages are perfectly reciprocal, as far as they can be rendered ſo by treaty. The two parties agree that no higher du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall be paid by the ſhips or merchandiſe of the one party in the ports of the other, than ſuch as are paid by the like veſſels and merchandiſe of all other nations. This is the principal object of theſe articles; but there are ſome particular ſtipulations reſpecting the equalization of duties, &amp;c. in which Great Britain appears to have reſerved to itſelf a trifling advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:028437_0059_0FD90259339A4420"/>To theſe articles the Town-meeting have ſome particular objections; but as theſe are founded upon an opinion, expreſſed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in a general objection, it will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to anſwer the general objection only. <q>Becauſe the nature and extent of the exports of the United States are ſuch, that in all their ſtipulations with foreign nations they have it in their power to ſecure a perfect reciprocity of intercourſe, not only with the home do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of ſuch nations, but with all their colonial poſſeſſions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is firſt neceſſary to obſerve, that, what theſe citizens mean by <hi>reciprocity,</hi> goes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beyond the common acceptation of that term. They do not mean, <hi>an advantage for an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> they mean all the advantage on their ſide, and none on the other; they mean, that all the ports of all the nations with whom they trade ought to be as free for them as for the ſubjects of thoſe nations; they mean, that other nations ſhould maintain fleets and armies to keep up colonial poſſeſſions, and that they ſhould reap the profit of them; in ſhort, they mean, that all the <hi>poor ſubjects</hi> in the world are made for the <hi>citizens</hi> of the United States to domineer over. Nor is it much to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at that they ſhould entertain theſe lofty pretenſions, if we conſider how they have been <hi>becitizened</hi> and <hi>beſovereigned</hi> up within theſe few years. One half of them believe, that it is in their power to ſtarve the whole world, when they pleaſe to <hi>make</hi> the government put on an embargo; they were fretted to death
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028437_0060_0FD901D238CB1FA0"/>
that the Preſident would not let them go to take Canada, Nova Scotia and the Weſt Indies; nor would they have been pacified, if they had not been aſſured, that they ſhould have them all in a hundred years time.</p>
            <p>This is all very well for theſe Citizen-ſovereigns, and Sovereign-citizens; but for you who, I hope, have no pretenſion to this kind of civic royalty, it becomes you to talk and think like reaſonable creatures.</p>
            <p>Before I go any further, I muſt notice what <hi>Franklin</hi> ſays on the ſubject. <q>The articles of commerce in the United States are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the neceſſaries of life; few of its luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are born, or cultivated among us; does it appear, then, that a commercial treaty is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to afford an out-let to things of the firſt requiſition? It is a fact <hi>well aſcertained,</hi> that the Weſt India Iſlands are <hi>in a ſtate of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence among us,</hi> and by means of this dependence, <hi>we are enabled to make</hi> ſuch regulations with reſpect to our commerce, as ſhall render a treaty with Great Britain wholly ſuperfluous. <hi>It is equally aſcertained,</hi> that in our commerce with Great Britain herſelf, the balance of trade is conſiderably in her favour, and from this circumſtance likewiſe ſhe would be induced to <hi>reciprocate</hi> intereſts, without a commercial treaty, were <hi>thoſe means purſued which are in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
               </q> Now, to know the real value of the term <hi>reciprocity,</hi> take the following ſentences. <q>
                  <hi>If we cede an advantage for an advantage ceded to us, whence the boaſt of a treaty?</hi> She (Great Britain) can grant us no commercial
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028437_0061_0FD901D69BE4C328"/>
priveleges that our ſituation does not enable us to <hi>exact;</hi> why then wave the moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>demands,</hi> to obtain a grant of commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial advantages, which we could <hi>compel?</hi>
               </q> This is the language of all the <hi>Patriots</hi> of the preſent day.</p>
            <p>If what the <hi>Patriots</hi> ſay be true, then, you have it in your power to <hi>exact</hi> from Great Britain what conditions you pleaſe; 1ſt. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your articles of exportation are, in great part, neceſſaries of life; 2d. becauſe the Britiſh Weſt Indies are in a ſtate of dependence on you; 3d. becauſe the balance of trade with Great Britain is greatly in her favour.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Beauſe your articles of exportation are in great part, neceſſaries of life.</hi> This idea is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally of the populace, who look upon every barrel of proviſion ſhipped off to the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or elſe where, as ſo much loſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and as a kind of alms to keep the poor fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign devils from ſtarving: and, in return for this generoſity on their part, they imagine they have the power to <hi>compel</hi> the beggars to do juſt what they pleaſe. From the populace it found its way into Congreſs, under the auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a member of that body who made it the ground work of his famous reſolutions, intended to <hi>force</hi> Great Britain to yield you commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial advantages. No wonder, then, that it ſhould now be taken up by <hi>Franklin,</hi> and all the oppoſers of the treaty. They cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how a nation, to whom you throw a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of bread when you pleaſe, ſhould dare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe you any thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:028437_0062_0FD901D838FD1898"/>That your exports being, in great part, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life (that is <hi>eatables</hi>) ought to give you a preference in commercial relations, is an error, and not the leſs ſo for being a popular one. Commodities being eatabes may give the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler a preference in a town during the time of a ſeige, but not in the great world of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. It is as neceſſary for you to ſell your produce as for a toy-man to ſell his toys. If they rot in your ſtores their being neceſſaries of life will not diminiſh the loſs. If the land is obliged to lie fallow, the mill ſtand ſtill, and the veſſels rot at the wharfs, little ſatisfaction will it be to the farmer, the miller and the merchant, that they all uſed to be employed in cultivating and diſtributing the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of life. When a man is reduced to begga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for want of a vent for his goods, it ſignifies not a farthing to him, whether theſe goods were neceſſaries of life, or luxuries. No; it is the pecuniary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ariſing from trading with a nation, which ought to give, or which can give, that nation a right, or a power, to <hi>exact</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial advantages; and not the nature of the merchandize ſhe has to export.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe the Britiſh Weſt Indies are in a ſtate of dependence upon you.</hi> For my part, I cannot conceive how they make out this <hi>ſtate of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> The exportation of your articles being as neceſſary to you as the importation of them is to the Iſlands, you depend upon them, as much as they depend upon you. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Sugar, Molaſſes, Coffee, and Rum, from the Iſlands; theſe, too, are neceſſaries of life;
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028437_0063_0FD901D9B6397070"/>
and ſuch as you could not poſſibly do without. I cannot pretend to ſay what proportion your imports from the Iſlands bear to your exports to them; but there muſt be a balance of trade either for or againſt you. If the balance be againſt you, you receive more of the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of life from the Iſlands, than you carry to them, and they cannot, then, be in a ſtate of dependence, on that account: if the balance be in your favour, then the trade is an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous one for you, and, if it makes a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on either ſide, it makes you dependent on the Iſlands. Obſerve here, that the <hi>Patriots</hi> ſuppoſe you have the power of <hi>compelling</hi> Great Britain to do what you pleaſe, becauſe, in her trade with you, <hi>the balance is greatly in her favour,</hi> and becauſe, in your trade with the Weſt Indies, <hi>the balance is in your favour.</hi> Thus the Weſt India Iſlands are in a ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on you, becauſe you gain by them; and Great Britain is in the ſame ſtate becauſe ſhe gains by you! No wonder the citizens of the United States ſhould think themſelves ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe the balance of trade with Great Britain is greatly in her favour.</hi> This balance of trade, aſſert the <hi>Patriots,</hi> is to give you what terms you pleaſe to <hi>exact,</hi> 
               <q>if you purſue the means that are in your power.</q> Theſe means are <hi>prohibiting the importation of Britiſh merchandizes;</hi> and this, they aſſert, would do her much <hi>more harm than it would you.</hi> A bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter reaſon of action than this might, perhaps, be found; but as it ſeems to be a favourite
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028437_0064_0FD901DB541A3998"/>
one with them, and, indeed, the only one by which they are actuated, I ſhall take them up upon it, and endeavour to convince you, that they are miſtaken.</p>
            <p>I will ſuppoſe, with the <hi>Patriots,</hi> that the manufactures you receive from Great Britain are not neceſſary to you. I will ſuppoſe that you have the capitals and raw materials for eſtabliſhing manufactories of your own; I will ſuppoſe one third of your peaſants (I beg pardon, I meant <hi>Yeomen</hi>) and ſailors changed by a <hi>preſto</hi> into weavers, combers, fullers, whiteſmiths, &amp;c.  I will ſuppoſe the manufactories going on, and all of you inſpired with patriotiſm e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be happy, dreſs'd in the work of their hands; I will ſuppoſe, in ſhort, that you no longer ſtand in need of Britiſh manufactures. This is allowing my adverſaries every thing they can aſk, and all I aſk of them in return, is, to allow me, that Great Britain ſtands in no need of <hi>your manufactures.</hi> If they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe me this, as, I think, they cannot, I have not the leaſt doubt but I ſhall prove, that cutting off all communication between the countries, would injure you more than Great Britain.</p>
            <p>The imports being prohibited on each ſide, and both being able to do without them, the injury muſt ariſe from the ſtoppage being put to the exports; and as Great Britain ſells you much more than you ſell her, the <hi>Patriots</hi> maintain, that this ſtoppage would do her more harm than it would you. This was the ſhield and buckler of <hi>Mr. Madiſon.</hi> He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028437_0065_0FD901E1B6399F50"/>
the United States to a <hi>country gentleman</hi> and Great Britain to a <hi>pedlar;</hi> and declared, that you might do without her, but that ſhe could not do without you.</p>
            <p>How illuſive this is we ſhall ſee in a minute. It is a maxim in commerce, that the exports of a nation are the ſource of her riches, and that, in proportion as you take from that ſource, ſhe is injured and enfeebled; hence it follows, that cutting off the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Great Britain and you would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure her more than you, in proportion to the balance now in her favour; that is to ſay, <hi>if the total of her exports and the total of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports were to the ſame amount.</hi> But this is far from being the caſe: your exports amount to no more than 20 millions of dollars, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, 9 millions of which go to Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and her dominions, while the exports of Great Britain amount to 100 millions of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, no more than 15 millions of which come to the United States. Suppoſe, then, all communication cut off at once; you would loſe 9 twentieths of your exports, while Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain would loſe only 15 hundredths of hers: ſo that, if there be any truth in arithmetic, you would injure yourſelves three times as much as you would her.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations will, of courſe, have no weight with the honeſt ſtipendiaries of France; but with thoſe whoſe only deſire, is to injure Great Britain <hi>more</hi> than the United States, they ought to have ſome weight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:028437_0066_0FD901E372772C98"/>If what I have advanced on the ſubject be correct, "the nature and extent of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports" do <hi>not</hi> give you a power <q>to <hi>demand,</hi> to <hi>exact,</hi> to <hi>compel,</hi>

            <p>Art. XXVII. <hi>Stipulates for the giving up of murderers and forgers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This article has been the innocent cauſe of much alarm. The <hi>Patriots,</hi> lately imported from Great Britain and Ireland, and ſeveral members of the Democratic ſocieties in this country, were afraid that it was to have a <hi>retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective</hi> effect. Upon receiving an aſſurance to the contrary, their fears are in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure diſſipated; but they nevertheleſs oppoſe the treaty, on this account, with all their might. A writer (and I am miſtaken if he be not the ſame who has drawn up a certain peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Preſident) affirmed in one of your papers, a few days ago, that this article was <q>a cruel ſtab to the <hi>ſovereignty</hi> of the people, and militates againſt the <hi>law of nature!</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From the deſcription of the perſons who have hitherto oppoſed the treaty, and from the futillity of the reaſons they have given for their oppoſition, there is every reaſon to imagine, that great part of them object (in the bottom of their hearts) to this article only. If this be the caſe, it is pity the article was introduced. Forgers and murderers, if left to themſelves for a time after their flight, would not fail to meet the fate, which the article was made to inſure to them, and it is little matter in what country they ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Art. XXVIII. <hi>Relates to the duration of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ones, and the ratification of the treaty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This article, which ends the treaty, is of ſuch a nature as to admit of no objection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:028437_0069_0FD901E7F35572F0"/>Now, you will obſerve, that it is not my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to render this treaty palatable to you; I ſhall not inſiſt, therefore, that the terms of it are as advantageous as you might wiſh, or expect them to be; but I inſiſt that they are as advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous as you ought to have expected. Great Britain grants you favours, ſhe has never grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any other nation; and that no other nation, not even your Siſter Republic, has granted you. Nor can it be ſaid, that, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, you grant her favours, which you have not granted to other nations; ſeveral favours, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to France, you have ſtill withheld from Great Britain, even if the preſent treaty goes into effect. Great Britain does not, then, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive favours, as it has been abſurdly aſſerted, but ſhe grants them.</p>
            <p>Had the terms of the treaty been ſo decidedy advantageous to the United States as to deſtroy every principle of reciprocity, it might, <hi>perhaps,</hi> have eſcaped much of the cenſure that has been paſſed on it; but would any man of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been pleaſed with ſuch a treaty? Would he have ſeen in it the foundation of a laſting peace? No; he would have ſuſpected that it had been yielded to, in a moment of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment, merely to amuſe you, 'till a change of circumſtances would enable Great Britain to aſſume another tone, and refuſe you every thing; and, whatever your dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues may ſay to the contrary, ſuch a change was near at hand.</p>
            <p>I cannot diſmiſs this part of my ſubject, without obſerving, that <hi>Charles Fox</hi> made, in
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028437_0070_0FD901ED179A9A40"/>
the Britiſh Parliament, exactly the ſame objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the treaty, as the <hi>Patriots</hi> in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try have made. It was <hi>humiliating</hi> to Great Britain, he ſaid. Unfortunate, indeed, muſt be the negociators, who have made a treaty humiliating to both the contracting parties! <hi>Mr. Fox's</hi> cenſure is the beſt comment in the world on that of the American <hi>Patriots,</hi> and theirs on his.</p>
            <p>I now come to the third object of the cenſure of <hi>Franklin:</hi> the conduct of the Preſident relative to the treaty.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That ſuppoſing the terms of the treaty to be what every good American ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, yet the conduct of the Preſident, relative to the negociation and promulgation of it, has been highly improper, and even monarchical, and for which he deſerves to be <hi>impeached.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franklin</hi> has not obliged the world with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of impeachment regularly drawn up; but, as far as can be gathered from his letters, he would have the Chief Magiſtrate of the Union impeached; 1ſt. for having appointed <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> as Envoy extraordinary; 2d. for having appointed an Envoy extraordinary, on this occaſion, contrary to the opinion of the Houſe of Repreſentatives and of the Democratic Society; 3d. for his reſerve towards the Senate, previous to <hi>Mr. Jay's</hi> departure; 4th. for his reſerve towards the people; and, 5th. for having evaded a new treaty with France, while he courted one with Great Britain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:028437_0071_0FD901EE1041A2E8"/>The firſt of theſe, the appointing of Mr. Jay as Envoy extraordinary, is declared to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional.</hi> 
               <q>The Man of the people, ſays <hi>Franklin,</hi> it was believed, would not have conſented to, much leſs have originated a miſſion, hoſtile to the Conſtitution, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to the functions of the legiſlature, and inſulting to a Great people, ſtruggling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt tyrants. The appointment of the Chief Juſtice of the United States as Envoy extraordinary, to the court of Great Britain, put to defiance the compact under which we have aſſociated, and made the will of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive paramount to the general will of the people. The principle laid down by this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, ſtrikes at the root of our civil ſecurity; nay, it aims a deadly blow at liberty itſelf.</q> The word <hi>unconſtitutional</hi> is, with the oppoſers of the government, a word of vaſt import: it means any thing they pleaſe to have it mean. In their acceptation of the word, therefore, I cannot pretend to ſay that the conduct of the Preſident, in appointing <hi>Mr. Jay,</hi> was not <hi>unconſtitutional;</hi> but if <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional</hi> be allowed to mean, <hi>ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Conſtitution,</hi> I think it would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult to prove, that the appointment was <hi>unconſtitutional;</hi> for, certain it is, there is no article in the Conſtitution, that forbids, either litterally or by implication, the employing of a Chief Juſtice of the United States on an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary embaſſy. "The Conſtitution," ſays <hi>Franklin,</hi> 
               <q>has provided, that the different departments of government ſhould be kept diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028437_0072_0FD901F0E1564958"/>
and, conſequently, to unite them is a violation of it, and an encroachment on the liberties of the people, guaranteed by that inſtrument.—The appointment of <hi>John Jay,</hi> Chief Juſtice of the United States, as Envoy Extraordinary to the court of Great Britain, is contrary to the ſpirit and meaning of the Conſtitution; as it unites in the ſame perſon judicial and legiſlative functions.</q> If as it is here aſſerted, the Preſident had united the judicial with the legiſlative functions, it muſt be confeſſed, that he would have depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſpirit and meaning of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; but, has the mere negociation of a treaty any thing to do with the legiſlative functions? It appears to me not. Treaties are the ſupreme law of the land, and, therefore, the ſanctioning of them, the making of them laws, is a legiſlative act; but the mere draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them up, the preparing of them for the diſcuſſion of the legiſlature, is no legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive act at all.</p>
            <p>If negociating be a legiſlative act, it naturally follows, that nobody but the legiſlature, or ſome member or members of it, could be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a negociation; and the Conſtitution expreſsly provides, that, <q>no member of Congreſs ſhall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office, under the authority of the United States which ſhall have been created during ſuch time.</q> Thus then if the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution makes negociating a legiſlative act,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028437_0073_0FD901F1B2AAD340"/>
and, conſequently, requires a legiſlator to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate a treaty, and the <hi>latter</hi> poſitively forbids it, the whole clauſe reſpecting treaties is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, for there ought never to be any ſuch thing as treaties.</p>
            <p>When the ſecretary of either department brings forward a plan for the conſideration of Congreſs, does he act in a legiſlative capacity? And what more is an unratified treaty? In ſhort, if a negociator acts in a legiſlative capacity, ſo does every petitioner; nay, every clerk and printer, employed by Congreſs.</p>
            <p>The Chief Juſtice is further objected to as an Envoy Extraordinary; on this occaſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <q>treaties being the ſupreme law of the land, it becomes the duty of the judiciary to expound and apply them, and, therefore, to permit an officer in that department to ſhare in their formation, is to unite diſtinct functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tends to level the barriers of our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to eſtabliſh precedents pregnant with danger.</q> If the mere formations of laws by gentlemen of the bar tends to level the barriers of your freedom, I am afraid the barriers of your freedom are already levelled; for I believe, there are very few laws that do not paſs through their hands, or concerning which their advice is not aſked, before they are ſanctioned. <hi>Franklin</hi> (perhaps through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance) confounds the <hi>formation</hi> with the <hi>mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of a law; how eſſentially they differ I leave you to determine.</p>
            <p>To object to the Chief Juſtice as a negociator, becauſe it would become his duty to expound
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028437_0074_0FD901F621874850"/>
and apply the treaty he was to negociate, is what I ſhould expect from nobody but <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> or ſome one of his faction. Was ever a man, before, ſuppoſed to be leſs capable of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding and applying a law, becauſe he had aſſiſted in framing it? Or was he, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ever ſuppoſed to be leſs deſirous of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it duly and faithfully executed? Purſue this monſtrous maxim, and ſee where it will end. If it be unſafe to truſt the expounding and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of a law to him who has aſſiſted in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it, muſt it not be much more unſafe to truſt the expounding and application of it to thoſe who have aſſiſted in making it? And, is it not, then, unſafe to admit gentlemen of the law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Congreſs, without incapaciating them from pleading at the bar, or, at leaſt, from becoming judges, for ever after? Suppoſe, for inſtance, that one of the preſent Senators were to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Chief Juſtice in the room of <hi>Mr. Jay,</hi> would he not have to expound and apply the treaty which he has juſt aſſiſted in making? And ſhould ſome of the gentlemen of the other houſe be, at a future period, appointed judges of the ſupreme court, would they not have to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the laws, which, as legiſlators, they have aſſiſted in making? Should a commander in chief propoſe to Congreſs a plan for the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the troops, and ſhould it become a law, would it be ſaid, that the General had united the legiſlative with the military functions, and that he ought to be diſmiſſed from the ſervice, as unfit to expound and apply the law which he
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028437_0075_0FD901F7EF435998"/>
had propoſed. The principle of <hi>Franklin,</hi> if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted, would render it abſolutely impoſſible for the Congreſs to avail themſelves of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents or integrity of any one out of their own body.</p>
            <p>But, at any rate, had this objection been well founded; had there been cauſe to fear the conſequences of leaving the treaty to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and applied by him who had aſſiſted in framing it, the danger is now over: <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> is no more Chief Juſtice; the <hi>freemen</hi> of the State of New York knew how to eſtimate his merit rather better than <hi>Franklin.</hi> Fortune ſeems to have lent a hand in depriving the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the government of all grounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and yet they make a ſhift to keep the Union in an uproar.</p>
            <p>Another objection to ſending the Chief Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice on this miſſion, is, that <hi>a Preſident</hi> might thereby eſcape from the hands of juſtice, or, at leaſt, elude a trial. "From the nature," ſays <hi>Franklin,</hi> 
               <q>and terms of an impeachment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Preſident of the United States, it is not only neceſſary that the Chief Juſtice of the United States ſhould preſide in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but that he ſhould be above the bias which the honour and emolument in the gift of the Executive might create.</q> 'Tis true, the conſtitution ſays, that, <q>when the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the United States is tried, the Chief Juſtice ſhall preſide.</q> But, waving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence and moſt <hi>patriotic</hi> ingratitude of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation; admitting your Preſident to be what <hi>Franklin</hi> would make you believe he is,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028437_0076_0FD901FB741D27F0"/>
and that the neceſſity of impeaching him was a thing to be expected, I cannot perceive any great inconvenience that could ariſe from the abſence of the Chief Juſtice. The Preſident could not be impeached before the opening of Congreſs, and, by that time, it was reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the object of the extraordinary miſſion would be accompliſhed, and the Envoy ready to return. An impeachment againſt the Preſident could hardly be hurried on in ſuch a manner as not to leave an interval of four months between his accuſation and trial, a ſpace quite ſufficient for recalling the Chief Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. And as to the bias, that the honour and emolument attached to the office of Envoy might create in favour of the culprit Preſident, that could not be very powerful, becauſe, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Envoy muſt ceaſe, before the Chief Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice could enter on his functions as Judge on the Preſident; and <hi>Franklin</hi> ought to know by his own heart, that <hi>gratitude for paſt ſervices</hi> would have but very little weight in favour of the offender.</p>
            <p>There is one objection remaining, which, if well founded, is really of a ſerious nature. <hi>Franklin</hi> poſitively aſſerts, that the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Envoy Extraordinary was ſtrongly proteſted againſt by a very <hi>reſpectable minority</hi> of the Senate; and not by them alone, but by the <hi>Democratic Society of Pennſylvania</hi> alſo! That this reſpectable minority ſhould coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide in ſentiment with the Pennſylvania democratic ſociety is, indeed, a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that deſerves to be well attended to;
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028437_0077_0FD901FCF8824B18"/>
and, no doubt, it has had, and will yet have, due weight with the Preſident.</p>
            <p>How it came into the head of <hi>Franklin</hi> to introduce his club on this occaſion, it is not eaſy to imagine. He does not pretend, I hope, that there is ſomething unconſtitutional here alſo? The Conſtitution ſays, that the Preſident ſhall take the advice of the Senate, but it is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſilent with reſpect to the democratic ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Pennſylvania. Mightily "alarming," indeed, that the Preſident ſhould not conſult this club of butchers, tinkers, broken huk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and tranſatlantic traitors! Had he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fellow to fell an ox or mend a kettle, to bilk his creditors or blow up an inſurrection, he would have done well to addreſs himſelf to the democratic ſociety of Pennſylvania for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but to aſk their advice in the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Envoy Extraordinary would have been as prepoſterous as conſulting the devil in the choice of a Miniſter of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I have now anſwered, and I hope to your ſatisfaction, what <hi>Franklin</hi> calls his <hi>conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal objections</hi> to the appointment of <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> as Envoy Extraordinary: it remains for me to take notice of one of a more perſonal nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franklin,</hi> conſcious that <hi>Mr. Jay's</hi> charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for wiſdom and integrity was unimpeacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, has conjured up againſt him an opinion, which he gave ſome time ago, concerning the Weſtern Poſts. He ſays: <q>After the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made by <hi>John Jay</hi> that Great Britain was juſtifiable in her detention of the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Poſts, it was a ſacrifice of the intereſts
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028437_0078_0FD90201B280E4E0"/>
and peace of the United States to commit a negociation to him, in which the evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe poſts ought to form an eſſential part." This unqualified declaration, "that Great Britain was juſtifiable in her detention of the Weſtern Poſts,</q> is a moſt ſhameful miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation of <hi>Mr. Jay's</hi> opinion on the ſubject. By this declaration <hi>Franklin</hi> inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates, that <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> had given it as his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that Great Britain would be juſtifiable in her detention of the Weſtern Poſts for ever; whereas his opinion was, that ſhe was juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in detaining thoſe poſts, only 'till the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of the treaty of peace with reſpect to debts, due to Britiſh Subjects from ſome of the States, ſhould be fulfilled. And was there a candid, honeſt man in the United States who differed in opinion from <hi>Mr. Jay,</hi> on this ſubject? Very few I believe, except it were through ignorance. I am fully convinced, that there is not, at this time, a ſingle well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed man in this country, who is not ſatisfied, that Great Britain was juſtifiable in her deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Poſts; to object then, to <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> as an Envoy Extraordinary, becauſe he had given his opinion to that effect, was to object to him for having ſpoken the truth, like an independent honeſt man: indeed, the <hi>Patriots</hi> ſeem to look on honeſty as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſqualification, and, therefore, their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> is not ſo unaccountable as it otherwiſe would be.</p>
            <p>Muſt not thoſe people, who ſo boldly aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, that <hi>John Jay</hi> would betray your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028437_0079_0FD9020349072C28"/>
that he would ſell the Weſtern Poſts, &amp;c. have bluſhed when they ſaw that a ſurrender of theſe Poſts was the firſt thing he had ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for? No; a <hi>Patriot's</hi> ſkin is like the ſhield of the Grecian hero; blood cannot penetrate through "ten bull hides."</p>
            <p>The following anecdote will at once prove the injuſtice of charging <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> with a wiſh to abandon the Weſtern Poſts to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, and confirm the Prudence of the Preſident's choice.</p>
            <p>"From here," ſays Mr. Briſſot, <q>we went to New Rochelle. This place will always be celebrated for having given birth to one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed men of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Revolution; a republican remarkable for his firmneſs and his coolneſs, a writer eminent for his nervous ſtyle, and his cloſe logic, <hi>Mr. Jay.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>At the time of laying the foundation of the Peace of 1783, <hi>Mr. de Vergennes,</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by ſecret motives, wiſhed to engage the embaſſadors of Congreſs to confine their demands to the fiſheries, and to renounce the <hi>Weſtern Territory.</hi> The miniſter required particularly, that the independence of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica ſhould not be conſidered as the baſis of the peace; but, ſimply, that it ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional. To ſucceed in this project, it was neceſſary to gain over <hi>Jay</hi> and <hi>Adams. Mr. Jay</hi> declared to <hi>Mr. de Vergennes,</hi> that he would ſooner loſe his life than ſign ſuch a treaty; that the Americans fought for Independence; that they would never lay
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028437_0080_0FD90204A66C22C8"/>
down their arms 'till it ſhould be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated; that the court of France had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized it, and that there would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in her conduct, if ſhe deviated from that point. It was not difficult for <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> to bring <hi>Mr. Adams</hi> to his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and <hi>Mr. de Vergennes</hi> could never ſhake his firmneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> was equally immoveable by all the efforts of the Engliſh Miniſter, whom <hi>Mr. de Vergennes</hi> had gained to his party. <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> proved to him, that it was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Engliſh themſelves, that the Americans ſhould be independent, and not in a ſituation which would render them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on their ally. He converted him to his ſentiment; for his reaſoning determined the court of St. James's. When <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> paſſed through England in his return to America, <hi>Lord Shelburne</hi> deſired to ſee him. Accuſed by the nation of having granted too much to the Americans, he deſired to know, in caſe he had perſiſted not to accord to the Americans the <hi>Weſtern Territory,</hi> if they would have continued the war—<hi>Mr. Jay</hi> anſwered that he believed they would, and that <hi>he ſhould have adviſed it.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the man whom the <hi>Patriots</hi> accuſe of intentions of rendering the United States dependent on Great Britain, and of abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Weſtern Poſts! This is the man, who, after twenty years ſpent in the ſervice of his country, after having a ſecond time enſured
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028437_0081_0FD902054F542220"/>
its happineſs and proſperity, is called <q>a ſlave, a coward, a traitor,</q> and is burnt in effigy for having <q>bartered its liberty for Britiſh gold!</q> The ingratitude of republics and republicans has long been proverbial.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Franklin</hi> would have the Preſident im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, <hi>for having appointed an Envoy Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary to Great Britain contrary to the opinion of the majority of the Houſe of Repreſentatives.</hi> 
               <q>A majority of that Houſe, ſays <hi>Franklin,</hi> were in favour of dignified and energetic meaſures; they ſpurned the idea of a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and ignominious ſubmiſſion to robbery and outrage. The different propoſitions of of Meſſrs. <hi>Madiſon, Clarke,</hi> and <hi>Dayton</hi> ſubſtantiate this aſſertion.—And yet the Executive nominated an Envoy Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in coincidence with the minority, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently to defeat the intentions of <hi>the repreſentatives of the people.</hi> This fact is ſerious and alarming.</q> That the Preſident did nominate, and, by and with the advice of the Senate, appoint, the Envoy Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, contrary to the opinion of the majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, is, at leaſt, doubtful, becauſe no ſuch queſtion could be agitated in that houſe; but that he would have been juſtifiable in ſo doing is not doubtful at all. Your Conſtitution, which this Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue affects to call the palladium of your liberty, ſays that the Preſident, with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſhall appoint Embaſſadors, &amp;c. and not a word about the Houſe of Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:028437_0082_0FD9020A6254B240"/>Without directly denying the authority of the Preſident and Senate in the appointment of an Envoy Extraordinary, <hi>Franklin</hi> aſſerts that the exerciſe of that authority was in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance, interfering with the dignified and energetic meaſures that were pending in the Houſe of Repreſentatives. If the conſtitution had made an exception here, if it had provided that the Preſident and Senate ſhould not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point an Envoy, but that their functions ſhould be ſuſpended, while dignified and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic meaſures, were pending in the other Houſe, I ſhould be ready to confeſs, that the former had ſtepped beyond their authority; but, as the Conſtitution is ſilent on this ſubject, I cannot. It was poſſible, indeed, for the Houſe of Repreſentatives to fall into an indelicate inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Executive, on this occaſion, and, perhaps, they did ſo; but the Executive could not intefere with them, unleſs they had firſt begun to meddle with a branch of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which the Conſtitution had forbidden them to touch. What would be ſaid of the Preſident and Senate, were they to frame a money bill, paſs it, and ſend it to the other Houſe? Juſt as conſonant to the Conſtitution is it for that Houſe to intefere in the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or appointment, of an Envoy to a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign court.</p>
            <p>Beſides, as to the fact, how did the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Envoy interfere with the <hi>dignified and energetic meaſures?</hi> They were adopted by the Houſe of Repreſentatives, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028437_0083_0FD9020B391FF278"/>
to the Senate, who rejected them, and who would have rejected them, whether the Envoy had been previouſly appointed or not. This is evident, becauſe had they intended to ſanction the <hi>dignified and energetic meaſures,</hi> they would not have appointed the Envoy; and therefore, by delaying the appointment, 'till theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were rejected by the Senate, nothing could have been gained but a loſs of time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franklin</hi> ſeems to triumph in proving, that the Preſident acted contrary to the opinion of the Houſe of Repreſentatives. I have already obſerved that that Houſe had nothing to do in the appointment in queſtion; but, even ſuppoſe they had, is the Senate nothing? What is the uſe of three branches in the Conſtitution, if two of them muſt ever yield to the will of the third, or to the whim of a faction? To what end has a power been given to the Senate to reject bills ſent to them by the other Houſe, if they are never to exerciſe it, unleſs it ſhould ſhould happen to be agreeable to the democratic clubs? In ſhort, why is there a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and Preſident at all? And, indeed, it ſeems to be the opinion of your countryman <hi>Franklin,</hi> that theſe two branches, <hi>at leaſt,</hi> are uſeleſs. <q>If, ſays he, the <hi>immediate</hi> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people were to decide upon treaties, the ſecrecy in relation to them would be more tolerable.</q> After this ſentence, it is perfectly ridiculous to hear him cenſure the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration for acting <hi>unconſtitutionally;</hi> full as much ſo, as it is to hear my old friend <hi>Prieſtley</hi> rebuking <hi>Tom Paine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:028437_0084_0FD9020EF3145EC8"/>If the <hi>immediate</hi> Repreſentatives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as <hi>Franklin</hi> is pleaſed to call them, were permitted to decide upon treaties, there is no one act of authority that they would not ſoon exerciſe excluſively. Very ſoon would the whole power of the ſtate be conſecrated in one heterogeneous aſſembly, ſplit up into committees of confiſcation, war, and murder. Very ſoon would your legiſlature reſemble that of your Siſter Republic, where every crude idea that comes athwart the brain of a harlequin legiſlator, becomes a law in the ſpace of five minutes, and iſſues forth amidſt the acclamations of the ſovereign people, bearing terror and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation through the land. You may thank God that your Conſtitution has provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a legiſlative ſcourge like this. It is this prudent proviſion alone that has ſaved you from the dreadful conſequences, which the dignified and energetic meaſures of the <hi>patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic</hi> triumvirate, <hi>Madiſon, Clarke,</hi> and <hi>Dayton,</hi> would moſt inevitably have produced.</p>
            <p>After having cenſured the Preſident for not acting in coincidence with the ſentiment of the <hi>majority</hi> of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, <hi>Franklin</hi> returns to the charge by cenſuring him for acting in coincidence with the ſentiment of the <hi>minority</hi> of the ſame Houſe; this he calls, "a ſerious and an alarming fact," juſt as if it was not an unavoidable conſequence of the other. But, it is not a little extraordinary to hear him cenſure the Preſident for acting in coincidence with the <hi>minority</hi> of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, when, a few pages before,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028437_0085_0FD90213AEB8A1E0"/>
he cenſures him for <hi>not</hi> acting in coincidence with the ſentiment of the <hi>reſpectable minority</hi> of the Senate? Perhaps the epithet <hi>reſpectable,</hi> which <hi>Franklin</hi> has beſtowed on his <hi>minority</hi> of the Senate (and of which, I ſuppoſe, the <hi>reſpectable Mr. Maſon</hi> was one), render them ſuperior to the majority, and, if ſo, their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion certainly ought to have been followed. But, the truth is, I believe, this <hi>reſpectable minority</hi> of the Senate were in favour of thoſe dignified and energetic, or dragooning, plundering, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which the Preſident did not approve of, and ſo were the majority of the Houſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives; and this is the reaſon why <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> who is a ſort of war trumpet, would have had him guided by the minority of one Houſe and by the majority of the other.</p>
            <p>The Preſident's having acted in coincidence with the minority of the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ought to be looked upon as a mere matter of accident; for, on the appointment of an Envoy, it was not neceſſary for him to take cognizance of what was paſſing amongſt them; but, as to his acting in coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the majority of the Senate, it was a duty that the Conſtitution im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on him. According to the wiſh of <hi>Franklin,</hi> the Preſident ſhould have rejected the advice of that branch of the legiſlature which the Conſtitution has aſſociated with him in the appointment of an Envoy, to adhere to the advice of another branch, to which the Conſtitution has allotted no participation in
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028437_0086_0FD90214F3362738"/>
ſuch appointments. This is what the <hi>Patriots</hi> would have called acting <hi>conſtitutionally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not content with accuſing the Preſident of acting unconſtitutionally in nominating an Envoy to Great Britain, <hi>Franklin</hi> adds, that he did it <q>apparently to defeat the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Repreſentatives of the people.</q> There is a good deal of bitterneſs in this. If, by the <hi>Repreſentatives of the people, Franklin</hi> means the majority of the Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives alone, I aſſent to the truth of his remark: nay, I will go further, and own, that I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded, the Preſident did appoint the Envoy Extraordinary on purpoſe to defeat their intentions. But, were I an American, very far ſhould I be from imputing this to him as a crime; for, had he not defeated their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you would by this time have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of pity rather than of envy.</p>
            <p>There was no perſon of the leaſt diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who was not well aſſured that the object of your <hi>patriotic</hi> Members of Congreſs, was to reduce you to the neceſſity of making a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe with the French. I know they pretended, that they wiſhed to preſerve peace. With this deſirable object in view one propoſed laying ſuch duties on Britiſh merchandiſe and ſhips, as would go nearly to a prohibition; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother propoſed an entire prohibition; and a third, in order to preſerve peace with Great Britain, propoſed ſeizing all debts and funds, the property of Britiſh ſubjects! Theſe were ſomething like the peace meaſures adopted in 1776, and had there been a ſecond Independence
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028437_0087_0FD9021BC0141888"/>
to gain, no good Whig could have objected to their being revived; but this gaining of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is a game of hazard that no nation ever ought to play but once. At the preſent time, it would be an exceedingly ſilly game for you; you have every thing to loſe, and nothing to win.</p>
            <p>I am totally at a loſs to account for theſe gentlemen's motives in endeavouring to plunge this country into a war with Great Britain. I will not affect to believe, that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of foreign gold, though I believe them to be as corruptible, at leaſt, as <hi>Mr. Jay.</hi> Intereſted conſiderations could have no weight with them; for, they appear to have loſt all idea of private as well as public intereſt. But whatever might be their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the meaſures they propoſed were fraught with beggary, ruin, and diſhonour, and if the Preſident, by his nomination of the Envoy to Great Britain, contributed to their being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, though ſupported by the majority of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, he is entitled to the bleſſing of every lover of this country.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Franklin</hi> would have the Preſident im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, <hi>for his reſerve towards the Senate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to Mr. Jay's departure. Franklin</hi> ſays <q>the advice of the Senate was not taken in the treaty with Great Britain.</q> By this, he ought to mean, that the Senate was not inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the particular objects to be obtained by <hi>Mr. Jay's</hi> miſſion; for, if he means (which is poſſible) that their advice was not taken on the ſubject of the miſſion itſelf, and of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028437_0088_0FD9021BC3560CB8"/>
to be employed on it, he wiſhes to impoſe on the unwary what he knows to be untrue. On theſe ſubjects their advice was taken, and any further it was not neceſſary, either in a conſtitutional or prudential point of view.</p>
            <p>
               <q>By the Conſtitution, ſays <hi>Franklin,</hi> all treaties are to be made by and with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and conſent of the Senate. The term <hi>advice</hi> has a natural and obvious reference to negociation; <hi>that no negociation ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into but with the advice of the Senate.</hi>
               </q> Before I take the liberty of contradicting our Demagogue here, give me leave to make him contradict himſelf. "The Preſident," ſays he, in another place, <q>has power by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi> treaties; that is, the Senate has the power to accept or reject any treaty negociated by the Preſident; <hi>but this power has not gone to prevent him from opening a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation with any nation he thought proper.</hi>
               </q> This <hi>Patriot</hi> was determined no one ſhould tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in confuting it. A diſputant that thus contradicts himſelf point blank, without any kind of ceremony or apology, ſets his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary at defiance.</p>
            <p>Reſerving myſelf 'till by and by to account for theſe contradictory expoſitions of the ſame text, I am ready to allow, that the latter of them exactly meets my ſentiments; that is, that the ſhare of power, in making trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, allotted to the Senate, <hi>does not go to prevent the Preſident from opening a negociation with
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028437_0089_0FD9021FD786A8C8"/>
any nation he may think proper.</hi> This is ſo clearly pointed out by the Conſtitution, that one is aſtoniſhed to hear it controverted by perſons capable of reading. "He ſhall," ſays that inſtrument, <q>have power, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, to to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators preſent concur: and he ſhall nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and by and with the advice of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſhall appoint Embaſſadors, &amp;c.</q> And yet <hi>Franklin,</hi> in one place, inſiſts that the term <hi>advice</hi> has a natural and obvious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to negociation <hi>only;</hi> 
               <q>for, ſays he, it would be the extremity of abſurdity to ſay, that advice was neceſſary <hi>after the thing was done.</hi>
               </q> Whether he has willfully, or through ignorance, confounded <hi>the making</hi> of a treaty with the forming of a treaty, is to me a matter of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty (for he poſſeſſes qualities that render either probable), but that he has confounded them is a clear caſe. A treaty is not <hi>made</hi> 'till it be <hi>ratified</hi> and, therefore, preſenting it to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for their conſideration, before it be ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not taking their advice <hi>after the thing is done.</hi> It is taking their advice before it is done; but not, as he ſeems to think ought to be the caſe, <hi>before it is begun.</hi> The natural and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſenſe, and, indeed, the only ſenſe of the clauſe of the Conſtitution juſt quoted, is, in my opinion; that the Senate is to be conſulted in making treaties, but not in opening negociations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franklin</hi> has had the ingenuity to give to the words <hi>advice</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> an application, that moſt certainly never entered into the thoughts
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028437_0090_0FD902240A762D48"/>
of thoſe who framed the Conſtitution. Can he be ſerious in confining <hi>advice</hi> to what precedes the negociation, and <hi>conſent</hi> to what follows it? If this were correct, the Senate ought never to give their conſent to a negociation, nor their advice concerning a ratification.</p>
            <p>To me the ſenſe of the Conſtitution is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely clear, as to this point. The words <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> have both a reference to what follows the negociation; and this will fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if their import in the latter part of the above clauſe be well weighed. <q>The Preſident ſhall nominate, and, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, appoint Embaſſadors, &amp;c.</q> Now, if <hi>advice</hi> in the making of treaties, has a natural and obvious reference to <hi>negociation;</hi> ſo, in the appointment of Embaſſadors, it muſt have reference to <hi>nomination.</hi> I leave any one to judge how nonſenſical it would have been to authorize the Senate to conſent to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a perſon, whoſe nomination they had before <hi>adviſed;</hi> and yet it would not be more ſo than to give them the power of conſenting to the terms of a treaty formed by their <hi>advice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, it would be ſlandering the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſuppoſe that it contained any thing approaching ſo near to the anarchical, as to ſubject the particular objects of a negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to an aſſembly, not obliged to ſecrecy, before the negociation is opened. Were this ever to be the caſe, it eaſy to foreſee that it would be impoſſible to conclude any treaty of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or, at leaſt, to conclude it with
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028437_0091_0FD90225706A97A0"/>
advantage. Suppoſe, for inſtance, that the threatened rupture with Great Britain had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it neceſſary for you to form a cloſe alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with ſome power in Europe, and that the Preſident had been obliged to make known every ſtipulation to be made on your part, before the departure of the Envoy; can you believe that, with ſuch a perſon as <hi>Mr. Maſon</hi> in the Senate (and, from the degeneracy of human nature, you ought to expect that there ever will be ſome ſuch in it), the affair would have been kept ſecret, 'till concluded? or even 'till it was begun? No; I'll be hanged if it would. It would have been known in London long before the Envoy's arrival in Europe, and you would have had an Engliſh fleet upon your coaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could poſſibly have fulfilled his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>Among thirty perſons there muſt ever be a difference in opinion, there muſt ever be a majority and a minority, and a recent, a very recent, example ought to convince you, that a perſon of a factious diſpoſition, who has the mortification to find his ſchemes diſconcerted, to find himſelf lurched in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, will go above half way to hell to fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the intentions of the majority. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſe in the framers of the Conſtitution to give the Preſident a power to treat, without previouſly conſulting the Senate with reſpect to the objects to be obtained by the treaty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Preſident ought to be impeached, according to <hi>Franklin, for his reſerve towards the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:028437_0092_0FD9022AA279F938"/>When ignorance or factiouſneſs, or both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, have led a man beyond the bounds of truth and candour, they never let him go, 'till they have plunged him into an abyſs of abſurdity. Thus has it happened to <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</hi> After having perſuaded himſelf that the Preſident ought to withhold nothing from the knowledge of the other branches of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it was natural for him to purſue the error, 'till he found, that, <q>to withhold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of a treaty from <hi>the people,</hi> 'till it was ratified, indicated a contempt for public opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and a monarchical ſupremacy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He ſays that Republics ought to have no ſecrets, and adds, in the words of <hi>Thomas Paine,</hi> "the ſecrets of courts, like thoſe of individuals, are always their defects." I do not know whether <hi>Franklin</hi> has ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened his poſition or not, in your opinion, by bringing to his aid a maxim of the old bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken exciſeman, <hi>Paine;</hi> in my opinion, he has weakened it by ſuch an auxiliary. <hi>Paine,</hi> if I miſtake not, was one of the half do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of <hi>Lycurguſes</hi> who framed that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of your Siſter Republic, which is commonly called <hi>The Conſtitution of</hi> 1793, and which the gaunt Pariſians imagine will ſhower down bread amongſt them, like manna from heaven. When this Conſtitution begins to operate, there will, undoubtedly, be no ſuch thing as ſecrecy in the happy country which is to be governed by it; but it will be prudent in you to wait, 'till you ſee its effects, before you act upon its principles;
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028437_0093_0FD9022B76CBA238"/>
and, in the mean time, as you enjoy peace and proſperity under your preſent half-Engliſh Conſtitution, it will be right to guard it as much as poſſible againſt the attacks of the modern <hi>Patriots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In the compact, ſays <hi>Franklin,</hi> entered into by the citizens ot the United States, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conceſſions were made by them, and theſe conceſſions are ſpecified in the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; but, have they conceded a right to an acquaintance with their own affairs?</q> Yes, if his queſtion applies, as it evidently does to the terms of an unratified treaty, the people have conceded a right to an acquaintance with their own affairs; for, in the right of making treaties is neceſſarily included the right of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a prudent ſecrecy concerning them, and, as the former is expreſly conceded to the Preſident and Senate, ſo is the latter. The people have conceded the right of making trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the conceſſion is unconditional; they have made it without reſerving to themſelves the right of demanding their promulgation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they become the law of the land; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerving to themſelves the right of adviſing, diſputing, and caballing about their contents, before they are known, or of tormenting and reviling the Executive, and burning the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciators in effigy, when their contents are known.</p>
            <p>But, would not <hi>Franklin</hi> be very far from being content with the people's having this knowledge of their own affairs? Would he be willing to ſtop here? No. "Where the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028437_0094_0FD9022CF06FD760"/>
people" ſays he <q>are virtually, and not nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the ſovereign, the magiſtrates <hi>partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,</hi> but do not <hi>monopolize</hi> the ſupremacy.</q> As he applies this to the treaty, it is evidently his wiſh to perſuade you, that ſomebody elſe, beſides thoſe who now make treaties, ought to participate therein, and who this ſomebody is, he takes care to inform you in the next ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. <q>If the people, he continues, have the right and <hi>capacity to govern themſelves,</hi> they are certainly entitled to a knowledge of their own affairs; if they are not, a republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can government is wholly unfitted to them, for this form of goverment is founded upon the preſumption <hi>that they poſſeſs ſuch a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> The people being the <hi>legitimate ſovereign</hi> of our government, they have the ſame right to a knowledge of the affairs of ſtate as a <hi>Monarch,</hi> and every reſtraint upon this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is an abridgement of their rights.</q> Now, without deſcanting upon the ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant nonſenſicalneſs of this paſſage; without inſiſting on the abſurdity of a government's being founded upon the preſumption that the people are capable of governing themſelves; without enquiring what is meant by the legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſovereign of a government, I ſhall come at once to <hi>Franklin's</hi> republican <hi>Monarch.</hi> It is well known, that a <hi>Monarch</hi> ought to be at the head of all the great affairs of ſtate, and if the people in a republic ought to have the ſame ſway, a treaty could not only never be ratified, but it never could be negociated, without their advice being previouſly taken, and their conſent
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028437_0095_0FD90233428B2B38"/>
obtained. <hi>Franklin's</hi> great fault, as a writer, is, want of memory. Muſt it not ſhock the reader to hear him give to his <hi>Sovereign People</hi> exactly the ſame rights as thoſe exerciſed by a <hi>Monarch,</hi> when, in the very ſame page, he affirms, that, "to naturalize the practices of Monarchies in a republic is a direliction of every juſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple."?</p>
            <p>To eſtabliſh the principle that the ſovereign people ought to take an active part in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of treaties appears to be the real object of <hi>Franklin,</hi> while he is talking about their being acquainted with their own affairs. <q>To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect, ſays he, the ſecrecy of a <hi>divan</hi> with the formation of a treaty is to double <hi>the inſecurity</hi> of committing the truſt <hi>out of the hands of the people;</hi> for a treaty may be made to barter away our eſſential intereſts, and the people may remain ignorant of it, 'till it is too late for a <hi>remedy.</hi>
               </q> His meaning here is by no means equivocal. If it be inſecure to commit the truſt out of the hands of the people, it ought to remain in their hands: if the people have the right to apply <hi>a remedy,</hi> they muſt have the right of <hi>prevention</hi> alſo, which is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And, indeed, this is a ſelf-evident conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for, it would be mere nonſenſe to pretend, that they have a right to be informed of all the ſecrets of a negociation, without having a right to break it off. If they have not a right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a treaty's going into effect, where would lie the advantage of having it communicated to them previous to its ratification? What ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction could they derive from being tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized

with a view of dangers, that they could not avoid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franklin</hi> has been pleaſed to ſay ſomething about conceſſions, made by the people; but, according to his ſubſequent account of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I cannot perceive that they have made any at all. For where is the uſe of their having ſaid to the Preſident and Senate, <q>you ſhall have the <hi>ſole</hi> power of making treaties,</q> if they are to make them themſelves? If, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their having conceded the power of making treaties to the Preſident and Senate, they ſtill retain that power, the ſame will hold good with reſpect to every other power they have conceded by the Conſtitution; and then, what conceſſion have they made? None at all; with their capacity to govern, they ſtill retain all their governing powers, and every nation that would treat with the United States, ought to addreſs itſelf to His multifarious and many-headed Majeſty, <hi>The People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Franklin</hi> would adviſe the impeachment of the Preſident, <hi>for having evaded a new trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with France, while he courted one with Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the great offence; to bring this home to the Preſident ſeems to have been the chief object of <hi>Franklin,</hi> who is affected by nothing that does not concern the French Republic.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed any further, it is neceſſary to give you a brief hiſtory of the "Letters of Franklin." Whoever reads theſe letters with the ſmalleſt attention, muſt perceive, that
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028437_0097_0FD90235F3010990"/>
they are, originally, a French production. Every one of them ends with an addreſs to the paſſions of the ſovereign people. Theſe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory parts betray their origin in a more ſtriking manner than the reſt of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. Here we ſee every where a cloſe and ſervile imitation of the illiterate new fangled jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon of the French Convention, a heterogeneous mixture of inſolence, ſervility, vaunting, and lamentation. The author, or rather tranſlator, is eaſily gueſſed at, if you pay attention to his affectionate expreſſions towards <hi>Citizen Genet.</hi> He calls <hi>Mr. Jay the libeller of Citizen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net;</hi>" and great part of his malice againſt that Gentlemen ſeems to have no other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In ſhort, I am fully perſuaded, that this <hi>Franklin</hi> is the ſame perſonage who rendered himſelf ſo extremely odious in the diplomatic diſpute between <hi>Citizen Genet</hi> and your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>The quarter, too, from whence theſe <hi>Letters</hi> iſſued, ſeems to correſpond with the reſt of their hiſtory. They were firſt publiſhed, in a paper famous for its anti-federal principles. The printer who is alſo a <hi>Colonel,</hi> went to France in 1792, to combat, in the cauſe of liberty and humanity, againſt the ſatellites of the combined deſpots; and he returned to Philadelphia in 1793, about the time that <hi>Citizen Genet</hi> arrived there. What rank this Colonel and Printer bore in the armies of your Siſter Republic, or whether he be <hi>ſtill in her ſervice,</hi> I know not; but it ought not to be wondered at, if his zeal in her
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028437_0098_0FD9023ACC531B08"/>
cauſe, in "the cauſe of the human race," ſhould have prompted him to ſerve her in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia as well as in Flanders; the Colonel might do as much execution with his printer's balls as with his cannon balls; perhaps more; and (which is a circumſtance by no means to be overlooked) the former are employed with leſs danger than the latter.</p>
            <p>Now, with this key, you will be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the ſpirit of many expreſſions and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of <hi>Franklin,</hi> which, without it, muſt appear totally incomprehenſible.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We have, ſays <hi>Franklin,</hi> treated the <hi>overtures</hi> of France for a treaty, with neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. The nation that has barbarouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted us, and plundered us, we have court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>meanly courted,</hi> and the nation <hi>on whom our political exiſtence depends,</hi> and who <hi>has treated us with affection,</hi> we have treated with indifference bordering on contempt. <hi>Citizen Genet</hi> was empowered to propoſe a treaty with us on liberal principles, ſuch as might ſtrengthen the bonds of good will which <hi>unite</hi> the two nations.</q> How your government has <hi>courted</hi> Great Britain, how your political exiſtence depends on France, and how ſhe has treated you with affection, we have already ſeen; it only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for us to ſee what were the "liberal principles," which Citizen Genet was autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to treat upon, and whether it was pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on your part, to refuſe to treat upon thoſe "liberal principles," or not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="unknown:028437_0099_0FD9023E306A5D08"/>But, previouſly, it is neceſſary to obſerve, that, let theſe "liberal principles" be what they might, the Preſident's conduct in refuſing or evading to treat on them could amount to no more than <hi>imprudence.</hi> The Preſident, I agree, has power to open negociations with any nation he thinks proper, and then, ſays <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> 
               <q>why did he not treat with <hi>Citizen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net?</hi>
               </q> To which I anſwer, that the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, in authorizing the Preſident to open ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations with any nation whom <hi>he thinks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> to treat with, has not obliged him to open negociations with every nation that thinks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to treat with him. It has not obliged him to open negociations with a nation ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as not to be depended on for the value of a cargo of flour, with a nation in jeopardy, with an aſſembly who had declared themſelves a committe of inſurrection againſt every go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment on earth not founded on their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, with an Executive Council compoſed of half a dozen unhappy wretches, who were all either publicly executed or outlawed, before the treaty with them could have been ratified; no; the Conſtitution has obliged him to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this ſort, if it had I am ſure, he never would have accepted the poſt of Preſident. The Conſtitution has left it intirely to his own pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to make or to avoid treaties; whether he has on the preſent occaſion, made a good uſe of the truſt repoſed in him, or not, we ſhall now ſee.</p>
            <p>As a preliminary, I muſt obſerve, that the Preſident's <hi>Proclamation of Neutrality</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028437_0100_0FD902401AA653A0"/>
by you all, with a very few exceptions, with the moſt unequivocal marks of approbation. If, then, the treaty propoſed by <hi>Citizen Genet</hi> went directly to render that Proclamation nugatory, or to make it a maſque to cover the hoſtilities of ſuch Americans as choſe to make war upon the enemies of France, you will be obliged to approve of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent's conduct in avoiding to treat with <hi>Citizen Genet,</hi> or expoſe yourſelves to a charge of the moſt palpable inconſiſtency.</p>
            <p>Soon after the <hi>Citizen's</hi> arrival at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, he announced to the Preſident, through the Secretary of State, that he was authorized to open a negociation with the government of the United States. I have not room to give you his letter at length here. It was one of thoſe <hi>fanfaronnades</hi> for which the French Republicans are ſo famous, and for which any man, ſuppoſed to be in his ſenſes, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a good kicking.—I will give it a place; it is a diplomatic curioſity that merits to be preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <p>The obſtacles raiſed, with intentions hoſtile to liberty, by the perfidious miniſters of deſpotiſm; the obſtacles whoſe object was to ſtop the rapid progreſs of the commerce of the Americans, and the extenſion of their principles, exiſt no more. The French Republic, ſeeing in them brothers, has opened to them, by the decrees now encloſed, all her ports in the two worlds; has granted them all the favours her own citizens enjoy in her vaſt <hi>poſſeſſions;</hi> has invited them to participate the benefits of her navigation, in granting to their veſſels the ſame rights as to her own; and has charged me to propoſe to your government, to eſtabliſh in <hi>a true fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compact,</hi> that is in <hi>a national compact,</hi> the liberal and fraternal baſis, on which ſhe wiſhes to ſee raiſed the commercial and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſyſtem of two people, <hi>all whoſe intereſts are confounded.</hi>

                  <p>I am inveſted, Sir, with the power neceſſary to undertake this important negociation of which <hi>the ſad annals of humanity offer no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> before the brilliant aera at length open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it.</p>

               <pb n="95" facs="unknown:028437_0102_0FD90245A1E22DD8"/>This letter admits of half a dozen interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. One would imagine by its outſet, that the French Convention was graciouſly pleaſed to ſuffer you to remain in peace, <q>notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe had a right to reclaim the obligations impoſed on the United States, and which ſhe had cemented with <hi>her blood;</hi>
               </q> but, what follows ſeems to overturn this ſuppoſition; for the Citizen declares that <q>the emiſſaries of your <hi>common enemies</hi> were making <hi>uſeleſs efforts</hi> to <hi>neutralize</hi> the gratitude, and to damp the zeal of your fellow citizens &amp;c.</q> 
               <hi>Citizen Genet</hi> arrived ſoon after the proclamation of neutrality was iſſued, and he took the earlieſt opportunity of declaring, that <hi>uſeleſs</hi> efforts had been made to <hi>neutralize</hi> the gratitude of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of America; and yet <hi>Franklin</hi> and all the other ſtipendiaries of France aſſert, that <q>France with a magnanimity which ſhe alone ſeems ſuſceptible of, has not urged the fulfillment of her treaty with you; but that, ſhe has expreſſed her wiſh, and her conduct has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, that you ſhould remain in peace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We will allow that <hi>Citizen Genet's</hi> letter might mean, that France wiſhed you to remain in peace (for it may be made to mean any thing) yet that letter is not the document to which you are to look, to know the gracious intentions of your Siſter Republic. At the ſame time that the Citizen came forward with his republican <hi>fanfaronnade</hi> to propoſe negociations; he carried in his pocket certain <hi>inſtructions</hi> according to which the propoſed treaty was to be formed, and from which he could not depart. By the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028437_0103_0FD902467889E080"/>
that I am going to make from thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, it will appear to every one of you, who is not ſo prepoſſeſſed in favour of the French as to be incapable of conviction, that the new treaty was to accord you no advantages, of which your participation in the war was not to be the price, and that <hi>Citizen Genet</hi> was to plunge you into a war, with or without the conſent of your government, to make a diverſion in favour of France, at the expence of your proſperity, and even your very exiſtence as a nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Citizen Genet,</hi> though abundantly aſſuming and inſolent, though uniting the levity of a Frenchman to the booriſhneſs of a Calmuck, though deſerving of much cenſure from your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, has, however, been loaded with a great deal of unmerited odium by the people of the United States. The man acted in full conformity to his inſtructions in all his attacks on your independence, and, therefore, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is to be attributed to the Government of France, or the ſovereign people of that <hi>happy</hi> Republic, and not to the poor citizen himſelf. He was a mere machine in the buſineſs, and his not being ordered home to anſwer for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, is a ſtrong preſumptive proof, that the ſovereigns of France apprroved of it, without daring to avow it openly. I ſay without <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> to avow it; becauſe, though you could not have directly chaſtiſed them, yet they wanted your flour, and it is well known, that empty cupboards are no leſs formidable than great guns.</p>

            <p>
               <q>Struck with the grandeur and importance of this negociation, the Executive Council preſcribe to <hi>Citizen Genet,</hi> to exert himſelf to ſtrengthen the Americans in the principles which led them to unite themſelves to France:—The Executive Council are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſet on foot a negociation upon thoſe foundations, and they do not know but that ſuch a treaty admits a latitude ſtill more extenſive in becoming a national agreement, in which two <hi>great</hi> people ſhall <hi>ſuſpend their commercial and political intereſts</hi> to befriend the empire of liberty, <hi>wherever it can be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,</hi> and <hi>puniſh</hi> thoſe powers who ſtill keep up an excluſive colonial and commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſyſtem, by declaring that their veſſels ſhall not be received in the ports of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting parties. <note n="*" place="bottom">Here we ſee the ground work of the <hi>reſolutions</hi> of Citizens <hi>Madiſon</hi> and <hi>Clarke.</hi>

                  </note>—The Executive Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil has room to believe that the conſideration of their own independence depending on our ſucceſs, added to the <hi>great commercial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,</hi> which we are diſpoſed to concede to the United States, will determine their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to adhere to all that <hi>Citizen Genet</hi> ſhall propoſe to them on our part. As it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, however, that they may adopt a timid and wavering conduct, the executive Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil charges him, in expectation that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican government will finally determine <hi>to make a common cauſe with us,</hi> to take ſuch ſteps us will appear <hi>to him</hi> exigences may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, to ſerve the cauſe of liberty, and <hi>the freedom of the people.</hi>

and make this a condition, <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> of their free commerce to the Weſt-Indies, ſo eſſential to the United States.— The miniſter of the marine department will tranſmit to him a certain number of blank letters of marque, which he will deliver to ſuch French and <hi>American</hi> owners as ſhall apply for the ſame.

            <p>Now, was your taking part in the war, that your Siſter is carrying on for the good of the human race, to be the price of a treaty with her, or was it not?—The Preſident, then, not only acted conſiſtently with his duty in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding it, but conſiſtently alſo with your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, already decidedly expreſſed by your approbation of his Proclamation of neutrality.</p>
            <p>But, ſay the <hi>Patriots,</hi> we could forgive him for not treating with France, if he had not treated with Great Britain. He treated with her while he refuſed to treat with our French bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.—But, for this accuſation to have any weight with even the friends of France, it ought to be proved that the treaty negociated with Great Britain, bears ſome reſemblance, at leaſt, to the one propoſed by <hi>Citizen Genet,</hi> Can this be done? Has the Preſident ſtipulated
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028437_0107_0FD90256DE200170"/>
with Great Britain to <q>ſuſpend your commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and political intereſts in order to befriend the empire of liberty, wherever it can be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced? Has he promiſed that you ſhall contribute to the general emancipation of the New World?</q> Has Great Britain aſked you to aſſiſt her in the war? Are you to make a "common cauſe with her?" Has ſhe made your <q>guarantee of her Iſlands an eſſential clauſe in the treaty, and a <hi>ſine qua non</hi> of your free commerce with them?</q>—Where, then, is the likeneſs between the two treaties? And if there be none, by what ſort of <hi>patriotic</hi> reaſoning do they prove that the Preſident, becauſe he had refuſed to treat with France, ought not to have treated with Great Britain? This, however, appears to be the heavieſt charge againſt him. "So bold an attack," ſays your Demagogue <hi>Franklin,</hi> 
               <q>upon the palladium of our rights, deſerves a ſerious enquiry. However <hi>meritorious</hi> a motion for ſuch an enquiry might be, if ſuggeſted in the Senate, yet, it could not be conſidered in place; for enquiries of this ſort belong to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, as the Senate are the conſtitutional judges to try <hi>impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> If the grand inqueſt of the nation, the Houſe of Repreſentatives, will ſuffer ſo flagrant a breach of Conſtitution to paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed, we may conclude, that virtue and patriotiſm have abandoned our country.</q> Hence you are to conclude, then, that <hi>General Waſhington</hi> muſt be <hi>impeached,</hi> or virtue and patriotiſm have abandoned your country.</p>

               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:028437_0108_0FD901D0B6730E70"/>It is not for an Engliſhman to determine whether this be true, or not; but, if it be true, you will excuſe him for ſaying; <hi>the Lord have mercy upon your country!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only fair way for you to judge of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident's conduct relative to the treaty negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with Great Britain, and the one propoſed by France, is, to draw a compariſon between your preſent ſituation, and the ſituation in which you would have now been, had he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a different conduct. As the tree is known by its fruit, ſo are the meaſures of the ſtateſman by their effects. Look round you, and obſerve well the ſpectacle that the United States preſent at this moment. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine its reverſe, and you have an idea of what would have been your ſituation, had the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent yielded to the propoſals of <hi>Citizen Genet,</hi> or thoſe of the war party in Congreſs. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the country would have been at about one third of its preſent price, while every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported article would have riſen in a like propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The farmer muſt have ſold his wheat at four ſhillings a buſhel in place of fourteen, and in place of giving four dollars a yard for cloth, he muſt have given ten or twelve. Houſes and lands, inſtead of being riſen to tripple their former value, as they now are, would have fallen to one third of that value, and muſt, at the ſame time, have been taxed to nearly half their rent. In ſhort, you would have been in the ſame ſituation as you were in 1777, and without the ſame means of extricating your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it. However, ſuch a ſituation might,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028437_0109_0FD9025B02EDE890"/>
perhaps, be a deſirable one to you. Habit does great things. People who were revolution mad, might look back with regret to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poch juſt mentioned, and might even view with envy the effects of the French Revolution. If ſo, it is by no means too late yet; the Preſident has only to refuſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ratification of the treaty with Great Britain, and adopt the meaſures propoſed by the honeſt and <hi>incorruptible</hi> friends of the French Republic, and you may ſoon have your fill of what you deſire. If you have wiſhed to enjoy, once more, the charms of change, and taſte the ſweets of war and anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy (for I look upon them as inſeparable in this country,) then, the Preſident may merit an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment at your hands; but, if you have deſired to live in peace and plenty, while the reſt of the world has been ravaged and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to accuſe the Preſident now, is to reſemble the crew of ungrateful buccaniers, who, having ſafely arrived in port, cut the throat of their pilot.</p>

            <p>THE proceedings of the <hi>Patriots,</hi> previous to the departure of <hi>Mr. Jay,</hi> and during his abſence, throw a good deal of light on their preſent obſtinate oppoſition to the treaty. At the time of <hi>Mr. Jay's</hi> appointment as Envoy, a recent diſpute had convinced the public that he was no friend to the dragooning ſyſtem, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by <hi>Citizen Genet,</hi> and adhered to by the war, or confiſcating, party in Congreſs. The <hi>Patriots</hi> were morally certain, that a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace between Great Britain and this country would be the conſequence of his miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and, of courſe, that their golden dreams of plunder would end as dreams generally do end. Accordingly, no ſooner was his appointment made known, than the whole Union began to ring with their vociferations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Democratic Society</hi> of Pennſylvania (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laſt in the purſuit of miſchief) gave the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of malcontentedneſs. They publiſhed their <hi>reſolves</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Theſe <hi>reſolves</hi> have been re-publiſhed ſince the return of <hi>Mr. Jay.</hi> This is ſaying to the people: <hi>look here; what we foretold is now come to paſs!</hi> The democrats knew what <hi>Mr. Jay</hi> ought to do, it was not, therefore, very difficult for them to foretell what he would do, and to condemn it beforehand; nevertheleſs they now hold up their predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as a proof of their ſagacity. I muſt confeſs, they are a ſort of wizzards, and I only lament that they had not lived in New England about 130 years ago.</p>
                  <p>This re-publication was ſigned by one <hi>Iſrael Iſrael;</hi> Rabin of the democratic tribe of Pennſylvania. Can this be the ſame <hi>Iſrael Iſrael,</hi> who was put in durance for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving publicly declared his wiſh, that not one of thoſe who marched againſt the Weſtern Rebels would return alive? If he ſhould be the ſame, I think, his wiſh on that occaſion may ſerve as an excellent comment on the reſolves.</p>
               </note> againſt the appointment, and were ſoon followed by all thoſe ſelf-created clubs,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028437_0111_0FD90262F5D22ED8"/>
which, in the <hi>patriotic</hi> cant of the day, they term their "Siſter Societies." It is unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſay what were the ſentiments contained in theſe reſolves; as is the ſource, ſo is the ſtream. One circumſtance ought not, however, to paſs unnoticed: joining France in the preſent war appeared to be the leading object of every one of the ſocieties. Then ſentiments, and even expreſſions, on this ſubject bear ſuch a perfect reſemblance, that it is almoſt impoſſible they ſhould not have been preſcribed by ſome agent of <q>that regenerated, rich, great, generous, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, happy, valiant and victorious republic.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The following extract, from the reſolves of the <hi>democratic ſociety,</hi> met at <hi>Wythe Court Houſe,</hi> in Virginia, will ſerve as a ſpecimen. <q>Shall we Americans, who have kindled the ſpark of liberty, ſtand aloof and ſee it extinguiſhed, when burning a bright flame in France, which hath caught it from us! If a deſpot prevails, we muſt have a deſpot like the reſt of the nations.
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:028437_0112_0FD90264B8229330"/>
If all tyrants unite againſt free people, ſhould not all free people unite againſt tyrants? Yes, let us unite with France, and ſtand or fall together.</q> This is the ſociety, who, after a great deal of abuſive language againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, propoſe to the people of the United States, <q>ſo to amend the Conſtitution as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capaciate any man to ſerve as Preſident for more than eight years ſucceſſively.</q> It was well known that the Preſident had ſerved ſix years, at that time.</p>
            <p>Nor were the <hi>Patriots</hi> idle during the abſence of the Envoy. Every piece of news, that could be picked up concerning his conduct at the Court of St. James's, was made the means of ſarcaſm, and conjured into prognoſtics of his making a diſhonourable treaty. Even the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of his introduction at Court could not eſcape the malicious obſervatlons of the <hi>patriotic</hi> crew. His kiſſing the Queen's hand was term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <q>proſtrating at the feet of Majeſty the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of a great people,</q> and for which it was affirmed he deſerved to have "his lips bliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the bone." Had I been in <hi>Mr Jay's</hi> place, perhaps I ſhould have preferred the hand of one of the Queen's daughters; but his taſte was, at any rate, as good as that of the <hi>Patriot's;</hi> for, who would not rather kiſs the ſhrivelled hand of the Queen of England than the monſtrous beef-ſtake lips of an African <hi>Patriot,</hi>

            <p>From men in this dispoſition of mind, it was to be expected that any arrangement, tending to prevent a rupture with Great Britain, would
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028437_0113_0FD902685A3DFCB0"/>
meet a clamorous oppoſition; but few people, I believe, thought that the firſt attack would come from a member of the Senate. Nobody imagined, that any member of that venerable body would have ſo far loſt ſight of his country's intereſt, of its peace, as to divulge the terms of an unratified treaty, and even become inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in its promulgation, not only without the permiſſion, but againſt the wiſh and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Preſident and the majority of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. <hi>Mr. Maſon's</hi> motives were but too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. He might have ſaid to himſelf (with the hypocritical <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> after he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged to the plebians the Will of Caeſar); <q>Now let it work. Mischief thou art a foot, take thou what courſe thou wilt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The effects of this legiſlative tattling were not long in diſcovering themſelves. The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was publiſhed at Philadelphia on the 2d. of July, prefaced by a letter from <hi>Mr. Maſon,</hi> authorizing the printer to make what uſe of it he thought proper. On the fourth of July the moſt ſcandalous ſcene was exhibited, in this capital of the Union, that ever diſgraced a civilized country. To avoid a charge of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation here, I ſhall give an account of it in the <hi>Patriots'</hi> own words, as publiſhed in their gazette, the <hi>Aurora,</hi> of the 9th July.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The day (the 4th. of July,) was cloſed by the exhibition of a tranſparent painting with the figure of <hi>John Jay</hi> upon it. The figure was in full ſtatue, holding in his right hand a pair of ſcales, containing in one ſcale, <hi>American liberty and Independence,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:028437_0114_0FD90269DFC10B28"/>
kicking the beam; in the other, <hi>Britiſh Gold,</hi> in extreme preponderance. In his left hand a Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, which he extended to a group of Senators, who were grinning with pleaſure and graſping at the Treaty. From the mouth of the figure iſſued theſe words, <hi>come up to my price, and I will ſell you my country.</hi> The figure was burned at Kenſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton amid the acclamations of hundreds of <hi>citizens.</hi> Thus ended the proceſſion, and thus terminated the anniverſary of American Independence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was a good ſetting out. Meanwhile the Treaty got ſpread about, and a ſyſtematical op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to it was determined on. The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance was drawn up at Boſton, and in ſuch haſte were the <hi>citizens</hi> of that town to get the ſtart of thoſe of other places, that the firſt copy of the treaty had not been arrived in town twenty four hours, before a town meeting was convened to condemn it. At this meeting a motion was made to read the treaty, at leaſt, before they remonſtrated againſt it; but this motion was not even ſeconded.</p>
            <p>The <hi>citizens</hi> of New York were not much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their <hi>brethren</hi> of Boſton in point of time, and in other reſpects very far outſtripped them. A town meeting being called to take the treaty into conſideration, a great number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of all deſcriptions attended. A chairman being named, a propoſition was made for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing to ſome more convenient place for a fair and full diſcuſſion of the treaty, but this
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028437_0115_0FD9026B9A745E90"/>
was oppoſed with much clamour by many of the <hi>citizens.</hi> There appeared, however, to be a majority in favour of a fair diſcuſſion, but thoſe who were againſt it were the moſt noiſy; interruption, diſorder and confuſion enſued. <q>In the courſe of the affair three ſtones were thrown at Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who was for a fair diſcuſſion, the ſecond of which glanced his forehead, one of the others ſtruck a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtanding by him. From the beginning ſtandards were diſplayed bearing the colours of the United States and France. A party of thoſe who had oppoſed a fair diſcuſſion went off to the battery, bearing a ſtandard with French and American colours, where they burnt the treaty, and then returned with an acceſſion of numbers.</q> Now, will any one in his ſenſes believe, that this rabble, or, at leaſt their ringleaders, were not hired to oppoſe the government on this occaſion? What did the French flag do at this meeting? What had the French Sailors at New York, to do with a treaty between this country and Great Britain? <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>On the third of July the following card appeared in the Gazette, called the <hi>Argus,</hi> of New York.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The good Frenchmen, who are at New York, having <hi>taken cognizance</hi> of the treaty paſſed with the Engliſh, beg the Americans of this city to take away the tricolored flag from the Coffee Houſe, finding it, in this circumſtance, diſplaced.</q>
                  </p>
               </note> Humiliating ſcene!</p>
            <p>There was certainly a very great majority of the merchants, traders, and people of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of New York in favour of the treaty and yet brick-back eloquence has prevailed, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance has been ſent off to the Preſident.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:028437_0116_0FD9026D1B9D4E30"/>Philadelphia was the next ſcene of action. A vaſt concourſe of <hi>Citizens</hi> of the right true blue ſtamp aſſembled nearly in the ſame manner, and for the ſame purpoſe, as the <hi>citizens</hi> of New York. It would be uſeleſs to deſcribe the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid ſtare, the dirty ſhirts, and long beards, of theſe ſovereigns, or the <hi>patriotic</hi> ſtrut an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary conſequence of their chairman and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee men. I ſhall notice only a circumſtance or two, which, though trifling in themſelves, characterize the meeting better, perhaps, than the moſt minute account of their proceedings and principles could do.</p>
            <p>The important buſineſs being ended, a <hi>citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> made a motion, that the welcome of the meeting ſhould be given to a firm friend of the <hi>Rights of man,</hi> juſt arrived from Ireland (laſt from France), <hi>Citizen Archibald Hamilton Rowan.</hi> The name of <hi>Rowan</hi> was hardly out of his mouth, when the whole aſſembly burſt out into an acclamation, ſuch as is heard from the ſummit of mount Rhodope, when the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken God retires to his pleaſures; or (to make uſe of an apter compariſon) ſuch as reſounds through the infernal regions, when Satan an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces the arrival of one doubly damned. Silence being at laſt reſtored, the ſame <hi>citizen,</hi> holding up a little pamphlet containing one of <hi>Mr. Maſon's</hi> treaties, exclaimed, <q>what a damned treaty!</q> After a ſhort pauſe, he continued; <q>I make a motion, that every good citizen in this aſſembly kick this damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed treaty to Hell.</q> He muſt have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that his good <hi>fellow citizens</hi> know the way
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028437_0117_0FD9027170A34370"/>
to Hell; and to tell the truth, ſome of them had much more the appearance of furies than of ſober honeſt men.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of the meeting being cloſed by this <hi>patriotic</hi> exhortation, ſome of the lukewarm <hi>citizens</hi> retired home, while others of a more determined character paid the Houſe of <hi>Mr. Bingham</hi> a viſit. It was thought by ſome, that violence was their intention; but they were ſo moderate as to be contented with inſult and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecration. Mr. <hi>Bingham</hi> has, without diſpute, the fineſt houſe in the city, and he is ſaid to be, beſides, one of the wealthieſt as well as worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt men in the country; it muſt, therefore, be confeſſed, that he was, on every account, a proper object of attack.</p>
            <p>Such are the oppoſers of the treaty, ſuch the <hi>ſovereign people,</hi> who are now tormenting the Preſident with their remonſtrances, which ſome of them have the inſolence to call, <q>inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their <hi>public ſervant,</hi>
               </q> and who will ere long, unleſs their power be contracted, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over the peaceable inhabitants of theſe States. When once the lower orders of the people, thoſe who have nothing, begin to give law to thoſe who have ſomething, a ſtate of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is at no great diſtance. This dreadful ſcourge now menaces the United States, and the only way of avoiding it is for every honeſt man, every man of property, to give his hearty and ſincere ſupport to the General Government.</p>

                  <head>Extract of a letter from Thomas Pinckney, Miniſter Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary, to the Secretary of State, dated London, 16th November, 1793.</head>
                  <p>Mr. Jay communicated freely with me on this ſubject during the courſe of the negociation, and I have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the great difficulties which have occurred in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſting ſeveral of the articles. Although ſome points might have been arranged more beneficially for us if the treaty had been dictated entirely by the United States, yet when it is conſidered as a compoſition of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, where mutual complaints had rendered mutual conceſſions neceſſary to eſtabliſh a good underſtanding, I think it may fairly be ſaid, that as little has been conced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. Jay, and as much obtained for the United States as, all circumſtances conſidered, could be expected: the buſineſs upon the whole, has been concluded more beneficially for us than I had any hope we could obtain by negociation ſix months ago, and, in my opinion; places us in a more advantageous ſituation than we ſhould have been by becoming parties to the war.</p>
