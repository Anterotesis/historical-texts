            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is good for every Man to fortify himſelf on his weak ſide: and if he loves his Peace, he muſt not be Inquiſitive, and hearken to <hi>Tale-bearers;</hi> for the Man that is over-curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to hear, and ſee every thing, multiplies Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to himſelf: For a Man does not feel, what he does not know. He that is liſtening after <hi>private Diſcourſe,</hi> and what People <hi>ſay of him,</hi> ſhall never be at Peace. How many things that are Innocent in themſelves, are made Injurious yet, by miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? Wherefore ſome things we are to pauſe upon, others to laugh at, and others again to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Or if we cannot avoid the Senſe of Indignities, let us however ſhun the open profeſſion of it; which may be eaſily done as appears by many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of thoſe, that have ſuppreſs'd their Anger, under the Awe of a greater Fear. It is a good Caution <hi>not to believe any thing till we are very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it,</hi> for many probable things prove falſe, and a ſhort time will make Evidence of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Truth. We are prone to believe many Things which we are unwilling to hear, and ſo we

Admit no Stories upon theſe terms; for it is an unjuſt thing to <hi>Believe</hi> in private, and to be <hi>Angry</hi> openly. He that delivers himſelf up to Gueſs, and Conjecture, runs a great hazard; for there can be no Suſpicion without ſome probable Grounds; ſo that without much Candor, and Simplicity, and making the beſt of every thing, there is no living in Society with Mankind. Some things that offend us we have by report; others we ſee, or hear. In the firſt Caſe, let us not be too Credulous; ſome People <hi>frame Stories that they may deceive us:</hi> Others, only tell what they hear, and are deceiv'd Themſelves.

Let us therefore truſt to nothing, but what we ſee: And chide our ſelves where we are over Credulous. By this Courſe we ſhall not be ſo eaſily impos'd upon; nor put to trouble ourſelves about things not worth the while; as the Loytring of a Servant upon an Erand, the Tumbling of a Bed; or the Spilling of a Glaſs of Drink. 'Tis a Madneſs to be diſorder'd at theſe Fooleries. We conſider the thing done, and not the Doer of it. <hi>It may be he did it Unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly; or by Chance.

A Generous Priſoner cannot immediately comply with all the ſordid, and Laborious Offices of a Slave. A Footman that is not breath'd, cannot keep pace with his Maſter's Horſe: He that is over-watch'd, may be allow'd to be Drowzy. All theſe things are to be weigh'd before we give any Ear to the firſt Impulſe. If it be my Duty to love my Country, I muſt be kind alſo to my Countrymen: If a Veneration be due to the Whole ſo is a Piety alſo to the Parts: And it is the Common Intereſt to preſerve them. We are all Members of one Body, and it is as Natural to help one another, as for the hands to help the feet, or the eyes the hands. Without the Love, and Care of the Parts, the whole can never be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and we muſt ſpare one another, becauſe we are born for Society, which cannot be maintain'd, without a Regard to Particulars. Let this be a Rule to us, never to deny a Pardon that does no Hurt either to the Giver, or Receiver. That may be well enough in <hi>One,</hi> which is Ill in <hi>Another;</hi> and therefore we are not to condemn any thing that is Common to a Nation: for Cuſtom defends it. But
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007317_0013_102B57685416C2E0"/>much more Pardonable are thoſe things which are Common to Mankind.</p>
            <p>IT is a kind of Spiteful Comfort, that whoever does me an Injury, may receive one, and that there is a Power over him that is above me. A Man ſhould ſtand as firm againſt all Indignities, as a Rock does againſt the Waves. As it is ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to a Man in a Mean Condition, that there is no Security in a more proſperous; And as the Loſs of a Son in a Corner is born with more Patience, upon the ſight of a Funeral carry'd out of a Palace; So are Injuries, and Contempts, the more tolerable from a meaner Perſon, when we conſider, that the <hi>Greateſt Men,</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> are not exempt. The wiſeſt alſo of Mortals, have their failings, and no Man living is without the ſame Excuſe. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, that we do not all of us tranſgreſs the ſame way: but we are oblig'd in Humanity <hi>to bear one with another.</hi> We ſhould, every one of us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think ourſelves how remiſs we have been in our Duties: How immodeſt in our Diſcourſes; how Intemperate in our Cups; and why not as well how Extravagant we have been in our Paſſions. Let us clear our ſelves of this Evil, purge our minds, and utterly root out all thoſe Vices, which, upon leaving the leaſt ſtring will grow again, and recover. We muſt Think of every thing, Expect every thing that we may not be Surpriz'd. It is a Shame, ſays <hi>Fabius,</hi> for a Commander to excuſe himſelf, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I was not aware of it.</hi>

               <hi>Of</hi> ANGER.</head>
            <p>—The general Cauſe of Anger, is the Senſe, or Opinion of an <hi>Injury;</hi> that is the Opinion either of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007317_0014_102B576A8091D7F0"/>an Injury ſimply <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of an Injury done which we have not deſerv'd. Some are Naturally given to Anger; Others are provok'd to't by Occaſion; The Anger of Women, and Children, is commonly ſharp, but not laſting: Old Men are rather queru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and peeviſh. Hard Labour, Diſeaſes, Anxiety of Thought, and whatſoever hurts the Body, or the Mind, diſpoſes a Man to be Froward, but we muſt not add fire to fire.</p>
            <p>HE that duly conſiders the ſubject Matter of all our Controverſies, and Quarrels, will find them Low, and Mean, and not worth the Thought of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Mind; but the greateſt Noiſe of all is about <hi>Money.</hi> This is it, that ſets Fathers and Children together by the Ears; Huſbands and Wives; and makes way for Sword and Poiſon: This is that, tires out Courts of Juſtice; enrages Princes, and lays Cities in the Duſt, to ſeek for Gold, and Silver in the Ruins of them. This is it, that finds work for the Judge, to determine, which ſide is leaſt in the wrong; And whoſe is the more plauſible Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, the Plantiffs, or the Defendants: And what is it that we contend for all this while, but thoſe Baubles that make us Cry, when we ſhould Laugh? To ſee a Rich old Cuff, that has no Body to leave his Eſtate to, break his Heart for a handful of Dirt; And a Gouty Uſurer, that has no other Uſe of his Fingers left him, but to Count withal; to ſee him I ſay, in the Extremity of his Fit, wrangling for the odd Money in his Intereſt:—If all that's precious in Nature were gather'd into one Maſs, it were not worth the trouble of a Sober Mind. It were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to run over all thoſe ridiculous Paſſions that are mov'd about Meats, and Drinks, and the matter of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007317_0015_102B576D474878B0"/>our Luxury; Nay, about Words, Looks, Actions, Jealouſies, Miſtakes, which are all of them as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Fooleries as thoſe very Baubles that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Scratch, and Cry for. There is nothing Great, or Serious in all that which we keep ſuch a Clutter about; the Madneſs of it is, that we ſet too great a value upon Trifles. One Man flies out upon a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, a Letter, a Speech, a Queſtion, a Geſture, a Wink, a Look. An Action moves one Man; A Word affects another: One Man is tender of his Family; another of his Perſon; One ſets up for an Orator; Another for a Philoſopher; This Man <hi>will</hi> not bear Pride, nor that Man Oppoſition. He that <hi>plays</hi> the Tyrant at Home, is as <hi>gentle</hi> as a Lamb Abroad. Some take Offence if a Man aſk a Favour of them, and others, if he does not. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man has his weak ſide; Let us <hi>learn</hi> which that is and take a care of it; for the ſame thing does not work upon <hi>all Men alike.</hi> We are moved <hi>like Beaſts,</hi> at the <hi>Idle appearances</hi> of things; and the fiercer the Creature, the more is it <hi>ſtartled.</hi> The ſight of a <hi>Red Cloth</hi> enrages a <hi>Bull.</hi> A Shadow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the Aſp; Nay, ſo <hi>unreaſonable</hi> are ſome Men, that they take Moderate Benefits for Injuries; and <hi>Squabble</hi> about it, with their neareſt <hi>Relations; They have done this and that for others,</hi> they cry; And <hi>they might have dealt better with us if they had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Very Good! And if it be leſs than we look'd for, it may be yet more than we deſerve. Of <hi>all</hi> Unquiet humours, this is the worſt, that <hi>will</hi> never ſuffer any Man to be happy, ſo long as he ſees a happier Man than himſelf.</p>
            <p>HOW Vain, and <hi>Idle</hi> are many of thoſe things that make us ſtark Mad! A reſty Horſe, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007317_0016_102B576FC50DB380"/>of a Glaſs; the <hi>falling</hi> of a Key, the Drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of a Chair, a <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> a <hi>Miſconſtruction.</hi> How <hi>ſhall</hi> that Man endure the <hi>Extremities</hi> of Hunger, and Thirſt, that flies out into a rage <hi>only</hi> for the putting of a <hi>little</hi> too much Water in his Wine? What haſte is there to <hi>lay</hi> a Servant by the <hi>Heels,</hi> or break a Leg or an Arm <hi>immediately</hi> for't, as if he were not to have the ſame power over him an hour after, that he has at that Inſtant.</p>
            <p>When we are abroad we can bear <hi>well enough</hi> with <hi>foul</hi> ways, naſty Streets, noiſom Ditches; but a ſpot upon a Diſh at home, or an unſwept Hearth, <hi>abſolutely diſtracts us.</hi> And what's the Reaſon, but that we are Patient in the one <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> Peeviſh in the other? Nothing makes us more Intemperate than Luxury, that ſhrinks at every ſtroke, and ſtarts at every ſhadow. 'Tis Death to ſome to have another ſit <hi>above</hi> them, as if a Body were <hi>ever</hi> the more, or <hi>the leſs honeſt for the Cuſhion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>HOW ridiculous was that of</hi> Cyrus; <hi>who, in his deſign upon</hi> Babylon, <hi>found a River in his way that put a ſtop to his March: The current was ſtrong, and carried away one of the Horſes that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his own Chariot: upon this he ſwore, that ſince it had obſtructed his Paſſage, it ſhould never hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Body's elſe: And preſently ſet his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to work upon't, which diverted it into a hundred and fourſcore Channels, and laid it dry. In this Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, and unprofitable employment, he loſt his Time, and the Soldiers their Courage, and gave his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries an opportunity of providing themſelves, while he was waging War with a River, inſtead of an Enemy.</hi>
