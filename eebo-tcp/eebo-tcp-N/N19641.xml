            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>For what nation is there ſo great, who hath <hi>GOD</hi> ſo nigh unto them, as the <hi>LORD</hi> cur <hi>GOD</hi> is in all things that we call upon him for?

Only take heed to thyſelf, and keep thy ſoul diligently, leſt thou forget the things which thine eyes have ſeen, and leſt they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but teach them thy ſons, and thy ſons' ſons.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>MY Chriſtian Brethren, we are now aſſembled into the Divine Preſence, on one of thoſe anniverſary days, in which every grateful heart muſt feel highly intereſted, and in which every ſoul is moſt devoutly called to expreſs a ſenſe of his dependence on Divine Providence, and thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to the FATHER of the univerſe. The duty which we are now ſolemniſing, is moſt highly becoming a Chriſtian people, and is of that kind which conſtitutes the ſublimeſt part of worſhip, which intelligences can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their CREATOR. In our uſual addreſſes of the throne of grace we are looking for benefits; and the end of petition centres on ſelf. In adoration, which is the moſt <hi>diſintereſted</hi> as well as moſt <hi>delightful</hi> of human duties, the mind is drawn forth from itſelf, by the view of Supreme Excellence; and the DEITY <hi>alone</hi> abſorbs every attention.</p>
            <p>Had man never ſinned, there had been no bleeding vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, nor need of an Interceſſor. And in the future ſtate, when perfect holineſs ſhall be reſtored, <hi>prayer</hi> ſhall ceaſe, <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> will ceaſe; but <hi>adoration, praiſe, charity</hi> and <hi>love</hi> ſhall exiſt forever.</p>
            <p>When the duty of praiſing GOD is rightly performed, there ever accompanies it a <hi>lively diſpeſition</hi> of mind. The heart is ſoothed and elevated, a divine pleaſure <hi>expands</hi> the ſoul, and, being <hi>irradiated</hi> by the ſplendor of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good,</hi> is <hi>abſorbed</hi> in GOD, and raiſed above <hi>all</hi> world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares, allurements and amuſements, to a <hi>peace and joy which the world cannot give or take away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:025638_0005_0FCEAD331634D080"/>
The human mind, its principles, habits, modes of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conduct will ever be greatly affected by the objects of its moſt frequent contemplation. This originates the different manners of the prince and the peaſant But <hi>where</hi> is an object ſo calculated to enlarge and aggrandize the ſoul, and all its powers, and to lift it above all low and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did motives, as the Divine Being when adored by us, in that amiable view in which the whole biblical volume pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents HIM. But while the mind is elevated with joy raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the act of praiſe above worldly concerns, and greatly enlarged by contemplating upon a Being ſo filled with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it is alſo humbled as to the duſt by the unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble view of its own inſignificance. <hi>The heavens are not clean in his ſight, and the angels He chargeth with folly; what then is man!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such being the advantages of that religious ſervice, which we are this day to offer to the Great Benefactor of the world, let us enter upon it with <hi>all</hi> thoſe <hi>devout</hi> and <hi>enlarged</hi> principles, which the <hi>high objects</hi> of gratitude now demand.</p>
            <p>To inſpire us with theſe elevated ſentiments, few porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſacred ſcriptures are better adapted than the text which I have read to you. In this you ſee the <hi>holy prophet,</hi> in whom the legiſlator and the father of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are moſt admirably united, and beautifully illuſtrated, leading the choſen tribes to realize, that the favor of GOD and the ſmiles of heaven, are not only the greateſt bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but the higheſt aggrandiſement of any nation. At the cloſe of a life filled with the moſt unremitting labors, diſintereſted exertions, and unceaſing vigilance and prayer for their proſperity, he had now been recounting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Divine goodneſs, which they had experienced, that by impreſſing their minds with the beneficence of GOD, he might perſuade them to feel the greatneſs of their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and "<hi>not ſuffer them to depart from their hearts all the days of their lives, but</hi> to <hi>teach them</hi> to <hi>their ſons, and their ſons' ſons.</hi>"</p>
            <p>"<hi>For what nation is there ſo great, who hath</hi> GOD <hi>ſo nigh unto them, as the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD <hi>is, in all things that we call upon him for!</hi>"—We are peculiarly happy in having an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired prophet to aſſure us, <hi>in the name of</hi> GOD, of what the hiſtory of ages and the experience of the world have united to convince us, that no people is ſo truly great, as that which hath the LORD their GOD <hi>nigh unto them.</hi> In this reſpect the nation of Iſrael appeared highly illuſtrious. Their GOD, in whom they truſted, going before them in a pillar of cloud by day and of ſire by night, and <hi>being a very preſent help in time of trouble.</hi> To all their greatneſs were they raiſed by the hand of GOD. Divine Sovereignty, whoſe <hi>power</hi> is ever connected with <hi>benevelence,</hi> beheld a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025638_0006_0FCEAD34C8E5B9A8"/>people whom HE <hi>loved,</hi> clanking the chains of ſlavery under Egypt's lords; HE <hi>beheld the oppreſſor and the oppreſſed;</hi> HE <hi>ſaw the tears of the oppreſſed, and there was none to comfort them; and on the ſide of the oppreſſor there was power, but they had no comforter:</hi> HE ſaw this, with that <hi>frown</hi> of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which commands empires to their original <hi>nothingneſs,</hi> and raiſed the Son of Amram to emancipate Iſrael from ſlavery, and to lead them to a land of liberty, to the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their enemies, and the deſtruction of their tyrants. The father of that people was choſen by Heaven, on account of his faith and piety, to be one, in whom not only his children, but all the families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed: bleſſed with a Prince to ariſe and ſway the ſceptre of righteouſneſs, and to erect, on the ruins of all unjuſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, a kingdom of the moſt perfect government, of the wiſeſt laws, and filled with the moſt virtuous and happy ſubjects, enjoying peace, liberty and bliſs. To what <hi>high proſperity</hi> was that nation afterwards raiſed, <hi>entirely</hi> by the <hi>ſovereign</hi> favor of HEAVEN! In an age of great darkneſs. when the governments of the world were ſyſtems of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and their ſubjects educated to believe that they were born to be ſlaves to the will of tyrants, this people were illuminated in the knowledge of the principles of the <hi>nobleſt</hi> truths; <hi>truths</hi> to which the ſuperior improvements of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times bear the moſt honorable teſtimony, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they are incapable of greater perfection, and that truly there was the finger of GOD. While other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ruled by oppreſſors, <hi>neither fearing</hi> GOD <hi>nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding man, they</hi> were bleſſed with one, whoſe ruling prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was the moſt diſintereſted love to his people, as was moſt amply evinced in that moſt benevolent prayer of his, that they might be ſaved, to which he added, "<hi>if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of the book which</hi> THOU <hi>haſt written.</hi>" In him we behold a prophet, a legiſlator, and the father of his people, united to which we might add one who could ſay. "I fear my GOD and HIM alone." By him deſignated and raiſed up for that people, they were bleſſed with ſuch a ſyſtem of religious and civil polity, blended with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—a ſyſtem ſo calculated to anſwer many grand and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſigns in Divine providence; a ſyſtem ſo calculated to produce patriotiſm, mutual love and the cloſeſt political union, as witneſs their laws for triennial aſſemblies, thoſe for the prevention of perpetual ſlavery, thoſe for the relief of every ſpecies of diſtreſs, that, to this day, Moſes is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable as a legiſlator; but in former days, their laws, their government, and their enlightened policy were the admiration and envy of the world.</p>
            <p>Thus were they aggrandiſed by the goodneſs of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sovereign. <hi>By this alone;</hi> for in the hiſtory of ſix thouſand years, not a ſingle inſtance, deſerving a parrallel,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025638_0007_0FCEAD35FAEB8AB8"/>is to be found, in which a nation has ariſen from obſcurity, ſlavery, wretchedneſs, or the ignorance attending deſpotick governments, to be bleſſed with a ſyſtem of religious and civil polity, inducing liberty and happineſs, <hi>unleſs favored by a Divine revelation,</hi> or <hi>the immediate hand of</hi> HEAVEN. As Iſrael roſe to liberty and glory by the ſovereign goodneſs of GOD, as their ſafety and proſperity depended entirely on having <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>their</hi> GOD <hi>near unto them in all that they called upon</hi> HIM for, how ſoon did they ſink into infamy and contempt, when, becauſe of their high and long repeated ingratitude, they were rejected of their Divine Protector.</p>
            <p>To apply theſe remarks to our own nation—To what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry have <hi>we</hi> riſen <hi>by the ſmiles of</hi> HEAVEN? To what elſe can we impute that luſtre, independence and glory, which have rendered us the admiration of aſtoniſhed Europe? Many have been the times, in which we have been reduced to ſay, <hi>We can only ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of our</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>Few of us but may recollect thoſe ſeaſons of national diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, in which our tribes mournfully repaired to the houſe of the LORD, <hi>feelingly</hi> impreſſed with the belief, that if we were <hi>ever</hi> ſaved, it muſt be by the ROCK that is higher than man. Then we fully believed the infinitely intereſting truths, which we are now contemplating: then we needed no prophet to inculcate them, as the immediate meſſage of GOD. We were ready to receive them. And when the GREAT SOVEREIGN, who diſpoſeth of empires according to His will, looked down from the throne of his Glory on our diſtreſs, we gladly reaſſumed "the harp that had been hanging on the willows," and unitedly acknowledged, <hi>Had not the</hi> LORD <hi>been on our ſide, when our enemies roſe up againſt us, the waters had overwhelmed us, the ſtream had gone over our ſouls.</hi> How important is it that theſe ſentiments be indelibly impreſſed upon our minds, and that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, with an eaſtern prince, "Thou Moſt High, rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth." Never was there a people more truly origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and protected by Divine Providence than this; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was the hand of GOD more evidently and ſignally lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up on behalf of any people, in a ſeaſon of the moſt trying emergency, than we ourſelves have ſeen. How ſignal the bleſſing of a temporal ſavior, deſignated by Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the day of our diſtreſs, moſt inimitably qualified with abilities and patriotiſm for the arduous work of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing empire to the nation; a character ſo renowned among the nations for great and different talents, ſo happily blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and concentrating in the ſame mind, that the ſons of Iſrael had not more real cauſe to believe that their deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, from the houſe of bondage, was ſent to them by the 'I AM,' who appeared on the mount, than we have, to be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ours was purpoſely raiſed by HEAVEN, for the day
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025638_0008_0FCEAD384EE42240"/>when his country called for his important ſervices. If we conſider that ſyſtem of government under which we live, and that happineſs which it has diffuſed thro all ranks; if we recollect that this land is become known thro' the world, a land of liberty, political, civil and religious, where all thoſe vain diſtinctions, on which numbers have thought themſelves entitled to almoſt every homage, and ſecured from the juſt conſequences of their crimes and guilt, are here not to be found; a land where obſcurity of birth or fortune does not prevent the honors due to real merit; a land where the Jew and the Greek have equal reception, and where liberal ſentiments, on the rights of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have ſo far prevailed, that there have been the moſt noble exertions, that the prophecy of Noah, concerning a very unhappy branch of his family, which for ages has been moſt aſtoniſhingly verified, might come to a concluſion, and hereafter the deſendants of Shem and Ham and Japhet might ſtand on a level, and acknowledge each other as brethren. <hi>What nation is there ſo great, who hath</hi> GOD <hi>ſo nigh unto them, as the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD <hi>is, in all things that we call upon Him for? and what nation is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and judgments ſo righteous</hi> as has been given to this favored land? But upon a day like this, it becomes us more particularly to enumerate the inſtances of that real great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to which this nation has been raiſed by the ſmiles of HEAVEN. If any degree of it conſiſts in the too cuſtomary, but now exploded, method of meaſuring the greatneſs of a kingdom by the extent of territory, we might boaſt of greater glory than ſome of the moſt famous and potent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have figured in the page of hiſtory. But Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, Greece and other ſtates have become renowned, not by extenſive territory, but by their noble and liberal policy, their wiſe laws, their general liberty, their high patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, and the great encouragement to every thing which might conduce to heighten, aggrandize and bleſs the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of government. Let us then endeavour to find that real greatneſs to which we have been raiſed, in thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in which we have juſtly become the admiration of the world. And here we might obſerve, that it is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which, from the earlieſt ſettlement of it, there have exiſted the moſt noble and valuable inſtitutions, ſacred and civil, which have been tranſmitted from the fathers to the children, and have been preſerved hitherto to deſcend to riſing generations. However true it may be, that the firſt inhabitants of this country, may have imbibed and poſſeſſed many prejudices peculiar to thoſe days, and to which ſcarce any people have been known to riſe wholly ſuperior, ſtill we muſt venerate them for their pious regard to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and for their noble inſtitutions, ſacred and civil, the benefit of which we now enjoy, and by which we have ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025638_0009_0FCEAD39BB0D4388"/>to a moſt eminent diſtinction, and enviable glory to the ſurrounding world.</p>
            <p>We may next obſerve, that it is a nation in which the government is truly repreſentative. This can be ſaid of no one ſo truly, as of that in which we live. In the ſyſtem of the Jewiſh legiſlator, the high civil and ſacred offices, tho' for Divine reaſons, were limited to a tribe or a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There is an European nation, to which we were once moſt nearly allied, that boaſts of a repreſentative govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but where the firſt legiſlative offices are compleatly hereditary, and in the others but a very inconſiderable proportion of the people are repreſented. If we ſurvey the European ſtates, called republican, they are far from being ſtrictly repreſentative. Privileged orders are found in every civilized country of Europe, poſſeſſing powers incompatible with a juſt repreſentation. This favored people only, to whom <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD <hi>has been nigh in all that they have called upon Him for,</hi> has been choſen by HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEN, to realize the fullneſs of a bleſſing reſulting from this circumſtance of civil government. Here any one poſſeſſed of property ſufficient to make him feel himſelf intereſted in the proſperity of the nation, and ſmall indeed is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, has a voice in the election to the firſt offices of ſtate. This is a circumſtance that conſtitutes no little part of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> greatneſs to which we have been raiſed.</p>
            <p>We may next obſerve, that this people have had the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular felicity of living under a government, in which there has been a very high enjoyment of all the rights of nature. Nature gives no one a right to oppreſs his fellow creatures, nor to hold in ſervitude his body or mind, his faith or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Accordingly no one is here permitted to aſſume ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary diſtinctions, and unjuſt ſuperiority; none poſſeſſes ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or religious powers, but what are voluntarily conferred; and the Savior's command, to call no man Rabbi or Father, ſeems to have been received, and in a great meaſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. Thoſe high founding titles, many of which ſhould be appropriate to JEHOVAH alone, under which villainy was ſheltered from juſtice, made ſacred and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by deluded ignorance, and by which, for too many ages, the <hi>greateſt ſcourges</hi> of the human race have, in the <hi>name of</hi> GOD, carried on the moſt ambitious and tyrannick deſigns, both in political and religious matters, and by which they have made nations, kept by their policy in the moſt conſummate ignorance, tamely to ſubmit to the moſt cruel impoſitions, ſanctified by the name of a BEING whom they juſtly adored, are in this nation not to be found. This people by means of the valuable inſtitutions tranſmitted to us from the rathers, for promoting uſeful knowledge, have become too enlightened for the impoſitions of any, who ſhould come to us like the prophet of Mecca, with the ſword in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025638_0010_0FCEAD3B488BF918"/>one hand and the Koran in his other. The rights of nature have at length found an aſſylum in this favored land. Here we make the laws by which we chooſe to be bound, and profeſs and peaceably practiſe that mode of religion, by which we are inclined to worſhip the GOD of our fathers.</p>
            <p>We may next obſerve, that we live under a government, in which every kind of uſeful induſtry is moſt liberally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. Separate from the incitement ariſing from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral legiſlative acts, there have numerous ſocieties origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the patriotiſm and publick ſpirit of influential perſons, which have excited general emulation for excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and perfection, in the various arts of uſeful induſtry. Induſtry has ever been found ſucceſsful in raiſing ſtates and empires, even of the moſt unpromiſing beginning, to ranks of the firſt eminence. An induſtrious people will ever be a flouriſhing and happy people. Under deſpotick govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there is but little encouragement for the uſeful arts; in republics they have ever found the higheſt patrouage, and the greateſt perfection. In a nation as this, where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry <hi>finds</hi> the moſt flattering wiſhes of individuals emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of improvement ſo fully gratified; where our labors are not only rewarded by the honors of the great, but where they are ſecured in the profits ariſing from them, without the danger of their being ſubjected to the never ceaſing demands of tyranny, what a proſpect of riſing greatneſs preſents itſelf to every view. Whoever labors in this country enjoys the good of his labor; and is ſecured in his poſſeſſions, while his children ariſe and are benefited by the induſtry of a parent. And this, you will eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is a much greater bleſſing, than if it were poſſible that every want of the individual were ſupplied by the publick. Neceſſity brings action, and action is the life and beauty of the world. If the Almighty were to ſupply us with the gratification of every deſire without our labor and exertion, what would the world be, but a ſcene of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and in inactivity. More than half the beauty of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be loſt. It is an happy law of nature therefore, that bleſsings are offered to our acquiſition, not to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert reception. And the neceſſity of this labor originates all thoſe arts and improvements, which adorn ſociety, and call forth that beautiful variety of talents, which would otherwiſe lie concealed from human views. It is kind in Providence, that we ſhould be obliged to labour, and it is the happy privilege of this nation, that induſtry receives every encouragement. It is a greater act of charity in the publick, both to the morals and enjoyment of individuals, to enable them to acquire poſſeſſions, than if it gave to their inactive wiſhes. And the ſame obſervation may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to acts of private charity; for an individual to enable another to acquire wealth for himſelf, rather than to give
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025638_0011_0FCEAD3CBAA45058"/>without inciting him to perſonal activity, is more favorable for his morals and felicity. In addition to thoſe wiſe laws, and ſtatutary inſtitutions for promoting induſtry in gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, we may conſider the proviſions that are made, and the funds that exiſt, for the general diffuſion of ſcience. Theſe originated, in ſeveral of the ſtates, with the fathers of this country, to whoſe provident wiſdom for the welfare of their deſcendants we are indeed greatly indebted. Their literary inſtitutions we have preſerved; the happy effect of them has been, a great degree of intelligence through all ranks, moſt highly favorable to the exiſtence of that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which is found in republicks. While our higher ſeats of literature prepare the riſing generation for the more important departments of community, the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſchools of learning diffuſe ſuch a portion of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as ſerves the purpoſe of enabling the people to ſtudy, and value their privileges; and <hi>both united</hi> form one of the <hi>greateſt bulwarks</hi> of rational, civil, political, ſocial and religious liberty. And we ought not to be unmindful, that theſe inſtitutions for the general diffuſion of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge among the lower ranks of the people, is a very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bleſſing, in which we are privileged above all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world. While theſe continue to exiſt, deſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and tyranny can never find ſupport. Theſe therefore, conſtitute <hi>no little part</hi> of that greatneſs, to which we have been raiſed by the ſmiles of HEAVEN.</p>
            <p>We may next obſerve, that we live in a nation, in which we are taught to ſeek for our higheſt glory in the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all nations. The period has at length arrived, in which ſuperior improvements in all liberal ſcience has ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified what has been formerly taught <hi>only in the Chriſtian religion,</hi> that the trueſt happineſs of the individual, or of the part, lieth in the proſperity of the whole. Enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed policy and true Chriſtianity concentrate in the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and inculcate the deſired felicity of the world: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, for this enlightened policy, we are originally indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>chriſtianity,</hi> though infidelity and deiſm are not wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to acknowledge it. But that the fact exiſts, witneſs the diſintereſted exertions for general liberty, and ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are formed to patroniſe the abolition of general ſlavery. How different this from the ſpirit and diſpoſition of former ages and nations? Patriotiſm indeed has been anciently carried to a ſurpriſing height: but how illiberal the principle! A kind of love, which juſtified the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed hatred to foreign nations, a love as far removed from the enlarged principles of true benevolence, as the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſelfiſhneſs towards thoſe who are its friends, from the philanthropy of a chriſtian, <hi>who loves his enemies, and prays for them that curſe him.</hi> How great were the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of the Jew and the Greek? and among Chriſtian nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025638_0012_0FCEAD3E6611F8C0"/>how common to find one people ſeeking for national aggrandiſement, on the reproach or ruin of another? The chriſtian ſyſtem has taught its diſciples to view the world as a large brotherhood, and to exerciſe a benevolence as <hi>extenſive as the creation of</hi> GOD. Late improvements in knowledge, whether acquired by ſtudy, experience, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, have in a great meaſure removed thoſe prejudices, which formerly exiſted: and have taught us that chriſtian benevolence and enlightened policy are cloſely united.</p>
            <p>We may next obſerve, that we live under a government in which there is exiſting a great degree of equality among the people. In deſpotick governments this would be very unfavorable to their <hi>exiſtence.</hi> Laws are therefore made, which will ever produce great inequalities among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in all nations which are not republican. By reaſon of theſe inequalities, it is very evident, that the enormous powers of a part of the community over the other, who are in many inſtances the moſt meritorious, have been ſo long ſupported. In governments where theſe inequalities are maintained by law, it is not uncommon to find in the ſame family, one a nobleman, and another but a few de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees above beggary; and all this for no other reaſon, but that the former happened to be the eldeſt ſon, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the heir of all the family honor, and wealth, and titles, and dignities. This law for the maintenance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalities, ſo neceſſary in monarchial governments, is a remnant of the ancient fendal ſyſtem, but moſt unjuſt, and highly diſgraceful to an enlightened age. A law ſomewhat ſimilar exiſted in this ſtate, which admitted the eldeſt male to an equality with any two of his brethren, and that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the manifeſt injury of the family. But we are happy to find that law exiſts no more. Inequalities, and extreme ignorance in the lower ranks, conſtitute no little part of the policy of all deſpotick governments, in which they originated, and which <hi>they only</hi> are intereſted to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as the <hi>grand ſecret</hi> of monarchial exiſtence. In repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, different principles are neceſſary, and all that equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that nature has made, except what may ariſe by ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or induſtry, or the ſpontaneous beſtowments of a grateful people may render a propriety to exiſt, ought to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
            <p>We may next obſerve, that we live in a land where the people are contented and happy. This is evident in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral emulation to excel in all thoſe uſeful arts by which their country may be benefitted, in their peaceable and quiet attention to their own and family intereſts, by their veneration of the laws of the land, the few complaints of oppreſſion and the ſcarcity of any event that has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of inſurrection. In the claſs of the unhappy, we find but few, except thoſe reduced to miſery and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025638_0013_0FCEAD40252FE5C0"/>by utter privation of all ſober principles, and a courſe of licentious conduct. And no form of government can bleſs unprincipled minds. As to the ſober and worthy part of community, they eat the bread of induſtry, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, enjoy the benefit of their labor, and are happy. <hi>Few</hi> are there who know the wants of extreme poverty; <hi>few</hi> ſo ſtraitened in their circumſtances, but can allow themſelves the proper ſeaſons of rejoicing with their friends, and cultivating the ſocial virtues; <hi>few</hi> but can obey the calls of humanity, and contribute for the relief of the diſtreſſed. The poor of our land, and ſuch the Savior ſays ye ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have with you, will unite with us to venerate thoſe laws, by which proviſion is made to prevent their extreme ſufferings, and the claſs of thoſe who are in needy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, will <hi>love</hi> a country, in which private charity is not a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> and in which the poor of our land are fed with bread.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The text inculcates a duty in conſequence of being thus highly favored by the ſmiles of HEAVEN. <hi>Take heed to thyſelf, and keep thy ſoul diligently, leſt thou forget the things which thine eyes have ſeen, and leſt they depart from thy heart, all the days of thy life; but teach them thy ſons, and thy ſons' ſons.</hi> Our duty is firſt, to be ſenſible that becauſe the LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD <hi>has been nigh unto us,</hi> we have been raiſed to all that greatneſs, which our eyes have ſeen; and we are grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remember from whom we have received all our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and bleſſings. What the ſame prophet ſpake to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, may be applied to us, <hi>Not becauſe ye are more righteous than any other people, but becauſe the</hi> LORD <hi>had a delight in your fathers,</hi> that this land has been given unto you, and that ye have had the LORD <hi>your</hi> GOD <hi>ſo nigh unto you, in all that ye have called upon</hi> HIM <hi>for.</hi> Whence is it, that we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived all this greatneſs, that we enjoy the greateſt liberty, and live under the moſt righteous government, that we have the beſt laws in the world, and are free from every ſpecies of oppreſſion? Is it becauſe we have more wiſdom and power, and our princes, men who ſear GOD, been more highly illuminated, and poſſeſſed of greater benevolence to the publick? The enquiry ſtill meets us, whence is all this? Surely "becauſe the LORD our GOD has been nigh unto us in all that we have called upon him for." What ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, if our minds are not deeply impreſſed with a realizing ſenſe of the greatneſs of our obligations? But, my chriſtian auditors, there is one debt that we owe to GOD, compared to which all others are greatly leſſened. This is the debt of gratitude for the gift of His SON, to bleſs the world with the light of the goſpel, by which we have received the moſt pure and ſublime religion, and which, by giving more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened ſentiments of GOD, of human nature, and of the moſt intereſting truths, hath not only elevated the hopes of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025638_0014_0FCE9E5A13E95210"/>individuals, but hath greatly meliorated the governments of the chriſtian nations, diffuſed a grater mildneſs and leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the complexion of the laws, the adminiſtration of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and the manners of the people at large. The refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ancient Greece and Rome, though the boaſt of the enemies of our religion, were barbariſm compared to the civilization to which ſome chriſtian nations have attained. Witneſs the publick feaſts in honor of the gods in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the <hi>unrobed</hi> combats and cruel ſports of the gladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, putting each other to death merely for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people called <hi>refined,</hi> in the latter. When we recollect the great amelioration exiſting in nations favored with the light of the goſpel, and the juſt ideas it has given of GOD and man, of the world, its origin, deſign and end, of the fall and recovery of the human race, of the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of love reſerved for the virtuous, of a future king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be realized in this world, before the conſummation of all things, in which there is to be exhibited a perfect go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the moſt righteous and benevolent laws, and a numerous people all happy in their obedience, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this a bleſſing that might with propriety draw from us the language of an apoſtle, who was enraptured with its greatneſs, <hi>"The length and breadth, and depth and height, and to know the love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge!" Here is love indeed. "Oh the depth both of the wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of</hi> GOD!"</p>
            <p>But while we gratefully acknowledge our obligations to the LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD, for that greatneſs to which we have been raiſed, it is our duty to tranſmit theſe ſentiments of gratitude and ſenſe of obligation to poſterity. <hi>Teach them to thy ſons and thy ſons' ſons.</hi> While the untutored ſavage "under the ſhade of his plantain" teaches his children, who are hanging upon his lips for inſtruction, the wondrous deeds of the fathers, ſurely chriſtians ought with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, to impreſs upon the minds of their deſcendants, thoſe more intereſting truths which they have received, and the aſtoniſhing events which have taken place in former days, becauſe <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD was nigh unto the fathers <hi>in all that</hi> they <hi>called upon him for.</hi> Thus ſpake the prophet of GOD to Iſrael. <hi>"And theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thy heart. And thou ſhalt teach them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to thy children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou rifeſt up.</hi> Thus would the riſing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration value the privileges which we ſhall have tranſmitted them, and realizing the greatneſs of their obligations, will unite piety with their virtue and induſtry, in rearing to perfection the great temple of liberty, which was founded in the days of their fathers.</p>
            <p>We may next obſerve, that it is our duty to exert ourſelves
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025638_0015_0FCEAD42D50D8E90"/>for the continuance of thoſe bleſſings which we have received. The time has been, when we thought the work finiſhed, and our happineſs as a nation perfected. We were careleſs, we were luxurious and idle. We were in debt to our friends, who had aſſiſted us in the day of trouble and the hour of blood, with their treaſures; and to our breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren who had fought for us, who had bled, and many of whom had died, in their country's cauſe; we were at that time without any energetick ſyſtem of national go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the political affairs of this country had a very dark aſpect indeed: Yet for a time, the people were utterly regardleſs of the conſequences of their inactivity; induſtry had greatly failed, vice and indolence made rapid incurſions, and we were inattentive to the firſt and neceſſary ſtep for remedying greater evils, than we had ever before experienced. Neceſſity and want at laſt reduced us to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and the provident wiſdom of the ſober and prudent part of the nation animated the people to induſtry, led them to ſee the neceſſity of greater energy in the ſeat of government, and we became united in eſtabliſhing ſuch a ſyſtem, which promiſes the continuance of thoſe high privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, which we now poſſeſs. Still much is depending on our continued exertions. Look for a moment among nations, ſocieties and individuals, and we find this invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth, that none flouriſh without diligence; that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings acquired are not continued without induſtry, and that they, whoſe circumſtances require unremitting exertion, are the happieſt people. It is not only true that diligence is neceſſary for the continuance of our privileges, but it is a happy circumſtance, that thus it ſhould be, for active en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are the only real ones. Whatever bleſſings are the fruit of conſtant induſtry, are the trueſt riches. None are permitted to ſit down idly at the feaſt of life, and long be happy</p>
            <p>We may in many reſpects be ſaid to contribute, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our abilities, for the ſecurity of the bleſſings we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and no one is to be excuſed from caſting in his mite, to the great treaſury of the national welfare.</p>
            <p>Every honeſt and induſtrious man, who faithfully employs the talents committed to him by the Great Maſter of the world, and attends to that calling in life which is aſſigned him by Divine Providence, contributes a valuable portion to the publick good, ſerves his GOD and his country, and will at laſt receive the reward of <hi>a faithful ſervant.</hi> All are not formed to act in the higher departments of life, neither could all be uſeful there. Infinitely various are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the publick good, and the great variety of ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and employments in a civilized community are happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adapted to call forth that amazing variety of talents, which GOD hath, in ſuch wiſdom, diſtributed to his ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025638_0016_0FCEAD45A3783B10"/>creatures, for all that beautiful ſubordination, which conſtitutes no little part of the glory of this and the upper worlds. Here is then a large field, in which not only mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, but every talent is called forth for action. While the Great LORD and Maſter is walking forth, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inactive, his language is, "<hi>Why ſtand ye here idle all the day.</hi>" The induſtrious man, while purſuing that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to which he has been called, is not only benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf and his family, but ſociety and the publick: but the idle or inactive, while injuring himſelf, his morals and his family, is robbing ſociety of its juſt demands. He is placed as a man among men, endued with abilities to do good to his fellow creatures, and ſociety juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires him to be active and uſeful. What account can ſuch render to their GOD or country? What ſelf condemnation, in that awful criſis of human exiſtence, when called by that VOICE, which none can refuſe to hear, and ſummoned to render an account for the improvement of that reaſon, and thoſe talents, with which they were inveſted, in the day that they were ſent forth into ſociety, with this command to be active and uſeful? To benefit the Almighty we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; for if thou art righteous, what doſt thou give him? But we may do good, and merit from our fellow creatures; and the Savior has informed us, that in the great day of retribution, he will accept our ſincere and well meant ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to others, as if to Him. <hi>Inaſmuch as ye have done it to one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may again obſerve, that all wiſe inſtitutions for the improvement of the human mind, for the education of the riſing youth, for the encouragement of the various arts, and the incitement of induſtry in general, are contributions to the publick good.</p>
            <p>Every parent and head of a family may render impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſervices to his country. In an ancient country, ſuch were taught to conſider their children as rather belonging to their country, than to themſelves. In <hi>families</hi> it is that thoſe pious maxims, virtuous principles, and uſeful precepts are taught and inculcated, by which the riſing youth may fill their future ſtations in life with dignity and every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. Here by the foſtering care of a parent they are trained up for thoſe employments, by which they may ſerve their country, and preſerve and extend thoſe privileges, which have been tranſmitted to them by their anceſtors, as the moſt valuable of earthly legacies. How important then is the charge committed to every head of a family? How <hi>vaſt</hi> is the benefit which <hi>ſuch</hi> may render their country, by forming their young and tender minds to uſefulneſs and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and hereby rendering them bleſſings to the world? But farther, <hi>here it is,</hi> that thoſe religious principles are laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly impreſſed, by which infidelity and vice may receive
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025638_0017_0FCEAD467B135638"/>an early check, and the riſing youth may learn by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of their fathers whom they venerate, to revere the goſpel of the Savior, and by which they may finally take an active part with their anceſtors in the ſublime and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tific employments and entertainments of the world of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</hi> And never was there a pious and virtuous maxim more invariably accompliſhed and realized.</p>
            <p>We may farther obſerve, that all endeavours to promote the proſperity of others is a contribution to the publick good. <hi>If one member be honored, the whole rejoice with it.</hi> It ought to be in ſociety as in a family or a friendly circle, in which the whole body feel the proſperity of the individual as their own. And it is as really a fact, that every happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an individual is, in its meaſure, the felicity of the whole, as in the natural body that the whole ſympathize with the member. The virtuous man conſiders himſelf as a part of the community, and when he beholds the proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of others, or of his country, he lifts his eye to heaven, and thanks his GOD. The Divine Being has ſo connected us with each other, that none can live or act without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting community. The ſin of the firſt parent has tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted miſery through ages, and that not by the poſitive will of GOD only, but by the ſame law of connexion, which we now ſee exiſting between the head of a family or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity and its members. On the contrary the virtue and uſefulneſs of individuals will be diffuſed through the whole, and be tranſmitted to riſing generations.</p>
            <p>We may next obſerve, that the ſupport of religion is a contribution to the publick good. By religion we do not intend to include any particular mode or form; for as the Savior ſaid, <hi>The time cometh, yea is already come, that neither in this mountain, nor yet in Jeruſalem, ſhall men worſhip the Father: GOD is a ſpirit; and they that worſhip him, muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in ſpirit and truth.</hi> Different modes will ever be moſt edifying to men of different prejudices and educations. It ſeems as if the Savior had deſignedly omitted any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar directions in this reſpect. Great were the prejudices he had to encounter in his diſciples. But inſtead of uſing force, he once obſerved, <hi>Many things have I to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</hi> But as to religion itſelf, the wiſdom and experience of ages have ſufficiently proved its near connection with the civil good. The ruler who fears GOD, muſt have the confidence of his ſubjects; and the ſame religion, which teaches the ſubjects to revere their Creator, commands them to be good ſubjects of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to look upon the <hi>powers that be, to be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of</hi> GOD; to be good members of ſociety, good neighbors, friends, parents, ſons, maſters, ſervants, and that <hi>every man,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025638_0018_0FCEAD4800677C30"/>wherein he is called, ſhould therein abide with</hi> GOD. Religion alone, by giving ſolemnity to an oath, is the very bond of civil ſociety. What would a ſociety be, in which the members had no fear of GOD before their eyes? How would the culprit laugh at the executioner, and all the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn pomp and inſtruments of death, were it not for that fear of an unknown futurity, a Divine Legiſlator and Judge, which has not only more influence upon the human mind, than is frequently ſuppoſed, but is of <hi>more weight,</hi> in deterring from the greateſt of human crimes, than <hi>all the ſolemn ſanctions</hi> that were ever affixed to the laws of man. Hence the moſt celebrated legiſlators have found it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to eſtabliſh ſyſtems of religion. But if thoſe religions, though filled with error, were neceſſary for the ſtability of empire, how much more the religion which came down from GOD, which exhibits the nobleſt virtues, all exemplified by its Divine Author, and in which we are called to practiſe <hi>whatſoever things are true, and honeſt, and juſt, and lovely, and commendable, and ever to ſtudy thoſe things that make for peace</hi> and love. How important is religion then, and that it be countenanced by all ranks, while the fathers ſet the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by leading their children to the temple of JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, to be early taught to adore the Great Benefactor of the world? The religion of the goſpel formerly gave us this land; the ſame religion ſtill preſerves it for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and our elders and princes are ſtill venerable for their piety, while on the weekly ſolemnities they are leading forward the tribes of Iſrael to the mount of worſhip, the ſolemn aſſemblies, the temple of GOD. May this ſpirit be cheriſhed by the riſing age. and may the temple and the prieſt, the altar and the victim, which have exiſted for ages among unenlightened nations, never reproach a people, who may juſtly glory in ſuperior light and growing advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. Let us never forget the religion of our fathers, the religion of Jeſus, the bread of life, and the waters of life.</p>
            <p>The whole plan of duty, and of our national proſperity, greatneſs and happineſs in connection with it, are given us by JEHOVAN himſelf, and addreſſed, by his prophet, to a riſing, flouriſhing commonwealth, like ours, in the ſame book from whence I have choſen my text; and they are ſummed up in piety and obedience, in religion and virtue. The ſuperſtructure of national happineſs and glory is ſure to riſe upon ſuch a foundation, and no other foundation can be laid, on which it can ariſe and find a permanent ſtability. To ſupport it in the way of impiety, unrighteouſneſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligacy, political arts, cunning and wickedneſs, is abſurd and ſelf-ſubverſive. It is an inconſiſtency in nature, repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the wiſe, holy, great and good plan of providence, and therefore the Almighty will frown with indignation
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025638_0019_0FCEAD498016FEB8"/>upon it. In this divine plan, the duties of piety are of the higheſt order, and take place of all others. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone muſt be exalted</hi> by us, as the object of our ſupreme wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and of our beſt affections. We muſt cultivate the love &amp; fear of the LORD our GOD, who has been nigh unto our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and unto us their children, with the higheſt venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his being and perfections, providences, word and works. The atheiſt is unfit for human ſociety, and to be a member of civil community; for he diſbelieves the being, omniſcience and power of GOD, to whom the appeal is made as THE WITNESS OF TRUTH, AND THE AVENGER OF PERJURY. Neither is the deiſt greatly ſuperior, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies a revelation atteſted by miracles, which none can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and one of which extorted from the lips of a centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, preſiding at the execution of Jeſus, this confeſſion— "Surely this was a righteous man."—MIRACLES ALONE PROVE A REVELATION.</p>
            <p>We may farther obſerve, that another important duty which we owe to GOD, our country and ourſelves, is fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer for the peace and proſperity of our Jeruſalem. <hi>Pray for the peace of Jeruſalem: they ſhall proſper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and proſperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions ſake, I will now ſay, peace be within thee.</hi> By this we ſhew a realizing ſenſe of our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and dependence on that GOD from whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived our bleſſings; and in this way we may hope to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the great love which HE hath exhibited to a highly favored land.</p>
            <p>My chriſtian brethren, let a view of the divine goodneſs excite us to rejoice in exiſtence; but particularly that we had our exiſtence in a land of light and liberty, political and religious. Exiſtence itſelf is a bleſſing; but how much greater, to be aſſured that there is a divine government, and that goodneſs and benevolence preſide over the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe? If this be ſo great a bleſſing, how much greater to be yourſelves a part of that highly favoured people, who have had the LORD their GOD near unto them in all that they call upon HIM for? But if this be a bleſſing that adds to the happineſs of our exiſtence, how much more is it heightened by the conſideration, that our exiſtence will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe, and that the wiſe and virtuous, who improve their privileges, their reaſon talents, and opportunities for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to their fellow creatures, and their country, ſhall not only forever live, but be forever advancing in beatific knowledge and happineſs, in the contemplation of divine objects, and a vaſt and infinite plan of the moſt pleaſing and aſtoniſhing wiſdom and benevolence, till the whole ſoul be wrapped up in GOD; and the radiant glory of the SUPREME GOOD ſhall ſo entirely <hi>abſorb</hi> the univerſe of virtuous ſemis, that there will be but <hi>one</hi> great object, <hi>one</hi> will, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </hi> With this view <hi>what a bleſſing indeed is our exiſtence!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this view of the Divine Goodneſs lead us to imitate what we ſo much love and admire in GOD. His omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, his univerſal preſence, and thoſe great and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing events which have ſurpriſed the world, and been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the effect of Power Divine, can only be admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and praiſed; but we may be Godlike in goodneſs; and <hi>this</hi> is that attribute in GOD, which, among all his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>crowns</hi> the whole with ſuperior glory. If we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, this is a ſufficient indication that thus GOD willeth.</p>
            <p>Let a view of the Divine Goodneſs to ourſelves, and our country, lead us to adore and praiſe the LORD our GOD, <hi>who has been ſo nigh to us in all that we have called upon Him for.</hi> There is ſcarce any power or faculty in human nature, but what may find a reſemblance, though in a lower degree, in the animal world. But do we differ from them only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree? No, there is one faculty in which we differ in kind, and are eſſentially ſuperior. This is our capability of knowing and reſembling the Creator, and adoring his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. This is the ſuperior glory of man. At the cloſe of the fifth day's work of creation, GOD beheld his works, and pronounced them good; but lo! there was none found capable of knowing and adoring their Creator. Then JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH ſpake, <hi>LET US make man.</hi>—Man alone he beheld among all his works capable of knowing his goodneſs, and on behalf of all creation, animate and inanimate, as their common prieſt, capable of rendering thankſgiving and praiſe; and <hi>He ſaid, Let them have dominion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But while the Divine Goodneſs to our favored land leads us to adore Him as on this day, let it alſo ſerve to ſhew us the nature of national vice and diſobedience to that GOD <hi>who has been ſo nigh unto us.</hi> What are our ſins, but a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of thoſe laws, by which alone as a people, or as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, we can ariſe to real greatneſs? The law is good as well as holy. Never did an individual, much leſs a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, attain to true and permanent proſperity by vice and want of allegiance to the government of the Supreme Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator. Thus a prophet, in the name of GOD, addreſſed a once choſen people; <hi>Oh! that thou hadſt hearkened to my commandments; then had thy peace been like a river, and thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025638_0021_0FCEAD4C98FF9110"/>joy—a joy that elevates and improves the mind, while it gladdens the heart.</p>
            <p>What a ſuitable ſeaſon is this to make the hearts of our fellow-creatures around us, particularly of the induſtrious and virtuous poor, to rejoice with us, and that as far as lieth in our power, there be no ſorrowing foul; but that <hi>ſighing and tears he wiped away,</hi> by our exerciſe of that chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian charity and benevolence, which our holy religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. Thus your prayers and your alms, your thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and your good works, your joy and your labors of love would <hi>aſcend up for a memorial before</hi> GOD. This would be the rejoicing of benevolence, a Godlike affection! a joy that would make us better, as it makes us happier. Thus <hi>would our light break forth as the morning, our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs go before us, and the glory of the</hi> LORD <hi>would he our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the midſt of our rejoicing this day, as is natural to every grateful mind, remember our brethren or friends who as a nation or ſociety may be filled with fore diſtreſs, are contending for the privileges we enjoy, or are expoſed in property, liberty and life to the moſt imminent dangers. Such is the ſituation of an allied European people, who, in the days of our diſtreſs, generouſly aſſiſted us, and openly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended the cauſe of this country againſt our enemies. They are now emerging from darkneſs far greater than ours, to behold the light of general liberty. The true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, accompanied with the knowledge of it, which hath for ages been concealed from the commonality, and which, when known, has ever been found favorable to univerſal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, is now beginning to break forth, its principles to he diffuſed, particularly thoſe which reſpect the rights of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and bids fair to emblazon ſpeedily the whole European nations. But they are only ariſing as yet. Great and diſtreſſing will probably be their conflict with the wrath of united tyrants, who look forward with terror and diſmay to the approaching fall of deſpotiſm, before thoſe liberties and privileges that we enjoy will be eſtabliſhed in that nation. Through what ſeas of blood have they been already obliged to wade in purſuit of this high object! but the price is not eſteemed too great for a bleſſing dearer than life. While we ſympathize with them in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, we ought particularly to lament, that it ſhould be, or be thought, neceſſary to exile or ſacrifice any, who were once highly valued by them, at the ſhrine of liberty; any who have been holden in the higheſt eſtimation in this country, and whoſe names are yet dear to almoſt every American. This however ought not to prevent our benevolent wiſhes for the proſperity of that cauſe, which, as it is the <hi>cauſe of human nature,</hi> a cauſe which the more it is inveſtigated by every nation, the more it <hi>muſt</hi> be befriended; a cauſe which
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025638_0022_0FCEAD4EB3B57CE0"/>as it involves in its conſequences the liberty and happineſs, not of a nation, or an age, but <hi>of ages and nations to come,</hi> we have every reaſon to believe that GOD will eſpouſe it as <hi>His cauſe</hi> and crown it with ſucceſs. The ſun of liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe in the weſt, and its light is rapidly diffuſing to the eaſt; and ſaith the holy prophet, "wrapp'd into future times," <hi>They ſhall fear the name of the LORD from the weſt, and his glory</hi> ſhall extend to <hi>the riſing of the ſun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are brethren and friends ſtill nearer to us; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied not by treaty, but by nature; bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh, whom we ſhould remember this day, in the midſt of grateful rejoicing under the ſmiles of HEAVEN. They lived with us, but they have gone from us, to take their future reſidence in the diſtant parts of this land, where they are now expoſed to the depredations of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs enemy. While we are rejoicing, they are perhaps this moment trembling under momentary uncertainty and perpetual danger. How inſecure their lives and property! how often are their houſes <hi>wrapp'd in flames,</hi> their wives and children taken by brutal violence, without regard or pity to age or ſex, and led to long captivity, or put to a cruel death? The father leaves his family in the morning in peace, goes forth to his labors in the field, returns in the evening to gladden a dependent family; but alas, the ſad reverſe of fortune! Let imagination paint the ſcene which has been often realized.</p>
            <p>That grateful joy in the bounties which we receive, and which we are this day enjoying, in the pleaſant ſociety of our families and friends, without any enemy to moleſt or make us afraid, ſhould remind us of our brethren who once ſat with us. This is but natural to a grateful and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous heart. Thus, while we are ſitting around the table, and partaking of the gifts of Providence, how common is it, to remember ſome abſent friend or relation, who filled a now vacant ſeat on the former anniverſary day? With the ſame propriety we ought this day to remember our breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in diſtreſs, and to raiſe a ſympathizing heart and eye to the throne of grace, that the <hi>Father of love</hi> would protect them, and ſoon enable them to ſit under the <hi>peaceful vine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, let us this day remember our fellow creatures here and elſewhere, who may be in affliction. Let our hearts be filled with benevolence equal to our joy. <hi>Let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> break every yoke aſunder,</hi> and do our endeavours for the peace, liberty and happineſs of all our fellow creatures. Then <hi>while the</hi> ALMIGHTY <hi>looketh down with a frown</hi> on the remaining iniquity of an highly favored land, HE <hi>may turn an eye</hi> to our deeds of charity and benevolence, with a countenance beaming with deſigns of infinite love.</p>
