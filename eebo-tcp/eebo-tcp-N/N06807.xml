            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>The King ſhall joy in thy ſtrength, O Lord, and in thy ſalvation how greatly ſhall he rejoice. Thou haſt given him his heart's deſire, and haſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden the requeſt of his lips. For thou preventeſt him with the bleſſings of goodneſs; thou ſetteſt a crown of pure gold upon his head. He aſked life of thee, and thou gaveſt it him, even length of days for ever and ever.—Thine hand ſhall find out all thine enemies, thy right hand ſhall find out thoſe that hate thee.—For they intended evil againſt thee: they imagined a miſchievous device, which they were not able to perform. Therefore ſhall thou make them turn their back, when thou ſhalt make ready thine arrows upon thy ſtrings, againſt the face of them. Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own ſtrength: ſo will we ſing and praiſe thy power.</p>

            <p>IT is probable <hi>David</hi> wrote this divine ode ſoon after he had received that promiſe of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of his kingdom in an uninterrupted line of ſucceſſion thro' his ſon <hi>Solomon,</hi> which we find, 1 <hi>Chronicles,</hi> 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>
            <p>On this promiſe <hi>David</hi> there dwells with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and rapture: it is plainly the ſubject of ſeveral pſalms; and he doubtleſs underſtood it as of the ſame tenor with the promiſes made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> ultimately referring to the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008632_0004_102FA2ADF2537BE0"/>
kingdom of the Meſſiah. This he ſeems principally to keep in view in this pſalm; in a prophetic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he deſcants upon it, and rejoices not only in the higheſt aſſurance of his own continued victories, and the greater glory of his ſon <hi>Solomon,</hi> but of the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible power of that future royal ſon againſt whom no policy ſhould prevail, no weapon proſper.</p>
            <p>But as far as this pſalm relates to himſelf, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly expreſſes his intire dependance upon God, aſcribes all his ſtrength, ſafety, honor, and proſperity to him, acknowleges them as anſwers to his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al prayers, and thankfully reflects upon divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in prolonging his reign, and granting him the hope of an endleſs life: by the great things which God had already done for him, and a believing proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the Meſſiah's kingdom, he riſes to the moſt joyful confidence that God would ſtill continue his favours to Iſrael conſidered as his church, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint and confound all their enemies; and ſo he concludes with this exulting prayer of faith, which he puts into the mouths of the whole body of ſaints <hi>—Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own ſtrength: ſo will we ſing and praiſe thy power.</hi> q. d. Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt thy divine perfections more and more, make thy power conſpicuous in thy wonderful providences for the ſafety and proſperity of thy church; let all nations behold thy majeſty and univerſal dominion: ſo will thy people ſing of thy goodneſs, and celebrate thy praiſe. Let us on the preſent joyful occaſion ſubjoin our hearty AMEN.</p>

            <p n="1">I. The ſtrength, ſafety, grandeur, and proſperity of kings, eſpecially when in connexion with the ſecurity and welfare of the church, muſt be aſcribed to God.</p>
            <p>All things are of God: the exiſtence, order, beauty of univerſal nature, ſprung from his almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty word, according to that perfect plan of eternal wiſdom, by which all things appear'd diſtinctly in their moſt minute circumſtances to an infinite mind, when yet <hi>they were not:</hi> the conſtant laws of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ſyſtems were fix'd from the beginning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue by his will: and all intellectual and rational beings are equally under the moſt exact regulation, by that ſupreme moral government which he more immediately exerciſes as <hi>God over all,</hi> and by the conſtitutions which he has ſettled agreeable to their various ranks and circumſtances.</p>
            <p>All government originates from him who is the Creator and Lord of the univerſe; who has plainly pointed out, by the different genius and capacities of
<pb facs="unknown:008632_0006_102FA2B291299DA0"/>
men, various ſervices, and different degrees of honor and power; who has made ſociety neceſſary for our welfare and comfort; who led the firſt families and tribes of mankind, by a certain inſtinct of nature, to acknowlege and obey their reſpective heads, and conſent to that authority which each found neceſſary for their common ſafety.</p>
            <p>Government began in patriarchal authority, and was gradually improved into more ample power, and extenſive dominion, eſtabliſh'd upon new claims, according to the riſing exigencies of thoſe little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and the opportunities which artful ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men ſeized upon from time to time to aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize themſelves, and ſubject cities and kingdoms to their will. There is ſomething in the very conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of man, and the general condition of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth, which tends to divide the world into diſtinct nations, and produce the various forms and degrees of dominion which have appear'd in all ages. Thus <hi>the civil powers are ordained of God,</hi> deſigned originally for the benefit of mankind, erected in various forms by his ſpecial providence.</p>
            <p>We no where find any certain model of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, preſcribed by expreſs revelation, except that given to Iſrael under <hi>Moſes;</hi> which was peculiar to their circumſtances as a national church, a proper theocracy under the conduct of a peculiar provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>The divine right of kings,</hi> as it has been preach'd up in times paſt in order to ſupport tyranny, and perſuade people to bear the heavieſt yoke with tame ſubmiſſion, is a whimſy without any foundation in ſcripture or reaſon: <hi>paſſive obedience</hi> is a doctrine which none can ſwallow who underſtand the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rights of mankind; which proteſtants eſpecially
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008632_0007_102FA2B7201AFA98"/>
muſt abhor; which <hi>England</hi> has always rejected as inconſiſtent with all her liberties: had this maxim prevailed, the great revolution by which <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> was happily ſecured from popiſh kings and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders had never been effected, and long before this time we might have been reduced under ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' we deny an <hi>indefeaſible divine right,</hi> we acknowlege kings are ſet up by the providence of God. The famous antient monarchies of the world were erected according to his purpoſe, and roſe to the height of their grandeur by his permiſſion. Even tyrants who abuſe their power, are exalted by the hand of God, to be inſtruments of chaſtiſing the nations for their ſins; he raiſes them up, or caſts them down, lets looſe their rage or reſtrains them, at his pleaſure. The Aſſyrian monarch <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. x. 5—15.</note> was but <hi>the rod of divine anger; the indignation of God put the ſtaff in his hand; he was ſent by heaven againſt an hypocritical nation, to take the ſpoil, to take the prey;</hi> tho' the tyrant never imagined any ſuch thing, but only <hi>aim'd to deſtroy and cut off nations not a few.</hi> So the Moſt High gave Nebuchadnezzar <hi>his kingdom and majeſty and glory and honour,</hi> and bro't all people into ſubjection to him, to anſwer his own wiſe and and holy purpoſes. <note n="†" place="bottom">Dan. v. 18, 19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But when ſuch an equitable conſtitution of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is form'd and ſettled as is plainly agreeable to the laws of nature, in the beſt manner ſerving the ends of ſociety; when the plain deſign and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it is to ſecure life, liberty and property, and promote virtue and peace; eſpecially when it not only guards and enforces the religion of nature, but gives protection and encouragement to the church
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008632_0008_102FA2BB0BE50B40"/>
of God, built upon the more immediate revelation of his will; ſuch a government may be ſaid with peculiar emphaſis to be <hi>of God:</hi> ſuch a kingdom is conformable to the perfect pattern of his ſupreme dominion, and the King of Heaven muſt be pleaſed with it in the ſame manner as he takes complacency in the virtues of individuals, and every thing copied from his own perfections.</p>
            <p>By the church we are not to underſtand ſome one diſtinct form and <hi>eſtabliſhment of religious ſociety;</hi> but collectively the whole body of chriſtians, united, tho' in many diſtinct ſocieties, under various particular denominations, in the worſhip of the one true God according to the expreſs revelation of his will. Nor is the church ſo connected in its own nature with the power and proſperity of any particular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it cannot ſtand upon its own proper baſis without the ſupport of civil authority: for we know the chriſtian church flouriſh'd and ſpread, in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt purity and power, long before it had the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of emperors and kings. Civil and religious ſocieties are entirely diſtinct in their nature; the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and proper authority of the one cannot be blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the order and proper authority of the other, without the greateſt hazard of corrupting and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening both.</p>
            <p>Yet the church receives great advantage from a well conſtituted civil government, and the proſperity of the ſtate. Under ſuch a happy government it is guarded againſt the rage of perſecution; appears openly in the worſhip and order of religious aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; enjoys the benefit of public inſtruction, free inquiry, and undiſſembled profeſſion; is permitted to employ all the artillery of the <hi>word of God</hi> againſt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008632_0009_102FA2BC98AC21B0"/>
the devil's kingdom, and uſe the beſt means for its own inlargement and perfection. The church thus built on its proper foundation, muſt very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the ſafety and proſperity of the kingdom, for it's own ſecurity and welfare: if the nation is weakened by wars, or over-run by invaſions, the enemies of the one will probably be enemies to the other, and the church muſt have a great ſhare in the public calamities; but when the nation grows ſtronger, and not only maintains its ground but multiplies its conqueſts, and becomes great and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, religion ſtands more ſecure, and ſpreads knowlege and liberty farther and farther.</p>
            <p>A kingdom eſtabliſhed upon ſuch equitable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, where civil liberty and evangelical religion are encouraged and ſupported, ſtands fair for the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar guardianſhip of Heaven. As the hand of God may be ſeen in erecting, his providence will be obſervable in defending and aggrandizing it: he will make its kings great and honorable by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favor, and grant them <hi>his ſtrength and ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When good kings are rais'd up, who by their example and authority encourage piety and virtue, and rule in the fear of God, they are like <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> dignified and protected by a peculiar providence, and given as bleſſings to their people and the church of God: and he will make them great on the throne, and ſucceſsful in war; they will reign in the hearts of their ſubjects, and be fear'd and honor'd by neighbouring nations. The goodneſs and power of God will be as plainly viſible in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, and the proſperity which attends their reign, as if they had been choſen and appointed by him in the moſt immediate extraordinary manner,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008632_0010_102FA2BE21F1AE98"/>
and gain'd their glory and magnificence in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the moſt expreſs perſonal promiſes: and the people ought to have a juſt ſenſe of this divine goodneſs, and eſteem it a great bleſſing to have the life and reign of ſuch kings prolonged.</p>
            <p>This naturally brings on the next remark,</p>
            <p n="2">II. The long life and proſperous reign of a good king is a great bleſſing, and an encouragement to the people of God to depend upon his continued care of the church, and the farther accompliſhment of his promiſes.</p>
            <p>Fooliſh, irreligious, an vicious princes are often ſent in wrath to a people, as a juſt puniſhment of their ſins: when they have forſaken God and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted themſelves, he ſuffers them to be corrupted more and more by the example of their kings, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits their vices according to their natural tendency to infect and weaken the government, diſtract their councils, impoveriſh and lay them open to the power of their enemies; and ſends his curſe upon them in all their intereſts and undertakings. By a ſucceſſion of wicked kings Iſrael was ſoon ripened for utter ruin; and the favor or diſpleaſure of God toward Judah was apparent according to the character of the kings which from time to time reigned over them: nor ſhould we be miſtaken perhaps in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame remarks upon the hiſtory of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> monarchs.</p>
            <p>Not that irreligious princes are never us'd by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence as inſtruments of doing ſome real good to a nation: to aſſert this would be to limit the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power of God, in contradiction to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and experience. He can make advantage even
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008632_0011_102FA2C50B1A8B68"/>
of the vices of the great, their pride, ambition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, avarice, or luſt, to accompliſh his deſigns for the good of a favorite nation, and the welfare of his church. <hi>Saul</hi> was a ſelf-will'd, jealous, revengeful prince; yet he introduced order among a people who had lived for centuries too much at looſe from government; he perform'd ſeveral worthy actions, and laid a good foundation for a proſperous king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Jehu</hi>'s zeal was fir'd chiefly by ambition; yet he did the work which God commanded, in cutting off the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and deſtroying the worſhippers of <hi>Baal.</hi> The grand charter of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s liberties was obtain'd of kings far from the beſt of characters. And a monarch whoſe chief aim was to gratify his luſt, became the inſtrument of our deliverance from the pope's tyranny, and the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the moſt valuable bleſſings of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>But wiſe and virtuous kings, whoſe breaſts glow with all ſocial affections; who are equally ennobled by great and generous actions as by royal blood; who value their high authority only as a power of doing the greateſt good; merit the warmeſt love of their ſubjects, and will be honor'd as fathers and benefactors, bleſſings which Heaven gives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues. Such amiable princes have appear'd even among the heathen, the delight of their people, the ſtrength and glory of their kingdoms. Such was <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the founder of the <hi>Perſian</hi> monarchy, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>'s great deliverer from the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> whoſe name ſtood honorably regiſter'd in one of the moſt remarkable prophecies of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> near two hundred years before the event <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. xlv.</note>. Such among the <hi>Roman</hi> emperors was <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> whoſe reign was
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008632_0012_102FA2C694E6B540"/>
gloriouſly diſtinguiſh'd by the birth of our Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt within the limits of his empire: and after him, <hi>Veſpaſian, Antoninus, Pius</hi> and ſome others.</p>
            <p>But eſpecially when kings are men of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, fearing and giving glory to God; it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt token of the divine preſence with them,—a plain intimation that God deſigns the greateſt favors to ſuch a nation. The beſt of Kings will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the moſt eminent ſervices, and diſtinguiſh'd by providence with the greateſt honors. If ever we may depend upon remarkable public proſperity, it is under ſuch princes who acknowlege their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon the ſupreme Majeſty of Heaven, and aſk counſel of God, in all affairs of government, peace and war; who make him their ſtrength and confidence, honor his laws, obſerve his providences, and give him the glory of their victories. What is too great to be expected under ſuch a reign? What can give greater joy to a happy nation than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their king governing with wiſdom, prudence and juſtice; aiming, in every thing, at the honor of God and their intereſt, protected by divine goodneſs, and reigning proſperouſly even to old age.</p>
            <p>Long life may be conſidered as a great bleſſing to the <hi>King himſelf:</hi> for though the life to come is infinitely preferable to the happieſt ſtate on earth; and the honors of an heavenly kingdom, the never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading crown of glory, the true and everlaſting riches, beyond all compariſon above earthly crowns and ſceptres, and the utmoſt ſplendor of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this world; ſo that chriſtians, in the vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous exerciſe of faith, would <hi>deſire rather to be abſent from the body and preſent with the Lord,</hi> even though
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008632_0013_102FA2C87270FAA8"/>
they had the higheſt enjoyments and nobleſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects which earth can afford: yet when our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance here may give us a farther opportunity of exerciſing and improving the nobleſt virtues; when we feel ourſelves capable of doing yet greater ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and our hearts more and more inlarg'd with generous paſſions; when it ſeems neceſſary we ſhould continue here for the advantage of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men, eſpecially of the church; a chriſtian, even in the beſt frame, would aſk life, though with ſubmiſſion, and entertain with pleaſure the hope of doing greater good. This is the language of an apoſtle, anxious for the church's welfare <note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. i. 23—25.</note>
               <hi>— I am in a ſtrait betwixt two, having a deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt, which is far better: nevertheleſs, to abide in the fleſh is more needful for you, and having this confidence, I know that I ſhall abide and continue with you all, for your furtherence and joy of faith.</hi> In ſuch a caſe, life is a bleſſing, and the greater as we move in a ſphere of the moſt extenſive uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>A good king enjoys the greater happineſs in life in proportion to his exalted dignity: He conſiders himſelf as a god to his ſubjects; and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon his benevolent ſchemes yet but imperfect; when he views the important ſervices which lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; when he ſees the nation yet in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled ſtate, and many farther regulations neceſſary which he has ſcarcely had opportunity to attempt, religion and virtue demanding his patronage, and the future peace and proſperity of his ſubjects greatly depending upon the continuance of his life; he will aſk it of God, and value it as a ſpecial favour.</p>
            <p>But to his happy people the long life of a good king is more eſpecially a bleſſing. They conſider
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008632_0014_102FA2CA02EC2758"/>
him as their guardian, their father, the miniſter of God. They ſee the wiſdom and equity of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; they experience the ſalutary effects: religion and virtue prevails; their liberties are guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; every thing is brought into order, and it is put more and more out of the power of future princes to oppreſs them; ſo that, for their own advantage, they cannot but wiſh to have his life and reign pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed.</p>
            <p>Beſides; there are ſome peculiar circumſtances, which may add greater importance to the life of a good king: as, when there is no certain ſucceſſor: or none but a minor, under tutors and governors, ſo that the adminiſtration may fall into the hands of ambitious deſigning men, contending among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ſuperiority, and aiming more at their own private intereſt, and the advancement of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, than to diſcharge their duty to their king and country:—when the ſituation of affairs is critical;— when there are inteſtine broils, or foreign wars:— when ſucceſsful plans of operation are but juſt ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to afford a comfortable proſpect of approaching tranquillity:—at ſuch times to have a good king, though advanced in years, taken away, may diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert all meaſures, reverſe events, and throw all things into confuſion.</p>
            <p>On the contrary: when, at ſuch a juncture, his life is continued; when we ſee him ſurprizingly extricated from the greateſt difficulties, and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his wars beyond our utmoſt expectations; when God by him is apparently performing great things for his church, diſappointing the deſigns, and breaking the power of the adverſaries of religion and liberty; it gives great encouragement to look upon
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008632_0015_102FA2CD2F03A500"/>
theſe things as a prelude to farther favors, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of thoſe greater events, by which the church is to be brought into a more complete and flouriſhing ſtate, and the kingdom of Chriſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd through the world. By theſe things our faith is confirmed, that God will preſerve and defend the truth of the goſpel in ſuch a nation, ingage himſelf on their ſide, and ſupport his own cauſe, till he has ſilenced and confounded all who oppoſe his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and bleſſed all nations with light, liberty, and peace, under the glorious king of righteouſneſs. If the antient people of God were encouraged, by the favors granted to the church in <hi>David's</hi> proſperity, to depend upon the full accompliſhment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that the church ſhould be ſecured notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the moſt threatning appearances, and rais'd at length to greater glory under the Meſſiah; we alſo may be aſſured by all which God has done in times paſt for Proteſtants, and by the wonderful things which he has lately been doing for <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her allies againſt a grand confederacy of the antichriſtian powers, that he will continue his care of the reformed churches, till all the prophecies of the new teſtament againſt myſtical Babylon are accompliſhed, and the kingdoms of this world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>kingdoms of our Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Our fathers have told us what God did for them in their day: and now we ourſelves are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his goodneſs and power, and are at this time rejoicing in the life of one of the beſt of Kings, and the aſtoniſhing ſucceſs with which, in his old age, his arms have been bleſs'd: the hand of God is viſible in theſe great events, and it is our duty to obſerve it, with admiration and gratitude. This is
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008632_0016_102FA2D2F0E94D20"/>
agreable to the laſt remark upon our text; which I ſhall briefly illuſtrate, to make way for a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conſideration of thoſe extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which this day fill our hearts with joy, and demand our grateful praiſes to God.</p>
            <p>REM. III. When God in his providence remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably defeats and ſubdues the enemies of his kingdom, <hi>good men</hi> will take peculiar notice of his power, and give glory to his name.</p>
            <p>The generality of perſons overlook the hand of providence even in the greateſt events; they regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operations of his hands. As they lightly glance over the ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous works of creation, and behold the ſtarry ſkies without obſerving the incomparable wiſdom and unrival'd magnificence of that univerſal King, who has ſpread ſuch a pavement under his throne; as they behold the ſun, reſtoring and brightening the day, without conſidering the power and glory of that Being who kindled its blaze, and continues its revolutions; ſo they are equally inattentive to the works of providence: they think of common events as things of courſe; of events whoſe cauſes are more ſecret, whoſe appearances are more inconſtant and irregular, as meer caſualties; of evils or benefits as coming merely from men or nature. If they are involved in war, and things go againſt them; it is far from their thoughts that the enemy may be a ſcourge in the hand of God; they reflect only upon a weak or wicked miniſtry, bad officers, and the like: if they have ſucceſs, they extol the generals and the troops, commend the wiſdom of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and give all the glory to men; regardleſs
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008632_0017_102FA2D4969E2D28"/>
of a ſuperior Power, and thoſe acknowlegements which are due to God.</p>
            <p>But wiſe obſervers will ſee the majeſty and power, the juſtice, diſpleaſure, or favor of the great Lord of the univerſe, in all theſe things; in the moral, as well as the material ſyſtem; in common, as well as extraordinary appearances; in all occurrents, relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perſons, families, or nations. Eſpecially in the great affairs of government, or war, they ſee ſome of the plaineſt inſtances of that ſupreme do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which God exerciſes over all mankind: how he regulates the kingdoms of this world, like ſo many provinces of one general empire, under his own immediate care; marks their bounds; limits their privileges; balances their power; and retains them in ſubjection. They behold him judging among the nations; correcting them by one another, and by their own vices; puniſhing them for the abuſe of diſtinguiſhing mercies, by the moſt ſignal judgments; defending his church when ſurrounded with enemies; and by his arm ſtrengthening the hands of kings who engage in his cauſe.</p>
            <p>Such an acknowlegement of Divine Providence neceſſarily ariſes from a proper belief of the Being and Perfections of God: the light of nature teaches it; all religion requires it. If He has no concern either with material or rational beings, after giving them laws of action agreable to their natures; but, without any farther exertions of Will or Power, leaves them to go on intirely of themſelves; what do we make of God more than an idle ſpectator? In ſuch a ſyſtem, He ſeems to be introduced only to ſave the abſurdity of an infinity of cauſes; or the eternity of the world: and when we have made uſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008632_0018_102FA2D622290690"/>
of his name to give the firſt birth to things, we lay it aſide again, as if he were no more of any impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>How widely different is this from the religion taught in the ſacred Scriptures! The Great God reveals himſelf in his word, not only as the Creator, but the Governor and Diſpoſer of all things. In this majeſtic language He ſpeaks of his perpetual univerſal providence— <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. xlv. 7.</note> 
               <hi>I form the light, and create darkneſs; I make peace, and create evil.—</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xxxii. 39.</note> 
               <hi>I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal.—</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſai xlvi. 10.</note> 
               <hi>My counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure.</hi> There we find the ſaints, in all ages, confeſſing a continual Divine agency; looking to God for direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and proſperity in all their ways; obſerving his providencial government; adoring his wiſdom and juſtice; and praiſing him for his mighty acts, and unbounded goodneſs.</p>
            <p>As there are, in nature, ſome rare and ſurprizing phenomina, to awaken the attention of mankind, and fix upon their minds a deeper conviction of the Being and Perfections of God: ſo, in the courſe of providence, there are great and remarkable events, deſigned as more ſtriking evidences of the Divine government, to continue and increaſe in the world a reverencial regard to his ſupreme Majeſty and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It is moſt reaſonable to ſuppoſe that this is the principal point in which they centre, to promote religion and moral virtue: and it is obſervable in fact, that by many extraordinary and miraculous providences; by plagues, and famines; by wars, and deſolations; by the riſe and fall of empires; and by continual changes in the affairs of nations; God has been carrying on one uniform deſign from
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008632_0019_102FA2D936EF9558"/>
age to age, to purify, enlarge and perfect his church, till all things ſhall be prepar'd for the diſſolution of this preſent ſyſtem, and the introduction of a more glorious happy ſtate.</p>
            <p>Therefore Good Men, when they are rejoicing in any public proſperity, particularly in the ſucceſſes of war, will give honor to men, as inſtruments by whom ſuch great things are done for them; but they will give glory to God above all, whoſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they are. They will obſerve how he glorifies himſelf and carries on his deſigns in favor of truth and righteouſneſs; how wonderfully he appears at one time and another for the ſupport and defence of true religion; how remarkably he diſappoints it's adverſaries, even when they grow moſt confident of ſucceſs, and takes them in their own craftineſs. They will take notice, by what ſurprizing turns of providence the deſigns form'd againſt truth and liberty, and to introduce and propagate ignorance, ſuperſtition and ſlavery, are blaſted and overthrown, and that very miſchief brought upon the wicked projectors which they meditated againſt others. They behold the King of Heaven, in theſe things, accompliſhing his own purpoſes, notwithſtanding the oppoſition and rage of Earth and Hell; fulfilling his promiſes; magnifying his power and wrath againſt his enemies; and diſtinguiſhing, by his wonderful goodneſs, thoſe who place their truſt in him. When ſuch things as theſe are viſible in our ſucceſſes, it is juſtly expected we ſhould take notice of them, and give glory to God, as exalting himſelf in his own ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians may triumph in the victories of war; but not as the heathen, who ſhout and give honor
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008632_0020_102FA2DF34F386D8"/>
to their idols with frantic noiſe, and bruitiſh ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality: the joy of <hi>chriſtians</hi> ought to be more ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, temperate, and noble, ſpringing from a proper ſenſe of the benefits receiv'd, and exciting religious ſentiments and affections. They ought to rejoice and give glory to God; to aſcribe to him all the advantages they have gained; and praiſe him for ſuch public bleſſings, and the proſperity of Sion. By this joy they will find their knowlege, love, and reverence of God increaſing, and their faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him more and more ſtrengthned.</p>
            <p>But it is high time to paſs from generals to a more particular application of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Therefore to bring theſe things home to ourſelves</p>
            <p>In the firſt place. <hi>We have reaſon to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege the glory of our</hi> Britiſh <hi>Monarchs as a peculiar favor of God.</hi> He has placed <hi>Great-Britain</hi> among the moſt conſiderable powers in <hi>Europe,</hi> and made her kings rich and honorable, ſo that they may vie with the greateſt abſolute monarchs. Tyrants have the command of their people's purſes, yet they often find themſelves poor; they are deſpotic, but hated: but the kings of <hi>England</hi> have the affections of a free people; they are rich in the national wealth, which is freely granted whenever it is neceſſary; and their authority is obeyed with pleaſure, with the firmeſt loyalty, while they adhere to the conſtitution, and love their ſubjects. Never did any nation more heartily abhor tyrants, or oppoſe with greater reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſuch ſtretches of authority as are inconſiſtent with the natural rights of mankind: but no where can be found a more loyal people while their princes obſerve the proper bounds of power, and aim to be benefactors. Every good king, crown'd according
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008632_0021_102FA2E0CA213748"/>
to the ſettled laws of the realm, we revere as God's repreſentative, equally as if he could plead a divine right, in a ſucceſſion eſtabliſhed by Heaven.</p>
            <p>The liberties of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and her proſperity, have been remarkably favorable to the church of Chriſt: for true chriſtianity, the religion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, is inſeparably connected with free inquiry, conviction, and profeſſion. Where theſe are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, though it may ſupport itſelf under diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and perſecutions, among a happy few, whoſe minds, by divine grace, are taught to reverence the truth, and obey God rather than men; yet the church of Chriſt can have no firm footing in ſuch a nation; it will be like a ſtranger, diſcountenanc'd, oppreſs'd, and denied any ſettled reſidence among them. As Tyranny, once eſtabliſh'd, commonly extends it's inſolence to blind and curtail men's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and determine what they ſhall believe, and how they ſhall worſhip; it muſt either be taken away firſt, in order to the introduction of true chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; or elſe if proteſtant principles ſhould gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enter and gain ground, by ſome remarkable conduct of providence, they will effectually coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwork, weaken, and deſtroy ſuch tyranny, and reſtore both civil and religious liberty. Thus that ſpirit of liberty which has appear'd from the firſt foundation of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, and ſo often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted itſelf, notwithſtanding the enchantments and chains of popery, prov'd very friendly to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and the eſtabliſhment of the proteſtant religion has, on the other hand, greatly ſecured and inlarg'd our liberties.</p>
            <p>Divine Providence has ſeem'd to point out <hi>Britain,</hi> from the beginning, as a favorite nation, to make it
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008632_0022_102FA2E3B9C12BE8"/>
a pattern to other kingdoms of the moſt rational and equitable government; to ſhow how wealth, and power are connected with freedom, and to prepare the way for her enjoying a remarkable ſhare in the bleſſings of knowlege and true religion. The Great Lord of the world commonly performs the deſigns of his providence, not by immediate exertions of almighty power, but by means ſuited to the general conſtitution and courſe of things. Therefore as Antichriſt had ingaged on his ſide the policy and arms of the greateſt empires in <hi>Europe</hi> to cruſh the Reformation; it was neceſſary that ſome earthly powers ſhould be rais'd up to encourage and defend it. For this end, from ſmall and confuſed begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, by wonderful ſteps, through many ſtrange revolutions, God ſtrengthened and aggrandized the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation, increas'd knowlege and liberty among them, and made them the envy and terror of their neighbours, ſo that they became the ſtrength and glory of the reformed churches.</p>
            <p>The Roman-catholic powers conſider'd <hi>England</hi> as the grand ſupport of the northern hereſy, as they term'd the Reformation: therefore they tried their utmoſt efforts, either to conquer, or reduce it under the Papal yoke. But He that ſits in the Heavens derided them, and defeated all their attempts: in vain they formed ſtrong confederacies; in vain they fitted out the moſt formidable Armadas <note n="*" place="bottom">The Spaniards in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign.</note>; in vain did Hell ſuggeſt and carry on a ſcheme to burſt its fire from beneath, and deſtroy at one blow all the Princes and Senators of the nation <note n="†" place="bottom">The Gun powder Plot in the Reign of <hi>James</hi> I.</note>: neither po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy nor arms availed to ſubdue <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> or root out the proteſtant religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:008632_0023_102FA2E5497B5A58"/>The moſt refined policy of <hi>Rome,</hi> was to debauch and infatuate our Kings themſelves <note n="*" place="bottom">In the ſucceeding reigns.</note>, to purchaſe of them the religion and liberties of their ſubjects, and ſo make us again a province of the papacy: but this was wonderfully over-rul'd, by Him who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the wiſdom of the wiſe, and takes them in their own craftineſs, for the more effectual ſecurity of the nation from all future attempts of that nature: it occaſioned that glorious Revolution under King WILLIAM, and thoſe parliamentary acts, by which all Papiſts were forever bar'd from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> throne, and the ſucceſſion was ſettled in the proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant line of the preſent illuſtrious houſe of <hi>Hanover.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>It is difficult to ſpeak very particularly of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious character of Kings; and the more ſo, at ſuch a diſtance; their piety muſt exceed that of common chriſtians in proportion to their greater temptations, and more illuſtrious and extenſive ſphere of action, or it cannot be conſpicuous. Flattery often covers the greateſt deformities, compliments even the vices of Princes, and paints them in thoſe ornaments of grace which they never wore; the greateſt monſters of wickedneſs have ſome times been ſainted, and even deify'd. It is rare to ſee a <hi>David</hi> or a <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhining on the throne in all the excellencies of the greateſt Kings and real Saints. But we never had more reaſon to ſpeak well of any King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> than of <hi>his preſent Majeſty.</hi> He has always acted as under a proper ſenſe of his dependance upon God; concern'd to approve himſelf to his Maſter in Heaven; aiming to promote juſtice and virtue, love and peace, in the nation, and ſecure to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects their civil rights, and the moſt valuable liberty of conſcience. He has never attempted to deprive his people of any of their privileges; the ſpirit of his reign has been the moſt oppoſite to every degree of tyranny and oppreſſion; and it is no inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the glory of it, that he never would ſuffer any of the ſeveral denominations of chriſtians,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008632_0025_102FA2EC46150D78"/>
in his dominions, to be compell'd to worſhip God contrary to the real free perſwaſion of their own minds. Whatever miſconduct may have been chargeable upon any of his Miniſters; if it ſhould be ſuppoſed that they have ever carried on ſchemes tending to undermine the liberties of the nation; for the beſt of Kings may be deceived in the perſons whom they entruſt with power, and <hi>ſervants,</hi> we know, are often <hi>more haughty and imperious</hi> than their maſters; our benevolent Sovereign never gave his people the leaſt cauſe of complaint on this ſcore. He has always contented himſelf with that authority which belongs to him by the conſtitution and laws of the nation; he has acted as the Guardian and Father of his people; He has reign'd in their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and his reign will forever be diſtinguiſh'd as one of the longeſt and happieſt in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Annals.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:008632_0026_102FA2EDCF3FD2E8"/>If we conſider <hi>the late ſituation of our public affairs,</hi> we muſt be convinc'd that the continuance of our good King's life was of the greateſt importance, and ought to be eſteem'd a peculiar favor of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. But a little while ago, the nation appear'd in a moſt critical dangerous ſtate. We were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably involv'd in a difficult expenſive war. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the daily bold encroachments of the <hi>French</hi> upon theſe <hi>American Colonies, France</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> had enter'd into a deep conſpiracy againſt <hi>Hanover</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> and aim'd at nothing leſs in the end than an intire extirpation of the proteſtant religion. It was plainly neceſſary for us to form ſome alliance on the continent of <hi>Europe;</hi> and we were naturally led to unite with his <hi>Pruſſian Majeſty</hi> in a defenſive and offenſive treaty. But againſt <hi>Pruſſia</hi> the greateſt powers in <hi>Europe</hi> were confederate: <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the <hi>Empire,</hi> the King of <hi>Poland as Elector of Saxony, Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> were collecting their forces to ſurround and aſſault him on all ſides with mighty armies: confident that they ſhould make ſhort work with him, they had already, in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made a diviſion of his dominions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And though by his unparallel'd military genius, and timely reſolution, he very much diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed their meaſures, and early gain'd great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; yet there was the utmoſt danger of his being overpower'd with numbers, and ruin'd in the end. On our part, the ſucceſs of the war, for ſome time after it began, was far from anſwering our ſanguine expectations. <hi>England</hi> was bullied with a threatned invaſion, and thought herſelf oblig'd to ſend over to <hi>Germany</hi> for ſeveral thouſand troops for her own defence; while <hi>France</hi> was preparing to ſtrike the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008632_0027_102FA2F10AB07728"/>
firſt blow upon <hi>Minorca.</hi> Our Navy was inactive, or imployed to little purpoſe. The <hi>French</hi> gain'd faſt upon us in captures by ſea, and diſtreſs'd our trade, in the channel, in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and along the coaſt of <hi>Africa:</hi> their Fleets eſcap'd our vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance before their ports, and prevented our deſigns abroad, by ſeaſonable aids where they were moſt in danger. Our army of obſervation in <hi>Germany,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Duke of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> was reduced to the neceſſity of capitulating with the <hi>French</hi> General, and delivering <hi>Hanover</hi> into his hands. Our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive armaments at Home effected nothing. In <hi>North-America</hi> we met with almoſt continual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments: notwithſtanding the large ſupplies granted by parliament for proſecuting the war here with vigor, the numbers of troops ſent over to our aſſiſtance, and the cheerfulneſs with which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial forces were rais'd, and forwarded, the enemy gain'd ground from year to year, and our colonies were in danger of being brought into the utmoſt diſtreſs, if not intirely wreſted from us.</p>
            <p>All theſe things together rais'd loud clamors in the nation; who look'd upon themſelves as on the brink of ruin; and complain'd of corruptions in the ſtate, and <hi>public vices,</hi> as the real cauſes of all their diſappointments, more threatning than the whole power of the enemy. Diſcontent and faction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; remonſtrances were daily preſented to his Majeſty; who plainly found his wiſeſt counſels em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs'd, and every thing appearing either to be miſmanaged, or unfortunately to go wrong. He felt the moſt tender paternal concern for his ſubjects; he heard their complaints; and was deſirous of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying them, as far as might be conſiſtent with the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008632_0028_102FA2F6CAC15390"/>
honor and true welfare of his government: but it was a work of no ſmall difficulty to find out the true ſource, and apply a proper remedy to theſe evils; for if the complaints of the people were upon juſt grounds, ſuch an entire reformation as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd could not be effected without danger of greater convulſons.—</p>
            <p>Now at ſuch a juncture, had God, in righteous anger, taken from us our wiſe and good Sovereign, how unhappy and even fatal might have been the conſequences! The preſent illuſtrious <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> was not ripe to manage the national affairs by his own judgment: his youth might have laid him open to the artful deſigns of corrupt politicians; who to gratify their own ambition, and ſatiate their avarice, would have ſacrificed all the intereſts of the nation. As things were circumſtanced, many reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſteps were neceſſary, which none but a <hi>ſteady experienced</hi> King could eaſily have ventured upon. Great oppoſition might be expected; fierce conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would naturally ariſe; and while the jarring parties were diſputing, and counterworking each other, our enemies might have made great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſuch an unſettled ſtate, our ſtrength might ſoon have been exhauſted, the colonies loſt, and the kingdom ſeized upon and made a province of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how remarkably has the kind providence of God prevented all ſuch fears, by <hi>prolonging the life</hi> of our gracious <hi>Sovereign;</hi> who in his old age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the wiſdom, ſpirit, and reſolution of a King, and the moſt earneſt ſollicitude for the happineſs of his ſubjects. With the moſt condeſcending good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs He has liſtened from the throne to their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008632_0029_102FA2F857BA3418"/>
and raiſed to the moſt honorable and important truſt the very Miniſter whom they requeſted;— A Miniſter whoſe wiſdom, honeſty, and courage are equal to the exalted, but difficult place, which he fills. The deſired reformation has already proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very far; the whole face of affairs now appears happily changed; and things are brought into the moſt promiſing ſituation. The excellent Mr. PITT has conducted every thing relating to the war with conſummate prudence, unexceptionable fidelity, and inceſſant application, and has been honored of GOD with aſtoniſhing ſucceſs. May he more and more recommend himſelf to the eſteem of his Royal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the affections of the Heir apparent, and the whole nation, by his faithful ſervices; and be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered and encouraged, together with all thoſe honorable perſons who are with him in the work, to accompliſh his generous ſchemes, for the dignity of the Crown, and the proſperity of <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a happy circumſtance, which ought not to be overlook'd, that his Royal Highneſs the <hi>Prince of Wales</hi> has had the advantage of obſerving the paſt and preſent conduct of affairs, in ſo critical a ſeaſon. He has ſeen the conſequents of public vices, and that policy whoſe baſis is ſelf-intereſt.—He has ſeen the nation ready to ſink under theſe evils; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered before he is called to aſcend the throne.— He has ſeen the advantage of Royal condeſcention; the wonderful change effected by a faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and honeſt politics; with what prudence, peace, and order, all things are manag'd; how ſucceſsfully our fleets and armies are employed; and with what union, cheerfulneſs, and zeal the nation bears the heavieſt expences of war. He is now arrived at
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008632_0030_102FA2F9E23504E0"/>
maturity, and is ripened for government, whenever providence may call him to take the Sceptre in his hand. He has had the beſt advantages of educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; is well accompliſh'd with princely virtues, and, if we may depend upon credible information, breathes already ſomething of that genuine ſpirit of chriſtianity which appear'd in his late excellent Father, and ſtill adorns his illuſtrious Mother; which will more effectually guard him againſt the temptations of youth, and inſpire him with the nobleſt ſentiments and views.</p>
            <p>On all the foregoing conſiderations we ought to eſteem it a great bleſſing, that his Majeſty's moſt valuable life has been continued.— He is happy in that he has liv'd ſo long to enjoy the ſatisfaction of doing good to his people, according to the deſires of his large and generous heart.— He is happy in the conſtant love of his ſubjects:—Happy in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued proſperity of his kingdom:— Happy in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the numerous ſpreading Branches of his Royal Family, and an amiable worthy Grandſon ready to fill his place, whenever he ſhall exchange his earthly honors for an unfading eternal Crown of Glory:—Happy that he has liv'd to ſee the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration ſo well ſettled, and univerſal ſatisfaction and joy expreſſed in every countenance; that he has liv'd one year more to rejoice with the nation in the ſurprizing progreſs of his victorious arms, while old and young are repeating their triumphs, giving glory to God, and bleſſing their King. Doubtleſs he is ready to aſſume <hi>David</hi>'s language and ſing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert with him, and all who love the proſperity of Zion, <hi>The King ſhall joy in thy Strength,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

honorable Sir WILLIAM PEPPERRELL, in the laſt war, and the ſettling of <hi>Halifax,</hi> the French were alarm'd with apprehenſions of our growing ſtrength, and thought it high time to check our ſpreading ſettlements, and confine us to the limits which they had marked out for us, 'till they were prepared to diſpute the whole.

            <p>Thus we were diſappointed and humbled from year to year; almoſt every thing went againſt us; the enemy gain'd ground, fortified and ſecur'd every paſs into their own country, grew more and more animated, and were meditating and preparing to drive us farther and farther, and follow us down to <hi>Albany,</hi> or even to the city of <hi>New-York.</hi> In the mean time thouſands of ſalvages were enticed over to their intereſt, and imploy'd to harraſs our armies, cut off our convoys, and execute the moſt horrid barbarities all along on our weſtern frontiers: and even thoſe Indians who had ever been our faſt friends, began to deſpiſe and deſert us, and waited only for a fair opportunity to join our enemies. So that the Colonies were very much diſheartened, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended great danger of being over-run.</p>
            <p>But when God had thus prov'd and humbled, and convinc'd us that <hi>the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong,</hi> and that our dependance muſt be plac'd intirely on him: when every one trembled for the event of theſe things, and we began to cry to Heaven more earneſtly for Divine aid, with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confeſſion of our ſins, and ſubmiſſion to God; He that hears the prayers of his people, and pities them under all their afflictions, regarded our cries,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008632_0036_102FA30E5FA889B8"/>
and gave us help from trouble. His Providence bro't about a change of meaſures at Home, the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of which ſoon reach'd <hi>America.</hi> More powerful &amp; ſeaſonable aids were ſent over, under brave, faithful, and virtuous officers. Our armies were active; our fleets terrified and ſhut up the enemy on every ſide. Laſt year <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> the key of <hi>Canada,</hi> was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd into our hands: <hi>Frontenac</hi> was demoliſh'd, and Fort <hi>du Queſne</hi> reduced, by a peculiar turn of Providence in our favor, by which even that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly defeat and ſlaughter of our troops at <hi>Ticon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroga</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>July</hi> 8. 1758. Our army, conſiſting of about 14000 men, attacked the French in their entrenchments at <hi>Ticonderoga,</hi> but were repulſed, and obliged to return, about 1500 of our ſoldiers being killed or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Upon this a reſolution was immediately taken, to ſend Colonel <hi>Bradſtreet</hi> with a number of troops againſt <hi>Frontenac,</hi> in which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he ſucceeded, and ſo prepared the way for the reduction of <hi>Fort du Queſne.</hi>
               </note>, was over-rul'd for our advantage. Theſe were the beginnings of our triumphs.</p>
            <p>But this year what <hi>Wonders have been wrought for us!—</hi>Beſides reducing <hi>Gaudaloupe,</hi> one of the fineſt Iſlands in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and recovering the ground which we had loſt at <hi>Oſwego;</hi> we have gain'd the command of the paſſages thro' the Lakes, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant conqueſt of <hi>Niagara;</hi> where we had a double triumph, in defeating, with great ſlaughter, a conſiderable body of troops ſent for the relief of that garriſon. From <hi>Ticonderoga</hi> and <hi>Crown-Point</hi> the enemy fled, and left to our forces the forts which guarded the entrance into the heart of their country, and which had been the principal objects of our former expeditions. And now, to crown all, <hi>QUEBEC</hi> is TAKEN: <hi>Quebec,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Canada,</hi> the ſtrength and dependance of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <hi>Quebec,</hi> to which our moſt earneſt attention
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:008632_0037_102FA310022A7180"/>
was turn'd, is taken, by a brave General, the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable reſolute WOLFE; who, in the ſervice of his King, for the welfare of this Country, in the faithful diſcharge of his duty, willingly expos'd and ſacrificed his own life, and triumphed in the agonies of death.</p>
            <p>With his little army he cheerfully puſh'd on thro' the greateſt fatigues; tried every generous, every forcible method, to accompliſh his deſign; till at laſt he found it neceſſary to truſt all to a battle: and accordingly, with all the art and firmneſs of a ſkilful and heroic General, he drew the enemy from their entrenchments, met them in the field, though their numbers were more than double to his own, and gained a ſurprizing victory with the loſs of very few of his troops.—Alaſs! among the ſlain <hi>He himſelf fell!</hi> by his zeal and activity He was ſoon diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, and mark'd out for death!—But he died in the midſt of the ſhouts of victory, with the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of having finiſh'd, faithfully, and ſucceſsfully, the work which had been committed to him by God and his King: and if true religion was the baſis of his courage and fidelity, He is ſtill, and ſhall be forever <hi>triumphant.</hi> His name will be remembered, in theſe Colonies more eſpecially, with the greateſt honor and gratitude, to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes:</hi> we muſt ſay, <hi>not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name be the glory, for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.</hi> We muſt not glory merely in man. While we give deſerved honors to the worthy Commanders of our armies and fleets, we muſt remember <hi>that the victory is the Lord's,</hi> and that they are but inſtruments in his hands by which he
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:008632_0038_102FA3118DB52BA8"/>
performs all theſe things for us. <hi>Amherſt, Wolfe, Boſcawen, Saunders,</hi> are names which God has high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honored; they have been his officers to execute his purpoſes of goodneſs towards us, by chaſtening and ſubduing a proud, perfidious, and reſtleſs enemy: by them God has magnified <hi>his own power, exalted himſelf in his own ſtrength, and diſcharged his arrows in the faces of the adverſaries of his Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which we have ſo long been wiſhing for, which has been projected again and again, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in vain, is now accompliſhed. <hi>Canada muſt be ſubdued,</hi> has been the cry of <hi>New-England,</hi> ever ſince we have felt the effects of their barbarous prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices againſt us. Without any regard to the moſt ſolemn ratifications of peace, they have continually irritated the Salvages againſt theſe northern Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more eſpecially, and hired them to deſtroy our towns, murder and captivate the inhabitants, and do us all the miſchief in their power. We therefore had ſufficient reaſon to look upon <hi>Canada</hi> as worſe than a <hi>Carthage</hi> to us, and make it our grand aim to deſtroy or reduce it. But former Expeditions miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried and came to nothing: corruption, treachery, or cowardice, and the vices of our armies, which were filled with the moſt horrible profaneſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled with luxury, drunkeneſs, and debauchery, rendered all our ſchemes abortive. The time was not come for our conqueſt of that Country: their iniquities were not full; and we were not ſufficiently chaſtiſed and humbled. But now <hi>we have ſeen that joyful day</hi> which our Fathers ſo earneſtly wiſhed for. We may conſider all <hi>Canada</hi> as reduced, unleſs there ſhould be ſome farther remarkable interpoſition of Providence. The paſſages of the Lakes are ours;
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:008632_0039_102FA314B9285AD0"/>
we have poſſeſſion of their Capital, and only Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; they muſt ſurrender, or live another year without ſupplies of proviſion, and fight without am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition. The <hi>Indians</hi> are forſaking their intereſt; our frontiers are quiet, and will be from henceforth ſecure, if we are permitted to enjoy, at the concluſion of the war, this important conqueſt.</p>
            <p>But, as Chriſtians, we ſhould rejoice in theſe things chiefly as they relate to the Church and Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. We are, by profeſſion, the <hi>people of God. Great-Britain</hi> has been one of the firſt among the reformed nations, and on her ſecurity and proſperity the Proteſtant intereſt very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: and <hi>New-England</hi> has been highly favored with the light and liberty of the Goſpel; the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of Chriſt have been taught, and the worſhip and diſcipline of his Church maintain'd with equal purity here, as in any other part of the world. And therefore for his own name's ſake, for the honor and advancement of true religion, God has granted us all this proſperity. Zeal for pure religion brought over the Fathers of <hi>New-England</hi> from their native ſoil, to plant churches, on theſe diſtant deſolate ſhores, upon <hi>the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt being the chief corner ſtone:</hi> and God ſmiled upon their deſign, and perform'd for them Wonders of Providence, almoſt parallel with what he did for <hi>Iſrael</hi> when he bro't them out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo that we can with great propriety apply the words of the Pſalmiſt, and ſay—<hi>We have heard with our ears, &amp;c</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xliv. 1, 2, 3.</note>. We now enjoy the word and ordinances of God in their original purity and ſimplicity, with that liberty which is the glory of chriſtianity; a bleſſing from time to time has accompanied the means of grace; our Churches are greatly multiplied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well ſupplied with able and faithful <hi>Miniſters of the New-Teſtament,</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:008632_0040_102FA31A8FCA4068"/>
and ſpreading farther and farther into the wilderneſs; and notwithſtanding our great declenſions, there are multitudes not only of honeſt, ſober, virtuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, but humble, obedient, exemplary chriſtians in our numerous Pariſhes, by whom the name of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is and will be glorified.</p>
            <p>We may therefore behold the goodneſs of God to us, to the nation, to all the proteſtant Churches, in the late wonderful ſucceſs of our arms, and the arms of our Allies. Thus God is ſtrengthning and giving weight to the <hi>proteſtant intereſt,</hi> manifeſting his wrath againſt the <hi>antichriſtian powers,</hi> and preparing the way for the final ruin of that ſpiritual tyranny and <hi>myſtery of iniquity.</hi> For theſe ends He has raiſed up and ſupported his <hi>Pruſſian</hi> Majeſty; that like a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he may execute the Divine purpoſes againſt <hi>myſtical Babylon.</hi> God has given him the moſt extraordinary military Genius, inſpired him with wiſdom and courage, upheld and ſtrengthned him, and ſubdued mighty armies before his ſword, not meerly that he might be famous, as the <hi>Hero of the preſent age,</hi> but, as we have better reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to accompliſh ſome important deſigns of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in favor of the Church. Providence has joined us in alliance with him; we have ſhared in his proſperity; <hi>the Lord of Hoſts has been with our armies; thro' God we have done valiantly, for He hath ſubdued our enemies before us. Twice</hi> the <hi>French</hi> have been diſappointed and totally defeated in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon <hi>Hanover:</hi> the former victory obtained over them by his <hi>Pruſſian Majeſty,</hi> in perſon; and the late fatal blow which they have received from <hi>Prince Ferdinand,</hi> are equally ſurprizing, and happy in their conſequents.</p>
            <p>When we review the repeated victories which have been obtained on the continent of <hi>Europe</hi> ſince
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008632_0041_102FA31C476EF440"/>
the preſent war;—when we conſider how our Fleets have alarmed and diſtreſſed the enemy on their ſea-coaſts, deſtroyed their Navy, and ruined their Trade;— when we recollect all our conqueſts in <hi>Africa,</hi> the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and theſe northern parts of <hi>America;—</hi> when we conſider how greatly this war has embarraſſed and weaken'd <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the two main Pillars of the Papacy;—we may ſee very evident tokens of God's favor to his Church, for the encouragement of all his faithful people to look and wait for the accompliſhment of his promiſes. The time will ſhortly come, and it may be much nearer than we imagine, when it will be proclaimed with a ſhout of general joy— <hi>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen! rejoice over her thou heaven, and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets, for God hath avenged you on her. They have ſhed the blood of ſaints and prophets, &amp; God hath given them blood to drink, for they are worthy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>America,</hi> the immediate deſign of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may be to ſecure this part of Chriſt's viſible Church, and make way for its greater enlargement and proſperity; that the knowlege of the truth may ſpread and fill the Continent; that Churches may riſe up and ſhine every where, thro' the wide countries which now lie waſte; that the Goſpel may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated in its purity, ſimplicity, and power, among the many thouſands of indian tribes, which now live a ranging ſalvage life round the vaſt Lakes, and thro' the boundleſs foreſts. Perhaps a door is now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for proteſtant miſſions, where the Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> have been eſtabliſhing falſhood and idolatry; that ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the only Mediator,</hi> may be preached among them, and that they may be taught a virtuous civil life. This will make way for the proper improvement of our <hi>largeſt charitable funds,</hi> to convert <hi>heathen nations,</hi> and thoſe who have
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:008632_0042_102FA31DD07FD4C8"/>
been deluded with <hi>popiſh ſuperſtitions,</hi> and bring them to the knowlege of God, and conformity to the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>God has been ſtretching out his hand in favor of the Proteſtant cauſe, diſappointing the miſchievous deſigns of the <hi>French,</hi> and requiting the perfidy and barbarity which they have ſo long been practiſing againſt theſe Colonies. He has at length bro't us into the ſtrong city, the Capital of a Country which to us has been like <hi>Edom</hi> to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Shall we not <hi>ſing, and praiſe his power?</hi> Let us behold and admire theſe remarkable diſplays of his goodneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and aſcribe to him all the glory of thoſe great things which have been done for us. If we have a proper ſenſe of his hand in all this, it will fill our hearts with unfeigned love and gratitude;—it will ſtrike our minds with deeper impreſſions of religion;—it will lead us to ſerve God, with greater zeal and cheerfulneſs, in all the duties of devotion, in the practice of univerſal holineſs, in our Churches and families, in our private and public conduct, according to all his laws and ordinances:—it will fill us with the higheſt eſteem of the glorious Goſpel, which he has committed into our hands; we ſhall live as chriſtians, as true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, agreable to our high and holy profeſſion, according to the purity and power of that excellent religion which is our glory.</p>
            <p>We have already ſufficiently teſtified our Joy, in a civil way; we have given a decent public demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of our loyalty and love of our country, upon the news of our conqueſts; we have proclaimed <hi>the ſucceſs of his Majeſty's arms</hi> to diſtant towns by thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering cannon, and indulged our joy by a ſplendid evening ſhow <note n="*" place="bottom">About three weeks before this ſermon was deliver'd; a few days after the news of the ſurrender of <hi>Quebec</hi> arrived here.</note>. It will now be moſt proper, and
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:008632_0043_102FA31F81159A68"/>
moſt acceptable to God, that our joy be of a more compoſed and religious kind, exerciſed in the moſt ſerious conſideration of the wonderful mercies grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from Heaven. Tho' we could have wiſh'd for <hi>more religious ſolemnity</hi> on ſuch an extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and even to have devoted a <hi>whole day</hi> to offer our grateful acknowlegements to <hi>the God of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Iſrael,</hi> and meditate on his mercies; this would have been attended with ſome inconveniency this laſt day of the week.—We are called upon by authority "to perform divine ſervice in the morning <hi>only.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">The words of the Proclamation for a general Thankſgiving are, "the Miniſters of the Goſpel are hereby directed to perform Divine Service in their reſpective congregations in the morning only, the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon being devoted to public <hi>rejoicings,</hi> and lawful <hi>diverſions."</hi>
               </note> Let us therefore, <hi>while we are in the Houſe of God,</hi> labour to offer our thankſgivings to him with ſincere hearts, and pure devotion.—But certainly if it would be inconvenient to ſpend this whole day in religious exerciſes; it muſt not only be inconvenient, but highly improper and ſinful, to ſpend the reſt of it in the noiſy, diſorderly, ſenſual mirth, and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Mob, in revelling and drunkeneſs, in any of thoſe things which either are vicious in themſelves, or tend to diſcompoſe the mind, and unfit men for <hi>approaching holy time.—This evening is the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ſabbath is at hand.—</hi>Noiſe and ſhow, Guns and Fireworks this evening, can never be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to our King, as teſtimonies of loyalty; but to the <hi>King of Heaven</hi> they muſt be highly <hi>provoking,</hi> as the plaineſt indications that we have no becoming grateful ſenſe of his Benefits.</p>
            <p>We are ready to honor the King by the utmoſt teſtimonies of due reſpect and allegiance: but whilſt we <hi>render to Ceſar the things which are Ceſars,</hi> we muſt alſo be careful to <hi>render unto God the things
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:008632_0044_102FA3244E03AD50"/>
which are God's.</hi> We muſt not break in upon that part of time which God, by an expreſs command, has reſerved for himſelf and the benefit of our ſouls; nor put ourſelves into an unſuitable frame for the religious exerciſes of it.</p>
            <p>I tremble for our Sabbaths.—If We, who have been a people hitherto remarkable for keeping up the ſolemnity of the Lord's day, now grow careleſs, and fooliſhly affect and endeavour gradually to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an indifference and laxneſs in the obſervation of it; a general corruption of morals will immediately ſucceed, vice will break in upon us like a flood, and the <hi>Government</hi> will ſoon very ſenſibly feel the ſad effects.—But, which is much more to be dreaded, this will bring down the <hi>anger of Heaven</hi> upon us: tho' we may be ſecure from enemies for many years to come, God has a variety of judgments with which he can puniſh a backſliding profane people. He can and will ſend upon us other plagues, as diſtreſſing, more deſtructive, than foreign arms, or Salvage cruelties.</p>
            <p>But I need not enter any farther cautions againſt diſorderly <hi>ill-timed rejoicings:</hi> you will doubtleſs pay ſo much regard to that melancholly providence, by which the joy of his <hi>Excellency our Governor</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">His only Son JOHN WENTWORTH, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> died ſuddenly on the thurſday before the delivery of this diſcourſe.</note> is ſuddenly turned into mourning, as to mourn with him in decent ſilence, omitting the intended parade and diverſions of the day.</p>
            <p>And now I cannot conclude without one hint at the moſt proper application of the whole to the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Victories of Chriſt,</hi> that promiſed <hi>Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> whoſe throne is eſtabliſhed forever. God the Father has ſet this glorious King upon his holy hill of Sion; He has rais'd him up to the throne of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:008632_0045_102FA32871444A18"/>
Empire; and he muſt reign till all enemies are ſubdued under his feet. <hi>His hand ſhall find out all his enemies, his right hand ſhall find out thoſe that hate him.</hi> In vain do the powers of earth and hell combine againſt him, and his Church; he will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint and confound them; his wrath will be like a flaming furnace to devour them. <hi>In righteouſneſs he doth judge and make war:</hi> by his word and providences he rides forth againſt his enemies, gloriouſly terrible in Majeſty and Strength; either to conquer and bring them to ſubmiſſion, that they may become his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſubjects: or finally to ſubdue and deliver them up to complete everlaſting Deſtruction. He will fulfil the prophecies of his Word, and pour out the vials of his wrath to the utmoſt upon antichriſtian nations.—But there is a greater and more dreadful <hi>Day of Wrath</hi> to come, when all the myſteries of providence and grace will be finiſh'd; when all the kingdoms of this world, and this whole viſible cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſhall be diſſolved; when the wicked ſhall be as ſtubble to the flame, and all who know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of Chriſt, ſhall be puniſh'd with everlaſting deſtruction from his preſence and the glory of his power.—Let Sinners fear his wrath, and now make peace with him, while he offers to grant them not only the privileges of ſubjects, but the dignity and inheritance of children of the Moſt High.—Let us acknowlege and obey him as our King and Savior, and we ſhall rejoice that he lives, that he reigns and proſpers; we ſhall now triumph in all his victories, and ſhall finally triumph forever with his ſaints, enjoy all the bleſſings of his glorious Kingdom, and reign with him in Life eternal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto the King that ſitteth on the heavenly throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever. AMEN.</hi>
