            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </list>
            <p n="1">I. 1. We may, in the firſt place, obſerve a few particulars of his life and death. He was born at <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> in <hi>December,</hi> 1714, and put to a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-ſchool there, when about twelve years old. When he was ſeventeen he began to be ſeriouſly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and ſerved GOD to the beſt of his knowledge. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighteen he removed to the Univerſity, and was admitted at <hi>Pembroke</hi>-college in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and about a year after, he became acquainted with the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts</hi> (ſo called) whom from that time he loved as his own ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By them he was convinced, That we <hi>muſt be born again,</hi> or outward religion will profit us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. He joined with them in faſting on <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> in viſiting the ſick and the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and in gathering up the very fragments of time, that no moment might be loſt; and he chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the courſe of his ſtudies, reading chiefly ſuch books as entered into the heart of Religion, and led directly to an experimental knowledge of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and him crucified.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He was ſoon tried as with fire. Not only his
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012280_0003_0F8A8A268B5CB4E8"/>reputation was loſt, and ſome of his beſt friends for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him, but he had many inward trials. Many nights he lay ſleepleſs upon his bed; many days pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate on the ground. But after he had groaned ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months under the <hi>ſpirit of bondage,</hi> GOD was pleaſed to remove the heavy load, by giving him <hi>the ſpirit of adoption,</hi> enabling him, through a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, to lay hold on <hi>the Son of his love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. However, it was thought needful, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his health, which was much impaired, that he ſhould go into the country. He accordingly went to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> where GOD enabled him to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken ſeveral young perſons. Theſe ſoon formed themſelves into a little ſociety, and were ſome of the firſt fruits of his labour. Shortly after he began to read twice or thrice a week to ſome poor people in the town, and every day to read and to pray with the priſoners in the county goal.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Being now about twenty-one years of age, he was ſolicited to enter into holy Orders. Of this he was greatly afraid, being deeply ſenſible of his own inſufficiency. But the Biſhop himſelf ſending for him, and telling him, <q>Tho' I had purpoſed to ordain none under three and twenty, yet I will ordain <hi>you</hi> whenever you come;</q> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther providental circumſtances concurring, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and was ordained on <hi>Trinity-Sunday,</hi> 1736. The next <hi>Sunday</hi> he preached to a crowded audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the church wherein he was baptized. The week following he returned to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and took his Bachelor's degree. And he was now fully omploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the care of the priſoners and the poor, lying chiefly on him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But it was not long before he was invited to <hi>London,</hi> to ſerve the cure of a friend going into the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012280_0004_0F8A8A26B22422C8"/>country. He continued there two months, lodging in the <hi>Tower,</hi> reading prayers in the chapel twice a week, catechizing and preaching once, beſides daily viſiting the ſoldiers in the barracks and the infirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He alſo read prayers every evening at <hi>Wapping</hi> chapel, and preached at <hi>Ludgate</hi>-priſon every <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi> While he was here, letters came from his friends in <hi>Georgia,</hi> which made him long to go and help them. But not ſeeing his call clear, at the appointed time he returned to his little charge at <hi>Oxford;</hi> where ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral youths met daily at his room, to <hi>build up each other in their moſt holy faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. But he was quickly called from hence again, to ſupply the cure of <hi>Dummer</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire.</hi> Here he read Prayers twice a day, early in the morning and in the evening, after the people came from work. He alſo daily catechized the children, and viſited from houſe to houſe. He now divided the day into three parts, alloting eight hours for ſleep and meals, eight for ſtudy and retirement, and eight for reading pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, catechizing, and viſiting the people.—Is there a more excellent way for a ſervant of Chriſt and his church? If not, Who will not <hi>go and do likewiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Yet his mind ſtill ran on going abroad. And being now fully convinced he was called of GOD thereto, he ſet all things in order, and in <hi>January</hi> 1737, went down to take leave of his friends in <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> It was in this journey that GOD began to bleſs his miniſtry in an uncommon manner. Wherever he preached, amazing multitudes of hearers flocked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> in <hi>Stonehouſe,</hi> in <hi>Bath,</hi> in <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſo that the heat of the churches was ſcarce ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And the impreſſions made on the minds of many, were no leſs extraordinary. After his return to <hi>London,</hi> while he was detained by general <hi>Ogle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:012280_0004_0F8A8A26B22422C8"/>from week to week, and from month to month, it pleaſed GOD to bleſs his word ſtill more. And he was indefatigable in his labour: generally on <hi>Sunday</hi> he preached four times to exceeding large auditories; beſides reading prayers twice or thrice, and walking to and fro ten or twelve miles.</p>
            <p n="9">9. On <hi>December</hi> 28 he left <hi>London.</hi> It was on the 29th that he firſt preached without notes. <hi>December</hi> 30 he went on board; but it was above a month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cleared the land. One happy effect of their very ſlow paſſage, he mentions in <hi>April</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <q>Bleſſed be GOD, we now live very comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in the great cabbin. We talk of little elſe but GOD and CHRIST: And ſcarce a word is heard among us when together, but what has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to our fall in the firſt, and our new birth in the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </q> It ſeems likewiſe to have been a peculiar Providence, that he ſhould ſpend a little time at <hi>Gibraltar;</hi> where both citizens and ſoldiers, high and low, young and old, acknowledged the day of their viſitation.</p>
            <p n="10">10. From <hi>Sunday, May</hi> 7, 1738, till the latter end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, he <hi>made full proof of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi> in <hi>Georgia,</hi> particularly at <hi>Savannah:</hi> He read prayers and expounded twice a day, and viſited the ſick daily. On <hi>Sunday</hi> he expounded at five in the morning; at ten read prayers and preached, and at three in the afternoon: And at ſeven in the evening expounded the church catechiſm. How much eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is it for our brethren in the miniſtry, either in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> to find fault with ſuch a labourer in our Lord's vineyard, than to tread in his ſteps?</p>
            <p n="11">11. It was now that he obſerved the deplorable condition of many children here; and that GOD put
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012280_0005_0F8A8A282AC9FEA8"/>into his heart the firſt thought of ſounding an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan-Houſe:</hi> for which he determined to raiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions in <hi>England,</hi> if GOD ſhould give him a ſafe return thither. In <hi>December</hi> following he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>London:</hi> and on <hi>Sunday, January</hi> the 14th, 1739, he was ordained Prieſt, at <hi>Chriſt-Church, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> The next day he came to <hi>London</hi> again: and on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 21ſt preached twice. But though the churches were large, and crowded exceedingly, yet many hundreds ſtood in the church-yard, and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds more returned home. This put him upon the firſt thought of preaching in the open air. But when he mentioned it to ſome of his friends, they judged it to be mere madneſs. So he did not carry it into execution, till after he had left <hi>London.</hi> It was on <hi>Wedneſday, February</hi> 21, that finding all the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors to be ſhut in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> (beſide that no church was able to contain one half of the congregation) at three in the afternoon he went to <hi>Kingswood,</hi> and preached abroad, to near two thouſand people. On <hi>Friday</hi> he preached there to four or five thouſand; and on <hi>Sunday</hi> to (it was ſuppoſed) ten thouſand. The number continually increaſed all the time he ſtaid at <hi>Briſtol.</hi> And a flame of holy love was kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, which will not eaſily be put out. The ſame was afterwards kindled in various parts of <hi>Wales,</hi> of <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> and <hi>Worceſterſhire.</hi> Indeed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went, <hi>GOD</hi> abundantly confirmed the word of his meſſenger.</p>
            <p n="12">12. On <hi>Sunday April</hi> 29, he preached the firſt time in <hi>Moorfields,</hi> and on <hi>Kennington</hi> common, and the thouſands of hearers were as quiet as they could have been in a church. Being again detained in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from month to month, he made little excurſions into ſeveral counties, and received the contributions
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012280_0005_0F8A8A282AC9FEA8"/>of willing multitudes, for an <hi>Orphan-houſe</hi> in <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</hi> The embargo which was now laid on the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, gave him leiſure for the more journies, through various parts of <hi>England,</hi> for which many will have reaſon to bleſs God to all eternity. At length on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 14th he embarked, but he did not land in <hi>Penſylvania</hi> till <hi>October</hi> 30. Afterwards he went through <hi>Penſylvania,</hi> the <hi>Jerſies, New-York, Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Virginia, North</hi> and <hi>South Carolina,</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all along to immenſe congregations, with full as great effect as in <hi>England.</hi> On <hi>January</hi> 10, 1740, he arrived at <hi>Savannah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>January</hi> 29, he added three deſolate orphans to near twenty which he had in his houſe before. The next day he laid out the ground for the houſe, about ten miles from <hi>Savannah. February</hi> 11, he took in four Orphans more, and ſet out for <hi>Frederi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> in order to fetch the orhans that were in the ſouthern parts of the colony. In his return he fixt a ſchool, both for children and grown perſons, at <hi>Darien,</hi> and took four orphans thence. <hi>March</hi> 25, he laid the firſt ſtone of the <hi>Orphan-Houſe,</hi> to which, with great propriety, he gave the name of <hi>Betheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi> a work for which the children yet unborn ſhall praiſe the LORD. He had now about forty orphans, ſo that there were near an hundred mouths to be fed daily. But he was <hi>careful for nothing,</hi> caſting his care on HIM who <hi>feedeth the young ravens that call upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. In <hi>April</hi> he made another tour through <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> the <hi>Jerſies,</hi> and <hi>New-York.</hi> Incredible multitudes flocked to hear him, among whom were abundance of negroes. In all places the greater part of the hearers were affected to an amazing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Many were deeply convinced of their loſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012280_0006_0F8A8A28DDA95A70"/>ſtate; many truly converted to <hi>GOD.</hi> In ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thouſands cried out aloud; many as in the agonies of death; moſt were drowned in tears; ſome turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pale as death; others were wringing their hands; others lying on the ground; others ſinking into the arms of their friends; almoſt all lifting up their eyes, and calling for mercy.</p>
            <p n="15">15. He return'd to <hi>Savannah June</hi> 5. The next evening, during the public ſervice, the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, young and old, were diſſolved in tears; after ſervice, ſeveral of the pariſhioners, and all his family, particularly the young children, returned home crying along the ſtreet, and ſome could not help praying aloud. The groans and cries of the children continued all night, and great part of the next day.</p>
            <p n="16">16. In <hi>Auguſt</hi> he ſet out again, and through vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous provinces came to <hi>Boſton.</hi> While he was here, and in the neighbouring places, he was extremely weak in body. Yet the multitudes of hearers were ſo great, and the effects wrought on them ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, as the oldeſt men then alive in the town had never ſeen before. The ſame power attended his preaching at <hi>New-York;</hi> particularly on <hi>Sunday, November</hi> 2, almoſt as ſoon as he began, crying, weeping, and wailing, were to be heard on every ſide. Many ſunk down to the ground, cut to the heart; and many were filled with divine conſolation. Toward the cloſe of this journey he made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection: <q>It is the ſeventy-fifth day ſince I arrived at <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> exceeding weak in body. Yet <hi>GOD</hi> has enabled me to preach an hundred and ſeventy-five times in public, beſides exhorting fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in private. Never did <hi>GOD</hi> vouchſafe me greater comforts: Never did I perform my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012280_0006_0F8A8A28DDA95A70"/>with leſs fatigue, or ſee ſuch a continuance of the divine preſence in the congregations to whom I preached.</q> In <hi>December</hi> he returned to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah,</hi> and in the <hi>March</hi> following arrived in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. You may eaſily obſerve, that the preceding account is chiefly extracted from his own Journals, which, for their artleſs and unaffected ſimplicity, may vie with any writings of the kind. And how exact a ſpecimen is this of his labours both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> for the honour of his beloved Maſter, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the thirty years that followed! As well as of the uninterrupted ſhower of bleſſings wherewith GOD was pleaſed to ſucceed his labours! Is it not much to be lamented, that any thing ſhould have prevented his continuing this account, till at leaſt, near the time when he was called by his, <hi>LORD</hi> to enjoy the fruit of his labour?—If he has left any papers of this kind, and his friends count me worthy of the honour, it would be my glory and joy to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodize, tranſcribe, and prepare them for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic view.</p>
            <p n="18">18. A particular account of the laſt ſcene of his life, is thus given by a gentleman of <hi>Boſton:</hi> 
               <q>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being about a month with us in <hi>Boſton</hi> and its vicinity, and preaching every day, he went to <hi>Old-York,</hi> preached on <hi>Thurſday, September</hi> 27, there; proceeded to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and preached there on <hi>Friday.</hi> On <hi>Saturday</hi> morning he ſet out for <hi>Boſton;</hi> but before he came to <hi>Newbury,</hi> where he had engaged to preach the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was importuned to preach by the way. The houſe not being large enough to contain the people, he preached in the open field. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been infirm for ſeveral weeks, this ſo exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012280_0007_0F8A8A29AD57D190"/>his ſtrength, that when he came to <hi>Newbury</hi> he could not get out of the ferry-boat without the help of two men. In the evening, however, he recovered his ſpirits, and appeared with his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual cheerfulneſs. He went to his chamber at nine, his fixt time, which no company could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from; and ſlept better than he had done for ſome weeks before. He roſe at four in the morning, <hi>September</hi> 30, and went into his cloſet; and his companion obſerved he was unuſually long in private. He left his cloſet, returned to his companion, threw himſelf on the bed, and lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten minutes. Then he fell upon his knees, and prayed moſt fervently to GOD, That if it was conſiſtant with his will, he might that day finiſh his Maſter's work." He then deſired his man to call Mr. <hi>Parſons,</hi> the clergyman at whoſe houſe he was: But in a minute, before Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> could reach him, died without a ſigh or groan. On the news of his death, ſix gentlemen ſet out for <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> in order to bring his remains hither, but he could not be moved, ſo that his precious aſhes muſt remain at <hi>Newbury.</hi> Hundreds would have gone from this town to attend his funeral, had they not expected he would have been interred here.—May this ſtroke be ſanctified to the church of GOD in general, and to this province in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular!</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">II. 1. We are in the ſecond place, to take ſome view of his character. A little ſketch of this, was ſoon publiſhed in the <hi>Boſton Gazette:</hi> An extract of which is ſubjoined: <q>Little can be ſaid of him, but what every friend to vital Chriſtianity, who has ſat under his miniſtry, will atteſt. In his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic labours he has for many years aſtoniſhed the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012280_0007_0F8A8A29AD57D190"/>world with his eloquence and devotion. With what divine pathos did he perſuade the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinner to embrace the practice of piety and virtue! Filled with the ſpirit of grace, he ſpoke from the heart, and with fervency of zeal, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps unequalled ſince the days of the apoſtles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned the truths he delivered with the moſt graceful charms of rhetoric and oratory. From the pulpit he was unrivalled in the command of an ever-crowded auditory. Nor was he leſs agreeable and inſtructive in his private converſation: Happy in a remarkable eaſe of addreſs; willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, ſtudious to edify. May the riſing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration catch a ſpark of that flame which ſhone with ſuch diſtinguiſhed luſtre in the ſpirit and practice of this faithful ſervant of the moſt high GOD!</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A more particular, and equally juſt character of him, has appeared in one of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> papers. It may not be diſagreeable to you, to add the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this likewiſe: <q>The character of this tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pious perſon, muſt be deeply impreſt on the heart of every friend of vital religion. In ſpite of a tender and delicate conſtitution, he continued, to the laſt day of his life, preaching with a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and a fervor that ſeemed to exceed the natural ſtrength of the moſt robuſt. Being called to the exerciſe of his function at an age, when moſt young men are only beginning to qualify themſelves for it, he had not time to make a very conſiderable progreſs in the learned languages. But this defect was amply ſupplied, by a lively and fertile genius, by fervent zeal, and by a forcible and moſt perſuaſive delivery. And though in the pulpit he often found it needful, by <hi>the terrors of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012280_0008_0F8A8A2A6405DCE0"/>the Lord to perſuade men,</hi> he had nothing gloom in his nature, being ſingularly cheerful, as well as charitable and tender hearted. He was as read to relieve the bodily as the ſpiritual neceſſities of thoſe that applied to him. It ought alſo to be obſerved, that he conſtantly enforced upon his audience, every duty, particularly induſtry in their ſeveral callings, and obedience to the ſuperiors. He endeavoured, by the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary efforts of preaching in different place and even in the open fields, to rouſe the lower <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of people, from the laſt degree of inattention and ignorance, to a ſenſe of religion. For this and his other labours, the name of <hi>George Whitefield</hi> will long be remembered with eſteem and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That both theſe accounts are juſt and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, will readily be allowed; that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as far as they go. But they go little farther than the <hi>outſide</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his character. They ſhew you the <hi>Preacher,</hi> but not the <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the <hi>Saint</hi> of GOD. May I be permitted to add a little on this head, from perſonal knowledge of near forty years? Indeed, I am thoroughly ſenſible how difficult it is to ſpeak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo delicate a ſubject; what prudence is required to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void both extremes, to ſay neither too little, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> too much? Nay, I know it is impoſſible to ſpeak all, to ſay either leſs or more, without incurring from ſome the former, from others the latter cenſure. Some will ſeriouſly think, that too little is ſaid; and others that it is too much. But without attending to this, I will ſpeak juſt what I know, before Him to whom we are all to give an account.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Mention has already been made of his unp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aralleled <hi>Zeal,</hi> his indefatigable <hi>Activity,</hi> his <hi>Tender</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:012280_0008_0F8A8A2A6405DCE0"/>
               <hi>heartedneſs</hi> to the afflicted, and <hi>Charitableneſs</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the poor. But ſhould we not likewiſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his deep <hi>Gratitude,</hi> to all whom GOD had uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as inſtruments of good to him? Of whom he did not ceaſe to ſpeak in the moſt reſpectful manner, even to his dying day. Should we not mention, that he had an heart ſuſceptible of the moſt gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the moſt tender <hi>Friendſhip?</hi> I have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought, that this, of all others, was the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing part of his character. How few have we known of ſo kind a temper, of ſuch large and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affections? was it not principally by this, that the hearts of others were ſo ſtrangely drawn and knit to him? Can any thing but love beget love? This ſhone in his very countenance, and continually breathed in all his words, whether in public or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. Was it not this, which, quick and penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as lightning, flew from heart to heart? Which gave that life to his Sermons, his Converſations, his Letters? Ye are witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But away with the vile miſconſtruction of men of corrupt minds, who know of no love but what is <hi>Earthly and ſenſual.</hi> Be it remembered, at the ſame time, that he was endued with the moſt nice and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed <hi>modeſty.</hi> His office called him to converſe very frequently and largely, with women as well as men; and thoſe of every age and condition. But his whole behaviour toward them, was a practical momment on that advice of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the elder women as mothers, the younger as ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with all purity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Mean time, how ſuitable to the friendlineſs of his ſpirit, was the <hi>frankneſs</hi> and <hi>openneſs</hi> of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation? Although it was as far removed from rudeneſs on the one hand, as from guile and diſguiſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012280_0009_0F8A8A2B1502C0F0"/>on the other. Was not this frankneſs at once a fruit and a proof of his <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>intrepidity?</hi> Armed with theſe, he feared not the faces of men, but <hi>uſed great plainneſs of ſpeech</hi> to perſons of every rank and condition, high and low, rich and poor: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring only <hi>by manifeſtation of the truth,</hi> to <hi>commend himſelf to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Neither was he afraid of labour or pain, any more than of <hi>what man could do unto him,</hi> being equally
<q>"<hi>Patient</hi> in bearing ill and doing well."</q>
            </p>
            <p>And this appeared in the <hi>readineſs</hi> wherewith has purſued whatever he undertook for his Maſter's ſake. Witneſs one inſtance for all, the <hi>Orphan-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Georgia,</hi> which he began and perfected, in ſpite of all diſcouragements. Indeed, in whatever concerned himſelf, he was pliant and flexible. In this caſe he was <hi>eaſy to be intreated,</hi> eaſy to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commenced or preſuaded. But he was immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the things of GOD, or wherever his conſcience was concerned. None could perſuade, any more than affright him, to vary in the leaſt point from that <hi>integrity,</hi> which was inſeparable from his whole character, and regulated all his words and actions Herein he did
<q>
                  <l>"Stand as an iron pillar ſtrong,</l>
                  <l>"And ſtedfaſt as a wall of braſs."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. If it be required, What was the foundation of this integrity, or of his ſincerity, courage, patience and every other valuable and amiable quality, it is eaſy to give the anſwer. It was not the excellence of his natural temper: Not the ſtrength of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: It was not the force of his education
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012280_0009_0F8A8A2B1502C0F0"/>no, nor the advice of his friends. It was no other than faith in a bleeding LORD; <hi>Faith of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</hi> It was <hi>a lively hope of an inheritance incorruptible, and that fadeth not away.</hi> It was <hi>the love of God ſhed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghoſt, which was given unto him,</hi> filling his ſoul with tender, diſintereſted love to every child of man. From this ſource aroſe that torrent of <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> which frequently bore down all before it: From this, that aſtoniſhing force of <hi>Perſuaſion,</hi> which the moſt hardened ſinners could not reſiſt. This it was, which often made his <hi>head as waters,</hi> and his eyes <hi>a fountain of tears.</hi> This it was which enabled him to pour out his ſoul in <hi>Prayer,</hi> in a manner pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to himſelf, with ſuch fullneſs and eaſe united together, with ſuch ſtrength and variety both of ſentiment and expreſſion.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I may cloſe this head with obſerving, What an honour it pleaſed GOD to put upon his faithful ſervant, by allowing him to declare his everlaſting goſpel in ſo many various countries, to ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of people, and with ſo great an effect on ſo many of their precious ſouls! Have we read or heard of any perſon ſince the apoſtles, who teſtified the goſpel of the grace of GOD, through ſo widely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a ſpace, through ſo large a part of the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table world? Have we read or heard of any perſon, who called ſo many thouſands, ſo many miriads of ſinners to repentance? Above all, have we read or heard of any, who has been a bleſſed inſtrument in his hand of <hi>bringing</hi> ſo many ſinners from <hi>darkneſs to light, and from the power of a ſatan unto God?</hi> It is true, were we to talk thus to the gay world, we ſhould be judged to <hi>ſpeak as barbarians.</hi> But you underſtand the language of the country to which
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012280_0010_0F8A8A2BE558AF28"/>you are going, and whither our dear friend is gone a little before us.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But how ſhall we improve this awful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? This is the <hi>Third</hi> thing which we have to conſider. And the anſwer to this important queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is eaſy; (may GOD write it in all our hearts!) By keeping cloſe to the <hi>grand doctrines</hi> which he delivered: And by drinking into his <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt, let us keep cloſe to the grand ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural doctrines, which he every where delivered. There are many doctrines of a leſs eſſential nature, with regard to which, even the ſincere children of GOD (ſuch is the preſent weakneſs of human un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding!) are and have been divided for many ages. In theſe we may think and let think; we may "agree to diſagree." But mean time let us hold faſt the eſſentials <hi>of the faith, which was once delivered to the ſaints;</hi> and which this champion of GOD ſo ſtrongly inſiſted on, at all times, and in all places.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His fundamental point was, give GOD all the glory of whatever is good in man. And in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſalvation, ſet CHRIST as high, and man as low as poſſible. With this point, he and his friends at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the original <hi>Methodiſts</hi> (ſo called) ſet out. Their grand principal was, there is <hi>no power</hi> (by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) and <hi>no merit</hi> in man. They inſiſted, All pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to think, ſpeak, or act right, is in and from the Spirit of CHRIST; And all merit is (not in man, how high ſoever in grace, but merely) in the blood of CHRIST. So he and they taught: There is no power in man, till it is given from above, to do one good work, to ſpeak one good word, or to form one good deſire. For it is not enough to ſay, all men are <hi>ſick of ſin:</hi> No, we are all <hi>Dead in treſpaſſes and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012280_0010_0F8A8A2BE558AF28"/>ſins.</hi> It follows, that all the children of men are <hi>by nature children of wrath.</hi> We are all <hi>guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> liable to death temporal and eternal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And we are all helpleſs, both with regard to the power and to the guilt of ſin. For <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> None leſs than the Almighty. Who can raiſe thoſe that are <hi>Dead,</hi> ſpiritually dead in ſin? None but He who raiſed us from the duſt of the earth But on what conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will he do this? <hi>Not for works of righteouſneſs that we have done. The dead cannot praiſe thee, O Lord!</hi> Nor do any thing for the ſake of which they ſhould be raiſed to life. Whatever therefore GOD does, he does it merely for the ſake of his well-be-loved Son: <hi>He was wounded for our trangreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities. He himſelf bore all our ſins in his own body upon the tree. He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered for our offences, and roſe again for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> Here then is the ſole <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of every bleſſing we do or can enjoy: In particular of our pardon and acceptance with GOD, of our full and free juſtification. But by what means do we become intereſted in what CHRIST has done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered? <hi>Not by works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt;</hi> but by faith alone. <hi>We conclude,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>that a man is juſtified by faith, without the works of the law.</hi> And <hi>to as many as</hi> thus <hi>receive Him, giveth he power to become the ſons of God: Even to thoſe that believe in his name, who were born, not of the will of man, but of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And <hi>except a man be thus born again, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> But all who are thus <hi>born of the ſpirit,</hi> have <hi>the kingdom of God within</hi> them. Chriſt ſets up his kingdom in their hearts; <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> That <hi>mind
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012280_0011_0F8A8A2CC42222D0"/>is in them, which was in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> enabling them to <hi>walk as Chriſt alſo walked.</hi> His in-dwelling-ſpirit makes them both holy in heart, and <hi>holy in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of converſation.</hi> But ſtill, ſeeing all this is a free gift, through the righteouſneſs and blood of CHRIST, there is eternally the ſame reaſon to remember, <hi>He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. You are not ignorant, that theſe are the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental doctrines which he every where inſiſted on. And may they not be ſummed up, as it were, in two words, <hi>The new birth,</hi> and <hi>juſtification of faith?</hi> Theſe let us inſiſt upon with all boldneſs, at all times, and in all places: In public (thoſe of us who are called thereto) and at all opportunities, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. Keep cloſe to theſe good, old, unfaſhionable doctrines, how many ſoever contradict and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme. Go on, my brethren, in the <hi>name of the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> With all care and deligence, <hi>keep that ſafe that is committed to your truſt:</hi> Knowing that <hi>heaven and earth ſhall paſs away; but</hi> this truth <hi>ſhall not paſs away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. But will it be ſufficient, to keep cloſe to his <hi>Doctrines,</hi> how pure ſoever they are? Is there not a point of ſtill greater importance than this, namely to drink into his <hi>Spirit?</hi> Herein to <hi>be a follower of</hi> him, <hi>even as</hi> he was <hi>of Chriſt?</hi> Without this, the purity of our doctrines, would only increaſe our damnation. This therefore is the principal thing, to copy after his ſpirit. And allowing that in ſome points, we muſt be content, to <hi>admire</hi> what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>imitate;</hi> yet in many others we may, through the ſame free grace, be partakers of the ſame bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Conſcious then of our own wants, and of his bounteous love, who <hi>giveth liberally and upbraideth not,</hi> cry to Him that worketh all in all, for a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012280_0011_0F8A8A2CC42222D0"/>of the ſame precious faith: Of the ſame zeal and activity, the ſame tender-heartedneſs, charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, bowels of mercies. Wreſtle with GOD for ſome degree of the ſame grateful, friendly, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate temper; of the ſame openneſs, ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, <hi>Love without diſſimulation.</hi> Wreſtle on, till the Power from on high works in you the ſame ſteady courage and patience: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, becauſe it is the crown of all, the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable integrity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Is there any other fruit of the grace of GOD, with which he was eminently endowed, and the want of which among the children of GOD he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and paſſionately lamented? There is one, that is, <hi>Catholic love:</hi> That ſincere and tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is due to all thoſe, who, we have reaſon to believe, are children of GOD by faith: In other words, all thoſe in every perſuaſion, who <hi>fear God and work righteouſneſs.</hi> He longed to ſee all who had <hi>taſted the good word,</hi> of a truly <hi>catholic ſpirit,</hi> (a word little underſtood and ſtill leſs experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by many, who have it frequently in their mouth.) Who is he that anſwers this character? Who is a man of a <hi>catholic ſpirit?</hi> One who loves a friend, as brethren in the LORD, as joint partakers of the preſent kingdom of heaven, and fellow-heirs of his eternal kingdom, all of whatever opinion, mode of worſhip, or congregation, who believes in the LORD JESUS; who love GOD and man; who rejoice to pleaſe, and fear to offend GOD, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to abſtain from evil, and zealous of good works. He is a man of truly catholic ſpirit, who bears theſe continually upon his heart: Who having an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tenderneſs for their perſons, and an earneſst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012280_0012_0F8A8A2D60ADAD48"/>of their welfare, does not ceaſe to commend them to GOD in prayer, as well as to plead their cauſe before men: Who ſpeaks comfortably to them, and labours by all his words, to ſtrengthen their hands in GOD. He aſſiſts them to the uttermoſt of his power, in all things, ſpiritual and temporal. He is ready to <hi>ſpend and to be ſpent</hi> for them; yea, to <hi>lay down his life for</hi> his <hi>brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. How amiable a character is this? How deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to every child of GOD! But why is it then ſo rarely found? How is it, that there are ſo few inſtance of it? Indeed, ſuppoſing we have taſted of the love of GOD, how can any of us reſt, till it is our own? Why, there is a delicate device, whereby Satan per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades thouſands, that they may ſtop ſhort of it and yet be guiltleſs. It is well, if many here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are not in this <hi>ſnare of the devil, taken captive at his will.</hi> 
               <q>O yes, ſays one, I have all this love for thoſe I believe to be children of GOD. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </q> So we juſtify ourſelves in one ſin, by adding a ſecond to it. We excuſe the want of love in ourſelves, by laying the blame on others. To colour our own deviliſh temper we pronounce our brethren children of the devil. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
