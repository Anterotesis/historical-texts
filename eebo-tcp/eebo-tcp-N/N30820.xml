            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>hereas</hi> this Province was firſt ſettled by, and a Majority of the Aſſemblies have ever ſince been of, the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who, though they do not, as the World is now circumſtanced, condemn the Uſe of Arms in others, yet are principled againſt bearing Arms themſelves; and to make any Law to compel them thereto, againſt their Conſciences, would not only be to violate a Fundamental in our Conſtitution, and be a direct Breach of our Charter of Privileges, but would alſo, in Effect, be to commence Perſecution againſt all that Part of the Inhabitants of the Province; and for them, by any Law, to compel others to bear Arms, and exempt themſelves, would be inconſiſtent and partial; yet, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as by the general Toleration, and Equity of our Laws, great Numbers of People of other religious Denominations are come among us, who are under no ſuch Reſtraint, ſome of whom have been diſciplined in the Art of War, and conſcientiouſly think it their Duty to fight in Defence of their Country, their Wives, their Families, and Eſtates; and ſuch have an equal Right to Liberty of Conſcience with others;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas</hi> a great Number of Petitions from the ſeveral Counties of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince have been preſented to this Houſe, ſetting forth, That the Petitioners are very willing to defend themſelves and their Country, and deſirous of being formed into regular Bodies for that Purpoſe, inſtructed and diſciplined under proper Officers with ſuitable and legal Authority; repreſenting withal, that unleſs Meaſures of this kind are taken, ſo as to unite them together, ſubject them to due Command, and thereby give them Confidence in each other, they cannot aſſemble to oppoſe the Enemy, without the utmoſt Danger of expoſing themſelves to Confuſion and Deſtruction:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas</hi> the voluntary aſſembling of great Bodies of armed Men, from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts of this Province, on any occaſional Alarm, whether true or falſe, as of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:040861_0002_101910F596C19790"/>late hath happened, without Call or Authority from the Government, and without due Order and Direction among themſelves, may be attended with Danger to our neighbouring <hi>Indian</hi> Friends and Allies, as well as to the internal Peace of the Province:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas</hi> the Governor hath frequently recommended it to the Aſſembly, that, in preparing and paſſing a Law for ſuch Purpoſes, they ſhould have a due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſcrupulous and tender Conſciences; which cannot be done where compulſive Means are uſed to force Men into military Service:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore,</hi> as we repreſent all the People of the Province, and are compoſed of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of different religious Perſuaſions, we do not think it reaſonable that any ſhould, thro' a Want of legal Powers, be in the leaſt reſtrained from doing what they judge it their Duty to do for their own Security, and the Publick Good; We, in Compliance with the ſaid Petitions and Recommendations, do offer it to the Governor to be <hi>Enacted; And be it Enacted</hi> by the Honourable <hi>Robert Hunter Morris,</hi> Eſquire, with the KING's Royal Approbation, Lieutenant-Governor under the Honourable <hi>Thomas Penn</hi> and <hi>Richard Penn,</hi> Eſquires, true and abſolute Proprietors of the Province of <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and of the Counties of <hi>Newcaſtle, Kent,</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> upon <hi>Delaware,</hi> by and with the Advice and Conſent of the Repreſentatives of the Freemen of the ſaid Province, in General Aſſembly met, and by the Authority of the ſame, That, from and after the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Act, it ſhall and may be lawful for the Freemen of this Province to form themſelves into Companies, as heretofore they have uſed in Time of War without Law; and for each Company, by Majority of Votes, in the Way of Ballot, to chuſe its own Officers; to wit, a Captain, Lieutenant, and Enſign, and preſent them to the Governor or Commander in Chief, for the Time being, for his Approbation; which Officers ſo choſen, if approved and commiſſioned by him, ſhall be the Captain, Lieutenant, and Enſign, of each Company reſpectively, according to their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and the ſaid Companies being divided into Regiments by the Governor or Commander in Chief, it ſhall and may be lawful for the Officers ſo choſen and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned for the ſeveral Companies of each Regiment to meet together, and, by Majority of Votes, in the Way of Ballot, to chuſe a Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, and Major, for the Regiment, and preſent them to the Governor or Commander in Chief, for his Approbation; which Officers ſo choſen, if approved and commiſſioned by him, ſhall be the Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, and Major, of the Regiment, according to their Commiſſions, during the Continuance of this Act.</p>
            <p>
