            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE obſervations contained in the following pages, were made during the time that I lived in Jamaica, or while I attended ſome part of the army in America. The materials were collected between the years 1774 and 1782; and the preſent performance would have been offered to the public before this time, had I ſooner ſound leiſure to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the buſineſs of publication. The inſufficiency of Dr. Hillary's work, the moſt eſteemed book on the diſeaſes of the Weſt Indies, and the only one with
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:028890_0004_0FDE67838770BD48"/>
which I was acquainted while I remained in that country, furniſhed me with a motive for the undertaking; a motive, which may be thought, perhaps, no longer to exiſt, as two treatiſes have been publiſhed lately by Dr. Hunter and Dr. Moſeley, expreſsly on the diſeaſes of which I have written. I might remark, that the preſent attempt, ſuch as it is, was nearly completed before the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes to which I allude came to my hands. The views which they afford of fevers, as they differ from each other, ſo they likewiſe differ from thoſe which I have ventured to advance. I have weighed their merits maturely, and cannot ſay that I diſcover any information, which gives me cauſe to change thoſe opinions which I had formed, or which renders the publication of the preſent work
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:028890_0005_0FDE678505FD8DD8"/>
unneceſſary. I may obſerve, that Dr. Hunter details, with candour and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity, the mode of practice, which was followed by the moſt reſpectable medical people of Jamaica, at the time that I lived in the iſland. He perhaps preſcribes the bark in larger quantities, than was then cuſtomary; but I do not perceive any thing in the plan of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſſentially new; neither will Dr. Moſeley, though he purſues innovation with great eagerneſs, be better able to eſtabliſh his claim to original diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The plentiful and long continued purging, on which he places a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſhare of his merit, has been a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite practice with numbers for many years paſt; and the free uſe of the lancet, which he recommends ſo much in fevers, was employed in ſeveral diſtricts of
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:028890_0006_0FDE678687430A10"/>
Jamaica, before this author's name was known. Dr. Spence, a practitioner of ſome eminence at Lucea, in the Weſtern extremity of the iſland, wrote a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet (I believe in the year 1776) with a view to enforce its ſafety and utility, in promoting the cure of the general claſs of febrile diſeaſes. The publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was well received, and ſerved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the dread of the lancet, which ſome people till then had falſely entertained.</p>
            <p>I have thus explained the motive which induced me to write; and I leave it to people of experience to judge of the manner in which I have executed the taſk. I ſhall only obſerve, that, when I firſt intended to prepare my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the inſpection of the public, I had no other deſign than to mention
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:028890_0007_0FDE678F86E03D18"/>
ſuch circumſtances in the hiſtory and cure of fevers, as did not appear to be generally known. Having ſpent the earlier part of my life in ſituations, which did not admit of a continued plan of ſtudy, I had not till lately much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the opinions of medical writers. About four years ago, when I found a ſettled abode, I began occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally to look into the works of the ancient phyſicians. In examining Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, I diſcovered ſuch a ſimilarity in the fevers of the Archipelago, with thoſe of Jamaica, that I ſuſpended my deſign of publiſhing, till I ſhould have given that author's writings a careful peruſal. I ſoon was convinced that many obſervations, which I had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as my own, were actually known to this father of phyſic; and though I
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:028890_0008_0FDE6791726ACCA0"/>
was probably diſappointed in being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated in offering ſomething new to the public, I was ſtill gratified by the coincidence of remark, that gave me a confidence in my accuracy which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I durſt not have aſſumed. After I had carefully peruſed the writings of Hippocrates, I conſulted and compared ſuch other of the Greek phyſicians, as I was able to procure. I even deſcended with a ſimilar examination to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times; but as my collection of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical writers, particularly of modern ones, is ſmall, I have probably omitted ſome who ought to have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or perhaps advanced obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as my own, which in reality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to others. If I have done ſo, I muſt be allowed to ſay, that I have done it without conſciouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="unknown:028890_0009_0FDE679287B7A1B8"/>
It may appear, perhaps, that I have treated the opinions of great names with too little reſpect; but if facts have at any time occurred to me, which contradict eſtabliſhed theories, I ſhould hope that theſe facts will be examined before they are rejected. No medical authority ought to prevail over the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain evidence of truth. I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of having miſrepreſented, for the ſake of a theory, the minuteſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what I have actually ſeen;—if I have been miſtaken in any inſtance in forming concluſions, I ſhall receive the correction of my inaccuracies with gratitude.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. OF THE GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE REMIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TING FEVER OF JAMAICA.</head>
            <p>AS it is perfectly well known, that fevers, which are eſſentially in themſelves the ſame diſeaſe, vary in their appearances, from difference of climate and ſeaſon, it would be very ſuperfluous to attempt any proof of what is ſo generally acknowledged. Even Hippocrates, who lived more than two thouſand years ago, does not ſeem to have been unacquainted with this fact. This induſtrious phyſician, as we learn from many paſſages in his works, not only viſited the various iſlands in the AEgean Sea; but travelled like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe into various parts of the adjacent continents. The motive of his journeys, we are taught to believe, was principally to obſerve the different ſituation of places, and to mark their correſponding diſeaſes. He has deſcribed very fully, in a curious and uſeful treatiſe, the effects of air and local ſituation on the human frame; and in the hiſtory of fevers, related in the books of Epidemics, has ſeldom forgotten to mention, not only the general conſtitution of the ſeaſons with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to diſeaſes; but likewiſe the nature of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, where his obſervations were more particularly made. The ſpecies of fevers, it is true, that are found in the writings of Hippocrates are extremely multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; yet this author ſeems ſtill to have been clearly of opinion, that diſeaſes, which are eſſentially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he ſame, aſſume, in ſome reſpects, a different appearance in the iſland of Thaſus, and at Abdera, on the contiguous
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:028890_0011_0FDE679AC5EB51E0"/>
coaſt of Thrace. Obſervations to the ſame effect have been made by many others in different parts of the world; nor is the fact capable of being better il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated in any country than in Jamaica; where a very ſmall change of place, or the ordinary revolution of ſeaſons, are often obſerved to influence in a high degree, the appearances of the common endemic of that iſland. But this obſervation,—that local ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the change of ſeaſons, are the cauſe of varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the appearances of the ſame diſeaſe, has been ſo long known, that it is almoſt unneceſſary to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it; nor would it have been repeated now; unleſs to obviate any objections which might be made to the hiſtory, that is given in the following pages, ſhould it not be found exactly to correſpond, with that which has been obſerved by others, who have lived in the other iſlands of the Weſt Indies, or in other parts of Jamaica; or perhaps even in the ſame part of Jamaica, at a different period of time. It is preſumed, indeed, that the ſame fundamental diſtinctions of fever obtain in every iſland within the tropics; yet the deſcription that is given in this place, (it may not be unneceſſary to mention), is affirmed to be ſtrictly exact, only in the diſtrict about Savanna la Mar; and that only for a ſhort ſpace of time: <abbr>viz.</abbr> from the year 1774 to the year 1778.</p>
            <p>The fever, that chiefly prevailed at Savanna la Mar during the period mentioned above, was uſually mild in its ſymptoms, and more regularly remitting in its form than I underſtood the endemic diſeaſe to be in moſt other parts of the iſland. To what cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the local ſituation this might be owing, I do not pretend to determine. Savanna la Mar is ſituated cloſe by the ſea: its particular ſcite, and the ſurrounding country to the diſtance of ſeveral miles is perfectly level; whilſt in conſequence of its being open to the ſea on the eaſt, it is viſited early, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly by a ſalutary and refreſhing breeze. There
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:028890_0012_0FDE679C96984188"/>
is a ſmall rivulet, indeed, which, loſing itſelf almoſt entirely in mud, forms a moraſs that partly ſurrounds it on the north. From vicinity to this moraſs the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Savanna la Mar has been ſuſpected to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy; but it is not ſo in fact. The ſea at high wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, particularly in the ſpring tides, overflowing the ſwampy ground, contributes in a great meaſure, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to diminiſh the more uſual noxious qualities of the marſh exhalation. The opinion of many eminent writers, however, is not altogether favourable to this idea; but there ſeems to be reaſon to doubt, whether the opinion formed by thoſe writers in this inſtance, is the reſult of accurate and careful obſervation; or if it is merely a ſuggeſtion of theory. I am inclined to the latter way of thinking, as I have never found the neighbourhood of Salt-marſhes, in the different parts of America that I have had the opportunity of viſiting, leſs healthful than the reſt of the country:—on the contrary, they were frequently more ſo.</p>
            <p>Before proceeding to a particular deſcription of the fever, that chiefly prevailed in the diſtrict of Savanna la Mar, it may not be ſuperfluous to give the outline of its character, that we may be the better enabled to trace its reſemblance with the fevers of other climates, and to determine its place in the general claſs of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile diſeaſes. The common fever of Savanna la Mar, which, as I mentioned before, was uſually mild in its ſymptoms, and regular in its form, ſeems to be properly ranked with thoſe, that ſtrictly ſpeaking are called remitting. It is difficult to fix the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries between remittents and intermittents, if a fixed boundary actually exiſts. The paroxyſms of the fever of Jamaica are obſerved, in many inſtances, to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in more perfect remiſſions than the paroxyſms of the endemic of North America, which is known to be fundamentally an intermitting diſeaſe. Hence au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors generally are of opinion, that all the difference which appears to take place in thoſe fevers, depends
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028890_0013_0FDE679E0D3E6568"/>
merely on an accidental cauſe: <abbr>viz.</abbr> on the greater or leſs heat of the climate. I ſhall not be poſitive that it is not ſo; yet I cannot help remarking that certain appearances incline me to be of opinion, that there ſubſiſts, between the endemic of Jamaica and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic of North America, a difference, in ſome degree, fixed and eſſential. I cannot pretend to aſcertain the difference preciſely; or to offer a conjecture about the modification of the morbid cauſe in which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts; yet the following circumſtances give reaſon to believe, that to a certain degree at leaſt it actually takes place. The common fever of Jamaica, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, was not only diſpoſed to terminate of its own accord; but it was diſpoſed to terminate on certain critical days, often at an early period, and by ſigns of criſis too clear to be miſtaken; neither did the Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian bark, in the manner at leaſt in which it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, ever cut ſhort its courſe with certainty. The endemic of America on the contrary often laſted long. It frequently, indeed, changed to another diſeaſe after a length of time; but no period could be aſſigned for its natural termination. The ſigns of criſis, it may likewiſe be remarked were ſo obſcure as ſcarcely to be diſtinguiſhed with the cloſeſt attention; at leaſt for my own part I will own, that after an experience of ſeveral years, and the greateſt care in obſerving the minuteſt circumſtances, I never yet was able to ſay with confidence, that the endemic of America, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the northern provinces, was gone not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again, till the hour of its return was paſt: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Peruvian bark, though its effects were ſo equivocal in the fever of Jamaica, ſcarcely ever fail of ſtopping the progreſs of this diſeaſe. To which we may add, that the complaint, which ſtrictly ſpeaking is called the intermittent, or ague and fever, can ſcarcely be ſaid to belong to Jamaica; at leaſt it was not known at Savanna la Mar. In the courſe of four years I did not once obſerve it; and thoſe, who had lived much longer at this place, aſſured
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028890_0014_0FDE67A70E5B52D0"/>
me they had never ſeen an inſtance of it; unleſs in perſons who were newly arrived from aguiſh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. This is a fact of ſome importance, as it ſhews to us, that though the proper intermittent is not the endemic diſeaſe of the country it is ſtill capable of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting in the climate:—no weak argument, that, the two diſeaſes of which we have been ſpeaking, actually do poſſeſs ſome difference in the modification of the general cauſe, though we are unable to define the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe bounds and limits of it.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances which I have mentioned might incline us to be of opinion, that the fever of Jamaica, and the common endemic of America are not exactly the ſame diſeaſe; that is, that though they depend on the ſame general cauſe; yet that this cauſe undergoes ſome fixed and permanent modification in thoſe different climates, ſo that an eſſential difference actually ariſes. But though this really appears to be the caſe; yet I muſt acknowledge, that the reigning epidemic of the ſouthern provinces of America, often loſes its diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive marks of intermiſſion in the hot months of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; whilſt it approaches, in other reſpects, ſo near to the fever of Jamaica, as to be diſtinguiſhed from it with difficulty. This was particularly the caſe at Eben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>er in Georgia, in the year 1779, during the months of June and July. A cold fit was ſeldom obſerved in this place; unleſs perhaps in the firſt attack; lowneſs, languor, head-ach, pain of the back and other diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able feelings remained even in the moſt perfect remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: the diſeaſe was likewiſe much diſpoſed to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of its own accord: on the uſual critical days, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by ſigns of criſis, that were far from being obſcure: yet though theſe reſemblances were ſo very ſtriking, the fever of Ebenezer was perfectly under the controul of Peruvian bark, which was not exactly the caſe with that of Jamaica. I muſt remark, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that bark was uſed with a freedom in America, that I never thought of attempting in the Weſt Indies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028890_0015_0FDE67A846269D90"/>
But though it ſtill may be thought doubtful by ſome, whether the autumnal fever of aguiſh countries, and the endemic fever of Jamaica are characteriſtically different, or eſſentially the ſame diſeaſe; yet it is not ſo difficult to trace a ſpecific reſemblance, between this fever of the Weſt Indies, and the prevailing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic of the AEgean Sea. The fever deſcribed in the Epidemics of Hippocrates has every ſtriking feature of the diſeaſe which is the ſubject of the following treatiſe. The general character is the ſame; the courſe and mode of termination are often alike. If the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is ſometimes different, it is probably much ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the more deciſive practice of the moderns: for though it remains uncertain, whether a remedy has yet been diſcovered, which abſolutely cuts ſhort the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Jamaica in the midſt of its courſe; yet no doubt remains, that there are various modes of treatment, which may, and actually do render the ordinary changes of the critical day, decidedly critical. The fevers of the AEgean Sea, as deſcribed by Hippocrates, and of Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

But that I may not be thought to inſiſt too much on this opinion, which few, perhaps, may conſider as of much conſequence, I ſhall relate the hiſtory of the fever of Savanna la Mar, as accurately as I can, leaving it to others to determine, whether it ſhould be conſidered as an intermittent degenerated into a remitting form, in conſequence of the greater heat of the climate, or allowed to poſſeſs ſomething characteriſtic in its own nature.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERIODICAL FE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERS.</head>
            <p>A Knowledge of the types and periods of fevers, though ſo neceſſary to be well underſtood by thoſe who pretend to cure the diſeaſe, has unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately been little attended to by the practitioners of Jamaica, In that country, I met with ſome who were able to foretel the returns of the ſingle tertian; but I met with none, and I have good reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there actually were few, who troubled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about forms of greater complication. There were many, on the contrary, who, blinded by theories of accumulated bile, ridiculed altogether the idea of this ſtated regularity in the movements of nature. To enter into a diſpute with ſuch would be labour loſt. The exiſtence of a regular type in the fevers of the Weſt Indies does not admit of a doubt, yet we muſt not forget to mention, that thoſe types are traced with greater difficulty in that country, where remiſſions are obſcure, than in others, where every paroxyſm is uſhered in by a cold fit. In Jamaica it is impoſſible to follow them without the moſt careful attention, or perhaps to attain a clear and ſyſtematic knowledge of them, without writing down and analyzing many of thoſe caſes which occur in practice. I remember to have been impreſſed with the idea, at a very early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, that one obſervation made by myſelf would in reality be more uſeful than twenty equally important in themſelves, which I only retained in my memory from reading. Convinced of this truth I ceaſed to look for information in books, from the time that I arrived in the Weſt Indies; but, truſting wholly to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028890_0017_0FDE67AB50405EB0"/>
my own experience, wrote down minutely, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſick, the hiſtory and cure of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant caſes of fever that occured to me. At ſtated times I reviewed that which I had done, and arranged under proper heads the moſt ſtriking circumſtances, that I found recorded in my notes. Among other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected appearances I obſerved a regularity and order in the types of fevers, of which at firſt I had no idea. But though the laws of nature appeared to be fixed and ſtable, in producing this varied but ſtated regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of form; yet a knowledge of thoſe laws was not eaſily attained. Two years were ſpent, and not fewer than a hundred caſes were analyzed, before my views of the ſubject were in any degree accurate. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, perhaps, was ſuperfluous; there being many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors who have deſcribed minutely every variety and every combination of type that has ever been obſerved to take place. But as I had little knowledge of the writings of others at this period, I ſhall content my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the firſt place with relating the hiſtory of types as they occurred to my own obſervation; at the ſame time that I ſhall not omit to take notice occaſionally of the more conſtant peculiarities, which are found in authors of credit, who have practiſed in different countries. The influence of climate I may obſerve is of conſiderable effect in modifying the various forms.</p>
            <p>The ſingle tertian, the period of which is forty-eight hours, is a form of fever that occurred frequently in Jamaica, particularly in the dry and healthy ſeaſon. Its courſe was eaſily traced, as the remiſſions were often diſtinct, and the acceſſions ſometimes diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſlight horror or ſhivering.</p>
            <p>But though the above-mentioned type was by no means of rare occurrence at Savanna la Mar; yet the double tertian, with ſimilar paroxyſms on alternate days, was ſtill more common, particularly in the rainy and ſickly months. This form of fever, which ſeemed to conſiſt of two ſingle tertians, that ran a ſeparate
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028890_0018_0FDE67B4D587B800"/>
and independent courſe, began uſually in the morning. Its hour of invaſion was from eight to ten; and its acceſſion was generally diſtinguiſhed by a cold fit. The paroxyſm, which for the moſt part was regularly formed, declined after a continuance of eight or ten hours; and the patient remained free from fever, not only during the night, but during the following day, till four in the afternoon, or later. A feveriſh indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition uſually came on then, which continued the whole or the greateſt part of the night. A remiſſion took place; but it was ſoon ſucceeded by a paroxyſm ſimilar in its ſymptoms, and manner of attack, to the paroxyſm of the firſt day. This having declined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evening, the patient, as formerly, was free from fever during the night and the day following. At the uſual hour, however, or more generally before it, a paroxyſm more diſtinctly formed in all its parts, and more violent in degree, than the preceding one which correſponded with it, returned, and continued till morning. It ſubſided; and was ſoon ſucceeded by the paroxyſm of the fifth day, which declined, as formerly, after the uſual duration. Such was the general courſe and progreſs of the diſeaſe.—The fever of the odd day, which began for the moſt part in the morning, uſually returned later and later, and with decreaſing violence every ſucceeding paroxyſm; whilſt the fever of the even day, which generally began in the afternoon or evening, as uſually returned earlier, and when this was the caſe, frequently encreaſed in force. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which came on in the morning generally began the diſeaſe. It was for the moſt part a fever of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete and regular paroxyſms from the firſt attack. The fever of the evening, on the contrary, was little more than an indiſpoſition in its beginning; nor was its time of appearing at all certain. It often was not perceived till the evening of the fourth day; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not till later, neither was its continuance of a fixed duration. Sometimes it went on after the fever
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028890_0019_0FDE67B5C5C3A988"/>
of the morning had ceaſed; and in other caſes it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, while the other purſued an uninterrupted courſe.</p>
            <p>The type, which was ſo frequent in Thaſus, and the other iſlands of the AEgean Sea, ſeems to be a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the double tertian. Mention is made frequently of ſuch a form in the Epidemics of Hippocrates; yet the double tertian of Hippocrates is directly oppoſite, in ſome reſpects, to the type which I have juſt now deſcribed.—The evening fever generally began the diſeaſe in thoſe iſlands: hence the great exacerbations, and conſequently the criſis were frequently on the even days. Such alſo appears to have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the caſe in Minorca: yet Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ghorn acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that a type, ſimilar to that which I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as prevailing ſo commonly at Savanna la Mar, was by much the moſt frequent form of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned iſland. It was alſo, I may add, frequent in the ſouthern provinces of North America, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the hot months of ſummer and autumn.</p>
            <p>A quotidian type has been deſcribed by almoſt every author, who has written on the ſubject of intermitting and remitting fevers: neither can it be denied, that forms of diſeaſe frequently occur, where the paroxyſm returns every day at the ſame hour, with ſymptoms ſo nearly alike, that an ordinary obſerver can perceive no difference. Yet Mr. Senac, an author of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable eminence, boldly maintains, that a real quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian type does not exiſt in nature. The queſtion, perhaps, is not eaſily determined. I can only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from my own experience, that I have frequently ſeen fevers with quotidian exacerbations of ſuch a kind, that there was no perceivable difference between them, either in ſymptoms or in manner of attack; yet I muſt likewiſe own, that theſe exacerbations were generally in the evenings; and that the diſeaſe was not in every reſpect of a diſtinct intermitting form.</p>
            <p>I have now mentioned thoſe types that are moſt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028890_0020_0FDE67B79AEF2C10"/>
frequently met with in the fevers of Jamaica; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, there now and then occur others of more complicated and perplexing forms. Thus, I have ſometimes ſeen at Savanna la Mar, a fever, which ſeemed to be compounded of a ſingle tertian with a quotidian. In the ſpace of forty-eight hours there were three ſeparate exacerbations, two of which were exactly alike, that it was impoſſible to perceive a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; whilſt the whole three followed each other in ſuch an order of time, that to a ſuperficial obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there appeared to be only one long paroxyſm of thirty-ſix hours or more. An example will make it more plain. On Monday, for inſtance, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm of a fever was obſerved to begin about nine in the morning, preceded by ſome degree of coldneſs and ſhivering. This paroxyſm was uſually violent in its firſt attack: But declined gradually towards evening; though before it was gone off totally, another exacerbation commenced, which continued the whole of the night. This likewiſe abated on Tueſday morning; and the patient remained ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently free from fever till five in the afternoon or later. A paroxyſm then made its appearance, ſimilar to the paroxyſm of the preceding evening. It ran over a courſe of ſimilar duration, and ſcarcely had abated on Wedneſday morning, when a paroxyſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that of Monday ſucceeded it; which, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, declining towards evening, was ſoon followed by an exacerbation, that laſted till the morning of Thurſday. On Thurſday, as on Tueſday, there was no fever till late in the afternoon; when the evening exacerbation returning at the uſual hour, proceeded in its uſual courſe.</p>
            <p>The tertian type, ſimple, or variouſly compounded, is the form of fever, which prevails moſt univerſally in all climates. The quartan in thoſe countries were I have lived was rare; and the exiſtence of a real quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian, perhaps, is doubtful. To that compound form,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028890_0021_0FDE67B8C6077118"/>
which I have juſt now deſcribed, I ſhould be inclined to give the name of Semitertian. It is expreſsly the diſeaſe, which I now find has been deſcribed under this name by Hoffman; but it is more difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine exactly, if it is the Hemitritaeus of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. The Hemitritaean form is frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Hippocrates; but his definition is too lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe to enable us to judge preciſely of its nature. It is in fact impoſſible to ſay with certainty, whether it is to a type ſimilar to that which I have deſcribed, or to the extended and ſubintrant paroxyſms of the double ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, that he has applied the name. This laſt, indeed, ſeems to have been the idea of many of the ancients, particularly of Celſus and Agathinus.—The phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of the earlier ages, were leſs curious in minute diſtinctions than their followers; and probably applied the name of Hemitritaeus to thoſe fevers, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms of which were ſimply of unuſual duration, no leſs than to thoſe that were of a complicated or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound nature. This actually appears to have been the caſe for a great length of time; but at laſt, and not long indeed before the days of Galen, the ſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical genius of the profeſſors of medicine, which exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf chiefly in things of little importance, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied the types of fevers to an endleſs variety, and attempted to eſtabliſh diſtinctions which have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence in reality. Galen, who is copious in moſt things, has diſcuſſed very fully the ſubject of types in general, and deſcribed particularly the nature of the Semitertian at great length. But whatever credit may be otherwiſe due to the obſervations of this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious writer, it is evident that the deſcription, in the preſent inſtance, is merely the reſult of theory. He has attempted, indeed, to illuſtrate his opinion by an example; but the caſe he has furniſhed us with, is conſtantly varying its hour of attack; and if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately examined, appears rather to be a triple tertian, properly ſo called, than the form of fever that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028890_0022_0FDE67C1DD83E498"/>
I have deſcribed above. After the Greeks we may next take a ſhort view of the Arabian phyſicians, who, as they borrowed much of their knowledge from the writings of Galen, likewiſe adopted his idea of the compound nature of the Semitertian. Avicenna, the moſt eminent among them, has defined this form of diſeaſe with a good deal of preciſion; but we do not find that he has added any thing very material to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of his predeceſſors. Galen indeed, had diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſubject ſo fully, that, though ſucceeding wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſometimes changed names, they do not ſeem in reality to have furniſhed much new obſervation. As we deſcend to leſs remote times, Hoffman and Cleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn are the moſt accurate of the moderns, on this ſubject, who have yet come to my hands. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer deſcribes under the name of Semitertian the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs form of diſeaſe, that I met with in Jamaica; the latter refers this title to the extended and ſubintrant paroxyſms of the double tertian. It is with unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that I differ in opinion from Cleghorn, who has thrown more light on the hiſtory of periodical fevers, than perhaps, all the writers of his time: yet I cannot help obſerving, that I never recollect to have met with an original Semitertian, ſuch as that he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in his well-known treatiſe. I muſt own, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that I have ſeveral times ſeen the morning fever of the double tertian anticipate, ſo as to be mixed with the decline of the paroxyſm of the preceding evening; thereby producing a form of diſeaſe, that could only be diſtinguiſhed, by the moſt careful attention, from one long paroxyſm of thirty hours or more: yet this was in fact, only a degenerated double tertian, the paroxyſms of which became accidentally mixed with each other.</p>
            <p>The types which I have deſcribed above are all the varieties, that I obſerved in the fevers of the Weſt Indies; yet more extenſive experience might have, perhaps, brought to my knowledge ſtill further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications:
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028890_0023_0FDE67C28563A380"/>
for beſides the forms mentioned in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding pages, I had the opportunity, in the ſouthern provinces of North America, to ſee ſeveral inſtances of the triple tertian, properly ſo called. In forty-eight hours there were three ſeparate paroxyſms; all of them differing from each other, but correſponding with others that followed.—They were eaſily traced, as the acceſſions in that climate were uſually diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by a cold fit. In Jamaica, on the contrary, complications and irregularities were marked with difficulty. The anticipation of type among other things occaſioned conſiderable perplexity. Thus the ſingle tertian, whoſe regular period is forty-eight hours, often completed its revolutions in forty-ſix. But though the paroxyſms frequently returned one hour or even two hours ſooner than the uſual time; yet theſe anticipations were ſeldom longer, unleſs the diſeaſe was of a malignant nature, or diſpoſed to change to a continued form. In either of theſe caſes anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of twelve or fourteen hours were not uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Of the different forms of fever the anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſingle tertian were the longeſt and moſt remarkable. It was obſerved, indeed, that the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paroxyſm of the double tertian very generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned before the uſual hour; yet this return was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom more than an hour at once; nor did the time of invaſion in the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, ſo far as I have obſerved, ever go beyond twelve at noon. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> morning paroxyſm, on the contrary, frequently poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned; yet I have likewiſe obſerved it ſometimes to anticipate ſix or eight hours at one time; by which means, it encroached on the paroxyſm of the preceding evening, and produced the diſeaſe which Cleghorn has diſtinguiſhed by the name of Semitertian. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of this fact does not ſeem to have eſcaped Avicenna.</p>
            <p>There undoubtedly are accidental circumſtances, which have ſome effect in accelerating or retarding
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028890_0024_0FDE67C404E981E0"/>
the return of the paroxyſm for a ſhort ſpace of time; yet it would appear, upon the whole, that the cauſe, why a fever anticipates or poſtpones, depends upon ſomething that is peculiar to the particular nature of the diſeaſe. Thus, a fever, which once begins to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate, generally goes on anticipating through a great part of its courſe; a certain proportion being frequently preſerved between the anticipations of the different paroxyſms. This was particularly the caſe in the ſingle tertian of America. The paroxyſms of the fevers of that country often anticipated to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain point, by ſhort anticipations, which bore a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular proportion to each other; whilſt they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times likewiſe obſerved to poſtpone, in the ſame gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual manner, towards the termination. This ſeldom happened in the fevers of the Weſt Indies.</p>
            <p>The anticipations I have mentioned often occaſion perplexity in tracing the types of fevers; yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications which ariſe in the progreſs of the diſeaſe, have a ſtill more conſiderable effect in embarraſſing the appearances of regularity. Fevers which begin as ſingle tertian, often continue ſuch through the whole of their courſe; yet it ſometimes likewiſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that complicating fevers make their appearance on the even days for inſtance, and continue longer, or terminate ſooner than the original complaint, in ſuch manner, as if their exiſtence no way depended on it. To be able to diſtinguiſh thoſe complications from the anticipations of a ſingle type is frequently very uſeful, and a knowledge of it may, in general, be attained with a good deal of certainty. Thus for inſtance, if the diſeaſe is moderate in its ſymptoms, and without ſuſpicion of malignity, the appearance of a paroxyſm twelve or fourteen hours before the uſual time, eſpecially if there is no material difference in the nature of the ſymptoms, gives reaſon to ſuſpect that the premature return is in reality the complication of another fever. On the contrary, where the diſeaſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028890_0025_0FDE67C586D4AC28"/>
has betrayed ſigns of malignity, or where the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms differ from thoſe of the former paroxyſms only in a greater degree of violence, there is then reaſon to apprehend that this appearance is only an anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. On the ſubject of complication of type, ſome curious obſervations may be found in the writings of Galen and Avicenna. The opinions of thoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, indeed, are often mixed with whimſical theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; yet in many reſpects they are fundamentally true and highly intereſting.</p>
            <p>It would be a matter of ſome utility could we learn to foretel, from the nature of the types, the accidents that are likely to happen in the progreſs of the diſeaſe, or to form a probable conjecture of the event. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certainly may be gained if we obſerve with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Thus I may remark, that I never found an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipations of one hour or even two to be of much conſequence in the fevers of Jamaica, particularly if they happened at an early period; yet if they were longer, or did not happen till after a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the diſeaſe, they often indicated an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing criſis. On the contrary, where the paroxyſm an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated twelve or fourteen hours at one time, there was always ſuſpicion of danger, at whatever period this might happen. It either indicated danger and malignity, or a diſpoſition in the fever to change to a continued form. Anticipating fevers were likewiſe obſerved to be more diſpoſed to terminate of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and likewiſe to terminate more ſpeedily, than thoſe which ſteadily preſerved the ſame hour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. This ſeems to have been known to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients.—But farther, as anticipating types are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a ſign of increaſing violence, though of a more ſpeedy termination; ſo the poſtponing of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm, has uſually been allowed to indicate a diſeaſe, whoſe violence has begun to decline. Such is the common obſervation; nor have I ever found it to be otherwiſe; unleſs in ſome caſes of weakneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028890_0026_0FDE67CEC00061A8"/>
ſenſibility, where the fatal paroxyſm did not come on till after the uſual hour of attack.</p>
            <p>I am afraid I may appear to many as unneceſſarily minute, on a ſubject, which is not in general conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as of much importance; yet ſtill I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to mention ſome circumſtances of connection, between the hour of invaſion and the future type of the fever, which appear to be not only curious, but uſeful; and which, ſo far as I know, have not been taken notice of by any preceding writer. Galen, it is true, boaſts the knowledge of foretelling, from the appearance of the firſt paroxyſm, the nature of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture type of the diſeaſe; yet the hour of invaſion is not included among the number of thoſe ſigns, from which he has drawn his information. The rules, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which he has left us are not altogether without foundation; yet they are by no means to be depended on alone. They have, in fact, ariſen from theories of bile and phlegm, rather than from accurate and careful obſervation. There is not, perhaps, any one crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion on this ſubjuct that applies equally in every cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. Thoſe rules, which I thought I had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, are only local. They varied in the different parts of Jamaica, and in moſt parts of America did not apply in any degree. Having adopted, on my arrival in the Weſt Indies, the method of writing down and analyzing ſuch caſes of fever as came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my care, the difference of hour, at which fevers of a different type uſually commenced, ſtruck me as a matter of no ſmall curioſity. The ſingle tertian, for inſtance, was conſtantly remarked to begin in the forenoon, uſually between the hours of eight and eleven; whilſt thoſe forms of diſeaſe, that were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently quotidian, or ſtill more continued as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly began in the evening, generally from four to eight. This ſeemed to be a fixed diſtinction; it is an important one; and ſo far there was no ambiguity: but it was extremely difficult, perhaps impoſſible, to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028890_0027_0FDE67D02C3736C0"/>
diſcover ſigns at an early period, which were capable of diſtinguiſhing the fever, which continued ſimple in its form throughout, or which became complicated at a certain period of its courſe. I have often made a fortunate conjecture; but I believe it would occaſion embarraſſment, rather than afford information, were I to attempt to deſcribe thoſe circumſtances, which ſometimes determined my opinion. They muſt, in fact, be learnt from actual obſervation. I have juſt now mentioned, that it is extremely difficult to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the ſingle from the double tertian, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of the firſt paroxyſm, when the morning fever of this laſt form begins the diſeaſe; ſo neither is it eaſy to diſtinguiſh the double tertian from the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian, when the illneſs commences with the evening paroxyſm of that complicated type. This is a caſe, indeed, as far as my experience goes, rarely happens; yet where it does happen, the circumſtances, with which the evening fever is uſually attended, mark a further diſtinction. The quotidian commences uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by a diſtinct and regular paroxyſm; the evening fever of the double tertian, for the moſt part, only by a ſlight indiſpoſition.</p>
            <p>This connexion which I have juſt mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hour of invaſion and the type of the fever, was obſerved conſtantly at Savanna la Mar in Jamaica; but the ſame rules did not by any means hold true in the different parts of the continent of America. The moſt uſual hour of the invaſion of the ſingle tertian was twelve at noon in that country; though in ſome caſes the paroxyſm came on ſo early as ten in the morning, or ſo late as two in the afternoon. Of the other forms I cannot ſpeak with any certainty.</p>
            <p>But beſides the different hour of invaſion of the different types, I muſt likewiſe take notice of ſome other circumſtances, that ſeemed to be connected with the various forms. The duration of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm for inſtance, was uſually longer in the ſingle tertian than in the double tertian, or quotidian; and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028890_0028_0FDE67D18C418ED8"/>
of the double tertian, the paroxyſm of the morning was uſually longer than that of the evening; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides being longer, was generally of greater violence, at leaſt in the beginning of the diſeaſe. The cold fit was likewiſe more remarkable in the ſingle tertian, than in the other forms of fever.—I do not ſpeak of the quartan, of which I know but little. Of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious vomiting, ſo much inſiſted on by Galen as a diſtinguiſhing mark of the ſingle tertian, I am at a loſs to ſpeak poſitively. I can, indeed, affirm that I conſtantly obſerved ſuch evacuations to be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the different forms of the tertian, than in thoſe that appeared to be quotidian, or that approached nearer to a continued type.</p>
            <p>Such were the types of the fever of Jamaica, and ſuch were the principal circumſtances that appeared to be connected with them. The types of fevers it may be obſerved ſeem to be modified by climate; and there are not perhaps two different countries, or even diſtricts of country, in which they are exactly alike. The hour of invaſion of the ſame form of diſeaſe was different in Jamaica, and on the continent of North America; neither does it appear to have been exactly the ſame in Jamaica, and in the different iſlands of the Mediterranean. The prevalence of certain forms in certain climates, and the various changes of the form according to the changes of the ſeaſon, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of curioſity, and of conſiderable importance in the hiſtory of the diſeaſe. In Jamaica for inſtance, for one ſingle tertian, there were at leaſt three double ones; whilſt in America, the ſingle tertian bore the proportion of ten to one, perhaps, to all the other forms. In the higher latitudes of this country, the ſingle tertian was almoſt the only form which was ſeen, in the winter months and in ſpring; yet in the ſouthern provinces, particularly in the heat of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and ſometimes in autumn, the double tertian, and even ſtill more complicated types were by no means uncommon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:028890_0029_0FDE67D306B9D128"/>
I have thus endeavoured in the preceding pages to deſcribe the types of remitting fevers, as they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to my own obſervation. I have likewiſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to compare my own deſcriptions with thoſe of other authors; ſo that the reader may, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, be able to attain a ſyſtematic view of this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of diſeaſe, as it appears in the different parts of the world. The labour I am aware will be reckoned ſuperfluous by many; and a diſcuſſion on types, will probably be conſidered as partaking too much of the ſchool of Galen, who is held in contempt by the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the preſent day. I by no means contend for the infallibility of Galen or the ancients; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help believing, that though they have left us much falſe and ſuperfluous theory, they have likewiſe left us many valuable obſervations, on the nature and progreſs of febrile diſeaſes, which the moderns ſeem to have neglected. Though the theory of Galen on the preſent ſubject is probably ill founded, his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are certainly exact; and from what I have my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeen, no aſſertions, which will convince me, that an intimate acqaintance with the types and periods of fevers, is not an eſſential knowledge to the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. It is, indeed, the firſt ſtep; and it is a ſtep of ſuch importance, that our future progreſs will neither be ſatisfactory nor ſafe, unleſs it is properly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. I may be allowed to ſpeak from my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. It fell to my lot to have the charge of men's lives at an early period of life. I had then no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the types and periods of febrile diſeaſes, and I muſt not conceal, that the method of treatment I purſued, and the returns of the diſeaſe ſo often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that though actual harm was ſeldom done, yet many opportunities of doing good were certainly loſt. The patient, if he had the leaſt penetration, could not, ſometimes, avoid ſeeing, that, though I might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the common routine of practice, I was ignorant of the nature and progreſs of the diſeaſe, from which I had undertaken to relieve him.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. CRITICAL DAYS IN FEVERS.</head>
            <p>THE critical days, which are intimately connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the types and periods of fevers, come properly to be conſidered in this place. The ſubject is important, and though very fully diſcuſſed by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical writers, does not as yet appear to have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily explained by any one. If we attempt to trace the doctrine to its ſource, we ſhall find the firſt mention of it in the writings of Hippocrates. The followers of this author's opinions are numerous; and the endeavours, they have employed in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſtabliſh his ſyſtem, have been ſtrenuous and unremitting. But critical days have unfortunately afforded a field for controverſy in all ages; and there ſtill are many who maintain, and others who as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finently deny the exiſtence of any ſuch power in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the termination of febrile diſeaſes. In the midſt of this perplexity, a man who has had no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his own is totally at a loſs, which way to turn. There are great names on both ſides of the queſtion, but clear and deciſive evidence on neither. A detail, therefore, of ſuch obſervations as promiſe to remove many of thoſe circumſtances of embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot fail of being uſeful, and I hope accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the public. I am aware, indeed, that an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to explain a myſtery, which has hitherto eluded the reſearches of the moſt eminent phyſicians, will not probably eſcape cenſure:—In an obſcure man, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, it may be deemed arrogant; neither is it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without heſitation that I undertake the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; though very unequivocal proofs of the truth of the principles on which I proceed, ariſe from a view
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028890_0031_0FDE67DD42A4F4C8"/>
of the caſes of fever which came under my care, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time I lived in the Weſt Indies. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple on which the critical days in that climate depend, appears from the facts found in the following pages to be indiſputably eſtabliſhed; the deviations are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorily accounted for; and the fundamental rules, it is preſumed, are ſuch as may be extended to every climate on the globe. But, I ſhall ſtate in a few words the leading circumſtances, which occurred to me on the ſubject. If they afford not light enough to remove all the difficulties, it is hoped they may at leaſt point out a road, by which theſe difficulties may in future be removed.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper to remark in the firſt place, that I had heard of the doctrine of critical days in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers before my arrival in the Weſt Indies; yet I may likewiſe obſerve, that it was a doctrine, which I had only heard of by name. I had no knowledge of it, and I ſoon found that the idea was treated with ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule by practitioners, who very generally ſuppoſed the courſe of the fevers of Jamaica to be cut ſhort by bark, or other powerful means. Influenced, perhaps, by the authority of older men, I found myſelf diſpoſed to acquieſce in the common opinion, that this doctrine was only one of the fanciful theories of the ſchools; yet it was not long before I acquired a different view of the ſubject. I ſoon obſerved that fevers ſometimes ceaſed before a ſingle grain of bark was given; ſometimes after a few doſes, and ſometimes not till after ſeveral ounces. The obſervation of this fact did not fail to undeceive me. Under the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I mention, it would have been the height of obſtinacy to have perſiſted in believing, that the cure of the fever was in reality owing to the power of this celebrated remedy. But though it was ſoon evident, that the termination of the diſeaſe depended on ſome other thing than that which was generally ſuppoſed; yet a conſiderable time paſt over, before I was able to determine what this ſomething actually
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028890_0032_0FDE67DE460A3420"/>
was, or before I was able to aſcertain the laws which it obeyed. I ſoon diſcovered, indeed, that fevers had a general tendency to terminate on particular days; but it was not till the year 1776, that I diſcovered the proportion thoſe days bore to each other, or the ſources of the many deviations, which occurred. The ſubject ſeemed to be important;—and I felt an eagerneſs to determine a queſtion, which hitherto had been fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly purſued. With this view I wrote down with care and attention every caſe of fever which I met with in the year 1776 and 1777; and in looking over the memoranda ſometime after, found, that the critical days bore to each other the following proportion: <abbr>viz.</abbr> of ſixty caſes, which terminated favourably, ten ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated on the third, ten on the fifth, twenty on the ſeventh, ten on the ninth, five on the eleventh, three on the thirteenth, and two on the ſeventeenth. Of nine which terminated fatally, one terminated on the ſixth, one on the ſeventh, ſix on the eighth, and one on the tenth. Theſe facts are preciſe and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; but I muſt not forget to mention, that if we are guided wholly by obvious appearances, there ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times occur circumſtances, which occaſion embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus in the preſent inſtances, I not only rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the time by the periods, or revolutions of the diſeaſe, but I likewiſe ſimplified the complicated types; that is, I reckoned every revolution of the ſingle ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian as forty-eight hours, though it was often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in leſs; whilſt I conſidered the correſponding paroxyſms of the double tertian, only as the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. It may alſo be farther remarked, that the diſeaſe, which was the ſubject of this inveſtigation, was of a regular, remitting form. Paroxyſms and remiſſions were always diſcernible, and ſigns of criſis were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſtinct.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the critical days, as repreſented above is literally exact, where the complicated types were ſimplified, and where the time was reckoned by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of the diſeaſe; but I muſt likewiſe obſerve, that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028890_0033_0FDE67DFC6B721A8"/>
unleſs this method of calculation was adopted, there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured numerous inſtances, which ſeemed to deviate from the general rule. In the firſt place, if the type of the fever was ſingle tertian, which neither anticipated nor poſtponed,—and with paroxyſms which did not exceed twelve hours in duration, the criſis was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly on an odd day: yet if the type anticipated, and the ſum of the anticipations, in the courſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, was equal to twenty-four hours, the criſis was then neceſſarily removed t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an even day, if the time was reckoned by the natural day; though ſtill on an odd day, if reckoned in the manner which has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above. In like manner, if the type poſtponed, while the duration of the paroxyſm exceeded or amounted to 24 hours, the criſis was neceſſarily protracted to an even day. But this was a caſe, which ſeldom happened. In fevers likewiſe of the double tertian type, the type which prevailed principally at Savanna la Mar, there occurred much ſeeming irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. This form of fever, as was ſaid before, ſeemed to conſiſt of two diſeaſes, which ran a ſeparate and independent courſe. Thus, if the fever which began on the odd day was critical; that is, if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm of the odd day terminated the diſeaſe, the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis was neceſſarily on an odd day; but if that fever, the firſt attack of which was on the even day, conſiſted of an equal number of paroxyſms with the other, or continued after that had ceaſed, the criſis was then on an even day, reckoning from the beginning of the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though ſtill on an odd day, dating from the commencement of the ſecond fever. It was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of this fact which firſt gave me the idea of ſimplifying complicated types, and of calculating the critical days by the periods of the diſeaſe. The idea may perhaps be reckoned fanciful; but experience has afforded me ſufficient proofs, and it will ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the ſame to thoſe who take the trouble to look for them, that the various types of complicated fevers
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028890_0034_0FDE67E8B5A23598"/>
actually run a ſeparate and independent courſe; a fact when eſtabliſhed, which removes all doubt and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity from the apparently varying laws of critical days in the compound forms of febrile diſeaſes. With regard to the quotidian it remains to be remarked, that the criſis was generally on an odd day. It was likewiſe generally on an odd day in thoſe that were ſtill more continued and acute;—a fact which ſeems to have been well known to Avicenna. But though the rules I have mentioned are clear and uniform, I muſt ſtill own, that I have ſometimes met with fevers of a very continued kind, which terminated late on the ſixth, or rather very early on the ſeventh. The diſeaſe was then of more than uſual violence on the ſixth:—how far this might be owing to anticipations of the paroxyſm of the ſeventh, accumulated upon that of the ſixth, is difficult to determine with certainty.</p>
            <p>The anticipation, the poſtponing, and the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of type are the principal circumſtances, which uſually diſturb the regular critical periods in fevers of ſhort duration; yet in thoſe of longer continuance, there is ſtill another cauſe, which deſerves to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly attended to. In the fevers of Jamaica, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe which approached to a continued form, ſome very apparent change in the nature of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, or in the mode of action of the febrile cauſe, was generally obſerved on the ſeventh, or before it. In conſequence of this change, the order of the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical days was ſometimes diſturbed, and appearances were often produced, which ſeemed to contradict the rules, which we have attempted to eſtabliſh. It was a common remark, that after the ſeventh there was leſs apparent regularity in the movements of nature, This, as we ſhall afterwards attempt to prove, was the conſequence of a ſeptenary revolution, which accidentally diſturbed the regular order of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary days of criſis. It is a fact of which the ancients were not ignorant; and of which I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028890_0035_0FDE67E987273128"/>
to make frequent uſe: <abbr>viz.</abbr> that a relapſe has a tendency to run over a courſe of duration equal to the original fever. This is confirmed by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Hippocrates; but I may alſo add, that not only thoſe recurrences of fever, which are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſtyled relapſes; but further, that in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, where the diſeaſe undergoes any remarkable change in the nature of its ſymptoms, the diſorder is generally diſpoſed to continue for the ſame length of time in this new form, as it had done in the former. Thus a remarkable change of ſymptoms on the fifth was followed by a criſis on the ninth; ſometimes, perhaps, only by another change of ſymptoms on the ninth, the final criſis not happening till after another period of five days. In like manner, a change of ſymptoms on the ſeventh was often followed by a criſis on the thirteenth; or only, perhaps, by another change on the thirteenth, the diſeaſe completing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther revolution of ſeven days before a final termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That ſuch changes actually do take place at certain periods, not only thoſe caſes of fever, which have come under my own care, but thoſe related by Hippocrates, in the books of Epidemics, give ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient room to believe. Thus in every one of thoſe inſtances, where the hiſtory is ſo circumſtantially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed as to leave it in our power to trace the diſeaſe in its progreſs, it will conſtantly be found, if the day of criſis deviates from the general rule, that a change of ſymptoms, often an evident renewal of fever, had actually taken place at ſome period of the courſe. In this manner, if the change of ſymptoms of which I ſpeak happened on an odd day, the odd days continued to be critical, as if no change had been; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if the paroxyſm of the odd day completed its courſe, the remiſſion which followed was often more perfect than uſual:—a diſtinct period was marked in the hiſtory of the diſeaſe,—or in other words, there was an obſcure or imperfect criſis. But on the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028890_0036_0FDE67EB055007F8"/>
day following, which was an even day, a fever with a different train of ſymptoms made its appearance, and ran over a courſe, for the moſt part, equal in dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the former. If this change, or renewal of the diſeaſe happened on the ſixth, a change or criſis was not expected till the tenth, if on the eighth, not till the fourteenth. I have ſaid juſt now, that relapſes were generally diſpoſed to run over a courſe of the ſame duration as the original diſeaſe; yet I muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe remark, that they were ſometimes alſo of ſhorter continuance. Thus I have frequently obſerved a change of the nature of the ſymptoms on the ſeventh, and a final criſis on the eleventh; the renewal of the diſeaſe, inſtead of ſeven, being only of five days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
            <p>The above circumſtances are capable of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordinary deviations from the regular critical periods in the fevers of the Weſt-Indies; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not affirm with the ſame certainty, that a ſimilar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation will be conſtantly admitted in the long fevers of this country. I have however reaſon to believe, that changes at the ſeptenary periods fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently take place here, and ſometimes apparently diſturb the critical periods of the diſeaſe. Thoſe caſes which I have been able to trace with accuracy give ſtrong proofs of it,—I ſhall relate two or three of them to ſerve as an illuſtration. The firſt, is that of a young man, who had been il<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of a fever more than three weeks before I was called to him. Two days before I ſaw him; and after an evident abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſymptoms, there happened a ſudden and unexpected relapſe, or renewal of the diſeaſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of this circumſtance, I dated from the new attack, and calculated the critical days in the manner which has been ſhewn above. Minute attention diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the type, though it was only an obſcure one.—It was Semitertian, or there was an exacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation every evening, with a more evident paroxyſm
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028890_0037_0FDE67EC86428A00"/>
on the alternate days. A criſis happened at the period I had foreſeen, but it was not final. A fever returned again in the evening, different however in type, as well as in ſymptoms, from the preceding. It had diſtinct quotidian exacerbations and an imperfect criſis happened on the ſeventh. But in twelve or fourteen hours, a coldneſs and ſhivering marked a renewal of the old, or perhaps the invaſion of a new diſeaſe. The ſymptoms were not only different in their nature from the ſymptoms of the former; but they were likewiſe more violent in degree. The diſeaſe continued in this form for ſeven days, and the criſis, which at laſt was only imperfect, was ſoon ſucceeded by another renewal of fever, the beginning of which was marked by a ſimilar degree of coldneſs and ſhivering. The ſymptoms of this were likewiſe different from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, but its form was the ſame, and it ran over a courſe of equal duration. The ſeptenary revolutions were very plain in this caſe. I ſhall relate another in which they were not ſo clearly marked, though they certainly did ſtill take place. It is a caſe of fever with nervous ſymptoms. On the ſeventh a ſediment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the urine, ſome drops of blood fell from the noſe; and the abatement of fever was very evident; yet it did not laſt long. The diſeaſe recurred again on the eighth, and continued to increaſe in violence till the fourteenth. A ſediment then appeared in the urine, ſome drops of blood fell from the noſe as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there were two or three evacuations by ſtool, which had been unuſual in the preceding courſe of the diſeaſe; and from the whole appearances I could not help entertaining ſome ſaint hopes of criſis. There was indeed an evident alleviation of the ſufferings; but it laſted but for a ſhort time. Next day every ſymptom was aggravated, and the powers of life ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuffer a gradual diminution till the twentieth, when the patient died. I do not recollect any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of fever, where the revolutions were more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028890_0038_0FDE67F41BE4F9D8"/>
than in the preſent caſe; yet they were ſtill ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being traced. The next example I ſhall mention is much clearer. It is an inſtance of a bad fever, of no diſcernible type in the beginning, in a man who was conſiderably advanced in years. On the evening of the ſeventh there was ſome obſcure tendency to criſis. The patient was not only eaſier in his own feelings; but the eye and countenance, which had been confuſed and clouded, brightened up, and a ſmall ſediment appeared in the urine. Yet theſe favourable circumſtances were only of ſhort duration. In the courſe of the day following, all the ſymptoms recurred, and the diſeaſe acquired force till the evening of the thirteenth. The pulſe then began to riſe, and continued riſing till the morning of the fourteenth, when a profuſe ſweat was followed by a very diſtinct criſis. But ſtill this criſis was not final. The malignity of the diſeaſe, however, departed, and the complaint that remained, aſſuming a remitting form, totally diſappeared after another pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of ſeven days. I ſhall only beg leave to relate another inſtance of fever, which occured to me lately, and which affords a very curious proof of ſeptenary revolutions in febrile diſeaſes of long continuance. A young man had been ill of a fever about a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before I was called to him. At the time I firſt ſaw him, the ſymptoms were very violent; but having abated conſiderably in the courſe of a day or two, I began to entertain hopes of a ſpeedy recovery. The complaint was almoſt entirely gone, when a new train of ſymptoms unexpectedly making its appearance, raged with violence for a day or two, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined gradually as the other had done. I again look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſigns of criſis, when another acceſſion on the ſeventh from the former attack, brought matters into ſtill greater danger. Theſe ſymptoms, though of a different nature from the former, were violent in the beginning; but they ſoon began to abate, and had
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028890_0039_0FDE67F5EF317B60"/>
almoſt diſappeared, when the attack was once more renewed on the following ſeventh. In this manner the diſeaſe went through nine ſeptenary revolutions; and it is ſomewhat remarkable, that the ſymptoms, which marked the new acceſſion, were always diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe of the acceſſion immediately preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In one, the diſtinguiſhing ſymptoms were a moroſe and ſtern ſullenneſs, in another, delirium, tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and ſubſultus tendinum,—and in the third, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious liver-coloured ſtools. Theſe were three times ſeverally repeated. It deſerves, however, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that the period of the acceſſions was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened before the termination of the diſeaſe. After it had continued nine weeks in the manner I have deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed above, there were two acceſſions of five days each; after which all traces of fever diſappeared.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficiently plain from the facts which I have mentioned in the preceding pages, that the more uſual irregularities in the order of the critical days, proceed generally from overlooking the type in periodical fevers, or from neglecting to attend to ſeptenary, and other revolutions, in ſuch as approach more nearly to a continued form. Theſe are the general cauſes of apparent irregularity; yet beſides theſe, there are ſtill ſome others, which muſt not be paſſed over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out notice, as they occaſionally have the effect of producing apparent deviations. Thus it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that a diſeaſe, which appears to be continued in the beginning, changes to remitting after a certain duration. The change is uſually on an odd day, and on the day following the firſt paroxyſm of the remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting form makes its appearance, the termination of which may be expected on an even day, if we date from the beginning of the illneſs, though ſtill on an odd day, if we date, (as perhaps we ought to do) from the time this change in the circumſtances of the diſeaſe took place. To this we may add, that thoſe complicating fevers, which, happening at various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028890_0040_0FDE67F74F07F620"/>
of time, ſometimes terminate ſooner, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times continue longer than the original complaint, frequently diſturb in appearance the general regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the critical periods of nature. It happens, perhaps, from a ſimilar cauſe, that a paroxyſm of an unuſual kind ſometimes terminates the diſeaſe, and apparently diſturbs the regular periods of criſis This has occurred to me ſeveral times in practice; and it happened twice in my own perſon. The ordinary paroxyſm declined after the uſual duration; a new one ſucceeded of uncommon violence, and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in its nature from the former. Its courſe was of long continuance, and it finally terminated the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The above facts enable us to explain ſatisfactorily every circumſtance, which relates to critical days in fevers, where the criſis is clear and decided; yet I muſt ſtill own, that as I have ſometimes met with fevers where marks of criſis were ſcarcely perceptible ſo it would be raſhneſs, in ſuch caſes, to ſpeak poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively of the order of the critical days. The patient might, in ſome meaſure, be ſaid to wade through the diſeaſe; the changes from day to day being ſo very ſmall, that it required more diſcernment than I can boaſt of to mark them with preciſion.</p>
            <p>The obſervations I have related, and the rules I have attempted to eſtabliſh, for the better explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the doctrine of critical days in fevers, were formed at a time when I had no knowledge of the opinions of preceding authors. They may therefore better claim exemption from bias in favour of one ſet of writers, or prejudice againſt another. They are indeed no more than an analyſis of facts, which were collected with every poſſible care, which are ſufficiently circumſtantial, and which ſpeak beſt for themſelves. They contain, (if I do not view them with a partial eye,) ſuch information, as may lead to a ſatisfactory explanation of this myſterious and long
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028890_0041_0FDE67F8843AEE78"/>
diſputed doctrine.—I muſt only beg leave to add, that though I have everywhere mentioned the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of particular days in terminating fevers, yet it muſt not be underſtood, that this power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on a particular quality of the days, merely as ſuch. It depends more evidently on a certain number of revolutions of the diſeaſe, in conſequence of which, the fever from ſomething we do not in the leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, ſeems diſpoſed to terminate finally, or to ſuffer a change in its mode of action. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brings us to the concluſion, that the critical pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods are improper calculated by the natural day. The doctrine, in ſhort, can only be rendered conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent by attending to the periods of the diſeaſe, by ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying complicated types, and by marking thoſe ſeptenary or other revolutions, which happening at different diſtances of time, occaſion an appearance of irregularity which does not exiſt in reality.</p>
            <p>Having related the reſult of my own obſervations on critical days in fevers, I ſhall now endeavour to bring under one point of view, the ſubſtance of what has been written on the ſubject, by ſome of the moſt celebrated of the ancient, as well as modern phyſicians. That certain days, or that portions of time compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in a certain number of days, had obviouſly a power of producing changes on the human frame, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be an obſervation of high antiquity; but as a medical doctrine, we are unable to trace it farther than the days of Hippocrates. Hippocrates has treated very fully of the critical periods of fevers, in various parts of his works; and upon the whole, has amaſſed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable body of information; though with leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, perhaps, than has been generally imagined. The caſes of the Epidemics, which we naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as the materials from which he formed his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral doctrine, have ſome obvious and great defects. The date is ſeldom clearly aſcertained, and the mode of calculating the time, does not ſeem to be fixed. If
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028890_0042_0FDD22D429FBB228"/>
a fever, for inſtance, begins in the evening, or in the courſe of the night, the day following is generally reckoned the firſt day of the diſeaſe, by this author.—But this is not all.—Some of the caſes are plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from memory; and others are only parts of caſes, related by different perſons. This want of accuracy, where it is ſcarcely poſſible to be too cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial, neceſſarily breeds confuſion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces an appearance of irregularity, which does not actually exiſt. Hence we find inconſiſtency in the general doctrine, as delivered in different parts of the works, which have been aſcribed to Hippocrates; at the ſame time, that there is a want of that circumſtantial detail in the particular parts, from which only we can be enabled to form an opinion. I have read over with much attention the caſes of fevers, recorded in the Epidemics; but I frequently found myſelf unable to trace the diſeaſe in its progreſs. Though evidently ſubject to periodical movements, it was not always in my power to lay hold of the type; yet wherever it was poſſible to attain this exactneſs, I have the ſatisfaction to add, that I conſtantly found the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of nature to be uniform. They were the ſame in the iſlands of the Archipelago, as in the iſland of Jamaica.—If they appeared in ſome inſtances to be different, it was perhaps principally owing to this, that the Greek phyſician had left ſome part of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe undeſcribed.</p>
            <p>From what I have juſt now ſaid, we can have no heſitation in concluding, that the opinion of Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, on the ſubject of critical days, is neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in any one part, nor conſiſtent in the whole. The doctrine, however, in its beſt digeſted form, is the following: <abbr>viz.</abbr> That odd days have a remarkable power in terminating fevers; but more particularly, that the great critical revolutions happen at quater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary periods. Thus the moſt eminent critical days, are the fourth, the ſeventh, the eleventh, the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028890_0043_0FDE6800C7745340"/>
the ſeventeenth and the twentieth. This is the general form of this Hippocratic doctrine; yet in this form, it bears contradiction to obſervations that are found in various parts of that ancient author's works. The fifth and ninth are excluded by this arrangement, from the number of the critical days; though there are numerous examples of their great power, in terminating febrile diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of critical days, which appeared firſt in a regular form, in the writings of Hippocrates, found numerous and reſpectable advocates among the ancient phyſicians. Diocles of Caryſtus, Philotimus, Heraclides of Tarentum, &amp;c. all bore teſtimony to the general truth of the obſervation; but their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings being unfortunately loſt, we are now ignorant of the particular facts and arguments, by which they attempted to ſupport their opinions. Indeed, from the time of the Perſian invaſion of Greece, till the Roman arms penetrated into Afia, a period of near four hundred years, we know of no oppoſition to to this fundamental doctrine of the Coan Sage: But in the time of Pompey the Great, an author aroſe, who endeavoured to eſtabliſh his own fame on the ruins of this favourite ſyſtem of his predeceſſors. Aſclepiades, who was a man of a bold and daring genius, not only rejected this apparently well founded doctrine of the ancients, but treated the idea of it with ridicule. His arguments are ingenious and acute; but they fall ſhort of the truth. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms or exacerbations, as he juſtly obſerves, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times change to the even days, and conſequently the criſis: yet this, if properly underſtood, does not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy the generality of the rules;—if the method of calculating the time, by the periods and revolutions of the diſeaſe, be adopted, the difficulty is perfectly removed. But though this fact in reality, was not unknown to Aſclepiades; yet it does not appear, that he underſtood the application of it. I may add, that
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028890_0044_0FDE6801846820C8"/>
he has precipiately rejected the doctrine, from the very circumſtance which eſtabliſhes its reality.</p>
            <p>We do not meet with any thing very material, on the preſent ſubject, between the time of Aſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piades, and the days of Galen. There appears, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to have been many, who adopting the opinion, and copying the arguments of the eloquent Bethy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, denied altogether the exiſtence of critical pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods in fevers; whilſt others, recurring to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Hippocrates, maintained their reality with no leſs obſtinacy. But we are now in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ignorant, if thoſe writers attempted to ſupport their opinions by any new facts, or new arguments. Among other misfortunes, we muſt regret particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that the treatiſe of Aretaeus on fevers is loſt. From what we know of this author's induſtry we might have reaſonably expected original information on the ſubject in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Galen, whoſe fertile and exuberant genius left no path in phyſic unexplored, has written fully on this celebrated doctrine. He has profeſſedly adopted the opinion of Hippocrates, and laboured much to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and confirm it; but unfortunately, he has oftener overwhelmed the ſubject with diffuſe and tedious reaſonings, than illuſtrated it by proofs from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and actual obſervation. Upon the whole, however, amidſt much ſuperfluous and unmeaning matter, we find not only uſeful information, but a more ſyſtematic arrangement of facts, than is any where to be met with. He has attempted to fix with more preciſion the date of invaſion; he has eſtimated with more accuracy the critical power of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent days; and further, has hinted obſcurely, that the time will be calculated moſt conveniently by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms or revolutions of the diſeaſe. In ſhort, this author, no leſs than Aſclepiades, was ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the principal truths, which give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency to this doctrine; but it is evident, that he
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028890_0045_0FDE68034A77A448"/>
did not underſtand the full extent of their application. He was conſtantly biaſſed by the theory of a quater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary period; as without this predilection, it is not eaſy to conceive, how he ſhould have conſidered the fourteenth, as critical of tertians, where the parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſms happen on the odd days, and where the termin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as he acknowledges, conſtantly follows the ſolution of a paroxyſm. The latitude likewiſe which he aſſumes, in explaining the apparent irregularities, is much too great. If we are permitted to reckon either the beginning or the termination of a paroxyſm, as the critical period, according as it ſhall beſt ſuit our theory, it is eaſy to elude the moſt poſitive teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of experience. Yet, notwithſtanding theſe defects, the different tracts of Galen on this ſubject, deſerve to be carefully read. The facts they contain, though ſometimes miſapplied, are often important; and though we are not always ſatisfied with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of the author, we are aſtoniſhed at the amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maſs of learning and knowledge found in his works.</p>
            <p>There is little new information, on the ſubject of critical days, to be met with in the writings of thoſe Greek phyſicians, who were poſterior to the time of Galen. AEtius Amidenus, indeed, brings into nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower compaſs the ſubſtance of the doctrines of his predeceſſors. He mentions likewiſe, the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial of thoſe circumſtances, which influence the deviations from the regular criſis; but it is evident, that he has not ſufficiently underſtood their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Alexander Frallianus, who was an excellent practitioner, and a man of long experience, paſſes over this ſubject without particular notice; and though Paulus of AEgina has detailed the opinions of Galen in a more compreſſed form, than they are found in the original author; yet he has not added any new obſervations of his own. From the manner, indeed, in which he ſpeaks, of the peculiar virtue of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028890_0046_0FDE680497DADF60"/>
the ſeventh and fourteenth, we ſhould be apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he is not altogether free from prepoſſeſſion in favour of the Pythagorean numbers.</p>
            <p>It was reaſonable to have expected information, on the ſubject of critical days, from the writings of the Arabian phyſicians. The Arabians inhabit a country, were the periodical movements of nature are perhaps more clearly marked, than in our north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern latitudes. Some diſtricts of their country like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were famous for the ſciences at an early period, though it does not indeed appear that much of this knowledge deſcended in a direct channel to the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians of the preſent times. The Arabian phyſicians, in many inſtances, enriched medical practice with new forms of remedies; but they have for the moſt part only adopted the theoretical doctrines of the Greeks, particularly of Galen. Avicenna, the moſt famous among their phyſicians, and undoubtedly a great man, has Galen conſtantly in his eye: in ſhort, he has done little more on the ſubject of critical days, at leaſt, than merely tranſlate the opinions and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the celebrated Greek. He attempts, indeed, to be more explicit in aſcertaining the date of inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but he does not in fact, go much beyond his predeceſſors;—hinting only obſcurely, that the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical days ought to be calculated from the proper for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the type, or the diſtinct invaſion of the fever. He has added, however, that the odd days, are properly the critical days of the ſingle tertian, and that the eleventh of courſe, obtains rank of the fourteenth in this diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>There are many authors, who have written on this ſubject, ſince the arrival of ſcience in Europe; but there are few that I have met with, who have thrown light on it from their own obſervations. The moſt of them have borrowed the opinion from Hippocrates; and accordingly have attempted to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the truth of it, on the facts which are found in
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028890_0047_0FDE680D5261E6F0"/>
the writings of that author; facts, which, on enquiry, will ſcarcely be found to be accurate enough to be made the baſis of a general doctrine. It would be time ill ſpent, to enter into a detail of the arguments of this numerous liſt of writers; who, in reality, have oftener attempted to ſupport their opinions by the authority of Galen and the ancients, than by the facts which might have been found in their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. From writers, however, of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would be unjuſt, not to ſeparate Hoffman, an author, who has related with candour the reſult of his own obſervations, in a practice of forty years and upwards. The facts which Hoffman mentions, throw conſiderable light on the ſubject; yet ſtill they do not remove all the difficulty. They neither ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to form an eſtimate of the power of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent critical days; neither do they at all aſſiſt us in comprehending the cauſe of the deviations. There are probably other modern authors beſides Hoffman, who have treated of the power of critical days in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; but, except Dr. Cullen, I have not met with any one, who has left any obſervations which deſerve much notice. This celebrated phyſician is a warm advocate of the ancient doctrine of critical days. He ſubſcribes profeſſedly to the arrangements of Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates; though he adds likewiſe the reſult of his own obſervation, in the various kinds of fevers of this country.</p>
            <p>The moſt eminent of the ancient and the moſt ſyſtematic of the modern phyſicians, all agree in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing to certain days a particular power in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating; yet they do not ſo perfectly coincide in the arrangement they have given of thoſe days, or in the cauſes they have aſſigned for the particular pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. The inconſiſtency of Hippocrates has, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, been in ſome meaſure the ſource of this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of opinion. In one place, this author has ranked the twentieth as the proper critical day in fevers; in ſome others, this power is attributed to the twenty-firſt.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028890_0048_0FDE680E47BA7078"/>
That the twenty-firſt is properly the day of criſis, was the opinion of Archegen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and Diocles; that it ſhould be ſo, is not inconſiſtent with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral principle of the Hippocratic doctrine; <abbr>viz.</abbr> the movements of a quaternary period. So far is clear; but as it was obſerved by Hippocrates, as well as by other authors, that the twentieth was ſtill more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a day of criſis than the twenty-firſt, a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> on the fourteenth, was introduced to account for this apparent deviation from the general rule. This idea of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or accumulation of one period on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is mentioned in the writings of Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, originated perhaps in the doctrine of Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras. It is adopted by Galen, and it appears in reality to be occaſionally true; yet it can never be conſidered as an eſtabliſhed principle in the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of febrile diſeaſes. By means of ſuch accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, however, Galen has attempted to eſtabliſh the pre-eminence of the twentieth, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders as the real critical day of Hippocrates. That the twentieth—(not the twenty-firſt) is actually the critical day of Hippocrates, is likewiſe decidedly the opinion of Dr. Cullen, who, going a ſtep farther than his predeceſſors, endeavours to ſupport his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion by ſome arguments, which are entirely new. This ingenious author hazards the bold conjecture, that the appearance of the twenty-firſt, in the writings of Hippocrates, has ariſen wholly from accidental error in the original manuſcript: but with all due deference to ſuch reſpectable authority, I muſt beg leave to ſuggeſt, that the twenty-firſt occurs too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in thoſe writings, which have been aſcribed to the Coan Sage, to give countenance to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that it owes its place, as a critical day, to care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs error. The other argument is more ingenious; but perhaps not better founded. This writer has ventured to maintain, that the type of febrile diſeaſes changes to quartan after the eleventh; but I can ſee
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028890_0049_0FDE681002F67410"/>
no good reaſon for the ſuppoſition. Medical writers have repeatedly noticed inſtances of criſis, on the thirteenth, and fifteenth; even my own experience, narrow as it has been, furniſhes me with ſufficient evidence, that criſis actually do happen at the above-mentioned periods.</p>
            <p>As thoſe days, which have been chiefly conſidered as critical, are now ſuppoſed to be ſufficiently known, it will not be ſuperfluous in the next place, to take a ſhort view of the cauſes, on which the particular pre-eminence has been thought immediately to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. The quaternary period, which in reality is a period of four, and a period of three days ſucceeding each other alternately, is the general principle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by ancient phyſicians, to explain this arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if we continue to purſue the undiſturbed movements of a quaternary period, we ſhall bring the eighteenth and twenty-firſt into the order of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical days, rather than the ſeventeenth, and twentieth. The contrary is in fact the caſe. To obviate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this difficulty, or to reconcile obſervation with theory, a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> has been ſuppoſed to take place on the fourteenth. That a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or as it may be tranſlated, the accumulation of the beginning of one period on the extremity of another, frequently takes place, cannot be denied; but its appearance is not determined by a fixed law. It is obſerved on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, on the fourteenth; in ſhort, on any day what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The quaternary period, with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> on the fourteenth, is the only principle employed by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients for explaining the uſual arrangement of the critical days; yet I muſt obſerve, that it is capable of doing this, only in a very imperfect manner; it totally excludes ſome days of very conſiderable pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Dr. Cullen, ſenſible, perhaps, of this defect, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted that there was a chance from the tertian to the quartan type on the eleventh. This change, it muſt be confeſſed, explains with perfect plauſibility
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028890_0050_0FDE6811625D1A98"/>
the pre-eminence of the fourteenth, ſeventeenth and twentieth; but there is the ſtrongeſt reaſon to believe, that it does not in fact take place. I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that inſtances are recorded by medical writers of criſis, which have happened on the thirteenth, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and the other days, which are not included in the quartan period; and I can add from my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that where the diſeaſe was of ſuch a kind, that a type could be clearly traced; no ſuch change, as this author has ſuggeſted, was ever ſeen.</p>
            <p>Having ventured to declare, that the cauſes, which have been hitherto aſſigned for the pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of certain critical days in fevers, are extremely defective; the facts, which I have mentioned before, it is preſumed, may enable us, if they are properly underſtood, to give a more ſatisfactory explanation of this ſingular phenomenon. There are few people of experience and obſervation, who do not know that the tertian is the moſt prevailing type in febrile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. This, at firſt ſight, gives a general pre-eminence to the odd days; but though the tertian period pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails very generally in fevers, yet it muſt alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that theſe revolutions are ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted in a ſhorter ſpace of time than the regular pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod; whilſt the types are frequently found to be doubled, or even more variouſly combined. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe accidents, apparent irregularities are often produced in the order of the critical days; though they may be all ſatisfactorily accounted for, by calculating the time by the periods of the diſeaſe, or by ſimplifying thoſe types which are more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently complicated. By attending to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I have mentioned, all the difficulties may be eaſily removed in periodical fevers; but as numerous inſtances of fevers occur, where no type can be clearly traced; ſo it is neceſſary in ſuch caſes to ſeek for ſome other principle, which may be capable of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining apparent irregularities. There very ſeldom
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028890_0051_0FDE6816F8E84490"/>
perhaps happens an inſtance of fever of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, where the ſymptoms do not undergo ſome change in the courſe of the diſeaſe. Thoſe changes or revolutions are generally at conſiderable intervals, frequently at an interval of ſeven days. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances by which thoſe changes are indicated, are not by any means obſcure; and, perhaps, there would not be great error, if we conſidered them as the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a new complaint; at leaſt by conſidering them as ſuch, the general principle of the critical days is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved conſiſtent and uniform throughout. I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch explanations as have occurred moſt frequently in my own practice. It often happened, that the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe underwent a material change on the fifth. It terminated on the ninth, or perhaps only put on a new appearance on the ninth, its final termination not happening till after another period of five days. In the ſame manner, a change of ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms on the ſeventh, was followed by a criſis on the thirteenth; or if the change of ſymptoms was not obſerved till the ninth, the criſis probably did not make its appearance till the ſeventeenth. Such change of ſymptoms on the odd days, (where we may ſay with propriety enough, that one diſeaſe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated upon another), there being ſeldom any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious marks of criſis, was by no means uncommon; yet it happened ſtill oftener, that the paroxyſm of the odd day declined; the original diſeaſe terminated im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly, whilſt a new one began the day following, which was an even day. By ſuch accidents the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the days of criſis was changed. And from the laſt mentioned cauſe the fourteenth, as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſeventh, becomes remarkable among the critical periods of fevers. This idea of a ſecond ſeventh oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to me many years ago, and long before I was acquainted with the opinions of Hippocrates or of Galen. It now receives information from the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of theſe careful obſervers. There are many,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028890_0052_0FDE681B8D212520"/>
I make no doubt, who will be diſpoſed to treat it with ridicule; but I ſhall combat their opinion with no other argument than a requeſt, that they write down carefully the hiſtory of a tedious fever, and afterwards review its courſe without prejudice or partiality.</p>
            <p>I now only beg leave to add, that the facts which I have mentioned in the preceding pages are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, and give room to conclude, that by ſimplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complicated types, by calculating the time by the revolutions of the diſeaſe, or by beginning to date a ſecond time from thoſe great and remarkable changes, which happen at more diſtant periods, a doctrine is formed, perfectly uniform and conſiſtent with itſelf. It is confirmed by every obſervation which I have been hitherto able to make. It is no more indeed, than an analyſis of thoſe ſeveral caſes, which have occurred in my own practice; which in periodical fevers at leaſt, has been tolerably extenſive.</p>
            <p>But though the prevalence of a tertian type, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains ſatisfactorily the general critical power of the odd days; and thoſe other circumſtances, which I have likewiſe taken notice of, account no leſs clearly for all the deviations, which are obſerved to take place; yet if we attempt to ſeek for a cauſe of this type, or of thoſe changes, which happen at more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, particularly at the ſeptenary periods, our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs is ſoon ſtopt. Galen, who ſeldom heſitates in explaining the phenomena of nature, acknowledges here that he was unwillingly drawn to a diſcuſſion of the ſubject. The queſtion undoubtedly is a difficult one; and, it is to be feared, muſt remain for ever unknown. In the Eaſt, where the powers of the human mind were not only earlier developed; but where men, from climate and modes of life, were led more early to obſerve the motions of nature, ſtated and periodical movements were ſoon diſcovered in the economy of the ſublunary ſyſtem. Egypt,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028890_0053_0FDE681C84844FA0"/>
there is reaſon to believe, is one of the countries where theſe revolutions were firſt taken notice of; at leaſt it was on the banks of the Nile, that the Greek philoſophers firſt gathered the ſeeds of natural ſcience. Among the knowledge or opinions, which theſe ſages carried back to their native country, we may reckon the doctrine of the power of numbers; which though disfigured perhaps by the metaphyſical genius of the philoſopher of Samos, has obſervation in ſome degree for its baſis. It does not concern us at preſent to enter into a particular diſcuſſion of this opinion; but as far as relates to the ſubject in queſtion, we cannot refuſe acknowledging, that the frame of man is liable to regular changes, at particular periods, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in a certain number of days and hours. But though this general truth is indiſputable, yet there is no argument which leads us to ſuppoſe, that thoſe changes are, in any degree, influenced by an harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic proportion in the ſimple number of the days. Ill founded however as this doctrine obviouſly is, it was in high faſhion with the Greeks in the time of Hippocrates; and ſeems evidently to have had ſome influence on the opinions of this author. Without ſuch a prepoſſeſſion, indeed, it is not eaſy to conceive, how he could have fabricated the ſyſtem which he has given to the world; as it by no means reſults from the facts which are found in his writings. Galen in this, as in moſt ſubjects, follows the footſteps of Hippocrates. He diſclaims, I muſt confeſs, the <hi>power of numbers,</hi> ſimply as numbers having any effect upon the moſt uſual days of criſis; but he maintains the influence of a quaternary period, which appears very plainly to be a remnant of the doctrine of Pythagoras. However, after exhauſting himſelf, and fatiguing his readers with a detail of uſeleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, he at laſt ventures to conclude, that the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of criſis is to be referred ultimately to the courſe and different aſpects of the moon. The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028890_0054_0FDE681E06ED7BB8"/>
like many others recorded by the Greek phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, draw its origin from Egypt. It is not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, altogether without appearance of plauſibility; yet I muſt add, that if the moon has in reality any influence in this buſineſs, the laws which regulate its effects are obſcure;—indeed, not in the leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. The conjecture however, fanciful as it appears to be, met with the general aſſent of medical writers, till about the middle of the ſixteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, when Fracaſtorious, a man of ingenuity and elegant gènius, attempted to ſubſtitute another in its place; though unfortunately, not a more probable one than that of his predeceſſors. This author, after a diſplay of much learning and general knowledge, at laſt ventures to conclude, that the power of the different days of criſis, depends on peculiarities in the laws of motion of the different humours, which give riſe to the different ſpecies of the diſeaſe: but with regard to this hypotheſis, it is only neceſſary to remark, that while the very exiſtence of the humours is doubted with reaſon, there can be no certainty in determining the laws of their motions. But though the opinion of Galen, and this of Fracaſtorius, are only vague and very queſtionable conjectures; yet they are the only ones, ſo far as I know, which have been offered to the public. The ſubject is too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, perhaps, ever to be explained. For though we clearly perceive that fevers are uſually of a ſtated duration; yet we are unable to perceive, whether this duration depends on ſomething inexplicable in the peculiar nature of the cauſe, which ceaſes to act, or changes its mode of action at a certain period; or to ſome imperceptible revolution in the human frame, which deſtroys in a given ſpace of time, that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular aptitude between the ſtate of the body and the morbid cauſe, in which the diſeaſe may be ſaid to conſiſt. This only we know with certainty, that where the febrile motions are violent and continual,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028890_0055_0FDE6826D0DB8958"/>
the diſeaſe haſtens to a termination; where they are languid and feeble, or ſuffer long interruptions, its duration is often drawn out to an undetermined length of time. Thus continued fevers, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory diatheſis and much viſcular excitement, for the moſt part terminate decidedly in ſeven or nine days; while thoſe with low and languid motions, with long and diſtinct intermiſſions, as the quartan, and even ſometime the tertian, continue for months, and decline at laſt by ſlow and almoſt imperceptible degrees.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem that I have treated very fully of the critical days of fevers; yet before leaving the ſubject altogether, there is one thing ſtill which requires to be mentioned;—I mean the great proportion of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal terminations, which happen on the even days. The even days were obſerved to be fatal in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of three to one, in thoſe fevers, which came under my care during the time that I lived in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica. The fact, which is curious and hitherto I believe unnoticed, was diſcovered in the following manner. That I might the better trace the progreſs of nature through the whole courſe of the fever, a ſubject which then engroſſed my chief attention, I viſited often, and ſpent much of my time in the apartments of the ſick. Among other things, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the manner in which death more uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached. The natural courſe of the paroxyſm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared generally to be finiſhed, or the action of the febrile cauſe ſeemed actually to have ceaſed. The lightning before death, as it is termed, which has been generally attributed to the laſt efforts of dying nature was frequently ſeen to take place. This was even ſometimes ſo remarkable, as to give flattering hopes of a favourable criſis; yet in a ſhort ſpace of time, the powers of life begun to fail, and at laſt were gradually extinguiſhed, like an expiring taper.—The criſis, ſtrictly ſpeaking, happened on the odd days, equally the ſame in thoſe who died, as in thoſe
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028890_0056_0FDE6827C5981548"/>
who recovered; only I had inaccurately, accuſtomed myſelf to refer the critical period to that moment, were the ſigns of criſis were firſt perceived; in the other, I had conſidered it as happening at the hour of actual death. Thus it was obſerved in thoſe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers which terminated fatally on the even days, that the powers of life, though irrecoverably exhauſted, were not totally extinguiſhed by the paroxyſm of the odd day. This paroxyſm, in ſhort, ſeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline after the uſual duration. It left the body, in ſome meaſure, free from diſeaſe; but ſo completely deranged in the vital functions, that the action of living, though it often went on for a few hours, could not be continued long. In this manner, the hour of death was frequently protracted to the even day; yet death happened ſometimes on the even days, from another cauſe. The decline of the paroxyſm, which in many caſes was hardly perceptible, in others was very plain. The diſeaſe terminated; but a new one recurring, after a ſhort interval, ſpeedily put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to exiſtence. In the mild fever of Jamaica, death uſually approached in the gradual manner I have juſt deſcribed; yet in caſes of much violence and malignity, the fatal termination was frequently on an odd day. In ſuch caſes the patient died in the height of the paroxyſm, carried off by convulſions, apoplexy, or other accident.</p>
            <p>Thoſe authors, who, ſince the time of Aſclepiades, have denied the power of critical days in fevers, are numerous; and many of them poſſeſs conſiderable authority in the medical world. Their opinions, however, cannot be conſidered as of great influence in the preſent caſe, though they may aſſert, that they never have obſerved the pre-eminence of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular days in terminating febrile diſeaſes; ſuch an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion means but little; unleſs its author convinces us, that he has adopted a method of inveſtigation by which thoſe regular movements, if they actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028890_0057_0FDE682958340F68"/>
could not fail to be diſcovered. Truth in the preſent caſe, can only be known from minute and careful obſervation; but a train of minute obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not likely to be the work of a buſy phyſician; and one, who is little employed, has not ſufficient materials in his practice to engage his attention to a continued purſuit. I conſider it as my own good fortune, to have been placed between the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of idleneſs and too much buſineſs. In the country where I reſided for ſome time, the movements of nature were generally ſo diſtinct, as to be obſerved without much difficulty; my practice likewiſe was ſufficient to employ my mind, and not more than it could comprehend eaſily; ſo that I had ſufficient lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to write down, and to digeſt the obſervations which I have related above. They afford, if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not, ſome facts which are preciſe and pointed; and which ſuperſede a multitude of arguments. I will not venture to ſay, that they remove all the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery from this dark ſubject; but I cannot help flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering myſelf, that they point out a road by which we may continue our inveſtigations with ſucceſs. The ſubject of critical days is of ſuch importance, as to demand every attention. A knowledge of it gives credibility to our art; whilſt ignorance in this reſpect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the ſource of perpetual miſtake and diſappointment. There are many phyſicians of the preſent day, who treat the idea of critical days with ridicule; but their aſſertions only afford an argument of their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy, and ſuperficial obſervation. The man in reality, who pretends to cure a fever, without a knowledge of the critical periods of nature, is no leſs preſumptuous, than the mariner, who undertakes to conduct a veſſel through the ocean, without being inſtructed in the manner of calculating her courſe.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. OF THE GENERAL REMOTE CAUSES OF INTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITTING AND REMITTING FEVERS.</head>
            <p>THE general remote cauſes of intermitting and remitting fevers have been ſo fully inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by ſeveral eminent writers, particularly by the induſtrious and learned Lanciſi, that little remains to be added: nor perhaps ſhould I have thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, even to have mentioned the ſubject, were it not to take notice of ſome opinions of the late Sir John Pringle, which appear to have been formed too precipitately; and which, I can affirm from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, have been pernicious to the health of thouſands. It would be a very needleſs oſtentation to adduce the authority of the ancients, to prove the general ſource of the diſeaſe which is the ſubject of the preſent trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. The hiſtorians, no leſs than the phyſicians of every age, do not entertain a doubt, that fevers of the intermitting and remitting kind, owe their origin to exhalations from ſwampy and moiſt grounds. Daily experience ſtill proves it; and there are few men whoſe obſervations are ſo circumſcribed, as not to know, that it is in the neighbourhood of ſwamps, and near the banks of freſh water rivers, that thoſe diſorders chiefly prevail. But though it is only in the above ſituations, that intermitting and remitting fevers are more peculiarly epidemic; yet it likewiſe deſerves to be remarked, that, independent of the particular circumſtances of ſoil and local ſituation, the endemic of champaign countries is ſubject, in a greater or leſs degree, to an appearance of period<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical revolution. Mud and ſtagnant water, in every climate, poſſeſs the materials of the cauſe of this ſpecies of diſeaſe; but a combination of other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028890_0059_0FDE6833E1237D70"/>
is required to give them activity. Among the principal of thoſe circumſtances, which call forth this action, we may reckon the influence of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful ſun. Hence, (as is commonly known), ſome ſituations, which, in the colder months of winter, are diſtinguiſhed for no particular diſeaſe, in the hot months of ſummer and autumn, are obſerved to be moſt malignantly unhealthful.</p>
            <p>The nature of this exhalation or cauſe of fever, though it has long been a ſubject of enquiry, remains ſtill unknown. We plainly perceive it to be of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious degrees of force, and in various ſtates of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centration; and we can eaſily conceive it to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly modified and combined;—but we go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It has been ſaid, to poſſeſs a ſeptic principle; but this alone will ſcarcely be thought ſufficient, to account for the very peculiar manner in which it affects the human race. Some other quality is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily joined with it, which our ſenſes cannot lay hold of. But though the ingenuity of man has not hitherto been able to penetrate the intimate nature of this cauſe of fever, we ſtill have it in our power, in ſome degree, to trace its effects on the human con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. We plainly perceive that an habitual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure to it, is peculiarly <hi>unfriendly</hi> to the principle of life, and in a very remarkable manner ſhortens the period of exiſtence. In proof of this I mention from good authority, that white females, born and conſtantly reſiding in the lower diſtricts of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Georgia in America, have ſeldom been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to live beyond the age of forty. Males, ſometimes approach near to fifty; while Europeans, who had arrived at manhood before they came to the country, often attain a good old age. The fact is curious, and ſhews, in a ſtrong point of view, the deleterious quality of the air of thoſe climates. But though the general nature of the country, which I have juſt now mentioned, is unhealthy in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028890_0060_0FDE6834A44051B8"/>
yet there are ſituations, in the Carolinas and Virginia, which are deſtructive of life in a ſtill more remarkable manner. There is not on record, I am credibly informed, an inſtance of a perſon born at Peterſborough in Virginia, and conſtantly reſiding in the ſame place, who has lived to the age of twenty-one. When the Britiſh army marched through this province, in the year 1781, I had the opportunity of ſeeing a native of this town, who was then in his twentieth year; but he was ſaid to be the firſt, who had ever attained ſo advanced an age. He was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepid, as if from the defects of time, and it did not appear that he could ſurvive many months. Yet it is not a little curious, that this man had never been much confined with ſickneſs. The reſiding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the ſame pernicious air, ſeemed alone to have been ſufficient ſo remarkably to accelerate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepitude. But though the inſtances I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, afford ſufficient proof, that this miaſma is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to the principle of life; yet we are by no means inſtructed, as to the manner, by which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo. This ſeems to be one of the arcana of nature; and it will profit little to proſecute it farther by conjecture. It will, however be an object of utility to mark the ſoils and ſituations in which the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moſt abounds, and to trace the cauſes which heighten or lower its activity.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory of the remote cauſes of intermitting and remitting fevers, with all the circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with them, having been, as I ſaid before, ſo fully inveſtigated by others, I ſhall only add a few curſory remarks, where the information does not ſeem to be ſufficiently preciſe, or where the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which have been made, are not juſtifiable by experience. It is an opinion, which, though it did not originate with Sylvius de le Boe, evidently gained weight from his authority—that a mixture of ſalt with freſh water, as corrupting more eaſily, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028890_0061_0FDE6834A44051B8"/>
a more noxious exhalation than freſh water alone. Lanciſi has mentioned the obſervation; and Sir John Pringle conſiders it as an eſtabliſhed fact; but the evidence, by which he attempts to ſupport his opinion, is not deciſive. It would be in vain to deny, that the neighbourhood of lakes or rivers, with a mixture of ſalt water, is often highly unhealthful; yet we may affirm with confidence, that it is ſeldom more ſo, than where the lakes and rivers are perfectly unmixed. In proof of this aſſertion, I might adduce the example of Savanna la Mar in Jamaica, or draw inſtances from the numerous iſlands on the coaſt of the Carolinas; where ſea and river water are often blended together in various proportions; to which might be added, the more particular evidence of the relative healthineſs of the banks of rivers. So far as I have obſerved, the uſual endemic was leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and leſs formidable on the banks of rivers, after their waters became mixed with thoſe of the ſea, than before this happened; unleſs the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were in other reſpects more favourable for the production of the diſeaſe. Hence there is but little reaſon for ſuppoſing, that there actually exiſts any degree of mixture of ſalt with freſh water, at leaſt of running water, which abſolutely heightens the noxious quality of the exhalation. The above is an opinion of ſufficient conſequence to demand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation: but there is another advanced by this celebrated author, worſe founded, and of ſtill greater concern, which I ſhall likewiſe mention. From an idea that a free circulation of air, is of all things the moſt eſſential to the preſervation of health, Sir John Pringle enjoins in a very poſitive manner, not only that open ground, but that the banks of large rivers ſhould be choſen, in preference to other ſituations, for the encampment of troops. This author's opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of information were good; his opinion has therefore gained weight, and his advice, I am afraid,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028890_0062_0FDE683785CD2B20"/>
has been often fatally followed. It would be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult taſk to produce teſtimonies, from both ancient and modern hiſtory, of the unhealthineſs of thoſe ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, which Sir John Pringle has thought proper to recommend; but at preſent I ſhall confine myſelf to that, which has more immediately fallen under my own obſervation. The inſtance I ſhall mention, is only a ſingle one; but it proves ſo clearly the danger of encamping on the banks of freſh water rivers, as to render all others ſuperfluous. In June 1780, the firſt battalion of the 71ſt regiment was detached to the Cheraws, where it encamped on open ground, within five hundred paces of the river Pedee. The people of the country, taught by experience, ſuggeſted the propriety of drawing back the encampment into what is called the Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>-barren, aſſigning as the cauſe of their advice, that the diſtance, as well as the cover of the wood, might be a ſecurity againſt the damps of the river, which were obſerved to be extremely noxious in that climate. A poſition in wood, acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible on all ſides, would not perhaps have been mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; ſo that no alteration was made. The other bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion of the regiment joined in July. It arrived in perfect health, and encamped likewiſe on open ground; but ſtill nearer the river. In a fortnight the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fever began to make its appearance; and in leſs than three weeks, more than two thirds of the men were ill; whilſt ſcarcely one of the officers had eſcaped. The officers, it muſt be remarked, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped in the rear of the men, and immediately on the bank of the river, the courſe of which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly ſlow at this place; while its banks, though high, were oozy and foul. There are few inſtances on record perhaps, where a degree of ſickneſs, greater than the preſent, has been obſerved in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time. The firſt battalion, however, did not ſuffer in the ſame proportion. The ground
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028890_0063_0FDE683785CD2B20"/>
of encampment was not only at a greater diſtance from the river; but being alſo nearer to a wood, many of thoſe, who were not confined by their duty to a particular ſpot, found a convenient ſhelter in its ſhade, from the powerful heat of the ſun. Theſe I muſt not omit to mention, were the leaſt ſickly of the whole encampment. The above is an important fact. It proves clearly, that no ideal circulation of air can counterbalance the noxious exhalations from rivers; and it likewiſe affords a preſumption, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of danger, there is ſafety in the ſhelter of wood. But with regard to this, no abſolute rule can be given. It muſt generally be decided by local circumſtances, whether wood, or open ground are to be preferred for the encampment of troops. Upon the whole, however, there are many reaſons to induce us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that as an encampment is not only more mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in the body of a wood, than in open ground ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by woods; ſo it is likewiſe more ſafe with reſpect to health; particularly if within the reach of effluvia from ſwamps or rivers. The reaſon which offers is obvious. The wood not only ſtops the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of noxious vapours carried from a diſtance; but it alſo covers the earth from the immediate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſun—the powerful cauſe of exhalation; in doing which, it perhaps, does more than counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance the leſs free circulation of air, or the greater dampneſs of the ground. But leſt the authority I have mentioned, ſhould not be thought ſufficient, the opinion receives farther confirmation from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ancients. Hiſtories abound with exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of deſtructive epidemics, which have followed the cutting down of groves, which covered mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes, or which intercepted the progreſs of marſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation. America alſo furniſhes daily inſtances of a ſimilar truth. In this country the unhealthineſs of a place is often obviouſly increaſed, by cutting down the woods of the neighbouring ſwamps: hence no
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028890_0064_0FDE6841AF8D4F30"/>
rule is more liable to exceptions, than that which has been ſo generally enforced; <abbr>viz.</abbr> that clearing a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of its woods invariably renders it healthy: unleſs the grounds be drained and cultivated, as well as cleared, the effect is likely to be the reverſe.</p>
            <p>It would be curious and uſeful, could we trace this miaſma or cauſe of fever in its progreſs. I do not deny that the noxious exhalation may be acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally enveloped in fogs; but it is not neceſſarily ſo; and I add, that the dews of night, unleſs as an exciting cauſe, are leſs pernicious than has generally been imagined. Low grounds, in the ſame manner, are not always unhealthy; as high and dry ſituations ſometimes afford no protection againſt the ravages of this diſeaſe. The ſituation of the encampment which the 71ſt regiment occupied at King's-bridge, in the year 1778, affords a curious and direct proof of the truth of this opinion. About two hundred paces to the right of the ſpot, on which the tents were pitched, was a tract of low and ſwampy ground; but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſituation was dry, and of conſiderable eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The right was <hi>particularly</hi> ſo; yet it was principally on the right, where the diſeaſe raged with violence. The left, though on low ground, over which fogs frequently hung till late in the day, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in a much ſmaller proportion. From this we might infer, that a dry and elevated ſituation is by no means exempted from intermitting and remitting fevers: but the great degree of ſickneſs, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to thoſe people, who not being confined by the nature of their duty to one particular ſpot, pitched their tents on a hill in the rear of the encampment, proves it clearly. The ground, which thoſe perſons made choice of was directly in the tract of air, which blew over the ſwamp. It was dry and ſcarcely ever covered with fogs; yet there was not an individual among them who encamped upon it, who did not ſuffer from this raging epidemic. The preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028890_0065_0FDE6842C6026BF0"/>
with many others which I might adduce, leaves little room to doubt, that inſtead of expoſing encampments to ſtreams of air, which blow from rivers or ſwamps, it ought to be our principal buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to guard againſt thoſe noxious effluvia, by the interpoſition of woods or riſing grounds. Exhalations which are the cauſes of fevers are ſubtile, and ſeem to be pernicious, chiefly in their aſcent:—viſible damps or night dews are comparatively innocent.</p>
            <p>So great is the importance of preſerving the health of an army in the field, that the choice of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campments ought to be made a ſubject of particular enquiry. The opinion of Sir John Pringle on this head, (which, in fact, is an opinion of theory rather than obſervation), has been followed too long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination. The directions of this author are influenced wholly by the dread he entertained of a contagious or hoſpital fever; but a contagious fever, is ſeldom a diſeaſe of the field; and has, perhaps, ſcarcely ever been known to make its appearance in a moving camp. Diſeaſes of the field are often epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic, ſometimes malignant, but rarely contagious. I even doubt if the dyſentery, whilſt a camp-diſeaſe, is ſo in any remarkable degree. It was not ſo at leaſt in America, in thoſe campaigns, where I had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of knowing the ſtate of the army.</p>
            <p>The general remote cauſe of intermitting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fevers, conſiſts, as was mentioned before, in inviſible exhalations floating in the air. Theſe are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> copious in ſome ſituations than in others; and appear to be rendered more or leſs active by a great variety of cauſes. Among the number of thoſe cauſes which have been accuſed of exciting fever, it has been uſual to reckon exceſs in drinking. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that this cauſe, in ſeveral caſes, has brought forth the diſeaſe, when it probably would not have otherwiſe appeared; yet it has been likewiſe obſerved that a debauch of wine has ſometimes reſtored the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028890_0066_0FDE684445E621C0"/>
body to health, when languiſhing under the influence of this diſorder in an obſcure or irregular form. The moderate uſe of wine, however, has been generally recommended as a preſervative in times of great heat, and epidemic ſickneſs:—and under limitations it undoubtedly is of uſe. In a time of very preſſing calamity, the oracle of Delphi gave its ſanction to the preſcription, and hiſtory bears teſtimony to its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. But beſides exceſs in drinking, cold and fatigue have likewiſe been conſidered among exciting cauſe of fever. In ſhort, whatever exhauſts or diminiſhes the activity of the powers of life, may be juſtly viewed in this light. Yet ſtill I muſt obſerve that neither cold, fatigue, nor any of the cauſes of this train, give occaſion to a proper intermitting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fever, unleſs the prediſpoſition to the diſeaſe be particularly ſtrong. As a proof of this, I muſt beg leave to mention a fact, which fell under my own obſervation. In an expedition into South Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina, in the year 1779, a part of the army was near five hours in paſſing Puriſburg ſwamp. The men were always up to the middle, ſometimes up to the neck in water. The cold and fatigue were both very great, and a fit of intermitting fever was the conſequence in a great number of the ſoldiers: yet it was only in a few inſtances that the diſeaſe went through a regular courſe, though there was even a general pre-diſpoſition to it, in the habits of almoſt all the men who compoſed the detachment. The moſt of them had ſuffered from it ſeverely the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding autumn; and a temporary return of it, was generally obſerved to follow any extraordinary exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the application of a debilitating cauſe. The above cauſes are generally reckoned exciting cauſes of fever; but beſides theſe there are ſeveral others of conſiderable power, which as being commonly known, I ſhall not now ſpend time in enumerating. There however ſtill remains one, which, though
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028890_0067_0FDE6848D4544110"/>
very univerſal, and perhaps more powerful than any other, has hitherto been little attended to. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the new and full moon, in ſome degree, perhaps in every part of the globe, but particularly in the Weſt-Indies, appears to be connected with the invaſion and relapſe of fevers, in a very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner. This obſervation has been hinted ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely by one or two authors; the idea has been treated with ridicule by others: and it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that the facts, which have hitherto been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in ſupport of the opinion, are extremely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ague and equivocal. I ſhall therefore enter a little more minutely into the ſubject, and ſtate circumſtantially the evidence, from which I have been led to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the approach to new and full moon, as a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exciting cauſe of fever.</p>
            <p>That the moon exerts ſome influence on the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frame, and that her different appearances are more or leſs connected with the progreſs and iſſue of diſeaſes, does not ſeem to have altogether eſcaped the notice of the ancients. In a fragment of Hippocrates, in the edition of Vander Linden, we find a detail of the different aſpects of the moon and planets, with their combined influence on the fate of diſeaſes; but the ſtyle and manner of this little tract are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, that I do not pretend to underſtand its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Galen had likewiſe ſome obſcure ideas on the ſubject; but he has left us nothing clear and explicit. The Arabian writers are alſo confuſed and inaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſo that the firſt circumſtantial evidence of the influence, or connexion of the moon with the human body, is found in the works of Ballonius, a French phyſician of the ſixteenth century. The fact which this author records, though not altogether in point, is curious. A Pariſian lady of quality appears by the account of Ballonius, to have been very ſingularly affected during an eclipſe of the ſun. Her complaint threatened nothing dangerous, and her phyſicians
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028890_0068_0FDE68774F3C8B10"/>
were amuſing themſelves with obſerving the progreſs of the eclipſe, when they were ſuddenly ſummoned to her aſſiſtance. In the moment when the eclipſe was deepeſt, ſhe had the appearance of dying; but theſe threatening ſymptoms decreaſed with the decreaſe of the eclipſe; ſo that ſhe at laſt returned to her former ſtate. This is only a ſolitary inſtance, and perhaps might be reckoned accidental. We may however add to it the general teſtimony of Ramazzini, who lived at Modena in the beginning of the preſent cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. This author's obſervations, indeed, are by no means preciſe; yet he was convinced by them, that the courſe of Epidemics was conſiderably influenced by the particular ſtate of the moon. It is almoſt needleſs to mention Dr. Mead, who wrote a treatiſe expreſsly on the moon's power on the human body. The facts which this writer has collected, afford a reaſonable preſumption, that this planet is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome influence in ſeveral diſeaſes to which man is liable; but we find not any thing in the work, which particularly relates to fevers. I ſhall mention a fact recorded by Dr. Grainger. It is the moſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial I have yet met with; and the ſtrongeſt to be found perhaps in the writings of any European phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. Dr. Grainger, who was a ſurgeon of the army, ſerved in the Netherlands about the years 1746 and 47, and wrote a treatiſe on the intermitting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of that country. Among other obſervations he takes notice of a circumſtance which occurred to him at that time, and which he then conſidered as ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly curious; <abbr>viz.</abbr> that twenty of the men of the regiment, of which he had the charge, were ſeized with this fever, which was then epidemic, on the day of a ſolar eclipſe. He has not made any application of the fact. It furniſhes however a very ſubſtantial evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, of the influence or connexion of this planet with the invaſion of febrile diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>It appears to have been long known in India, that
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028890_0069_0FDE6F0ECB10D708"/>
fevers have a tendency to relapſe about the new and full moon, and particularly at the time of eclipſes but Dr. Lind of Windſor is the firſt, who brought the knowledge of the fact to Europe. In an inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gural diſſertation, publiſhed at Edinburgh (I do not exactly recollect the year), this author obſerves, that this opinion prevailed very generally in the Eaſt. He adds likewiſe, that ſome inſtances occurred in his own practice, which gave him cauſe to believe that the fact was well founded. Dr. Lind continued of this way of thinking for ſeveral years after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to England. He does not indeed at preſent deny the fact. He only ſuggeſts that it may admit of a different explanation, from that which he had given in his firſt publication. The ſpring tides, as they overflow the low grounds, according to his preſent opinion, afford a more probable cauſe of the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon increaſe of fevers about the new and full moon, than the direct influence of the planet itſelf. I will take the liberty however to add, that this opinion has been offered to the public, from a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect view of the ſubject. I can affirm, even from the confined circle of my own experience, that a connexion, between the moon and the invaſion of fevers, certainly takes place in diſtricts remote from the ſea; and I believe it is generally known, that a fever, or the paroxyſm of fever, is not commonly the inſtantaneous conſequence of expoſure to its remote cauſe; which ought to be the caſe, if this author's reaſoning were juſt.</p>
            <p>The next, and indeed the only author who has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten profeſſedly on the influence of the moon in fevers, is Dr. Balfour; a gentleman who reſided ſeveral years in India, and who practiſed with reputation in the ſervice of the Company. This author pretends to have inveſtigated the ſubject with care and attention; but there appears in reality, to be more theory and general aſſertion in the treatiſe than circumſtantial
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028890_0070_0FE16FCF0A20A6C0"/>
fact. The reſult of his obſervations he informs us, amounts to this: <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the three days which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, and the three days which follow new and full moon, are remarkable for the invaſion and relapſe of fevers; that the day of the full moon, and the day of the change of the moon, are the moſt remarkable of all: and farther, that the days which follow, are, in general, more remarkable than thoſe which precede.</p>
            <p>I have now brought together the ſubſtance of what is found in the writings of thoſe authors who have mentioned curſorily, or treated profeſſedly of this ſubject. There is not in any part of it, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the inſtance recorded by Dr. Grainger, any thing accurate and preciſe enough to enable us to form an opinion. What has fallen under my own obſervation, I would flatter myſelf, is leſs ambiguous; and though it may not be ſo explicit, perhaps, as to eſtabliſh the doctrine completely, it may at leaſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt us, I hope, in approaching nearer to the truth.—I ſhall relate it in a few words.</p>
            <p>When I arrived in Jamaica, in the year 1774, I had no other knowledge of the influence of the moon in fevers, than what I retained from a curſory reading of Dr. Lind's diſſertation. I remember, however, to have mentioned the circumſtance to ſeveral prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, who had lived many years in the iſland. As I conceived there was a ſimilarity between the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of Jamiaca and Bengal, I thought it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that ſome of the practitioners of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in which I then was, might ſupply me with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory information on the ſubject. There were none of them, however, who acknowledged that they had ever obſerved any connection between the moon and febrile diſeaſes; neither were there many of them, who ſeemed diſpoſed to give credit to its exiſtence. Twelve months or more elapſed without my having paid any further regard to the fact, when an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028890_0071_0FDE78B86164D7E8"/>
relapſe of fever, happening near the time of full moon, recalled Dr. Lind's obſervation to my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. It likewiſe brought to mind a circumſtance, which till then I had overlooked. I had ſeen fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, though without attending to it particularly, that three or four of the ſoldiers of a company of the 60th regiment, who were quartered at Savanna la Mar, and of whom I had the care, were attacked with fever on the ſame day; whilſt it ſeldom happened, that any other febrile illneſs made its appearance in the garriſon, for the enſuing fortnight. This having been obſerved oftener than once, at the time the moon was near full, a hint ſuggeſted itſelf, that the cauſe, which was ſaid to influence relapſes in India, might here have an effect on the original invaſion. But in order to aſcertain the truth of this conjecture, which I conſidered as a matter of ſome importance, I provided myſelf with the almanack of the year 1776, and marked, in the blank leaf of it, the preciſe date of attack, of all thoſe fevers which came under my care. In looking over thoſe memoranda at the end of the year, I found I had put down thirty caſes of proper remitting fever, the invaſion of twenty-eight of which was on one or other of the ſeven days, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceding new or full moon; that is in the ſecond and laſt quarters. The ſame plan of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was continued through the following year, and the reſult, though not exactly the ſame, was ſimilar. Of twenty-eight caſes, which where found in the almanack, twenty-two were in the periods above-mentioned: that is in the ſecond and laſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the moon. It deſerves however to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that three of thoſe ſix caſes, which were not in the common period of invaſion, happened ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually on the day of new moon;—a few hours after the change had taken place. But beſides thoſe caſes of proper remitting fever which I have mentioned,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028890_0072_0FDE78CECA3528C0"/>
there were likewiſe found in the almanack many days fevers and ſlight feveriſh diſorders, the invaſion of the greateſt number of which was likewiſe in the uſual period.</p>
            <p>The above is a literal ſtate of the caſe as it ſtood in the almanack:—ſome remarks and obſervations, however, were added, of which the following are the principal: <abbr>viz.</abbr> That, though the whole of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and laſt quarters of the moon is included in this period of invaſion; yet the four days immediately preceding new and full moon, were more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly diſtinguiſhed for thoſe febrile attacks: that in the dry ſeaſon, which is reckoned the moſt healthy, the time of invaſion was more cloſely connected with the new and full moon, than in the wet and ſickly months, particularly when the ſickneſs was epidemic, or of a bad kind: and laſtly, that this influence, or connexion was more apparent in the ſoldiers of the garriſon, who were expoſed to few occaſions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, exceſs in drinking excepted, than in the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the town and country, whoſe occupations carried them oftner to places of unhealthy ſituation; or whoſe modes of life obliged them to ſubmit to more various hardſhips or to greater fatigues than fell to the lot of a ſoldier in times of peace.</p>
            <p>I ſhall further beg leave to add, that I went to join the army in America, in the year 1778; and that I continued in that country, the train of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on this ſubject, which I had begun in the Weſt Indies. The regiment, in which I ſerved, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped during the months of June and July on a healthy part of York-iſland. Fevers were rare; and the time of invaſion, of ſuch as did appear, was chiefly confined to the ſecond and laſt quarters of the moon. In the beginning of Auguſt, the encampment was removed to King's-bridge, where it occupied a very unhealthy ſituation. The intermitting fever ſoon
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028890_0073_0FDE78EBD9F33810"/>
made its appearance. It extended in ſome degree to the whole battalion; but raged with particular vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on the right, which bordered on low and ſwampy ground. The approach to new and full moon never failed, even in this climate, to increaſe the number of the ſick; yet it deſerves to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that this increaſe was always ſmaller in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, in that part of the battalion, which lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to the ſwamp, where the diſeaſe was highly epidemic, than in the other extremity of the encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where it prevailed in a leſs degree. But ſtill upon the whole, when the regiment moved from their ground, in the beginning of November, of a hundred caſes of intermitting fever, which were marked in the almanack, eighty were found to have commenced in the uſual period of invaſion; that is, in the ſecond and laſt quarters of the moon. It is ſomewhat remarkable, that relapſes were in a ſmaller proportion. This regiment, ſome parts of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical hiſtory of which I deſcribe, embarked on an expedition for the ſouthward in November, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at its deſtination in Georgia, in the latter end of the year. It remained in the ſouthern provinces, and ſerved every campaign till the capitulation at York-town. The ſame train of obſervation was continued during this intervening ſpace, and the ſame influence of the moon ſeemed in general to prevail; but the notes having been loſt, I cannot now exactly aſcertain the degree in which this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence took place. Of this, however, I am certain, that even in times of the greateſt epidemic ſickneſs, when the connexion was evidently weakeſt, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſick was generally doubled in the periods approaching to new or full moon.</p>
            <p>We cannot avoid concluding, from the facts which I have ſtated above, that the approach to new and full moon, or ſomething connected with that approach, may be juſtly conſidered as a powerful exciting cauſe
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028890_0074_0FDE78F178A0F2C0"/>
of fever. The circumſtances, indeed, which I have mentioned, are ſo clear and unequivocal as to leave little room for doubt: nor did I entertain any, till I found that the obſervations of Dr. Balfour, on this ſubject, were ſo ſtrikingly different from mine. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and Jamaica are diſtant from each other; yet few people will be diſpoſed to believe, that ſo great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of a general cauſe has ariſen ſolely from this diverſity of climate. Dr. Balfour muſt ſpeak for himſelf. For my own part, I can only ſay, that what I ſaw I have related with truth. As I have told the manner in which the idea aroſe, with the manner in which the inveſtigation was conducted, I leave the concluſion to be formed by the reader.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF FEVER.</head>
            <p>THEORIES of the proximate cauſe of fevers, or more properly modifications of theories, are ſo numerous, that a whole volume would ſcarcely be ſufficient to give any tolerable account of them. It is a taſk indeed which I ſhall not undertake; yet I hope it will not be altogether ſuperfluous, to give a curſory view of the principles, which have directed the conjectures on this ſubject in different ages. The principles are, in fact, fewer in number than at firſt ſight they appear to be. Phyſicians, ambitious of raiſing their name and reputation, have ſhown great induſtry in multiplying and modifying opinions; yet it does not appear, that they have produced any great variety of theories, which are fundamentally diſtinct.</p>
            <p>The ancients, who were little acquainted with chemical principles, or with the qualities and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the nervous ſyſtem, placed the proximate cauſe of fevers in ſome ſignal ſymptom of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, ſuch as increaſed heat, or abounding bile; or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſtill farther into the fields of ſpeculation, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to attribute it to derangements in the perme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able canals of the body, or to affections of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or circulating maſs of fluids. Hence obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pores, plethora, error loci, lentor and viſcidity, or putrefaction of the humours, have all ſeverally, at different times, or by different authors, been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the immediate or proximate cauſes of this diſeaſe. The theories, which prevailed in the ſchools till the beginning of the ſixteenth century, did not often extend farther than to the cauſes which I have mentioned: but after that period, the diſcoveries of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028890_0076_0FDE78FFFB1313D0"/>
the famous Paracelſus opened a road to innovation in medical reaſoning. The followers of this author, if not numerous, were enthuſiaſtic and vociferous. They indulged in the wildeſt extravagance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; and their opinions, for a conſiderable time, were combated with the authority of Galen, rather than with ſolid argument and accurate reaſoning. At laſt the diſputes between Chemiſts and Galeniſts beginning to ſubſide, the chemical theories became incorporated with the doctrines of the mechanic phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, which were revived more than a century ago, and which ſtill maintain ſome influence in the common ſyſtems of phyſic. In the mean time hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the important diſcovery of the circulation of the blood; but no immediate change, in the manner of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for fevers, enſued immediately in conſequence of it. Yet as from this period the reſearches of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians began to be conducted on a more extended plan, ſome parts of the ſyſtem were brought into view, which had been formerly little attended to. The nervous ſyſtem, which had been in a manner overlooked for many ages, was now found to be of importance in the economy of the animal machine; and authors ſoon began to conſider it, as affording a probable ſeat for the proximate cauſe of fevers. Among the firſt of thoſe authors, who viewed it in this light, we reckon Borelli and Dr. Cole; the one of whom in Italy, the other in England, propoſed much about the ſame time, new and different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about the proximate cauſe of fevers. Their conjectures, I muſt confeſs, are far from being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable;—(that of the Italian is ſcarcely ingenious) yet they deſerve to be mentioned in this place, as being among the firſt attempts to bring into view a part of the ſyſtem, which is very eſſential in enabling us to account for many appearances in febrile diſeaſes. It is commonly believed, that the nervous ſyſtem was not diſcovered to be a part of material import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028890_0077_0FDE79079E33C408"/>
either in the functions of health, or in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of ſickneſs, till the laſt century. This, in fact was generally the caſe; yet I muſt not omit to mention, that we meet with an expreſſion in the writings of Hippocrates, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which might incline us to be of opinion that this phyſician was not altogether ignorant of the influence of the nervous power; and that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually conſidered this principle of the conſtitution to be of much importance in the management and cure of diſeaſes. After Hippocrates, Van Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, under the whimſical appellation of Archeus, aſſerted more directly the dominion of the ſentient principle. He has indeed applied its operations more particularly to aſſiſt him in explaining the theory of fevers; but it has been a misfortune that the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of this author have been generally leſs attended to, than perhaps they deſerve: ſo that it has been cuſtomary to conſider, the celebrated Hoffman as the firſt, who ſuggeſted the idea, that the proximate cauſe of fever depends on a derangement or affection of the nervous ſyſtem; at leaſt he is the firſt, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered a ſyſtem on the ſubject, which can in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree be conſidered as rational and conſiſtent.</p>
            <p>It will not be an eaſy taſk, to give a clear and diſtinct view of that, which has been conſidered by the ancients, as the proximate or immediate cauſe of fevers. The language of the earlieſt writers is not by any means preciſe in this reſpect; and we ſhall frequently, perhaps, have difficulty from the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of expreſſion, to diſtinguiſh from each other the definition, the remote and occaſional, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and proximate cauſe of the diſeaſe. The proximate cauſe of a diſeaſe, it muſt be remembered, is a cauſe which conſtantly and uniformly produces its reſpective complaint; and without which this complaint cannot even for a moment exiſt. It is, in ſhort, the firſt eſſential derangement, which the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028890_0078_0FDE790D507BE4F8"/>
of this cauſe produces in the frame of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer: but though we know this to be certainly true, yet we have made no progreſs in diſcovering the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this derangement. The firſt action of the cauſe of fever is obſcure, and ſome part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement which it occaſions, has hitherto probably paſſed over unnoticed, even by the moſt accurate obſervers.</p>
            <p>If we attempt to give a view of the ſucceſſive conjectures, which, at different times, have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the public concerning the proximate cauſe of fevers, it will be neceſſary to begin with Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates. We may collect very clearly from the writings of this author, that an increaſe of the heat of the body had afforded, to the ſtill more ancient phyſicians, the firſt idea of the eſſence or immediate cauſe of fevers. This ſeems to have been the idea of the moſt ancient profeſſors of medicine. Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates in ſome degree ſubſcribed to it; yet this author ſeems likewiſe to doubt, if the ſimple increaſe of heat alone is ſufficient to conſtitute a proper fever, or that it can with propriety be conſidered as the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential proximate cauſe of the diſeaſe. But though Hippocrates raiſes this objection to the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning heat, yet he ſtill leaves us in doubt with regard to the opinion which we ought to adopt. His ideas are fluctuating and uncertain. We find in the different parts of his works, obſtruction, ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora, miaſmata or bile, all ſeparately conſidered, as immediate cauſes of fever. But ſuch cauſes, I may add, where they do take place, are in fact only more remote or diſtant cauſes. Neither miaſmata, bile, nor obſtruction, are circumſtances on which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of fever invariably and neceſſarily depends; at leaſt ſuch cauſes require to be in a certain ſtate of modification, which is yet undefined, before they are capable of actually producing the diſeaſe. Bile bears a very conſpicuous part in the Hippocratic
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028890_0079_0FDE791389233008"/>
doctrine of fevers. The fabric, indeed, which our author raiſes on this principle, is fanciful, and in many reſpects, ill founded; yet, as modified by the fertile genius of Galen, it paſſed on through a ſucceſſion of many ages: nor is it, even now, altogether baniſhed from the language of practitioners.</p>
            <p>Such are the hints concerning the cauſes of fevers, which I have been able to collect from the writings of Hippocrates. The expreſſions are often obſcure or equivocal; and we can ſcarcely ſay, that an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion can be formed from them which deſerves the name of a theory. The ſucceſſors of this great phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician were, perhaps, too ſenſible of this defect; and therefore attempted to fabricate other opinions, which might be more explicit and diſtinct. Among the firſt of thoſe attempts, we may reckon the hypotheſis of Diocles of Caryſtus, a phyſician who lived at an early period, and who was highly eſteemed by his contemporaries. Fever, according to this author, is not ſo much a primary diſeaſe, as a ſymptom of ſome other affection. Wounds, tumours, and many other accidental cauſes, have certainly been obſerved to give riſe to ſymptoms which have been uſually deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated fever; yet neither wounds nor inflammations have been generally obſerved to give riſe to a proper fever. I will not however deny, that wounds, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, occaſionally prove exciting cauſes of proper fever, where there is a ſtrong diſpoſition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the diſeaſe, exiſting in the conſtitution, at the time thoſe accidents have happened. It does not appear that this theory of Diocles gained much ground with ſucceeding writers; yet it was, perhaps, the cauſe of introducing the diſtinction of primary and ſymptomatic into the hiſtory of fevers; a diſtinction, which is frequently of conſequence in practice. But I muſt further add, that though the opinion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocles is not admiſſible in its literal meaning; yet, in a modified ſenſe, it is not altogether without foundation.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028890_0080_0FDE791AA9855560"/>
The ſymptoms of fevers are undoubtedly indications of a derangement of the body from its healthy ſtate; but when we have ſaid this, we can ſay no more.—The nature of the derangement, which in its firſt beginnings is not obvious to the ſenſes, neither the ancients, nor the writers of the preſent age have, as yet, been able to aſcertain.</p>
            <p>Not very long after Diocles, Eraſiſtratus, a native of the iſland of Cea, and phyſician at the court of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus, furniſhed a conjecture concerning the cauſe of fevers, which is mentioned both by Celſus and Galen, and which appears to have originated in his anatomical reſearches. As Eraſiſtratus directed his purſuits particularly to the ſanguiferous ſyſtem: ſo impreſſed, perhaps, with an idea of the importance of that part of the body on which his thoughts had been chiefly employed, he ventures to hazard the opinion, That the immediate cauſe of fever depends on a certain error loci, or transfuſion of the red blood into the arterial channels: and this, he moreover adds, proceeds from repletion,—The opinion originates from an anatomical error, and on that account need not detain us any longer.</p>
            <p>The next author, of whoſe opinion on this ſubject any diſtinct traces have been tranſmitted to us, is Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clepiades, the Bythinian, a man who ſeldom treats the doctrines of his predeceſſors with reſpect. In his rage for innovation, Aſclepiades attempted to change or modify the theories of thoſe who had gone before him, in ſuch manner, as to hope to impoſe a conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the world, which might, at leaſt poſſeſs ſome exterior claims of novelty. He allows with the moſt ancient phyſicians, that the inſeparable ſign of fever, or its eſſential part, conſiſts in an exceſs of heat; but having adopted the doctrine of atoms, which was conveyed to the Greeks by Democritus of Abdera, he pretends to account for the difference of types by a difference in the ſize of the corpuſcles, which he
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028890_0081_0FDE791F8CC7A6F8"/>
ſuppoſes to be formed by a combination of indiviſible atoms. Thus we ſee that obſtruction in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meable canals of the body, in this writer's opinion, conſtitutes the theory of the proximate cauſe of fever: on which principle we may likewiſe conclude, that the modern doctrine of lentor and viſcidity has built its foundation.</p>
            <p>The author, whom I have laſt mentioned, may actually be conſidered as the original founder of the methodic ſect. The principal tenets of this ſect of phyſicians have been tranſmitted to us by Celſus, Caelius Aurelianus, or Galen; but the doctrines, which they promulgated, have not been very fully and perfectly explained. The great diviſion of Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, into ſtrictum et laxum, furniſhes a very ſimple view of diſeaſes. Fevers are included in the firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of derangement; and in this reſpect, may be conſidered as depending on a cauſe ſimilar to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction obſcurely hinted by Hippocrates, or more explicitly deſcribed by Aſclepiades. There is this difference, however, between theſe reſpective opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the earlieſt writers ſeem to have referred the obſtruction to ſome change in the humours or circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating maſs; while the <hi>methodics</hi> appear to have attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted it more directly, to a change in the capacity of the containing veſſels. Hence we may infer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any improper latitude of interpretation, that the ſtrictum of Themiſon and Theſſalus comprehends the ſpaſmodic conſtruction of capillaries, which has lately made ſo conſpicuous a part in the theory of febrile diſeaſes. This theory of the methodics, where the nervous and fibrous ſyſtem have been more regarded than the humours, or circulating maſs of fluids, was principally followed at Rome, for more than a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. At laſt Galen, who was a very unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified admirer of Hippocrates, exerted himſelf ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully in reviving the humoral doctrine of his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the methodic ſect began to ſink rapidly into
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028890_0082_0FDE7925B56357D8"/>
decay; and after a ſhort time its traces were totally obliterated.</p>
            <p>The frequent blanks, in medical hiſtory, make it no eaſy taſk to give a connected view of the fluctuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſyſtems of the ancient phyſicians. The works of every writer of the methodic ſect have periſhed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe of Caelius Aurelianus: neither have we been able to diſcover any new opinion, or modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of opinion, concerning the proximate cauſe of fevers, between the time of Aſclepiades or Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the great commentator of Hippocrates, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of Athenaeus. Athenaeus, who was the head of the ſect of Pneumatics, ſtood high in eſteem among his contemporaries and ſucceſſors. This au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ventured to ſuggeſt a new hypotheſis, or more properly perhaps, only extended, and more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained a doctrine, of which the obſcure traces may be diſcovered at an earlier date. The general cauſe of fever, in this writer's opinion, conſiſts in a putrefaction, or putreſcent ſtate of the humours. Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates ſeems to have entertained ſome indiſtinct idea of the ſame kind; and thoſe, who have been inclined to this way of thinking, both in ancient and in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times, have neither been few in numbers, nor contemptible in authority.</p>
            <p>Galen, who has written on moſt parts of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical ſcience more learnedly than his predeceſſors, has diſcuſſed very fully the ſubject of the proximate cauſe of fevers. Amidſt the luxuriance of this author's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring, it is ſometimes difficult to lay hold of the preciſe idea; at the ſame time, that it is oftener tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than inſtructing to follow him through the maze of his fanciful and inconcluſive reaſonings. I ſhall not therefore enter into a minute detail of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but ſtill I conceive it may be uſeful, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to thoſe who have not the opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting his voluminous, and in ſome reſpects ill digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed works, if I compreſs into narrow compaſs the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028890_0083_0FDE792A511DF928"/>
principles of his general doctrines. In the firſt place, the opinion, hinted by Hippocrates and adopted by moſt of his ſucceſſors, that the eſſence of fever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a certain derangement of heat, is expreſsly maintained by Galen, who explains more elaborately than his predeceſſors the various circumſtances, which influence or modify this general cauſe of the diſeaſe. Galen aſſumes, indeed, as a fundamental poſition, that heat any how, or any where excited, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the heart, and from the heart to the reſt of the body, conſtitutes a fever; yet he afterwards adds more explicitly, that a preternatural heat does not conſtitute a fever, unleſs it is communicated to the heart; which is conſequently to be conſidered as the principal ſeat and reſidence of the febrile affection. Having, as he imagines, eſtabliſhed this fundamental principle, he proceeds to inveſtigate, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, the parts of the body where the heat reſides, and the cauſes by which it is generated, propagated, or ſo modified, as to produce the diſeaſe in its differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent forms. But, that he may the better explain his meaning clearly, he divides fevers into three differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kinds: <abbr>viz.</abbr> the hectic, or habitual, the humoural, and the ephemeral. The firſt he ſuppoſes to ariſe from an affection of the ſolids, or containing parts; the ſecond from ſome derangement of the fluids, or contained parts; and the third from ſome diſturbance of the ſpirits, or that part of the frame which we, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, now diſtinguiſh by the name of nervous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. He adds in the next place, that putrefaction is the medium, by which fever is excited, where the fluids or humours are the ſubject of the diſeaſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity and continuity, where the illneſs affects the habit or ſolid parts; and where the effects are tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and fleeting, he attributes the cauſe principally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the rapid movements of the ſpirits, or nervous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ory, by explaining the different types of humoural
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028890_0084_0FDE792FEF00DA28"/>
fevers, on the ſuppoſition of a ſtate of putrefaction in the different humours, from which he ſuppoſes the diſeaſe to ariſe. On this ſubject he has deviated very materially from his maſter Hippocrates, though he probably drew his ideas from the hints, which are found in that author's works. Hippocrates explains, or attempts to explain the various types of fevers, by a ſimple difference in the quantity of the bile. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, on the contrary, as we have ſaid juſt now, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to account for this phenomenon, by a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of putrefaction in the phlegmatic and bilious humours, which bear ſo conſpicuous a part in his theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical ſyſtem. Thus Galen ſuppoſes, that a putreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent tendency in the blood gives riſe to a continued fever; a ſimilar diſpoſition in the phlegm diſpoſes the diſeaſe to appear in a quotidian form: putrefaction of the yellow bile determines the type to be of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian kind; whilſt a like tendency, in the black bile, regulates the movements of the quartan period.—It is unneceſſary to make any remarks on the baſeleſs fabric, which this author has offered to the world, concerning the proximate cauſe of fevers.—Its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency and inſufficiency are perfectly obvious.</p>
            <p>After the time of Galen there does not appear to have been any material change, in the manner of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for fevers, for many ages. Aetius Amidenus indeed ſuggeſted ſome reſtrictions and explanations in certain ſpecies of fever, which do not ſeem to have been ſo explicitly marked by the commentator of Hippocrates. Inſtead of conſidering putrefaction as the ſole means of exciting heat in every ſpecies of humoural fever, Aetius ventures to inſinuate, that there is no ſtate of actual putrefaction in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or that ſpecies of diſeaſe which is purely inflammato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the cauſe of which appears to be ſimply an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate fermentation or ebullition of the blood. But except in this inſtance, the ſucceeding Greek phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians do not ſeem to have departed, in the leaſt, from
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028890_0085_0FDE792FEF00DA28"/>
the direct footſteps of Galen. The Arabians likewiſe, among the principal of whom we may reckon Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenna, adopted his general doctrines, and modes of reaſoning, only Avicenna defines more expreſsly than others had done before him, that fevers of all deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations ariſe immediately from a preternatural heat of the heart; in doing which, he ſeems to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the influence and power of that quality which preceding authors in looſer terms had conſidered as the general cauſe of febrile diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The doctrines of Galen, with ſome immaterial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations of the Arabian phyſicians, wholly occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the ſchools of medicine, till the beginning of the ſixteenth century, about which time Aureolus Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus Theophraſtus, commonly known by the name of Paracelſus, effected a revolution of opinions, which marks an important period in the hiſtory of the medical art. Paracelſus, who was a man of a ſingular turn of mind, ſpent the earlier part of his life in travelling among the nations of Aſia; where he probably acquired ſome knowledge of chemiſtry, in which ſcience the Arabians appear, even at that time, to have made conſiderable progreſs. The knowledge, which Paracelſus carried home to his native country, was not generally known in Europe. This author applied it with ſucceſs in the cure of ſome deſperate diſeaſes; and acquired uncommon fame from his new and unheard-of remedies. He was an empiric in the theory, no leſs than in the practice of the art; and I may add, that his attempts to overturn the doctrines of the ancients, give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of more effrontery than genius or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The wonderful cures of obſtinate diſeaſes, which he was ſaid to perform; and ſtill more, perhaps, the myſteriouſneſs of his language, which caught the notice of the vulgar, who often imagine that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is concealed under terms, which they do not underſtand, brought followers to his ſtandard. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028890_0086_0FDE793AB044D790"/>
of the proximate cauſe of fevers, were fabricated without difficulty, by the help of thoſe principles, which Paracelſus had introduced to the acquaintance of the world; yet it does not appear, that any theory aroſe, during this period, which had probability, or even ingenuity for its ſupport. The period indeed, during which chemical reaſonings ſo univerſally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, may be ſtyled juſtly enough a period of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical romance: and I ſhould conſider it as a treſpaſs on the patience and good ſenſe of the reader, to ſpend time in refuting the abſurd and incongruous doctrines of ſulphur, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itre or mercury; acid and alkali, or the various modes of fermentations, which for a time filled the writings of phyſicians. The mechanical mode of reaſoning, which ſucceeded, or rather which became incorporated with the doctrines of the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, ſeemed at firſt to promiſe greater advantages: but though theories of fevers were formed by many eminent men, both of the laſt and preſent century, on the principles of the mechanical or chemico-me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical philoſophy; yet there are not any of them, which ſeem to have afforded a ſatisfactory explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubject.—The ſo-much celebrated doctrine of lentor and viſcidity was aſſumed without evidence of its exiſtence, and perſiſted in, without being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to account for the phenomena of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Thoſe conjectures concerning the proximate cauſe of fevers, which I have mentioned hitherto, can ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be ſaid to extend farther than to a particular ſtate of the humours, or circulating maſs of fluids, which, according to the prevailing philoſophy of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ages, have been ſuppoſed to be changed from their natural and healthy ſtate, by chemical or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical derangement. I obſerved before, that it might appear, from an accidental expreſſion in the writings of Hippocrates, that this author was not altogether ignorant of the influence or effects of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>vous power, or ſentient principle. The methodic
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028890_0087_0FDE7940012741F0"/>
ſect likewiſe, may ſeem to have comprehended in the idea which they have given of diſeaſes, that there is ſome derangement of the fibrous ſyſtem; or perhaps that a ſpaſmodic ſtricture of capillaries is actually the immediate cauſe of fever; whilſt Galen every where celebrates the powers of nature or vires naturae me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatrices, which bear in his opinion, a very active part in the cure of febrile diſeaſes. To thoſe vague ideas of the ancients, we may add the more modern and explicit doctrine of Van Helmont, who was a man of genius, learning and obſervation. Van Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont adopted the ſentient principle of Hippocrates; but he alſo applied it in a bolder light than had been done by its original author, and employed its aſſertions more particularly towards the explanation of the cauſe and phenomena of fevers. The enthuſiaſm of this writer diſguſts the philoſophic ſpirit of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age, and we muſt acknowledge, that his ideas are often unphiloſophical and abſurd; yet we muſt likewiſe do him the juſtice to add, that the principle of his doctrine in ſome degree is well founded, and that his views, in many reſpects, are important in practice. I muſt further obſerve, that the efforts of nature, ſo celebrated by Campanella and Sydenham, and even, perhaps, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, of Stahl and his followers, can only be conſidered as modifications of the furious Archeus.—But though the authors I have mentioned, ſeem evidently to have poſſeſſed ſome vague idea of the powers or influence of the nervous ſyſtem; yet there are not any of them, who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to explain its operations by a philoſophical and conſiſtent mode of reaſoning. The period of this improvement is not very remote.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the circulation of the blood was known and fully eſtabliſhed, the heart loſt ſome part of its former importance; whilſt the brain and nerves, which for many ages had been little regarded, roſe into primary and eſſential conſequence. But
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028890_0088_0FDE7945A6E755D8"/>
though the brain and nerves were diſcovered, ſoon after this period, to be the inſtruments of life and motion; yet the laws of this part of the ſyſtem were at firſt only imperfectly underſtood; and the attempts to explain its operations were, for a while, whimſical and abſurd. Willis deſerves ſome credit, as being one of the firſt who brought the general importance of the nervous ſyſtem into view: but Borelli, an Italian mathematician, actually appears to be the firſt who ventured to aſcribe the proximate cauſe of fever, to a particular derangement of this part of the frame. The immediate cauſe of fever, in this author's opinion, depends on ſome unuſual acrimony of the nervous fluid; but it is only neceſſary to obſerve with regard to this doctrine, that a ſuppoſition of acrimonious fluids, where a fluid cannot be proved to exiſt, is ſo perfectly viſionary, as only to deſerve to be mentioned, from its being the firſt attempt to bring this part into view, in accounting for febrile diſeaſe. This hypotheſis, however, though obviouſly ill founded, enjoyed its day of fame. It was ſoon followed by another conjecture, more ingenious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but which was not ſo generally attended to, as the preceding. Dr. Cole of Worceſter, towards the end of laſt century, ſuggeſted an idea, that the proximate cauſe of intermitting fevers depends on a laxity or debility of the brain and origin of the nerves. The ſuppoſition is not ſo improbable; but the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure, which the author has raiſed, is abſurd, and unſupported either by fact or probability. Yet, if we expect Mundy, an author who offered a conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a ſimilar kind, in a work entitled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Borelli and Cole are the only writers prior to the time of Hoffman, who conſidered the nervous ſyſtem, as directly affording a ſeat for the proximate cauſe of fevers. Hoffman, whom I have juſt mentioned, was a celebrated profeſſor at Halle in Saxony. He flouriſhed in the earlier part of the preſent century,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028890_0089_0FDE794A411FD398"/>
publiſhed many volumes, and certainly poſſeſſes the merit of having enlarged our views on the ſubject of fevers. His theory of the proximate cauſe is not only more ingenious, but certainly has more appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of truth, than any other, which had been offered to the public at the time it appeared. The cure of fever conſiſts, in his opinion, in a ſpaſmodic affection of the nervous ſyſtem. It is a truth which few people will attempt to deny, that a ſpaſmodic ſtricture of the ſurface of the body generally takes place in ordinary caſes of fever; yet we muſt perhaps alſo acknowledge with Dr. Cullen, that a ſpaſmodic ſtricture is not certainly and uniformly the firſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part of a febrile diſeaſe. Some other thing is frequently obſerved to precede the ſpaſm, which, in the opinion of the laſt mentioned celebrated profeſſor, has a right to be conſidered as a proximate and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial cauſe. But as the theory of the proximate cauſe, aſſigned by Dr. Cullen, is not only more plauſible and complete than any preceding one; but ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in popularity and fame, it will not be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, if we ſtop to examine it with more attention. The remote cauſes of fever, according to this author, are ſedative powers, applied to the nervous ſyſtem, which diminiſhing the energy of the brain, thereby produce a debility in the whole of the functions, and particularly in the action of the extreme veſſels. Such, however, is at the ſame time the nature of the animal economy, that this debility proves an indirect ſtimulus to the ſanguiferous ſyſtem; whence by the intervention of the cold ſtage and ſpaſm connected with it, the action of the heart and larger arteries is increaſed, and continues to be ſo, till it has had the effect of reſtoring the energy of the brain, of exciting this energy to the extreme veſſels, of reſtoring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their action; and thereby ſpecially overcoming the ſpaſm affecting them: upon the removing of which, the excretion of ſweat, and other marks of
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028890_0090_0FDE794F48FA9D50"/>
relaxation of excretories take place. This theory of fever holds out an appearance of great ſimplicity, and of perfect connexion. I wiſh we could ſay that it had an equal claim to truth: but I am afraid it will be found, on a careful examination, to be no more in reality than an ingenious hypotheſis, the leading prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of which can ſcarcely be proved even to exiſt. I do not pretend to enter deeply into the diſcuſſion of the ſubject; yet I cannot avoid repreſenting, in a few words, ſome circumſtances of difficulty in this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's theory, which are not eaſily reconcileable, either with reaſon or obſervation. It might be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the firſt place, if the remote cauſes of fever are actually of a ſimple ſedative nature; but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I ſhall admit that the firſt principle, which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the profeſſor, is in reality a fact, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to enquire, if the reſt of the doctrine is capable of being defended, even on this foundation. It conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the ſum of Dr. Cullen's theory, as was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, that the remote cauſes of fever occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion debility, or diminiſhed energy of the brain and nervous ſyſtem; that this debility neceſſarily gives riſe to ſpaſm, and increaſed action of the heart and arteries; which continuing for a certain length of time, finally removes the diſeaſe. Thus the different ſtages of fever appear to follow each other as cauſe and effect; and debility in the firſt inſtance, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed neceſſarily to give riſe to reaction. Such a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is not very obvious to reaſon, and has not much ſupport from the analogy of facts. It would be eaſy to mention examples, where the application of debilitating cauſes as is not obſerved to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by obvious reaction of the ſyſtem; but at preſent I ſhall content myſelf with the familiar one of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of cold. It is perfectly well known, that cold, when conſtantly and uniformly applied to the body, even goes ſo far as abſolutely to extinguiſh the powers of life, in a part, or in the whole, without
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028890_0091_0FDE7954B24212D8"/>
our being able to perceive any efforts on the part of nature to ſtop the progreſs of this deſtructive tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. From this we may fairly infer, that common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitating cauſes, at leaſt while they continue to be applied in the ſame conſtant and uniform manner, do not neceſſarily excite the reaction of the ſyſtem: but I will even go farther, and venture to affirm, that ſpaſm and reaction do not neceſſarily follow very great degrees of debility, which appear to proceed from the preſence of a febrile cauſe. During the time I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in America, I had frequent opportunities of witneſſing the truth of this aſſertion. In the ſouthern provinces of that country, particularly in the ſummer and autumnal months, the intermitting fever was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally epidemic in a high degree; but its general cauſe, which was then ſo abounding in the atmoſphere, often injured the actions of life, without producing a regular train of operation; that is, one part of the diſeaſe appeared without that mode of action, which is ſuppoſed, by our author, to be its neceſſary effect. Thus, I have ſeen the moſt extreme degrees of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and langour in all the functions, continue even for eight or ten days, without our being able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſmalleſt marks of ſpaſm, or obvious reac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This inactivity and langour ſometimes vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuddenly; and the body reſumed its ordinary health and vigour, frequently without an evident cauſe. On the next day, however, or perhaps the day following it, the patient was ſurprized with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular paroxyſm of fever. From this it appears very plainly, that if the immediate cauſe of fever actually conſiſts in debility, this debility neceſſarily undergoes a peculiar, but hitherto undefined ſpecies of modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, before it can be conſidered as the cauſe of the ſubſequent parts of the diſeaſe; a conceſſion which leaves us perfectly in our former ſtate of uncertainty and ignorance.</p>
            <p>As it may be concluded from the facts, which I
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028890_0092_0FDE795A98DB4800"/>
have mentioned, that ſpaſm and reaction are not the neceſſary conſequences of the application of debilitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſes, either common or febrile; ſo if we purſue our author's train of reaſoning farther, we ſhall not find his inductions to be very conſiſtent, or very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing. If we are diſpoſed to grant, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote cauſes of fever actually diminiſh the energy of the brain, it is not an obvious inference, that the circumſtances of this diminiſhed energy have the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain effect of exciting the reaction of the ſyſtem. It appears, in ſhort, like aſcribing reſt and motion to the ſame power. But to ſmooth the prominent fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of this apparent inconſiſtency, the ingenious author has thought fit to aſſume a principle, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of which is very ambiguous in its enlarged ſenſe, and very inſufficient in its limited one. Dr. Cullen does not admit of the Italian principle of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; he however aſcribes effects to the vis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae medicatrix, which are not capable of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained mechanically. I mentioned before, that no efforts of nature are perceived to ariſe, under the uniform and conſtant application of a debilitating cauſe; but though this is true, I muſt likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that when theſe debilitating powers, from any cauſe whatever, actually ceaſe to act, abate materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the intenſity of their action, or ſuffer change in its mode, before the vital principle is irrecoverably deſtroyed, nature, which perſiſts in continuing life, and even ſtruggles in attempting to maintain it, may then be ſaid to raiſe efforts, which have a tendency to reſtore the body to its ordinary health. This power, which to a certain degree, reſiſts cauſes of a deſtructive tendency and which endeavours to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore to their original ſtate the derangements of the ſyſtem whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h have actually taken place, is only a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited degree of the vis naturae medicatrix. It is in ſhort, no more than an effort to continue the action of living; yet it is all, which we ſhall, at any time, perhaps, be able to perceive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:028890_0093_0FDE795FD550A270"/>
I have thus mentioned briefly ſome objections, to this celebrated theory of Dr. Cullen. The inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the author is acknowledged to be great; the pains and labour, which he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> beſtowed in complet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his favourite doctrine appear likewiſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; yet I cannot help remarking, that its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are ſtill ſo obvious, that we are unavoidably obliged to be ſatisfied with one of theſe concluſions: <abbr>viz.</abbr> either that the debility, which is ſuppoſed to be the cauſe of fever, is of a peculiar but unknown kind; that it ceaſes to act, or changes its mode of action from an accidental cauſe, or from ſomething in its own nature; or that a reaction ariſes in the ſyſtem, from a principle of conſciouſneſs of the deſtructive tendency of this debilitating power. It is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant with the common laws of the animal economy; that reaction ſhould ariſe in that part of the ſyſtem, where the debilitating influence has been primarily and principally exerted. Suppoſitions of this nature, are only ſubterfuges, and no more in reality than myſterious ways of acknowledging ignorance.</p>
            <p>The opinions I have enumerated above are the principal ones, which have been advanced by medical writers, on the ſubject of the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſe of fevers. Though numerous, they are all reducible to two general claſſes; <abbr>viz.</abbr> either to conjectures, which are totally without foundation; or to circumſtances, which are in fact only ſymptoms or parts of the diſeaſe, ſome of which are more, others leſs eſſential. The proximate cauſe of fever, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peculiar ſtate of the body, on which the diſeaſe, or the ſubſequent parts of the diſeaſe, neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. It is, in ſhort, the firſt eſſential action of the febrile cauſe; but this action is ſo intricate and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be diſcovered, that phyſicians have fought for it in vain for more than two thouſand years. The ancients were ſatisfied with the idea of preternatural heat, excited in the heart, and communicated, by
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028890_0094_0FDE79644EDED2E0"/>
means of the blood and ſpirits, to the reſt of the body. Hoffman, making a bolder ſtep, introduces a ſpaſmodic affection of the moving fibres; and Dr. Cullen, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill farther, lays the principal ſtreſs upon lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor and debility, or weakened action of the nervous energy. Increaſed heat, ſpaſmodic ſtricture and marks of debility, are generally preſent, in various degrees, in the different ſtages of fever; but debility for the moſt part precedes the others; and on this account, if equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſſential, has a preferable right to be conſidered as the firſt part of the diſeaſe. There is ſtill reaſon to doubt if it actually is the firſt. I have myſelf at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended carefully to the manner in which intermitting fevers approach. The firſt thing which I obſerved in others, or what is ſtill more to be depended upon, the firſt thing I felt in myſelf, was uſually a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but a peculiar affection of the ſtomach. The preciſe nature of this affection I am unable to define in words; but I knew it ſo well by experience, that I always conſidered it as a warning, (and it was ſometimes the only warning, which I had,) of the approach of the paroxyſm. It was often accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by flatulence, and it ſometimes preceded the firſt feelings of the languor and debility, nearly the ſpace of an hour. The obſervation of this fact has occured to me frequently; and I cannot avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that it gives room to believe, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which is ſo commonly the fore-runner of fever, inſtead of being the firſt and principal mode of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the febrile cauſe, is only a part of that action,—perhaps not the moſt eſſential. As Hippocrates appears at a very early period to have been perfectly ſenſible, that ſomething beſides a ſimple increaſe of heat was neceſſary to conſtitute a fever; ſo we may now perhaps conclude, with equal reaſon, that debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity has ſome other circumſtances combined with it, which we have not been able to diſcern very clearly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:028890_0095_0FDE7969F5297388"/>
Having ſaid that there are not any of the numerous theories, which have as yet been offered to the public on this important ſubject, in any degree ſatisfactory, it might be expected, perhaps, that I had ſomething of my own to bring forward, which might be more perfect, at leaſt in my own opinion: but I willingly acknowledge, that I have no ſuch pretenſions. After fourteen or fifteen years of careful obſervation, and daily reflexion on the phenomena of fevers, I am obliged to confeſs, that my opinion ſtill remains to be formed. The proximate cauſe of this diſeaſe, is a ſubject of a dark nature. It is ſuch, perhaps, as our limited capacities will never develope. But though we deſpair of ever attaining clear ideas of its ſpecific nature, there are ſtill ſome uſeful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances connected with it, which we comprehend with clearneſs. We know, that the more general remote cauſes of fevers, are certain inviſible exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſometimes more evidently ariſing from marſhy grounds, ſometimes more obſcurely diffuſed in the air, and ſometimes obviouſly proceeding from the bodies of our fellow creatures. We know, likewiſe, that theſe cauſes which are unfriendly to the human conſtitution, are variouſly modified and combined, and of various degrees of force or in various ſtates of concentration; but we proceed no farther with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. We are not able to aſcertain the nature of theſe effluvia, and it is only by conjecture that we trace them in the channels by which they enter the body. The changes which they operate on the ſolids, fluids, or nervous ſyſtem, before their action becomes obvious, are totally unknown to us. We know, though the body lie expoſed to exhalation, even in a concentrated ſtate, that an appearance of diſeaſe is not, generally, the inſtantaneous conſequence. A ſpace of time intervenes, various indeed according to circumſtances, but always ſuch as gives room to believe, that the cauſe requires, and actually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028890_0096_0FDE796EEF9F96E0"/>
a modification, before it is capable of producing a fever, or the paroxyſm of a fever. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances connected with the approach of fevers, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly intermitting fevers, afford an illuſtration of my meaning. The cauſe of the diſeaſe, ſo far from producing the fever immediately when applied to the body, often lurks for a conſiderable time in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, without perceptibly injuring the ordinary actions of life. Sometimes it gives riſe to affections, which are apparently very different from their real nature. Thus a perſon often languiſhes for days, weeks, or even longer. The indiſpoſition ſuddenly and unexpectedly vaniſhes: and the apparent reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of health is ſoon followed by a paroxyſm of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fever. In other caſes again, the attack of the diſeaſe is ſudden; and its formation from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diſtinct. This fact affords a preſumption, that, in conſequence of a particular modification, which is only accompliſhed in a certain ſpace of time, but the nature of which we do not in the leaſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, an aptitude is regenerated between the remote cauſe of the diſeaſe, and the relative ſtate of the body. When the ſtate of the body, and the remote cauſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to, or arrive at a ſtate of mutual correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the diſeaſe is produced. When this ſtate, which I call an aptitude, is changed or deſtroyed, the diſeaſe vaniſhes, or ſuffers a change of form. This is a fact, which cannot be diſputed; and it ſeems to be the extent of our knowledge, on the important ſubject of the proximate cauſe of fevers.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. OF THE GENERAL HISTORY OF THE FEVER OF JAMAICA.</head>
            <p>IT will not be improper to remark, before I begin to deſcribe the hiſtory of this fever, that though the endemic which prevailed at Savanna la Mar, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding much variety of forms and ſymptoms, is conſidered as only one and the ſame diſeaſe, yet it may alſo be obſerved, that the variety of theſe appearances is ſometimes ſo great and remarkable as to occaſion conſiderable perplexity to the practitioner. The ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and form of this endemic appeared, on a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial view to be conſtantly varying; yet by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more cloſely to the courſe, progreſs, and changes of the diſeaſe, theſe apparent irregularities vaniſhed gradually, the varieties being in fact only accidental, and often depending on very trivial cauſes. The ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis of the different caſes of fever, which came under my care, during the time that I lived in Jamaica, furniſhed me with this information. I formerly mentioned the manner in which my obſervations were conducted: I have only now to add, that I truſt the method, which I adopted, has enabled me to give a more accurate hiſtory of the fever of Jamaica, and to explain more ſatisfactorily than has been done hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the various ſources of the many irregularities which are obſerved to occur. I am perfectly ſenſible that my experience has been too limited, to give me hopes of rendering the preſent work complete; yet I would flatter myſelf, that it will not be altogether uſeleſs: I totally diſclaim theoretical opinions, and content myſelf with a plain narrative of facts; neither do I aſpire to any higher praiſe, than care in obſerving
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028890_0098_0FDE5CED4B600490"/>
the appearances of the diſeaſe, and truth in relating the appearances which I have ſeen.</p>
            <p>Before proceeding to give a particular hiſtory of the different varieties of the endemic fever of Jamaica, it will not be improper to mention the more general ſymptoms, which diſtinguiſh the diſeaſe, and to trace an outline of the courſe, which it has been commonly obſerved to purſue: and I may remark in the firſt place, that though debility is uſually conſidered as the firſt ſign of an approaching fever; yet, if we attend minutely to all the circumſtances of invaſion, it will not generally be difficult to perceive, that a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, though undeſcribable affection of the ſtomach, takes place previous to the ſmalleſt perceptions of languor or debility, which are commonly only imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate fore-runners of coldneſs and ſhivering. This coldneſs, which was obſerved to be various in dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as in degree of force in the fevers of this country, was ſucceeded by fluſhings of heat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternating with the cold, and increaſing gradually till the heat at laſt prevailed. The hot fit, which was likewiſe of various duration and of various force, had many new ſymptoms joined with it, the principal of which were ſuch as ſhewed an increaſed circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an irregular determination of the blood to the different parts of the body. This hot fit, and the diſturbances connected with it, according to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, continued for a longer or ſhorter ſpace of time; at laſt ſweat breaking out on the head and breaſt, extended itſelf gradually to the extremities, and accompliſhed after a certain continuance, either a total remiſſion of the fever, or a conſiderable abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the violence of the ſymptoms. It is almoſt unneceſſary to mention, that this remiſſion or abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſymptoms was of longer or ſhorter duration, and more or leſs complete in fevers of different forms. An aggravation of ſymptoms ſucceeded to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion;
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028890_0099_0FDE5C17EBD000E0"/>
but it was uſually obſerved to begin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preceding coldneſs, and frequently without marks of preceding languor or debility. The hot fit now ran high, and all the ſymptoms were frequently more violent than they had been obſerved to be in the firſt paroxyſm. Sweat at laſt made its appearance, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in moſt caſes by a remiſſion, leſs perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, than the preceding one, but ſtill diſtinct enough to be clearly traced. In this manner things went on for a longer or ſhorter ſpace of time, the paroxyſms uſually increaſing in violence, and the remiſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſometimes more, though in general leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as the diſeaſe advanced in its progreſs. I may further obſerve, that there was occaſionally a change of the type, ſometimes a change of the nature of the ſymptoms in the courſe of the illneſs; and that, where either of theſe were the caſe, the diſeaſe was uſually of longer continuance; at the ſame time, that the order of the critical days was diſturbed in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theſe changes.</p>
            <p>The reſemblances, which I have mentioned above, were found in all the different ſpecies of the remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fever of Jamaica; but from cauſes, which were not always perceived, and which ſometimes appeared to be very accidental, the diſeaſe was diſtinguiſhed in a part, or in the whole of its courſe, by the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a train of ſymptoms of ſuch a particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as gave occaſion to the diſtinctions of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory, nervous, malignant, putrid or bilious; the ſeparate hiſtories of which I ſhall now relate more circumſtantially.</p>

               <head>SECTION I. OF FEVER DISTINGUISHED BY SYMPTOMS OF IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FLAMMATORY DIATHESIS.</head>
               <p>THE variety of fever, which I ſhall deſcribe firſt, is that, where the inflammatory diatheſis prevailed in different degrees. Where this diatheſis was moderate, the diſeaſe was uſually of the leaſt complicated form, as well as of the leaſt dangerous nature, of any of the fevers of Jamaica. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms were generally regular, and complete in all their parts, and terminated, for the moſt part, by a copious ſweat, in a perfect remiſſion: the pulſe was full, ſtrong, and regular; without uncommon hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or tenſion; whilſt the heat of the ſkin, though ſometimes great in degree, was generally free from that burning pungency, ſo common in ſome other ſpecies of fever. It was leſs removed, in ſhort, from a ſimple increaſe of the natural warmth. I may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remark, where this moderate degree of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diatheſis characterized the genius of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, that the danger was ſeldom great; and that the termination or criſis was generally regular and final. But though this degree of the inflammatory diatheſis was frequently obſerved to be a ſign of ſafety, and of regular criſis: yet it alſo often happened, where the diatheſis prevailed in exceſs, that the ſymptoms of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement ran unuſually high, and that a ſerious danger threatened life. The pulſe, in ſuch caſes, was not only frequent during the paroxyſm, but it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, quick, hard, and vibrating; the heat was often intenſe; the internal functions and the various ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, were conſiderably diſordered; at the ſame time, that a very obſtinate ſpaſmodic ſtricture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on the ſurface of the body. The remiſſion which followed, for the moſt part, was obſcure; the
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028890_0101_0FDE5C226292B158"/>
pulſe frequently retaining a preternatural quickneſs and hardneſs; whilſt there was generally a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree of febrile heat on the ſkin.</p>
               <p>The ſymptoms, which I have juſt now mentioned indicate different degrees of the real inflammatory diatheſis; but beſides actual ſymptoms of real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory diatheſis, there were likewiſe found fevers, with the appearances of a ſimilar diſpoſition, though the real genius of the diſeaſe was in reality of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature. It is of importance in practice to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh thoſe ambiguous appearances; but it is not always eaſy to do it with certainty. We may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, however, that the apparent inflammatory dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis was uſually accompanied with marks of great irritability, and ſometimes with marks of violent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement during the paroxyſins; while languor and great depreſſion of ſpirit were frequently perceived to attend the remiſſions. The pulſe, which at one time was hard, irregular, and quick, at another was frequent and low, and ſunk under a ſmall degree of preſſure. The heat of the body was not always great, yet it was pungent,—and left a diſagreeable ſenſation on the hand: the ſecretions were often ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular; the countenance was confuſed, clouded and overcaſt, the eye was ſad, and ſometimes appeared as if it were inflamed; the feelings were unpleaſant to the patient himſelf: there was great irritability of temper; and the ſtate of the ſkin impreſſed us with the idea, that there was a ſtrong ſpaſmodic ſtricture prevailing on the ſurface of the body.—The above are the principal circumſtances, which were uſually preſent in the different ſtates of inflammatory fevers; yet theſe circumſtances were ſometimes ſo variouſly complicated and combined with others, that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate diſcrimination of them muſt be left, in moſt eaſes, to the obſervation of the individual himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thoſe different ſtates and degrees of the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diatheſis, which I have deſcribed above, were
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028890_0102_0FDE5CFE444FB6C8"/>
ſometimes general throughout the whole of the body, not affecting one member more remarkably than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; ſometimes they were partial or ſeemed to be connected with a principal affection of a particular part: and where this was the caſe, the local affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the general diatheſis of the ſyſtem, uſually had a mutual correſpondence with each other. Thus, where the inflammation affected the ſubſtance of the liver or lungs, the general inflammatory diatheſis was uſually in a moderate degree; while the higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of general vaſcular excitement often accompanied inflammations of the membranes of thoſe organs. But though inflammation of membranes was often accompanied with a high degree of general inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diatheſis; yet there were likewiſe ſome kinds of thoſe local inflammations which communicated only a low, or an ambiguous degree of their diatheſis to the general ſyſtem: ſuch are ſome of thoſe inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, which occaſionally affect the ſurface of the alimentary canal, and which appear, in general, to be of the eryſipelatic kind.</p>

               <p>THE endemic fever of Jamaica, was not oftener diſtinguiſhed by ſymptoms of general inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diatheſis, than by circumſtances of nervous affection. The beginning of this form of the diſeaſe, was often characterized by a high degree of that diſagreeable affection of the ſtomach, as alſo by much of that languor and debility, which are commonly fore-runners of fevers in general. To theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſucceeded a ſlight degree of chillineſs, followed
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028890_0103_0FDE5C30AAA1B628"/>
by a hot fit, which often continued long, but ſeldom ran high. The pulſe was ſmall, frequent, and eaſily compreſſed. It varied with change of poſture;—and ſometimes was ſo much affected when the patient was raiſed upright, as totally to diſappear; the heat of the body was ſeldom great; the ſecretions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions were generally irregular, and the internal functions were much diſordered. The mind was uſually affected, affected however in various degrees, and in various ways. Sometimes there was a lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium, ſometimes the delirium was low and deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, as the one or other of theſe was the caſe, the appearance of the eye and countenance was chearful or ſad. The tongue was ſometimes moiſt, ſometimes dry, but ſeldom very ſoul; thirſt was irregular, nauſea was frequent, and the ſtate of the ſtomach was generally very irritable. There was likewiſe, in moſt caſes, deep and heavy ſighing, and, unleſs in times of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural excitement, a very uncommon degree of deſpondency. The above were the principal ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the nervous fever of Jamaica. The parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yſms in this diſeaſe ſeldom exceeded twelve hours in duration; while the termination or abatement, was uſually diſtinguiſhed by ſweating, though ſeldom by ſuch ſweatings as extended completely to every part of the body. The remiſſions were not by any means perfect: the head-ach, and other diſagreeable feelings uſually abated; but ſigns of languor ſtill continued, and marks of ſpaſmodic ſtricture for the moſt part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained on the ſurface of the ſkin. I may further obſerve, that as the paroxyſms generally increaſed in violence, in the progreſs of the fever; ſo it was very ſeldom that the remiſſions put on an appearance of greater diſtinctneſs, as the diſeaſe approached to its termination.</p>
               <p>Such is the general hiſtory and the progreſs of the diſeaſe, which might be diſtinguiſhed by the name of the nervous fever of Jamaica: but beſides thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028890_0104_0FDE5D09C5437538"/>
which I have mentioned above, others were ſometimes found attending it, which, though leſs regular and conſtant, deſerve ſtill to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. Thus the firſt ſtage of the paroxyſm, inſtead of the more uſual appearances, was occaſionally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by fits, which appeared to be of the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptic kind. Theſe fits in ſome caſes were ſucceeded by a lively delirium, in others by ſtupor or inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. The delirium, which was a common ſymptom of this diſeaſe, ran high in ſeveral inſtances; though it more generally amounted only to an abſence of thought, or difficulty of recollection. It is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſome curioſity likewiſe, that inſtead of a paroxyſm, conſiſting of different parts in a certain order of ſucceſſion, there was ſometimes a total ſtupor and inſenſibility, which continued for a determinate ſpace of time, without even being ſucceeded by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious marks of fever: whilſt the time of the paroxyſm, in other caſes, was diſtinguiſhed by ſuch a degree of tremor and mobility, as nearly approached to the diſeaſe known by the name of St. Vitus's dance. And further, beſides theſe ſtrange and irregular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, ſpaſms and excruciating pains in different parts of the body, in many inſtances, were the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, indeed almoſt the only ſymptoms of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>It is not only curious, but it is indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the conduct of our practice, to obſerve with attention the various modes of action of the cauſe of fevers, and to eſtimate with preciſion the various combinations. The cauſe of fevers, in exerting its principal action on the nervous ſyſtem, ſometimes produces excitement, ſometimes occaſions depreſſion; effects oppoſite to each other in their nature. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement and depreſſion are two general and oppoſite modes of action; yet beſides theſe we often obſerve others, which do not belong wholly to the one or the other, but which ſeem to be compounded of both, in a manner we do not very well comprehend. This
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028890_0105_0FDE5C41B12515D0"/>
cauſe of fever likewiſe, which acts in directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ways, appears alſo to exert its action more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully at different times on one part of the ſyſtem than on another; that is, it acts ſometimes more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on the brain, or reaſoning faculty, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more directly on the nerves, or moving powers of the body. It may even be obſerved further, that all theſe modes of action, which are preſerved diſtinct at one time, are combined in various degrees at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Thus, where the cauſe of fever acts by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing excitement, lively delirium in various degrees is the conſequence; while languor, ſtupor, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility naturally follow the oppoſite mode of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Low delirium, tremors, ſtartings, &amp;c. are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably owing to a compound effect. Both modes of action ſucceed each other rapidly; or perhaps both modes are actually preſent at the ſame time, though probably in different degrees, in the different por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the brain. This fact at leaſt is certain, that obvious depreſſion is often combined with ſigns of great irritability. It is a remark likewiſe of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able importance, that the natural functions are leſs diſordered, where the cauſe of the diſeaſe acts upon the nervous ſyſtem internally, or principally diſturbs the intellectual powers, than where this action is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly external: the pulſe is then more regular, though often obſcure; the diſpoſition to faint is not ſo great; muſcular mobility is leſs remarkable, and local pains are felt leſs acutely. On the contrary, where this cauſe acts externally, or chiefly affects the moving powers, the diſpoſition to faint in changing poſture is more remarkable; tremors, ſtartings, &amp;c. are more common; appearances, in ſhort, are more fluctuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and often more alarming.</p>
               <p>It is a matter not leſs uſeful than curious to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the different ſpecies of delirium in fevers, to trace the different combinations, and to mark the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently trivial cauſes, which excite, or which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028890_0106_0FDE5D13B0BD2C40"/>
remove thoſe derangements of the reaſoning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. It is a remark, which has been often made, that while one delirious perſon in fever appears only to be in better ſpirits than uſual, another, or perhaps the ſame perſon in another paroxyſm of the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, is outrageous or perfectly furious. A third is low and languid, abſent and inattentive, or, with a fixed look of vacancy, does not ſeem to be otherwiſe deranged, than by requiring greater time to recollect himſelf. To which we may add, that there are ſome, who talk coolly on things in general; but who cannot bear mention of ſome particular ſubjects.</p>

               <p>THE fever of Jamaica, as diſtinguiſhed by ſigns of inflammatory diatheſis, or by circumſtances of nervous affection, prevailed principally at Savan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na la Mar; yet beſides the above forms of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re ſometimes likewiſe occurred others, which ſhewed marks of peculiar malignity. It is difficult to define preciſely in words the character of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which I now attempt to diſcribe; its diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating marks, not conſiſting ſo much in one or two ſymptoms, as in a certain aſſemblage of circumſtances reſiding chiefly in the ſtate of the eye and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the patient, and conveyed with difficulty in verbal deſcription. I may remark, in the firſt place, that there was ſeldom any thing very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the manner of invaſion of this ſpecies of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. The cold fit was rarely violent in degree, though it was often of long continuance: neither did the hot
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028890_0107_0FDE5C4E14470270"/>
fit uſually run high, in the common acceptation of the word, though it was ſometimes attended with circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances peculiarly diſagreeable. The pulſe varied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably. It was obſcure, or ſcarcely to be felt in ſome; in others it was ſtrong, though unequally ſo; the artery, in many inſtances, being hard and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, with a peculiar vibration in the ſtroke. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe ſymptoms and others, which are uſual in this ſtage of fever, had continued for a longer or ſhorter time, ſweat began to make its appearance on the head and breaſt, which extending itſelf gradually to every part of the body, was at laſt followed by a remiſſion, tolerably perfect for the moſt part, though there ſtill remained ſome ſtrange and unpleaſant ſenſations. It does not appear that there is any thing very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the ſymptoms, which I have hitherto taken notice of: thoſe which follow are more characteriſtic. The ſtate of the eye and countenance, afford the ſureſt ſigns of the malignity of the diſeaſe; but there is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in diſcriminating thoſe appearances. The face is not unuſually fluſhed in fevers; but, in the preſent caſe, the countenance exhibits ſomething elſe beſides an appearance of ſimple fluſhing. It is likewiſe grim, dark and overcaſt, with ſuch marks of confuſion and diſtreſs, as if the patient were agitated by ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentful paſſion. The eye is ſad and deſponding; and the whole appearance, in ſhort, indicates ſuch a ſtate of mind, as we ſhould be diſpoſed to ſtyle malignant. It is in ſuch a ſtate of the countenance as I have deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, that the character of this ſpecies of fever chiefly reſides; yet beſides this, ſome other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances frequently attend the diſeaſe, which are leſs uſual in ordinary fevers. The paroxyſm for inſtance returned, for the moſt part, much ſooner than the regular period, always with greater violence, and ſometimes with new and alarming ſymptoms. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined in twelve or fourteen hours; but the remiſſion was leſs perfect than the preceding one; the next re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028890_0108_0FDE5D19B8ACDD88"/>
of fever, which was likewiſe much earlier than the ſtated hour, was often uſhered in by convulſions, and the time of it occupied by ſtupor or coma. The tongue was likewiſe irregularly moiſt or dry. If dry, it was generally covered with a black ſcurf; if moiſt, with a thin glutinous coat, through which the red ſurface ſhining obſcurely, preſented an appearance of a leaden colour. In this caſe the mouth abounded with a ropy ſaliva. But beſides the above ſymptoms, there were alſo violent twitchings in the ſtomach and bowels, ſudden ſqueamiſhneſs, faintneſs, anxiety, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs, frightful dreams, diſtreſſing apprehenſions, and frequently after the ſecond paroxyſm, a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar crouded eruption (not unlike iron-burnt bliſters,) on the upper lip, which for the moſt part ſpread to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the noſe. The type of this fever, it may be further remarked, was uſually of the ſingle tertian kind, generally anticipating by long anticipations. In moſt inſtances this malignant diſpoſition was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable at the very beginning; yet in others, no ſymptoms of a doubtful nature made their appearance till after the third revolution.</p>

               <head>SECTION IV. OF FEVERS IN WHICH ARE OBSERVED SYMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOMS OF A PUTRESCENT TENDENCY.</head>
               <p>WE meet with the term putrid fever, or fever with putreſcent tendency, in the writings of almoſt every author who has treated of the diſeaſes of hot climates: but though this expreſſion is ſo much the common language of practitioners, I cannot held obſerving, that a remitting fever, with ſymptoms of a ſpecific putrefaction, did not once occur to my
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028890_0109_0FDE5C5813CBC3A8"/>
obſervation in the iſland of Jamaica, during the time that I lived in that country. I muſt however add, that though a remitting fever ſpecifically putrid is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually a rare diſeaſe; yet I do not attempt to deny, that a putreſcent tendency is frequently preſent in the primae viae, in a very conſiderable degree; and that marks of it are ſometimes diſcoverable, even in the general ſyſtem, at a late period of the illneſs, when the vigour of life has abated, and the powers of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation have begun to fail. This however is ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental and uneſſential, that it is only in compliance with the general language of medical people, that I think it neceſſary to deſcribe a diſeaſe, where theſe ſymptoms are obſerved to prevail. The tendency to putrefaction, which was obſerved in the fever of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, ſometimes begins in the primae viae; and from the primae viae was communicated to the reſt of the ſyſtem; ſometimes it remained confined to the limits of the inteſtinal canal, throughout the whole dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diſorder; in which caſe flatulence, ructus, anxiety, nauſea and thirſt were the ſymptoms which were chiefly troubleſome: the belly likewiſe was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally looſe, at the ſame time that the ſtools were dark and fetid. But where this tendency was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from the primae viae to the reſt of the body, or othewiſe made its appearance in the general ſyſtem, a form of diſeaſe aroſe diſtinguiſhed by the following ſymptoms. If the tendency to putrefaction appeared at an early period, the heat of the ſkin made a more diſagreeable impreſſion on the hand, than was uſual in ſome other fevers; the ſkin itſelf was likewiſe for the moſt part, dry and conſtricted; the thirſt was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, ſometimes intenſe, ſometimes from local af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſauces, apparently little increaſed.—The appearance of the eye was often ſad; ſometimes it gliſtened with unuſual brilliancy; ſometimes it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be inflamed. The countenance was generally fluſhed, often particularly confuſed, and of a grim
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028890_0110_0FDE5D1FF9EB6098"/>
and clouded aſpect. I have however frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, where ſymptoms of putreſcency diſcovered themſelves at a late period of a fever, the preceding courſe of which had been diſtinguiſhed by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of nervous affection, that the bloom of the complexion was uncommonly fine and delicate. To the above ſymptoms might be added, great irritabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of temper, general uneaſineſs of ſenſation, and diſorder in all the functions of the body. When the fever aſſumed this appearance, paroxyſms and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were generally obſcure and irregular. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver indeed often ſubſided in a ſmall degree; but the future remiſſions generally became leſs diſtinct, as the diſeaſe proceeded in its courſe. The tongue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed different appearances, at different periods and in different perſons. In ſome it was moiſt, in others parched and dry. It was not univerſally foul, at leaſt it frequently happened, that the edges were clear and beautifully red in their colour. The lips likewiſe were ſometimes ſmooth, and of a cherry-like appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; at the ſame time that the gums were inflamed and ſpongy, as they uſually are in ſcurvy: the pulſe likewiſe was ſmall for the moſt part; but it was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly ſo. I ſay nothing of the diſpoſition to faint in erect poſture, which though generally enumerated among the ſigns of putrid fevers by authors, does not in fact appear to conſtitute a criterion of the diſeaſe.</p>

               <head>SECTION V. OF FEVERS ACCOMPANIED WITH AN INCREASED SECRETION OF BILE.</head>
               <p>THOSE ſpecies of fevers, which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above, ſeem to affect the general ſyſtem, or every part of the body nearly alike; but beſides theſe, we ſometimes meet with others, which are diſtinguiſhed by local affections, or increaſed deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations to particular parts in a degree ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as to perſonate very exactly a peripneumony, a hepatitis, or inflammation of the bowels; the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying fever being at the ſame time ſo ſlight, as ſcarcely to be conſidered as a primary affection. As an accident ſimilar to theſe local affections of the liver or lungs, we may reckon an increaſed ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bile. The cauſe of fever, from circumſtances which we do not always perceive, ſometimes acts with particular violence on the biliary ſyſtem, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which the ſecretion of bile being preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally increaſed, a diſeaſe ariſes, which without much impropriety may be called bilious. But though this irregular action of the morbid cauſe, on the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary ſyſtem, frequently gives riſe to bilious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in the fevers of Jamaica; yet theſe appearances are in fact often owing to cauſes more accidental, and more remote than even this. Nauſea and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting are among the common ſymptoms of fevers in every country; but they are particularly frequent in thoſe of the Weſt-Indies. It is well known that a continuance of nauſea, or that a repetition of the action of vomiting, increaſes the determination, not only to the ſtomach, but likewiſe to the parts which are near to it. Hence the ſecretion of bile is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally increaſed ſecondarily by the ordinary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of vomiting, and bilious appearances become a
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028890_0112_0FDE5D2839CFCE00"/>
neceſſary conſequence of this accidental ſymptom of the diſeaſe. In thoſe two manners, <abbr>viz.</abbr> in conſequence of the irregular action of the morbid cauſe on the immediately biliary ſyſtem, or from a ſecondary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in conſequence of its action on the ſtomach, the the bilious fever may, in ſome reſpects, be conſidered as a diſeaſe of nature; but beſides this, it often ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginates from our own treatment, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated uſe of emetics, or of cathartics, which are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in their operation. The accidental appearance of bilious vomitings, in the fevers of hot climates, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed medical authors with a pretence of forming a new theory, and of directing the mode of practice to a particular view. Influenced by this appearance, they aſſume it as a fact, that a vitiated quality, or a redundant quantity of bile conſtitutes the eſſential cauſe of the diſeaſe; and on this foundation adopt the plan of repeated evacuating, both upwards and downwards; a practice which evidently increaſes the ſecretion of the bile. Hence, a diſeaſe, or the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a diſeaſe, ariſes wholly from this mode of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the removal or cure of it is afterwards attempted by a perſeverance in the means, which ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally gave riſe to it:—of this I have ſeen numerous examples.</p>
               <p>I have now deſcribed the remitting fever of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, as characteriſed by ſymptoms of a different appearance. I may further remark, that where theſe ſymptoms were unmixed with each other, there was little difficulty in the diſtinction, and little embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in planning or executing the indications of cure: but it ſometimes alſo happened, that the different ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which I have deſcribed ſeparately, was ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and complicated, that it appeared uncertain to which kind the diſeaſe properly belonged; or to which view the practice ought to be principally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. Symptoms of putreſcency, for inſtance, were often combined with ſymptoms of apparent inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028890_0113_0FDE5C6A719279B8"/>
diatheſis; as fevers with nervous affection, or putreſcent tendency, were ſometimes accompanied with marks of peculiar malignity. It happened often likewiſe, that the nature of the diſeaſe ſuffered a total change after a certain duration; or that a fever with one train of ſymptoms ceaſed, whilſt another with a different train began.</p>
               <p>It would be a matter of no ſmall importance, were we able to aſcertain the various cauſes, which influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the various appearances of the ſame diſeaſe; but this knowledge is not eaſily attained:—much of it indeed lies beyond the reach of our comprehenſion. We may however remark, that the ſeaſon of the year uſually has ſome effect on the diatheſis of the ſyſtem, and often on the type and form of the fever. Thus, in the dry ſeaſon, though the remiſſions are not always more perfect, the type is commonly more ſimple, and the general diatheſis is oftener inflammatory. In the rainy months, on the contrary, remiſſions are more perceivable, but the type is more complicated, and the general diatheſis of the ſyſtem has a ſtronger ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to putreſcency, often with a mixture of ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of nervous affection, ſometimes with ſymptoms of a malignant nature. The ſtomach, bowels, and biliary ſyſtem likewiſe ſuffer more in this ſeaſon than in the drier months of the year. But beſides this difference, which ariſes from ſeaſon, we alſo find very conſtant effects from local ſituation. Thus in hilly countries there is generally more of the inflammatory diatheſis, with more frequent determination to the head and lungs, and leſs obvious remiſſions, than in flat and champaign countries, where the ſtomach and biliary ſyſtem ſuffer in a more peculiar manner.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. OF PROGNOSTIC IN THE FEVERS OF JAMAICA.</head>
            <p>TO be able to perceive at a diſtance, the approach of danger or returning health, is a knowledge highly ſatisfactory and uſeful to the phyſician; but it is a knowledge which is not eaſily attained: for to judge with certainty of the event of fevers, requires not only long and attentive obſervation, but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination of complicated and ambiguous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, which does not depend always upon attention alone. The ſagacious Hippocrates is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the firſt, who laid the foundation of the ſcience of prognoſtic; and we certainly muſt allow, that he has left us many important and valuable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the ſubject; yet we may alſo add, that his deciſions in many inſtances, are precipitate. Hippocrates ſeems generally to have placed too great confidence in ſigns ſeparately conſidered, and to have formed his concluſions too often on the authority of ſingle facts. Thus he has ſometimes conſidered as fatal in themſelves thoſe ſigns, which in reality are only dangerous. The abſolutely fatal ſigns in fevers are actually few in number. I am able to affirm, from my own experience, that people are ſometimes reſtored to health after many of the uſually reputed fore-runners of death are preſent. We have, in fact, as yet only an imperfect knowledge of prognoſtic in fevers; but the field is ſtill open, and careful obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it is to be hoped, may enable us in time to ſupply the defects. I dare not venture to aſſert, that I have advanced beyond others in this neceſſary and difficult ſcience; but I am diſpoſed to flatter myſelf, that the following attempt to appreciate the marks of danger or ſafety in the fevers of Jamaica, may be
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028890_0115_0FDE5C7359499648"/>
found in ſome degree uſeful. It contains the reſult of my own obſervations in that country; and though I am perfectly conſcious that the rules are often defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, yet I likewiſe know, that I have ſuggeſted ſome hints which have not been commonly obſerved, and which may help to direct thoſe, who have not had much experience of their own.</p>
            <p>Prognoſtic is ſuch, as applies to fevers in general, or more particularly to the different ſpecies of the diſeaſe. The type or form, the general courſe and tenor of the diſorders, and the <hi>general</hi> nature of the paroxyſms often afford uſeful information. From the type alone, we do not often obtain much that is to be depended upon. Long and diſtinct intermiſſions are commonly accounted ſigns of ſafety; yet we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſee inſtances of the ſingle tertian proving fatal, while types of greater complication are often void of danger: in general, however, complicated types are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and perhaps more commonly fatal than others. But though a knowledge of the type of the fever abſtractedly conſidered, does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly afford any material indication of danger or ſafety, yet the time of the return of the paroxyſm is a ſubject, from which more may be learned. An an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of an hour or two, is ſeldom much to be regarded; yet an anticipation of ten or twelve is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuſpicious. It either indicates a latent malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or a tendency in the diſeaſe to change to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued form. The complication of another fever, or the doubling of type is by no means favourable; yet it is much leſs to be dreaded, than a long and an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular anticipation. Anticipations have been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſidered as ſigns of the increaſing force of the fever; ſo the type which poſtpones, is uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to indicate a diſeaſe, which is haſtening to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable termination: the effect however is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the contrary. I have myſelf ſeen ſome inſtances, where, in conſequence perhaps of weakneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired

               </gap> commenced ſooner, was not clearly perceived till after the uſual hour of attack. But beſides thoſe indications of danger or ſafety, which may be drawn from the nature of the ſimple type, or from the hour of return of the paroxyſm, the ſtate of the paroxyſms and remiſſions deſerves likewiſe to be attended to. It was generally obſerved where the paroxyſms were regular, and aſſumed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleter form in the progreſs of the diſeaſe, that there was not generally much reaſon to dread an unfavourable event. Hopes of ſafety might likewiſe be entertained with ſtill greater confidence, where the paroxyſms, though more violent in degree, became more regular and diſtinct after the uſe of bark, wine and ſtimulants. On the contrary, it was always an indication of danger, where they became longer or loſt the diſtinctneſs and regularity of their form, as the diſeaſe advanced in its progreſs. Changes from bad to good, in the courſe of the fever, alſo indicated more ſafety as the oppoſite changes indicated more danger, than if cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances equally unfavourable had continued from the beginning.</p>
            <p>In enumerating thoſe particular ſigns or ſymptoms, from which we are led to form a judgment of the event of the remitting fever of Jamaica, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the firſt place the ſtate of the pulſe. The pulſe is ſo differently affected by the ſame cauſes in different people, and individually ſubject to ſo many peculiarities, that concluſions formed ſolely upon this baſis muſt ever be fallacious. Hippocrates, who has treated very fully of the other ſigns of prognoſtic, is totally ſilent on the ſubject of the pulſe. He has mentioned the term, indeed, in ſeveral parts of his works; but it does not appear, that he had a perfect knowledge of the nature and indications of the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the arteries. The ſubject was ſomewhat better underſtood before the time of Celſus: yet this
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028890_0117_0FDE5C7AA86ABDA0"/>
author does not believe, that any information could be drawn from the ſtate of the pulſe alone, which was in any great degree to be depended upon. Galen, who is generally diffuſe on every ſubject, has treated very fully of the nature of the pulſe. He has indeed multiplied diſtinctions to an amazing extent, and ſuggeſted combinations of endleſs variety; yet notwithſtanding this apparent minuteneſs, there are ſtill ſeveral important obſervations with reſpect to it, which have eſcaped him altogether. It is not many years ago, that Dr. Solano, a Spaniſh phyſician who practiſed at Antequiera, opened ſome new and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious views concerning the pulſe, and its various indications.</p>
            <p>The detail of facts with which this writer has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us, is really wonderful, and the candour with which he has related them, independent of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſeveral reſpectable authorities, engages us to give him credit. I had not heard of Solano's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries at the time I lived in Jamaica, and I do not find that I had ever taken notice of obſervations ſimilar to thoſe he has mentioned. I was able indeed, for the moſt part, to foretel from the nature of the pulſe, even in the beginning of the diſeaſe, whether the fever would be of a continued or remitting form; but I did not diſcover any ſigns from it, which led me to form a judgment of the future mode of termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. I may add, that I met not with any inſtances of criſis by haemorrhage; neither did I ever take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the rebounding pulſe. The intermitting pulſe occurred frequently, ſometimes as a forerunner of death, ſometimes as an attendant of favourable criſis: but I cannot ſay, that I obſerved that it ever preſaged a future diarrhea. I ſhall however paſs over the obſervations of others without further comment for the preſent, and content myſelf with relating thoſe circumſtances of pulſe connected with danger or ſafety, as they occurred to my own obſervation in the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028890_0118_0FDE5D3D0D10F498"/>
remitting fever of the Weſt Indies. I muſt remark in the firſt place, that independent of peculiarities of conſtitution, a weak, a feeble and eaſily compreſſed pulſe was generally a bad one: a pulſe which was indiſtinct and ſmall, or ſmall and hard, particularly at a late period of the diſeaſe, or together with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium or clammy ſweats, indicated for the moſt part, the moſt extreme degree of danger. That ſpecies of pulſe moreover, where the ſtroke was obſcure, or felt with difficulty, was ſuſpicious at all times; but it was particularly dangerous where accompanied with a wavering, a tremulous, a conſtantly creeping or vermicular motion in the artery. I am not certain that my meaning will be clearly underſtood; yet I believe that thoſe who have once obſerved this tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous and creeping pulſe, will not eaſily forget the danger which it indicates. It often attended a fever of a malignant kind, where the nervous influence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in ſome degree, to be ſuſpended.—But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed: it is an obſervation ſo well known as to render any mention of it almoſt ſuperfluous, that a frequent, an irregular, a fluttering and intermitting pulſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly indicates danger, ſometimes approaching death: yet I muſt add, that an intermitting pulſe ſometimes attended the favourable criſis of a peculiar ſpecies of fever. It was obſerved, however, in ſuch caſes, that the pulſe was not otherwiſe irregular, than by failing in its ſtroke at the end of every third or fourth pulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither was it generally found to be uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly frequent. Some inſtances of this ſingular appearance occurred to me during the time that I remained in Jamaica: ſo that I was in ſome degree diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to rank the intermitting pulſe among the ſigns of favourable criſis, in a ſpecies of fever, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding courſe of which had been diſtinguiſhed by ſymptoms of a peculiar nervous affection. When I became acquainted afterwards with the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Dr. Solano, I began to doubt whether the
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028890_0119_0FDE5C82CA14AC58"/>
intermiſſion of pulſe, which I had met with in the fevers of Jamaica, might not have been a ſign of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching diarrhea, which had not occurred to my notice, rather than a ſign of proper criſis, as I had formerly imagined. I remained in this uncertainty till lately, that ſome inſtances of this ſymptom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening at the termination of fevers in this country, have helped to confirm me in the opinion which I entertained before. I found in thoſe caſes to which I allude, that the pulſe intermitted after every third or fourth ſtroke on the day, on which I expected the criſis. The intermiſſion of the pulſe was not of ſuch a nature as indicated approaching death; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looked watchfully for a diarrhea, but no diarrhea enſued. It muſt be confeſſed, indeed, that one of the patients ſeemed to be much diſtreſſed with gripes and flatus; but being deprived of the power of ſpeech we could not obtain any accurate idea of his feelings: and no evacuation actually took place, till the day following, before which time the intermiſſion had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared altogether.—Beſides the above, there are ſome other ſigns of pulſe which have their particular indications; but they are ſo generally known, that it will not be neceſſary to enlarge on the ſubject. I ſhall therefore only obſerve further, that changes from better to worſe in the ſtate of the pulſe, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe advances in its progreſs, are bad, while the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite changes are favourable: yet I muſt likewiſe add, that in thoſe caſes of favourable change, it will be neceſſary to diſtinguiſh carefully the pulſe of coma, from the pulſe of returning health.—The difference is ſometimes ſcarcely to be known, except from the attending ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>Next to the ſtate of the pulſe, I ſhall mention thoſe appearances of the tongue, which, together with other concomitant circumſtances, frequently afford ſigns of the mildneſs or malignity of the diſeaſe. Though we do not expect that the tongue ſhould be
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028890_0120_0FDE5D4351767968"/>
of a healthy aſpect, during the continuance of a fever; yet where it is dry only in a moderate degree, or where it is covered with a ſmooth and whitiſh coat, the diſeaſe for the moſt part, is void of malignity, though not always of danger. On the contrary, where it is immoderately dry, or dry and black, the indications of danger are great, and I may add, ſtill greater where a white ſlimy and glutinous ſubſtance covers its ſurface. This ſlimy ſtate of the tongue was often ſeen at an early period, and as far as my experience goes, conſtantly indicated malignity. To the above we may add, a ſodden or parboiled ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the tongue, which was not of leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous import than the preceding. But beſides thoſe obviouſly unhealthy aſpects of the tongue, its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſome inſtances was not different from its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, except in a certain lividneſs of colour. This was conſtantly ſuſpicious, and if not fatal, was always extremely dangerous. The danger indicated by the tongue, when it is intenſely dry, rough, crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ulcerated is generally known; but I muſt not omit to mention, that when from a dry and unheal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſtate, it turns moiſt ſuddenly, or aſſumes its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural appearance, whilſt the other ſigns of favourable criſis did not ſhew themſelves at the ſame time, a change of the mode of action of the febrile cauſe is indicated,—and generally a dangerous one.—I ſay nothing of paleneſs and tremor, as theſe ſymptoms only indicate certain ſtates of general or particular debility of the nervous ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>Vomiting is another of the alarming, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the dangerous ſymptoms of the fevers of the Weſt-Indies. If this ſymptom continues during the remiſſion of the fever, without material abatement, there is reaſon to dread its conſequences; but if it vaniſhes or abates in a very material degree at the decline of the paroxyſm, it does not deſerve to be ſo particularly regarded. The practice however to
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028890_0121_0FDE5C888290F798"/>
which it leads is often ſerious. Vomiting is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by moſt practitioners to indicate emetics; but the indication is fallacious, and the practice is often pernicious. During the time that I lived in Jamaica, I had frequent opportunities of ſeeing vomitings ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered continual by the repeated uſe of emetics, which before this treatment, appeared to be only accidental ſymptoms during the paroxyſm of the diſeaſe. I therefore at laſt became cautious of purſuing this view, and have reaſon to believe, that if I did not oftener do good than others, I ſeldomer increaſed the danger. But beſides the degree and frequency of the vomiting, the nature of the matters thrown up may likewiſe furniſh indications of the danger or ſafety of the fever. The various kinds of bilious vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings have been fully explained, and the danger of each has been ſo particularly pointed out by many writers, eſpecially by Hippocrates, that I paſs over the ſubject without further notice, conſidering it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to repeat the obſervations of others. I muſt however remark a more uncommon kind of vomiting, which ſometimes happened in the fevers of Jamaica, and which I believe has hitherto eſcaped the notice of obſervers. The vomiting to which I allude in this place, is a vomiting of a clear and ropy liquor, in which are often found ſwimming flakes of a darker coloured mucus. This appearance was chiefly obſerved, where the remiſſions were indiſtinct, and the ſweats partial and incomplete. It conſtantly afforded an indication of danger, and I ſeldom found that the uſual remedies were effectual in reſtraining it. Vomitings of black and vitiated matters are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known to be of the moſt dangerous import,—ſucceeded by obſcure hickupings, they are often fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of death. Yet though this is generally true, I muſt not at the ſame time omit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> mention, that I have ſeen ſeveral inſtances of recovery where black vomiting had prevailed for ſome time; and other
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028890_0122_0FDE5D49B45D1EF0"/>
caſes which give me room to conclude, that hickup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not conſtantly fatal. I take the preſent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to remark, that hickup was ſometimes only a diſtinguiſhing ſymptom of the diſeaſe, which increaſed or declined with the paroxyſm; and that in other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it attended the favourable criſis of fevers, the preceding courſe of which had been characteriſed by ſymptoms of nervous affection. This ſpecies of hickup was generally alarming in degree, and equally inexplicable with the intermitting pulſe, which I mentioned above as ſometimes attending a favourable termination. It often continued the ſpace of twenty-four hours, in ſpite of all that could be done by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
            <p>Next to the indications of vomiting, I ſhall enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate ſuch as may be drawn from the preſence or abſence of thirſt. Immoderate and unquenchable thirſt has always been reckoned an unfavourable ſymptom in fevers. It is ſo undoubtedly, yet I have frequently ſeen very extraordinary degrees of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing for a length of time, without particular dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Beſides the deſire for liquid in general, there is often an unconquerable longing for drinks of a particular kind;—a feeling which ought always to be attended to, and frequently complied with.—The deſire for cold water is ſometimes ravenous.—I have known it not only ſatiated with ſafety, but even with good effects. But though this immoderate thirſt is juſtly reckoned a bad ſymptom in fevers; yet an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference for liquid, with a dry tongue, and other marks of internal heat, is ſtill worſe. It has indeed been generally conſidered as fatal; but here we ought to diſtinguiſh, whether it proceeds from local affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tongue and fauces, or from a general failure of the powers of life. In the one caſe it is a mortal ſign, in the other it can only be ſaid to be dangerous.</p>
            <p>The ancients, particularly Hippocrates and his
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028890_0123_0FDE5C8F1AEFE3A8"/>
commentator Galen, have treated ſo fully of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of evacuations downwards, that I ſhould be able to do little more than to copy their obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. There is one ſpecies of evacuation, however, which they do not appear to have deſcribed very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, and which I have often obſerved to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with great danger. This is the frequent, ſmall and ineffective excretion, and more particularly copious ſtools, which reſemble dirty water, eſpecially if accompanied with tenſion of the hypochondria and abdomen.</p>
            <p>Medical writers have been long accuſtomed to form a prognoſtic of the event of fevers, from puſtular or ſcabby eruptions about the mouth: but the ſign is ambiguous, and cannot be depended upon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many limitations. I ſhall however relate that which has occurred to my own obſervation, without troubling myſelf about the opinions of others. And I remark in the firſt place, that an eruption about the corners of the mouth, and near the lips, which comes forth freely, and ſoon turns into a ſcab, particularly if it does not appear till after the third revolution of the diſeaſe, affords a general ſign of ſafety, at leaſt it affords a ſign that the complaint has attained the height of its violence. On the contrary, an eruption which ſhews itſelf at an earlier period, which is crouded, and makes its way with difficulty, or which reſembles iron-burnt bliſters rather than puſtules pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, particularly if it is on the upper lip, and ſpreads towards the noſe, affords a general indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of danger and malignancy.—Small and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect eruptions likewiſe are frequently a ſign of a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of animal heat is another of thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which may be conſidered as affording an indication of the nature and event of fevers. Where the heat of the body, in the remitting fever of Jamaica, was equally diffuſed to the extremities,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028890_0124_0FDE5D5263CD9E70"/>
or not differing from an increaſed degree of natural warmth, the diſeaſe was uſually mild, without particular danger or malignity; but where acrid, fiery and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, though perhaps not much increaſed in degree, danger was apprehended with reaſon, particularly if the warmth was not extended equally to every part of the body. In the remiſſions of thoſe fevers, which were diſtinguiſhed by ſymptoms of nervous affection, or, as is more commonly believed, putreſcent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, the heat of the body was often ſeveral degrees below the ſtandard of health. The ſymptom was alarming, but it was not in fact of much conſequence. This diminution of the heat of the body, during the remiſſion, was not by any means a rare occurrence; but beſides this, there was ſometimes obſerved a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of coldneſs, during the favourable criſis of ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fevers, of a very ſingular and extraordinary kind. In ſome inſtances this coldneſs was not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in degree to that of a perſon dying, or actually dead; yet a diſtinction was perceived without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. It was not accompanied with marks of ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the ſurface of the body, at the ſame time that the pulſe was generally ſoft, regular and full.</p>
            <p>Next to the ſtate of animal heat it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to conſider the indications of the various kinds of ſweats. The ſigns of a favourable ſweat are commonly known. Where that excretion was fluid, warm and univerſal, particularly where accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ſoft, full and expanding pulſe, calm and eaſy reſpiration, general relief from ſymptoms of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, with a cheerful eye and countenance, we might in general preſume on ſafety of the diſeaſe, often on its favourable termination. On the contrary, where the ſweat was cold, clammy and partial, particularly where the pulſe became or continued frequent, ſmall and tenſe, with anxiety, reſtleſſneſs and diſturbed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, a circumſcribed fluſhing, a greaſy hue of the countenance, or a wild and dejected appearance
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028890_0125_0FDE5C97DE3980C8"/>
of the eye, the ſituation was then alarming:—death, in ſhort, was ſeldom far off. There is, however, an obſervation with regard to this ſubject, which I muſt not omit to mention. Authors, with one conſent, have conſidered cold ſweats as certain mortal ſigns in fevers; but there appear to be exceptions to this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule. I met with ſeveral inſtances, while I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Jamaica, where univerſal fluid ſweats, of an extraordinary degree of coldneſs, accompanied the criſis of the diſeaſe. I was much alarmed when this appearance firſt occurred to me, but my fears ſoon vaniſhed, as I found that the pulſe became ſlower and fuller, that the reſpiration became calm and eaſy, and particularly that the eye and countenance acquired ſuch a cheerfulneſs and ſerenity, as are uſual at the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable termination of fevers.</p>
            <p>To the ſigns of prognoſtic, which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above, I ſhall add thoſe which are indicated by the general ſtate of the vital powers, or by the more particular affection of parts, which are of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate importance to life. Among the firſt of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the vital organs, we ſhall conſider ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications as ariſe from a diſturbed ſtate of reſpiration. A frequent, a hurried and unequal reſpiration, (I do not ſpeak of that which depends on primary affection of the lungs), is juſtly conſidered as a ſign of a bad diſeaſe. This is more certainly the caſe, where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with deep and heavy ſighing. Frequent ſighing was a common ſymptom in the fevers of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica, where the powers of life were depreſſed; and though not abſolutely a mortal ſign, it conſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated danger.</p>
            <p>Next to the ſtate of reſpiration, I ſhall mention the ſtate of the intellect, or reaſoning faculty, which often afforded ſome prognoſtic of the event of the fever. Delirium, I obſerved before, was a common ſymptom in the remitting fever of Jamaica. Where it vaniſhed or abated as the paroxyſm declined, it was ſeldom
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028890_0126_0FDE5D594A2146E8"/>
found to be of material conſequence. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, where it continued during the remiſſion undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed in degree, it was a ſymptom of the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious nature. I mentioned in a former part of this treatiſe, that the cauſe of fever appeared to act on the brain and nervous ſyſtem, in two general and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ways; that is, by occaſioning excitement or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Of theſe two modes of action, depreſſion was the moſt dangerous; unleſs where the excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ran uncommonly high. But though I obſerved, that there are only two general modes of operation, <abbr>viz.</abbr> excitement and depreſſion; yet I muſt alſo add, that the modifications are numerous, and very variouſly combined. Among the moſt dangerous and alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpecies of the derangements of the intellect, we might reckon a ſtern ſullenneſs, an unmanageable fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs, picking the bed cloaths, tracing figures on the wall, and ſuch other inſtances of perverted judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Stupor and ſuſpenſion of the nervous influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as we might term it, were likewiſe greatly to be dreaded: unleſs they ſhewed themſelves only during the time of the paroxyſm, they were generally fatal, more certainly ſo, if they followed convulſions.</p>
            <p>As nearly connected with delirium, we ſhall now conſider other diſturbed ſtates of the functions of the brain, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the ſtates of reſt and watching. We do not expect that ſleep ſhould be ſound and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed in fevers; yet we have been accuſtomed to think favourably of the diſeaſe, where the patient is refreſhed by it. On the contrary, total want of reſt, or unrefreſhing ſlumbers, conſtantly indicate danger. There is, however, an aſtoniſhing diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of conſtitution in this reſpect, that muſt always be taken into the account in forming an opinion. Want of ſleep was obſerved to give riſe to delirium in ſome perſons very ſpeedily; others ſupported it for a great length of time, without any appearance of delirium or ſpaſmodic affection. An appearance of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028890_0127_0FDE5C9E4DF2D4D0"/>
ſleeping, without actually enjoying the comforts of ſleep is well known to be a dangerous ſymptom; yet it is not by any means a mortal one. Anxiety and reſtleſſneſs, are often referred to the ſtomach; but reſtleſſneſs, and jactitation, as depending on the ſtate of the nervous ſyſtem, were likewiſe frequent, and generally dangerous ſymptoms. Tremors of the tongue and of the hands were common appearances in fevers, with marks of nervous affection; but I have likewiſe met with inſtances, where the whole body ſhook, when any motion was attempted, not otherwiſe than it does in paralyſis or chorea ſancti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viti. Startings and ſubſultus tendinum were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common; and they were juſtly conſidered as indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of danger; ſometimes as forerunners of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion. A diſpoſition to faint, even actual faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was frequent in the fevers of this country. It was always dangerous, though perhaps leſs ſo, than other ſymptoms which were leſs alarming, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly if it ſuffered increaſe and diminution with the paroxyſms and remiſſions of the diſeaſe. But beſides theſe ſymptoms, which indicate diminiſhed energies, or irregular action of the nervous influence, we may likewiſe obſerve, that the ſphincter muſcles fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently loſe their power of contracting, particularly in the advanced periods of fevers. Thus perſons ſometimes can only lie upon their back, the eyes and mouth are half open, the powers of ſpeech and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are impaired or loſt, and urine and ſtools paſs off without conſciouſneſs or againſt their will. It is unneceſſary to remark, that theſe are all ſymptoms of the moſt extreme danger. If they proceed from a general and uniform diminution of the powers of life, we may juſtly conſider them as fatal, if they are only produced by a certain mode of action of the febrile cauſe, and are remarkably increaſed during the paroxyſm, or aggravated by peculiar circumſtances of conſtitution, we ſhall find many inſtances of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028890_0128_0FDE5D5FE9AEAB68"/>
Thus, I have often ſeen people recover, who could neither ſpeak nor ſwallow; who did not appear even to diſtinguiſh objects, and who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to retain their urine and ſtools; or who were not conſcious when they paſſed; yet I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have met with any of theſe fortunate events, where theſe alarming ſymptoms were the conſequence of uniform diminution, or general extinction of the vital principle.</p>
            <p>From the ſigns which I have enumerated, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and collectively conſidered, we may in general be able to form ſome prognoſtic of the nature and event of the fevers of Jamaica. If to theſe we add thoſe indications, which may be taken from the ſtate of the eye and countenance, we may attain a ſtill more ſatisfactory knowledge. It is an obſervation which I have conſtantly found to be true, that where the eye and countenance were ſerene and cheerful, the diſeaſe was void of any latent malignity, though it might be otherwiſe of a dangerous nature. On the contrary, where the appearance of the eye was ſad, watery, inflamed, or uncommonly gliſtening; where the countenance was of a dreary hue, downcaſt, dark and clouded; and ſometimes where it was of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful blooming colour, which was not natural to the patient, there was always reaſon to ſuſpect danger. But though a ſerene and cheerful eye and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance are generally indications of ſafety, I muſt not at the ſame time omit to mention, that it ſometimes happens in beginning mortifications, or in imperfect or unfavourable criſis, that the eye and countenance aſſume, for a ſhort time, this flattering appearance of ſerenity and compoſure, though the hour of death is actually approaching faſt. The indications from the eye and countenance are of the greateſt importance, in enabling us to form a judgment of the event of fevers; but little of this knowledge is, in fact, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable in words. It muſt be drawn, in a great meaſure, from our own obſervations.</p>

I do not pretend that the ſigns of prognoſtic, which I have enumerated in the preceding pages, are by any means complete, if referred to fevers in general; but I at the ſame time believe, that they are leſs defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, if applied more directly to the remitting fever of Jamaica. They were collected at a time when I was not much acquainted with books: and, on that account, I am induced to offer them to the public with more confidence; particularly, as I find that the indications, to which I have principally truſted, appeared in the ſame light to ſome authors, who are univerſally conſidered as careful obſervers, and who practiſed in climates, in many reſpects, ſimilar to that of the Weſt Indies. I have diſcriminated, as far as was in my power, between the doubtful and more certain appearances of danger or ſafety; and I hope I have no where advanced any thing, which has a tendency to miſlead the uninformed. I may add, that general knowledge in prognoſtic goes no farther than a very rude outline, which individuals muſt fill up from their own experience. There are, in fact, few ſigns in fevers, which are abſolutely deciſive in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and as theſe ſigns are often variouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined, ſo they muſt be ſeparately and collectively eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated. It is only from conſidering accurately the reſult of the whole, that we can be enabled to ſpeak with confidence.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CRISIS AND SIMPLE REMISSION.</head>
            <p>IT is certainly a matter of ſome importance, to be able to diſtinguiſh between actual criſis and the ſimple remiſſion of the fever of Jamaica; but it is a matter about which the practitioners of that country did not ſeem much to concern themſelves. A differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence undoubtedly exiſts, and the marks of it appeared to me clear and unequivocal in moſt inſtances. It was otherwiſe in the intermitting fever of America. In the pure intermitting fever of that country, I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gueſſed luckily; but I cannot ſay poſitively, that I ever diſcovered ſigns on which I could depend with abſolute certainty, that the fever was gone, not to return again, till the hour of return was paſt. In this diſeaſe, on the contrary, I ſhould not expect to be deceived once in a hundred times. Much of this information, however, is too minute to be intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly explained in words, and therefore can only be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by actual obſervation.</p>
            <p>I ſhall attempt to enumerate the principal of thoſe ſigns, from which we may be enabled to attain ſome knowledge of the difference between actual criſis and temporary remiſſion: and in the firſt place I remark, that the tongue was uſually rough and dry, even dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt perfect remiſſions of the endemic fever of Jamaica. If it therefore happened, that it aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſmooth and moiſt appearance at the end of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm, there generally was reaſon to believe that the fever was gone, not to return again. This preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſtill ſtronger, where its edges acquired the cherry-like colour of health; and particularly where the coat, with which it was uſually covered, ſhewed
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028890_0131_0FDE5CAA6C9CD660"/>
a diſpoſition to looſen and ſeparate. It muſt however be remarked, that though theſe appearances of the tongue afforded a common mark of the termination of fevers, they did not by any means afford a deciſive one. Inſtead of criſis, they ſometimes only indicated a change in the mode of action of the febrile cauſe; they were, in ſhort, in ſome caſes only forerunners of ſymptoms of nervous affection, or marks of a change from a continued to a remitting or intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting form. Such are the preſumptions of actual cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, which might be drawn from the appearances of the tongue, where the tongue happened to be remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably changed from its natural appearance in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding courſe of the diſeaſe. But it alſo ſometimes happened in caſes of the ſingle tertian, where the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms were ſlight, and the remiſſions long and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that the tongue was ſo little altered by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the fever, as not to afford any certain crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion between the remiſſion and actual criſis. In ſome fevers likewiſe of a malignant kind, the tongue was ſometimes ſmooth and moiſt, even red and clear on the edges, whilſt the diſeaſe was advancing rapidly. This, however, ſo far as I have ſeen was conſtantly connected with a particular ſtate of the ſtomach, <abbr>viz.</abbr> with nauſea, or with vomitting of a viſcous liquor.</p>
            <p>Signs of criſis taken from the pulſe alone, were not in general much to be depended upon in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Jamaica; yet, together with other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the ſtate of the pulſe might often help us to decide in doubtful ſituations. Changes from bad to better, if no ſymptoms of comatoſe affection appeared at the ſame time, were generally conſidered as indicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing criſis, or tendency to criſis, yet it will be leſs expected, perhaps, that I ſhould rank the intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pulſe among the ſigns, which indicate a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able termination of the diſeaſe. Some inſtances of this have occured to me, both in the Weſt-Indies and in England; but though I mention the fact, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs myſelf unable to offer an explanation of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="unknown:028890_0132_0FDE5D734D2C1200"/>
The ſtate of the ſkin affords marks more deciſive of the total or temporary abſence of fever, than the ordinary ſtate of the pulſe. When the ſweat, which in the preceding remiſſions had been partial and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, became copious, fluid, univerſal and of long continuance, there was generally a preſumption of criſis. But independent of the nature of the ſweat, there is ſomething in the ſtate of the ſkin, ſomething in the impreſſion which it makes on the hand which feels it, very different when the fever has only remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and when it has terminated finally. Though it may be difficult, perhaps impoſſible, to mark this diſtinction preciſely in words; yet it is eaſily known to thoſe, who accuſtom themſelves to obſerve minute circumſtances with attention. There was, in fact, no indication of that ſpaſmodic ſtricture on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, which had been obſervable in the former remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and we might ſay, that the body was perſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, even in the extreme parts. It is a circumſtance likewiſe not a little curious, that the heat of the body, during a criſis, particularly in thoſe fevers, which had principally affected the nervous ſyſtem, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo much below what it uſually is in health, as to be really alarming. In ſome inſtances, I have found the extremities to be not leſs cold, than if the patient had been actually dead; yet this coldneſs was of ſuch a nature, as to be diſtinguiſhed without much difficulty from that which precedes death.</p>
            <p>The above is only a very imperfect hiſtory of thoſe ſigns, which actually diſtinguiſh the criſis of fever from a ſimple remiſſion. There are ſtill ſome others, not leſs to be depended upon, perhaps, but which cannot be ſo eaſily reduced to diſtinct deſcription.—Among theſe, we may reckon unuſual evacuations upwards or downwards, ſound and refreſhing ſleep, where watchfulneſs had prevailed through the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courſe of the diſeaſe, return of natural appetites, decreaſe of thirſt, looſening of ſcabby eruptions, and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028890_0133_0FDE5CB2EA728420"/>
above all, a certain expreſſion of chearfulneſs in the eye and countenance, which though not to be defined in words, conveys to the mind of the obſerver, a ſtrong conviction of what is going forward. This brightneſs of the eye was well known to Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, as a ſalutary ſign in fevers; but though it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally affords a very decided indication of a favourable event; yet we muſt be careful to diſtinguiſh from it that clear and glaſſy appearance, which the eye ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times acquires previous to death.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. THE GENERAL CURE OF FEVER.</head>
            <p>BEFORE I attempt to offer rules for the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the remitting fever of Jamaica, it will be proper to conſider in the firſt place, how far the cure of the diſeaſe is the work of nature, and how far it already has been, or hereafter may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by the exertions of art. The queſtion is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, and till its limits are defined, we cannot hope to eſtabliſh rules of practice on a firm baſis, or to conduct a mode of treatment on a conſiſtent plan. It will be neceſſary however, before entering farther into this ſubject, to conſider the power of the vis medicatrix naturae:—a principle, which under one name or other, has influenced the views of medical men from the earlieſt records of phyſic, till the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>SECTION I. OF THE VIS MEDICATRIX NATURAE.</head>
               <p>IT is an opinion, which ſeems either to have been expreſsly avowed, or tacitly acknowledged in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age of the world, that a fever is a combat or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of nature, to remove from the ſyſtem the derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a morbid cauſe; or in other words, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore a diſeaſed body to its ordinary health. It was long believed, that the powers of the conſtitution made an attempt to concoct the crude and undigeſted humours;—and finally to expel them from the body. But this mode of reaſoning is found to be unſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory:
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028890_0135_0FDE5CB5CC6022F8"/>
and ſome late authors have adopted the idea, that nature directs her efforts towards effecting a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſpaſm, on the preſence and obſtinacy of which the diſeaſe has been thought, in ſome meaſure, to depend. It will be a hard taſk to reconcile this difference of opinion, or to ſay which is the right one. There are plauſible arguments on both ſides of the queſtion; and neither ſuppoſition, perhaps, is accurately true. The coction of humours (as it may be called) is often apparently connected with evident approaches towards a relaxation of ſpaſmodic ſtricture; and increaſed diſcharges by the different ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretories, are obviouſly attendants of its actual ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet though this is certainly true, it ſtill is not clear, that either the coction of the humours, or the ſolution of the ſpaſm, is the real effect of a regular mechanic operation of the powers of nature, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this means to overcome the deſtructive ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the diſeaſe. It is even more probable, that the coction of the humours, or ſolution of the ſpaſm are only circumſtances of accident, occaſionally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with certain ſtates of action of the morbid cauſe; but which do not ariſe from the regular deſign of nature to accompliſh this purpoſe. I juſt now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that there is a difference of opinion about the mode of operation, which nature employs to combat the effects of the diſeaſe; but I may add, that no body, as far as I know, attempts to deny the exiſtence of ſuch a principle in the conſtitution of the frame, as diſpoſes it to reſtore its own health by a certain train of regular efforts. On the firſt view of the ſubject, indeed, there are many circumſtances which give countenance to the opinion. The relief which often follows hemorrhage, ſweat and other evacuations in unuſual quantity; and ſtill more, the relief, which attends the eruption of the ſmall pox, or the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of gout on the extremities, undoubtedly affords a ſtrong preſumptive argument, that nature raiſeſ
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028890_0136_0FDE5D845E3E7E20"/>
ſome active and generally well directed efforts, which remove from the body a cauſe that diſturbs the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary functions of health. But though the above cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are commonly known, and may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to afford an argument in ſupport of this opinion; yet the fact may perhaps admit of another explanation, while there are other appearances, connected with the ſubject, which render the exiſtence of this regular deſign of nature very queſtionable. When I ſay, that I cannot readily allow the vis m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dicatrix naturae, (in the ſenſe in which it is generally underſtood), to be an eſtabliſhed principle in the conſtitution of the frame, I am aware, that I incur an imputation of of preſumption. An opinion, venerable from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and ſupported by many plauſible arguments, might be thought to be ſecure from the attacks of a man, who has no profeſſional reputation to boaſt of: yet as no deſire of novelty has induced me to fabricate a conjecture on a dark ſubject, ſo I humbly hope I may be indulged in my attempt to explain an important truth. The ſanction of two thouſand years, and the authority of the names who ſupport this doctrine, are formidable opponents; yet I truſt I may be able to prove, that the vis medicatrix naturae does not, as is commonly believed, reſtore the health of the body by one general and uniform mode of operation; or that our diſeaſes are not removed in conſequence of a regular deſign in the mechaniſm of the frame. I ſhall relate the fact from which I have been led to form this concluſion; for the refutation or confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, I require no other indulgence than a candid enquiry.</p>
               <p>I have juſt now declared, that fever, or the cauſe of fever, is not combated and finally overcome by a regular train of active efforts, or a vis medicatrix na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae; and I muſt obſerve in proof of it, that there were many of the fevers of the Weſt-Indies, where the diſeaſe, or the paroxyſm of the diſeaſe, vaniſhed or
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028890_0137_0FDE5CBF9A962318"/>
declined, without any exertion on the part of nature being perceiveable. The powers of life, during this period, were in ſome degree ſuſpended. The patient, who could only be ſaid not to be actually dead, was totally inſenſible to every object that was near to him; and often did not feel the irritation of acrid ſubſtances that were applied to him: yet after a certain conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in this ſtate, he began to reſume his powers of ſenſation and motion; and the diſeaſe at laſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided or vaniſhed, though the efforts of nature were not diſcovered; nay, though the vital powers were ſometimes in a ſtate ſo weakened, as to be apparently very little capable of effort. This fact, which the moſt ſuperficial obſerver could not eaſily overlook, furniſhes ſufficient reaſon for doubting of the very exiſtence of a vis medicatrix naturae; a doubt which is further corroborated, by obſerving the manner in which death frequently approaches in the fevers of Jamaica. It is known, that the ſufferings of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient are ſometimes alleviated for a ſhort time before death. This alleviation, wherever it does take place, happens conſtantly at the expected period of criſis. The cauſe of it has generally been attributed to the vis medicatrix naturae; that is, to a laſt effort of the powers of life; but I have weighed carefully all the circumſtances connected with the phenomenon, and cannot readily aſſent to the opinion. To indulge in conjectures, is contrary to the principles I profeſs; yet I muſt ſuggeſt, that a fever, or the paroxyſm of a fever, terminates, ſtrictly ſpeaking, from a hidden ſomething in the nature of the febrile cauſe, from ſomething which ceaſes to act, or which changes its mode of action after a certain duration. I do not pretend to explain the manner in which this happens. I only add, that the fact is ſupported by probabilities. It was frequently obſerved, in ſuch caſes of fever as terminated fatally, that there was actually a period of time, generally the period immediately preceding a
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:028890_0138_0FDE5D8D3A8212B8"/>
decided fatal termination, where the real preſence of diſeaſe was perceived with difficulty. The patient, however, was unable to recover. Death happened in a very few hours, and it ſeemed to enſue in ſuch caſes, from one of the following cauſes, <abbr>viz.</abbr> either from the mechaniſm of a part of vital importance being deſtroyed; from the powers of nature being too much exhauſted to continue life; or perhaps ſtill oftener, from the recurrence of the diſeaſe, in another form, ſpeedily putting a period to exiſtence, while the vital principle was in this weakened ſtate. But though the circumſtances, which I have mentioned, afford grounds for believing that a fever, or the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm of a fever, is not actually removed from the body, ſolely by the efforts of a vis medicatrix naturae; yet if we chooſe to proceed further in the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will be no difficult taſk to involve this opinion, which has hitherto been conſidered almoſt as ſacred, in ſtill greater perplexity. If we admit of the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a vis medicatrix naturae, it will not be eaſy to conceive, how a fever, which has once been expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the body, ſhould return again in a given time, or how the alternate paroxyſms of the double tertian, for inſtance, ſhould be of ſuch different duration or of ſuch different degrees of violence in the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; neither can we underſtand, how a fever of one kind ſhould laſt only ſeven days, another fourteen, and another twenty, or longer:—circumſtances which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen daily, without the leaſt apparent connexion with the innate vigour of conſtitution. We ſhall be equally puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled likewiſe, if we attempt to explain on the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this principle, how a fever ſhould continue, while the powers of the conſtitution are vigorous and ſtrong, and ceaſe when they are apparently exhauſted. The above are well known facts, and do not leave any room to doubt, that the termination of fever, or of the paroxyſm of fever, depends on ſome other principle beſides the mere efforts of the vis medicatrix
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028890_0139_0FDE5CC82826EE40"/>
naturae. Whether this reſides, as was hinted before, in a hidden modification of the nature of the cauſe, which ceaſes to act, or changes its mode of action af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a certain duration; or whether, combined with this, the conſtant but imperceptible changes, which are continually going on in the ſyſtem, deſtroy in the frame of the individual, that particular ſtate of apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the febrile cauſe, in which the diſeaſe conſiſts, we cannot determine with certainty; yet it would be obſtinate to maintain any longer, that the cure of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is owing to general and well directed efforts of nature, expelling a morbific matter or overcoming a prevailing ſpaſm. It is true, that an obvious ſolution of ſpaſmodic ſtricture, or the appearance of a morbid matter on the leſs important parts of the body, uſually attend the favourable termination of fevers; yet theſe circumſtances are, in fact, attendants rather than cauſes of criſis. I do not deny, that increaſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges by different outlets, ſometimes moderate the violence of fever during its continuance, as well as attend its final ſolution; yet it has not, nor perhaps can it ever be demonſtrated, that this proceeds from a regular deſign of nature.</p>
               <p>The hints which have been thrown out in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding pages, give room for ſuppoſing that the vis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatrix naturae, in the ſenſe in which it is uſually underſtood by medical writers, is only a principle of doubtful exiſtence in the conſtitution of the frame; yet though this is certainly true, I do not pretend to deny, that the animal machine is endued with a power, which reſiſts, in ſome meaſure, the derangements of a deſtroying cauſe, and which perſiſts to a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in continuing the action of living. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nature of the cauſe of fever, or the nature of its various modifications is a myſtery, which we do not as yet know. We only know, that when preſent in a certain ſtate of vigour and activity, it deranges or diſturbs the actions and functions of the ſyſtem;—
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028890_0140_0FDE5D960E74E1C8"/>
while we likewiſe know, that it does not always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb every action or every function in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. It has occurred too often to have eſcaped the moſt ſuperficial obſervation, that where one part of the body ſuffers particularly, the others are often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in proportion. We frequently in this manner obſerve, that general fever is diminiſhed by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of local pain; or, on the contrary, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by its removal. It likewiſe often happens from the ſame principle, that where the ſtomach and biliary ſyſtem ſuffer much, there is leſs diſorder in the other parts: and on the other hand, that where theſe ſufferings are removed or mitigated, the general fever runs higher, and often continues high, till the ſame, or other local affections, are again produced. Thus, though we are totally ignorant of the intimate nature of the cauſe of fever, we ſtill perceive very plainly, that it either poſſeſſes ſomething in its own nature, or accidentally meets with ſomething in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the individual, which determines it to affect the different parts of the body in an unequal degree. It uſually exerts its greateſt force upon parts, which are preternaturally weakened by the general influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of climate, ſeaſon, ſituation, or other accidental ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſes. Hence bilious appearances are common in the hot months of hot climates, pneumonic affection in cold and dry weather, greater degrees of vaſcular excitement among the temperate and more active races of men; while ſymptoms of nervous affection prevail among the luxurious and enfeebled. The above, with other ſpecies of the increaſed action of the cauſe of fever on a particular part of the body, depend wholly, perhaps, on circumſtances of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; yet it has ſo happened, that thoſe irregular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations have unfortunately been conſidered as the efforts, which nature employs to expel from the body a cauſe, which diſturbs the economy of health. I ſhall not, at preſent, go ſo far as to contend, that
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028890_0141_0FDE5CD06A2C6EB8"/>
theſe determinations are not, in fact, intentions of nature; but ſhall only beg leave to ſuggeſt, if they actually are intentions, that it is mere chance which determines whether they are ſalutary or fatal. It is a truth which nobody will deny, where the force of the diſeaſe is accidentally directed to an organ of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to a part of little importance to life, that the reſt of the body is often proportionally relieved, and even that a recovery of general health is ſometimes the conſequence; yet the contrary is the effect, where the functions of the part, upon which the force of the fever has been thus accidentally diverted, are of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate importance to the action of living. The Gout, a diſeaſe, the cauſe of which bears no very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote analogy to the cauſe of fever, may be adduced as affording an illuſtration of this truth. The proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſe of gout, is equally hid from us as the proximate cauſe of fever. We know, however, that the one equally with the other, has a tendency to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy life. We likewiſe know, that there is a power or principle in the conſtitution, which to a certain degree reſiſts deſtruction. The nature of this power, however, is unknown. We are not only in the dark with regard to its nature; but we can only form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures about the part where it principally reſides.—We, however, clearly perceive its force and activity to be different in different parts of the body. We may next be allowed to remark, that where the cauſe of gout is in a certain ſtate of modification, tumults, (which properly enough may be termed re-action), ariſe in the ſyſtem, and go on to continue till this cauſe or hurtful matter finds an outlet from the body, or a lodgment on one particular part. The outlets from the body are numerous: the parts on which the gout ſeems principally to fix its ſeat, are the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, where the power of reſiſtance is ſmalleſt.—The vital principle, however, becomes weaker as man advances in years; and the cauſe of the diſorder
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028890_0142_0FDE5D9DEA5CECC8"/>
ſeems then frequently to find accommodations in parts, which are leſs remote from the ſources of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This more eſpecially is the caſe, where tone and vigour have been preternaturally weakened. Hence the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the bowels, ſometimes the brain, and even the heart itſelf ſuffer from the immediate action of this diſeaſe, in the latter periods of life. But though no perſon perhaps will deny, that the cauſe of gout finds readieſt accommodation, (if I may ſo apply the term) in thoſe parts of the body, where the vital powers are naturally weak, or have been accidentally weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened from various cauſes; yet we may add, that it is likewiſe removed from the parts, on which it has been thus fixed, by ſuch applications as excite their active powers; or, in other words, which call forth the local re-action of the ſyſtem. We may alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that tumults ariſe in the general ſyſtem, in conſequence of this repreſſion or repulſion of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid cauſe from a particular part; and that they do not in general ceaſe, till an outlet is opened, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation found in ſome other parts of the body. The above appearances, occur daily in the hiſtory of gout. They ſeem to bear a ſtrong analogy to thoſe irregular determinations, which frequently take place in fevers, and their cauſe perhaps is the ſame. We do not perceive any other law by which they can be explained, than the natural or adventitious ſtate of activity of the powers of life, which reſiſt deſtruction with unequal force in the different parts of the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem: ſo that we ſhall be obliged to conclude, that thoſe ſufferings, which have hitherto been ſtyled the efforts of nature, are in reality more of the paſſive, than of the active kind.</p>
               <p>The circumſtances which I have now mentioned, combat the very exiſtence of the opinion, which has been commonly received with regard to the vis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatrix naturae. I have hinted, that the extent and limits of that principle are narrow, and that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028890_0143_0FDE5CDA59A500A0"/>
effects are accidental. I ſhall next endeavour to ſhew, that they cannot, without danger, be made the baſis of the general plan of cure in febrile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. The taſk is important, but the attempt may be thought preſumptuous, as an opinion, contrary to that which I advance, has obtained almoſt the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſent of mankind. I have no deſire of changing names, or of making diſtinctions, where there is in fact no difference. I perfectly acquieſce in retaining the word vis medicatrix naturae, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it is limitted to a certain mode of re-action, or to a power in the conſtitution of reſiſting deſtruction unequally in its different parts, in conſequence of which, irregular determinations ſometimes prove ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary by accident; yet I muſt add, that if we mean to denote by this term a ſyſtem of laws, which have the beſt directed tendency to remove from the body a cauſe which deſtroys health, and endangers life, the opinion has a very uncertain foundation. There are few perſons ſo ignorant, or ſo blindly devoted to the doctrines of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as not to own, that the uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reputed efforts of nature, are often ill directed, ſometimes pernicious: in ſhort, that they are obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the cauſes of death. The truth of this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation cannot be denied, and unfortunately it obliges the advocates of the vis medicatrix naturae, to grant the concluſion, that the laws of the principle are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. The works of the author of nature, as far as our limited knowledge can trace them, are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally without defect, if examined according to the plan on which they have been originally formed. If they appear otherwiſe, it becomes us to heſitate, before we decide. We may not have comprehended the fundamental principle of the deſign; but we revolt from the idea, that the execution would be left im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, had it been intended by the Author of our being, that the mechaniſm of the frame would be ſuch, as ſhould oppoſe and remove, in the moſt
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028890_0144_0FDE5DA90FC58190"/>
effectual manner, the derangements of the morbid cauſe. Defect and imperfection can have no place in the works of the Almighty. Had it actually been in the original deſign of our Creator, that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body ſhould be provided with a ſyſtem of the beſt concerted laws for reſtoring its health, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged by the numerous cauſes of diſeaſes, as it is impious to ſuppoſe, that thoſe laws could be defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; ſo we may reaſonably conclude, that the effects of fevers would not then have been fatal. We find however, that fevers, as well as other diſeaſes, are fatal to people of all ages and deſcriptions: and that nature's intentions of cure, if they really are inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are often deſtructive to herſelf. I need ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remind the reader of examples of their pernicious tendency. Vomitting, ſweating, increaſed diſcharges by ſtool, &amp;c. are generally conſidered as the ſalutary efforts of nature: but inſtances are numerous, where the exceſs of thoſe evacuations have obviouſly proved the cauſes of death. In the ſame manner, abſceſſes, which in the remote parts of the body, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attend, and even ſometimes perhaps influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the favourable termination of fevers; in the brain, or in other organs of importance, are no leſs certainly the cauſe which deſtroys life. In both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the deſign of nature, if it can be called a deſign, is the ſame. The force of the diſeaſe being turned principally upon one part, the reſt of the body is in a great meaſure relieved from its ſufferings;—but the health and ſtructure of the part are hurt or deſtroyed by the change; and it depends wholly upon the accidental importance of the organ, upon which this diverſion has been made, whether death or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery is the conſequence. Thus it often happens, that the reputed indications of nature prove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſes which deſtroy the exiſtence of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual; a fact not reconcileable, with the infinite power and wiſdom of the Author of our being.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="unknown:028890_0145_0FDE5CE328070260"/>
I have inſinuated, that the efforts of nature are uncertain and precarious. They depend on acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental determinations to different parts of the body; and I may add, that if we endeavour to inveſtigate the cauſe, which directs the mechaniſm of the frame, to adopt one ſpecies of effort, or one mode of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in preference to another, we ſhall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be able to find any other, than a difference in the ſtates of the powers of life, which reſiſt deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with unequal degrees of force in the different parts of the body. Where there is the leaſt reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, either from the natural or accidental circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the conſtitution, there the diſeaſe moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly exerts its greateſt force. Hence we are ſufficiently warranted to conclude, that though the ſtructure of the human body is perfect with reſpect to every purpoſe for which it is intended, being only endued with a principle, which reſiſts deſtruction, or perſiſts in continuing life to a certain degree; yet that it is extremely defective, if we conſider it as a machine furniſhed with a ſyſtem of laws, which have an invariable and well directed tendency to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore health by the moſt judicious and rational efforts. The reſtoration of health, in conſequence of this re-action, or irregular determination which takes place in the ſyſtem, is only a circumſtance of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The ſkill of man ſometimes ſucceeds, where the efforts of nature have obviouſly failed.</p>

               <head>SECTION II. OF THE GENERAL INDICATIONS OF CURE IN FEVERS.</head>
               <p>THE vis medicatrix naturae, has been hitherto eſteemed a principle of much importance in the cure of febrile diſeaſes. I have attempted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028890_0146_0FE16FB606666998"/>
its real limits and extent; but am afraid I may not have done it ſatisfactorily. A tumult which, properly enough perhaps, may be termed a reaction of the ſyſtem, evidently takes place in conſequence of the application of a morbid cauſe; but there ſeems to be little reaſon for believing, that this reaction points out the beſt method of cure, or wholly by itſelf accompliſhes this important buſineſs. But though the reputed efforts of nature are thus defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in accompliſhing the cure of fevers; yet I do not deny, that there is a general tendency in fevers, or in the paroxyſm of fevers, to terminate in a given time, often by a fixed and regular mode of termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We do not, however, by any means compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the cauſe upon which this depends. From the ſimilarity in the progreſs and termination of epidemics, as well as from the ſteadineſs with which various ſorts of fevers purſue their courſe, in ſpite of the moſt oppoſite modes of treatment, we are led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is ſomething peculiar in the modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the cauſe, which influences the duration of the diſeaſe. This at preſent, is unknown; perhaps is a knowledge which we cannot attain; yet if we take pains to obſerve the courſe of fevers with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we may diſcover ſome rules of practical uſe. We know that one ſpecies of febrile diſeaſes, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately purſues its courſe, notwithſtanding every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to oppoſe it; while another is ſo totally under our management, as to be ſtopt ſhort at pleaſure with almoſt infallible certainty. It thus happens, that the intermittent is perfectly under our controul. Over the continued, and even over the remitting fever of Jamaica, I am afraid, we ſhall be obliged to confeſs, that we poſſeſs no very certain power.—But I ſhall examine this ſubject more particularly.</p>
               <p>When I firſt arrived in Jamaica, in the year 1774, I found that the practitioners of that country very generally believed, that the courſe of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028890_0147_0FDE5DB0CA0C8E38"/>
endemic fever was checked with great certainty by the powers of Peruvian bark. This opinion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is found in every medical book, and it appeared frequently, on the firſt view of the ſubject, to be well founded. No great ſpace of time, however, elapſed before ſome circumſtances were obſerved, which preſented the matter in a different light. I found in many inſtances, that bark was given in the firſt remiſſion, or on the ſecond day of the diſeaſe; in others, it was not given till the third remiſſion, or till the ſixth day from the beginning of the complaint; and in ſome again, the fever diſappeared altogether before a ſingle grain of this remedy had been admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered. I was particularly exact in marking the time or the period of the diſeaſe, at which the bark was begun to be given, as alſo the quantity which was taken upon the whole. The reſult was not ſuch as might have been expected. Notwithſtanding the moſt oppoſite modes of treatment, the diſeaſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to terminate or change about the ſame periods in almoſt every patient. This fact was confirmed in numerous inſtances; and it ſeems to afford a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal proof, that bark, in the quantity in which it is commonly preſcribed in the Weſt Indies, has not the effects which are <hi>uſually</hi> aſcribed to it. I do not, however, infer, that this remedy may not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, with more deciſive modes of management, of effecting all that has been expected from it. I had not, during the time that I remained in Jamaica, any conception that the ſtomach could have retained, or that it would have been ſafe to have ventured upon the quantities of bark, which I afterwards gave to others, or took myſelf in the intermitting fever of America. Two ſcruples or a drachm, every two hours, is in fact only a ſmall doſe. To this under doſe, during ſhort remiſſions, we might perhaps impute the failure of that remedy in the fevers of the Weſt Indies. That this actually is the caſe, is confirmed
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028890_0148_0FDE5DBAC7A67F00"/>
in ſome degree, by an inſtance which I find recorded among my notes. A young man was ſeized with a fever, about the middle of Auguſt, which ſhewed marks of great violence from the beginning. Bark was given early, and in larger quantity than cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary. The laſt paroxyſm of the diſeaſe, was in ſome meaſure ſuſpended, in conſequence of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; yet, except that the marks of external fever were obſcure, the patient remained, as uſual, uneaſy and diſtreſſed, till the period at which the criſis was expected; when the marks of final termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhewed themſelves diſtinctly. This is the only caſe I met with, where the paroxyſms of the fever of Jamaica were ſtopt, or ſuſpended by the bark; or where external marks of fever vaniſhed without evident ſigns of criſis. It affords only a doubtful proof of the power, which this remedy has been ſuppoſed to poſſeſs, of abſolutely cutting ſhort the courſe of the endemic of that country. But though the bark was ſeldom efficacious in abruptly cutting ſhort the courſe of this diſeaſe, it is no more than juſtice to remark, that it is a remedy which was almoſt every where ſafe, and that it was ultimately uſeful in promoting the cure. It imparted in moſt inſtances, where it was employed, a degree of tone and vigour to the ſyſtem—a certain ſomething to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; in conſequence of which, the criſis, which we ſhould have expected to be only partial or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, became decided and final. I have ſuggeſted thoſe few remarks, with regard to the virtues of Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian bark in the common endemic of Jamaica; if its effects are ſo very doubtful in this diſeaſe, we have no reaſon to expect, that they will be more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in fevers of a more continued kind.</p>
               <p>Beſides bark, the power of which appears to be very precarious, other remedies have been employed by phyſicians, with the view of cutting ſhort the courſe of fevers.—Antimony, under one form or
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028890_0149_0FDE5DC332336508"/>
other, has been celebrated for this intention, ſince its firſt introduction into medicine. James's Powder is the moſt famous, and perhaps the moſt effectual antimonial preparation, which, as yet, has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the public. I am ſorry to ſay, that I had not an opportunity of making proper trial of it, in the fevers of the Weſt-Indies; but I can add, that the emetic tartar was often found to be dangerous, ſcarcely ever effectual in cutting ſhort the courſe of the diſeaſe, unleſs given at an early period, or before the fever had aſſumed a proper form. Its <hi>virtues,</hi> as a febrifuge, were heightened by the addition of opium and camphire, I am ſorry alſo to remark, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak with confidence of the virtues of James's Powder, in the intermitting fever of America. Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic tartar was frequently employed, but it did not by any means anſwer the expectations which were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of it. I acknowledge, that it might be ſo managed, as apparently to prevent the return of a particular paroxyſm; but the inſtances, where it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely removed the diſeaſe, were ſo rare, that I do not conſider it as poſſeſſed of very eminent virtues. I have had frequent opportunities, ſince my return to Britain, of trying James's Powder in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued fevers of this country; and the reſult of my experience inclines me to believe, that this remedy, when given at an early period, has ſometimes actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally carried off the diſeaſe. It appeared likewiſe, when exhibited near the critical periods, to render the criſis more complete; but I have little cauſe for thinking, that it ever cut ſhort a fever in the midſt of its courſe. Thus it appears, that theſe two cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated remedies,—bark and the various preparations of antimony, are, in fact, leſs effectual in cutting ſhort the courſe of febrile diſeaſes, than has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuppoſed; I cannot, however, abandon the idea that the purpoſe, which has been expected from theſe remedies, may ſtill be obtained by other means.
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028890_0150_0FDE5DCA946FAC98"/>
Galen mentions ſome inſtances, where he extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fever by copious evacuations: authors men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many, and I have myſelf ſeen ſome, where drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plentifully of the coldeſt water, produced the ſame effects. The alternate uſe of warm and cold bathing occaſions great changes in the ſtate of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and from the trials, which I have made of theſe applications, I do not entertain a doubt, that they may be ſo managed, as to ſhorten very materially the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of fevers. I do not however promiſe, that they are capable of being ſo conducted, as infallibly at once to ſtop the diſeaſe in its progreſs. This can only be accompliſhed by thoſe great and remarkable changes, which deſtroy a certain aptitude, in the ſtate of the ſyſtem, to the morbid cauſe, in which the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is ſuppoſed to conſiſt. But I muſt at the ſame time confeſs, that as we neither know the nature of this aptitude, nor the particular nature of remote cauſes, ſo every attempt of cure on this plan, as it muſt be at random, cannot be adopted without danger. It is a view, therefore, which will not be proſecuted with ſafety, while our knowledge of the nature of morbid cauſes, and of the laws and ſtructure of the human frame, is ſo imperfect.</p>
               <p>It is evident from the facts which I have related in the preceding pages, that we cannot ſafely truſt the cure of fevers to thoſe tumults, or irregular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations in the ſyſtem, which are uſually ſtyled the efforts of nature: neither does it appear, that we can depend on the efficacy of any one remedy, we are yet acquainted with, as poſſeſſed of the power of abruptly cutting ſhort their courſe. We ſtill how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perceive, that theſe diſeaſes have a general ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to terminate in a given time and ſteadily to go through a regular progreſs, in ſpite of the greateſt exertions of art. If we review the practice which medical people have followed in fevers, from the days of Hippocrates to the preſent times, we meet with ſuch contradictory methods of treatment, as render
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028890_0151_0FDE5DD22B20E4C0"/>
it impoſſible to avoid pronouncing, that if one man had actually ſaved life, another's endeavours ſeemed as if intended to deſtroy it: yet few authors have ventured to offer the fruits of their labours to the public, without previouſly boaſting more ſucceſsful methods of cure, than were known to their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. Hence, if we are not ſometimes diſpoſed to doubt their veracity, we can hardly avoid concluding, that their practice had been feeble, and of ſmall effect. We lament, with reaſon, that medical facts are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of little value: nay, that they oftener miſlead, than guide us in the way to truth. An overfondneſs for ourſelves is, perhaps, more the cauſe of this, than real want of candour; the natural propenſity of the human mind to flatter itſelf, diſpoſing us to attribute cures to remedies, which were adminiſtered near the critical periods of the diſeaſe; while twenty inſtances, where ſimilar treatment produced no apparent effect, are inſenſibly blotted from the memory. This at leaſt was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he caſe with myſelf. I flattered myſelf in many inſtances, that I had actually ſaved life:—I now find, on maturer reflection, that I had in reality done no material good. Thus it frequently happens, I believe, that practitioners boaſt of cures, to which they have no right; at the ſame time I am convinced, that they are frequently charged with deaths, of which they are innocent. The life of man does not appear to depend upon ſo ſmall a matter, in febrile diſeaſes, as is generally imagined; and is not often preſerved or endangered by the routine of common practice. It is not always eaſy to know exactly the real effects of treatment; neither has the road, which leads to this knowledge, been purſued with ſufficient induſtry. Fevers occur frequently, and on that very account, have been traced leſs minutely in their courſe, than ſome other diſeaſes. There are few practitioners, who write down in the preſence of the ſick, a minute and accurate hiſtory of the various caſes of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which come under their care; who obſerve
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028890_0152_0FDE5DD9E878EA88"/>
carefully the changes which happen from day to day; who note the particular methods of cure, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which ariſe in conſequence of every alteration of treatment. Yet, unleſs all theſe circumſtances are attentively conſidered, we cannot hope to form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, which are in any degree to be depended upon. If we defer making remarks till the patient recovers or dies, difficulties will be eaſily got over, and ſuch facts as contradict opinions, in which we have long believed, will be more eaſily reconciled, as being leſs perfectly remembered. Hence it is that a man may continue a very extenſive practice, for a very long life, without ever once getting a view of the real truth.</p>
               <p>As from what has been ſaid before, little doubt can remain of the precariouſneſs of truſting the cure of fevers to the ſimple efforts of nature; or, if we except intermittents, to the efficacy of particular remedies which cut off their courſe abruptly, it remains to look out for ſome other principle, which may ſerve us as a guide in the conduct of our practice. It is a truth to which we may accede without heſitation, that the cauſe of fever, as I have mentioned before, whatever it is, or however modified, has a general tendency to deſtroy the powers of life; while we likewiſe know, that there is a principle in the mechaniſm of the frame, which reſiſts deſtruction to a certain degree. We alſo know, that the cauſe of the diſeaſe differs in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of force; and that it is differently modified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to various circumſtances; as we likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the principle of life, or power of reſiſtance, is different in activity, in the different parts of the body. To theſe two powers, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> force of the morbid cauſe and the powers of the conſtitution our views in practice muſt be principally directed. Hence we may eſtabliſh a general rule, that wherever the force of the morbid cauſe is weak; at the ſame time that the powers of life in the general ſyſtem, and particularly in the organs of vital importance, are
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028890_0153_0FDE5DDF702FE060"/>
ſtrong and active, we have nothing more to do than to look on. On the contrary, where the cauſe of the diſeaſe is of unuſual force, or where the powers of life are preternaturally weak, our interference ought to be ſpeedy, bold and decided. In other words, we leave the buſineſs chiefly to nature, or take it entirely out of her hands. It is this which a practitioner muſt firſt determine, when called upon to give his aſſiſtance to a patient labouring under a fever. If the powers of the conſtitution appear to be equal to the taſk, our interference would be officious, and perhaps might prove hurtful. If aſſiſtance is neceſſary, it ought to be our principal aim to render it complete; but in proſecuting this view, we meet with much difficulty and impediment. We are not yet acquainted with any one remedy, which has a certain and infallible power of cutting ſhort fevers in the midſt of their courſe. It is not therefore abſolutely in our power to take the buſineſs entirely out of the hands of nature. We can, in fact, go no farther, than to oppoſe her pernicious efforts; or to obviate the fatal tendencies of the diſeaſe. The fatal tendencies of the diſeaſe, are variouſly modified, and the means by which they muſt be obviated, are ſometimes directly oppoſite. Two general modes, however, of the fatal action of fevers may in moſt inſtances be diſcovered. The cauſe of the diſeaſe, in one caſe, exerts its influence on the ſources of life and motion; in the other, the ſtructure of an organ of leſs importance is deſtroyed, and death happens only from a ſecondary effect. There is perhaps no fundamental difference in theſe different modes of action; yet the indications of cure, which ariſe from this view, are totally oppoſite. In the firſt inſtance, it is neceſſary to excite, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the general powers of life: an indication of very great extent. In the other, it is ſometimes neceſſary to diminiſh the general reaction of the ſyſtem; to obviate irregular determination, and to oppoſe with vigour the tumultuary efforts of nature.</p>

            <head>CHAP. X. OF THE PARTICULAR CURE OF THE FEVER OF JAMAICA.</head>
            <p>I SHALL begin this ſubject with obſerving, that the fever, which prevailed in the diſtrict of Savanna la Mar, was naturally a diſeaſe of the remitting kind; yet circumſtances were ſometimes connected with it, in ſuch a manner as prevented it from aſſuming its proper form. To remove thoſe circumſtances, which thus maſked or concealed the real genius of the diſeaſe, was conſidered as the firſt ſtep towards a cure. The accompliſhment of this purpoſe, however, was ſometimes difficult; neither could it always be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame means. Thus it happened frequently in caſes, where there was exceſs of excitement, or a high degree of inflammatory diatheſis, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions where ſcarcely perceptible; as it was likewiſe obſerved, that where there was a want of reaction, the paroxyſms were often languid and obſcure. In the one caſe, the remiſſions diſcovered themſelves in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of bleeding, dilution and copious evacuation; in the other, wine and cordials determined the diſeaſe to aſſume its proper genuine form.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, evacuations were uſually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as the means of procuring remiſſion, where the inflammatory diatheſis prevailed in exceſs; I may add, that they were proper for the moſt part, and that they ſeldom failed of producing the effect. Bleeding was frequently neceſſary, and generally of ſervice. Its efficacy, however, was often heightened by particular modes of management. Thus relaxation of ſpaſms, and
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:028890_0155_0FDE5DF4A9CB5F10"/>
removal of inflammatory diatheſis, more certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed bleeding, if the blood was drawn from a large orifice; if the patient was placed in an erect poſture, during the operation; and more certainly ſtill, if the lower extremities were at the ſame time immerſed in warm water. When bleeding had been premiſed, and repeated according to the circumſtances and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the caſe, it was then cuſtomary to open the body freely: for which purpoſe, I have not found any thing anſwer better, than a thin ſolution of Glauber or Epſom Salts, with a ſmall portion of emetic tartar. The operation of this medicine was extenſive. It might be ſo managed as to occaſion nauſea, or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vomiting; to operate briſkly downwards, or to promote a gentle diaphoreſis. Remiſſions were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the conſequence of this method of proceeding, where there was no defect in the manner of conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. But where it it ſo happened, that the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the patient forbad the uſe of this laxative; or where it might not be proper to carry it to a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient length, benefit was derived from a powder, compoſed of nitre, camphire, emetic tartar and opium, given in pretty large doſes, and repeated frequently. Remiſſion, at leaſt a great abatement in the violence of ſymptoms, was generally the conſequence of this plan of treatment; particularly, if aſſiſted by the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful dilution of watery liquors, by warm bathing and by large glyſters of ſimple water. It is ſuperfluous to mention the uſe of bliſters in caſes of local affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it will be leſs expected, that this remedy ſhould be recommended in fevers, where there is an exceſs of the general inflammatory diatheſis.—I can, however, bear teſtimony to its efficacy. The manner by which bliſters produce their effects, is not yet agreed upon among authors; neither do I pretend to throw any new light upon the ſubject; but I would beg leave to ſuggeſt, that the mode of affording re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the preſent, at leaſt, did not ſeem to be much
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:028890_0156_0FDE5DFAE4904A60"/>
unlike the effect of local affections, in conſequence of which the violence of fevers is ſometimes obſerved to ſubſide.</p>
            <p>I purſued the above method of procuring remiſſion in thoſe fevers, where there was real inflammatory diatheſis prevailing in exceſs; but it ſo happened, that the ſigns of this diatheſis were fallacious, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſome inſtances to be preſent, though the real genius of the diſeaſe was actually of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; a circumſtance, which occaſioned a difference of management in conducting the method of cure. Exceſſive evacuations were not only unſafe in ſuch caſes, but in general had not any powerful effects in diſpoſing the diſeaſe to aſſume a remitting form. Bleeding, however, was often found to be neceſſary, though it was ſeldom requiſite to repeat the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The good effects which were obſerved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the uſe of cathartics, were not in general very remarkable; yet it was proper, in moſt inſtances, to open the body freely; for which purpoſe, no form of medicine, with which I am acquainted, anſwered better than a ſolution of ſalts with a ſmall portion of emetic tartar, and ſometimes with the addition of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum. In caſes of local pain, bliſters applied near the ſeat of affection were always of eminent ſervice; and in caſes of general irritability, they were often equally uſeful, when applied to the back part of the head and neck. A powder compoſed of nitre, cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, emetic tartar and opium, was likewiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed with ſucceſs; but the liberal uſe of warm bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was ſtill more to be depended upon. No per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, perhaps, will refuſe conſent to the method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, which I have hitherto recommended; but when I mention a free and bold uſe of cold bathing, even in an early ſtage of this fever, I do not expect the ſame conceſſion. To daſh cold water on the head and ſhoulders of a perſon in a fever, has an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of raſhneſs and hazard. I can, however,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:028890_0157_0FDE5E017A8429E0"/>
produce the teſtimony of repeated experience for the ſafety of the practice, no leſs than for its ſucceſs in procuring remiſſion; and ſhall therefore conſider it a duty to recommend it warmly to the public. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was employed,—and the caſes in which it was tried were numerous, a calm and equable perſpiration, additional tone and vigour, with great abatement of irritability, were conſtantly obſerved to enſue.</p>
            <p>The paroxyſms and remiſſions were generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct in the beginning of fevers, where the nervous ſyſtem was principally affected; but often became leſs ſo, as the diſeaſe advanced in its progreſs; a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which did not ariſe oftener from the nature of the complaint, than from the common method of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Bleeding was often diſpenſed with in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Weſt-Indies; but vomiting and purging were indulged in with freedom. The diſtinction of paroxyſm and remiſſion was ſometimes evidently ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered obſcure by this practice; while it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obviouſly reſtored again, by the uſe of wine and cordials, which excited the powers of life. In this ſpecies of diſeaſe, evacuations were ſeldom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; ſeldom indeed admiſſible in a great extent. Bleeding unleſs under particular circumſtances, was totally improper. Cathartics were ſometimes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and antimonial vomits often ſunk the patient irrecoverably. Bliſtering, on the contrary, even at an early period, was generally of ſervice; as alſo were opiates, and a judicious uſe of the warm bath; but cold bathing with ſalt water, was, of all others, the remedy of the moſt powerful effect. I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay, that it abſolutely ſtopped the courſe of the fever; but I can ſay with truth, that it generally reſtored the diſtinction of paroxyſm and remiſſion, diminiſhed irritability, and imparted a degree of tone and vigour to the ſyſtem, which was juſtly conſidered as a ſign of ſafety.</p>
            <p>To procure remiſſion in fever, diſtinguiſhed by a prevalence of the putreſcent tendency, is not in every
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:028890_0158_0FDE5E085D0D12A0"/>
inſtance an eaſy taſk. A remitting fever, with marks of ſpecific putrefaction, is not a diſeaſe of common occurrence in Jamaica; but a fever with ſigns of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefactive tendency, mixed with ſymptoms of great irritability, or a high degree of malignity, is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether rare. From the complicated nature of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, the indications of cure are often difficult and perplexed. Bleeding is univerſally condemned; more, I believe, from theory than from actual obſervation. It was, and perhaps ſtill is, a faſhionable mode of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, to impute the languors and other marks of debility, which are common in the fevers of the Weſt-Indies, to a putreſcent tendency in the ſyſtem. Such ſymptoms however are in fact more generally the attendants, or diſtinguiſhing ſigns of fevers, where the nervous ſyſtem is affected. In ſuch caſes, bleeding is obviouſly hurtful; in the one of which we now treat, (where ſuch a diſeaſe actually exiſts,) it is not only a remedy of ſafety, but of very eminent ſervice, previous to the application of cold, particularly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to cold bathing, which may be uſed with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and boldneſs. Cold bathing, indeed, is the remedy on which we muſt principally depend. There are others which do good occaſionally; but this is the only one I know, which has any very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable effect in changing the nature of the diſeaſe. There is a general rule in the practice of medicine, which requires to be particularly remembered in thoſe complicated ſpecies of fever, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that as the indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of cure are often embarraſſed; ſo the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, which principally point to danger, are firſt to be attended to; while the plan of cure, which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to be the moſt proper, muſt be followed up with vigour and reſolution. We ought always to bear in mind, that in dangerous and difficult caſes feeble remedies, or even powerful ones timidly uſed, are of little avail. Cold bathing, employed with ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, failed of doing good in ſome inſtances. I
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028890_0159_0FDE5BEDDC87CD70"/>
met with no example, where the boldeſt uſe of it did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. It was ſeldom, I muſt again repeat, that it did not ſucceed in obviating irritability, in checking the putreſcent tendency, and in imparting to the ſyſtem that degree of tone and vigour, in which ſafety is obſerved to conſiſt.</p>
            <p>The method of procuring remiſſion, in thoſe fevers which were diſtinguiſhed by local affections, or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular determinations to particular parts, was nice, and ſometimes difficult. Bleeding was frequently proper, eſpecially, if there ſubſiſted at the ſame time marks of a general inflammatory diatheſis: but it was ſeldom ſufficient wholly to accompliſh the buſineſs. However, together with a judicious management of warm bathing, it greatly heightened the good effects of bliſters, the remedy on which the principal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence was placed. In fevers which were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with uncommon pain of the head, I have ſometimes found it ſerviceable to apply cold to the part affected; the feet being at the ſame time immerſed in warm water, and blood flowing by a large orifice from the arm. I alſo frequently obſerved, that the general fever ran higher, though it likewiſe more certainly aſſumed its proper form, in conſequence of bleeding, bliſtering, and the removal of local pain. In thoſe fevers, where bilious appearances were the effect of accidental, irregular determination to the ſtomach or liver, the remiſſions were often obſcure: neither did the method of treatment, which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally adopted, ſeem to be well calculated to bring forth the natural, genuine appearance of the diſeaſe. Bilious appearances, it muſt be owned, ſometimes vaniſhed, while the type of the fever became more diſtinct after the exhibition of an emetic or briſk cathartic; yet there is cauſe to doubt if this depended on the evacuation of bile. It might be ſaid, with more truth, perhaps, that the action of the emetic, by exciting the powers of the ſtomach and biliary ſyſtem, effected a change in the irregular determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028890_0160_0FDE5BF879EF8718"/>
which had formerly taken place to thoſe parts. It was generally obſerved, where good effects did not follow the firſt exhibition of remedies of this kind, that harm was uſually the conſequence of a ſecond. Vomiting, in ſhort, was often rendered continual, and the diſtinction of paroxyſm and remiſſion was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently deſtroyed, in conſequence of the operation of violent emetics. Inſtructed by repeated examples of their hurtful effects, I at laſt ſcarcely ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed antimonial vomits; even the ſafeſt kinds were uſed with caution. If it appeared, at any time, that the action of vomiting would be ſerviceable, camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile tea, or at fartheſt a few grains of ipecacuana were generally thought ſufficient for the purpoſe. When this buſineſs was finiſhed, a draught of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial ſtimulating liquor, which had a tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a diaphoreſis, was next adminiſtered. By this mode of treatment, eſpecially if a bliſter was applied at the ſame time to the region of the liver, I have the ſatisfaction to add, that the bilious appearances for the moſt part vaniſhed, and, if care was taken to ſupport a determination to the ſurface, ſeldom ever returned during the continuance of the fever. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſeaſons, and different ſituations of country were particularly diſtinguiſhed by correſponding determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Thus a tendency to the bowels and biliary ſyſtem was chiefly remarkable in the autumnal months, and in low and champaign countries; the head and breaſt were oftener affected in the winter months, and in hilly ſituations.</p>
            <p>I obſerved before, that it is the firſt object in the cure of fevers, to remove thoſe circumſtances, or accidental ſtates of the body, which hinder the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe from aſſuming its proper form. Thus, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure remiſſion, appeared univerſally to be the firſt buſineſs in the cure of the fever of Jamaica; the next, and a very important one, is to prevent the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the paroxyſm. If we knew a remedy, which
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:028890_0161_0FDE5C008E5F0BF0"/>
could be depended upon to accompliſh this purpoſe with certainty, the cure of the diſeaſe would be eaſy; but the Peruvian bark, which almoſt infallibly ſtops the courſe of intermitting fevers in all countries, does not ſeem ſo indiſputably to poſſeſs the ſame power over the uſual endemic of the Weſt Indies. I am ſorry to own, that my knowledge on this ſubject, is not altogether ſatisfactory. At the time I left Jamaica I did not entertain a doubt, that the endemic of the diſtrict, where I reſided, poſſeſſed ſomething in its own nature which decidedly determined its duration. It was uſually obſerved to terminate on a critical day, generally by very evident ſigns of criſis, and without ſeeming to be materially effected in its courſe, by the various and oppoſite modes of treatment which were ſometimes purſued. But though this was true for the moſt part, yet the ſuperior efficacy of the very large doſes of bark, which I afterwards ventured to give in the intermitting fevers of North America, obliges me to ſpeak with heſitation, when I mention the powers of that remedy. It is probable that bark, with the ſame management, might have had the ſame effects, in the fever which prevailed at Savanna la Mar, as in that which is commonly epidemic in Georgia and the Carolinas; yet no doubt remains, that as commonly employed in Jamaica, it has no right to be conſidered as a remedy, which abruptly cuts ſhort the courſe of the diſeaſe. In every caſe where it was tried, (except one) it did not ſeem to do more than give a degree of tone and vigour to the ſyſtem, to excite a certain ſtate of inflammatory dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, in conſequence of which, the criſis was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be more perfect and complete, though it did not perhaps actually happen at an earlier period. Thus I am diſpoſed to conclude, from all the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience which I have had, that bark is not generally carried farther, in the cure of the remitting fever of Jamaica, than merely to ſupport the tone and vigour
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:028890_0162_0FDE5C0867BC2268"/>
of the powers of life. If we truſt to it for more, in doſes of two ſcruples or a drachm given every two hours, we ſhall certainly be deceived.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned the different methods of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which it was attempted to procure remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the endemic fever of Jamaica, and having likewiſe endeavoured to aſcertain how far we can go in preventing the return of paroxyſms, it only remains to detail ſome particulars in the management of the plan of cure, where the different ſpecies of fevers were diſtinguiſhed by a peculiar train of ſymptoms. It was obſerved in general, that fevers, with a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate degree of inflammatory diatheſis, ſeldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired our interference. The diſeaſe, after a certain duration, terminated uſually of its own accord. After I had gained ſome experience of the general courſe of fevers, I uſually allowed thoſe, in which I did not perceive marks of danger, to go on their own way, that I might better diſcover thoſe periods, at which the diſeaſe was naturally diſpoſed to terminate. Thus where the paroxyſms continued regular and diſtinct, the remiſſions perfect, and the vigour unimpaired, nothing material was attempted to be done. On the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ary, where the paroxyſms were long, or leſs diſtinctly formed, with ſigns which indicated an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching affection of the nervous ſyſtem, bark, and other remedies, which excited and ſupported the powers of life, were given with the earlieſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Changes from inflammatory diatheſis to nervous affection, were obſerved to happen frequently on the fifth day. Bark, and ſuch remedies as imparted tone and vigour to the ſyſtem, were given without delay; and the diſeaſe terminated for the moſt part on the ninth. In thoſe fevers, which were of a complicated nature, in which ſigns of inflammatory, nervous, or putrid diatheſis were variouſly mixed, bliſters applied in different manners, opiates, bathing and antiſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modics were often materially uſeful; but it would
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:028890_0163_0FDE5BD1956372D8"/>
be arrogance to attempt to deſcribe rules for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mode of application, which muſt vary more or leſs in almoſt every caſe, and which only can be learned from actual obſervation. There is one rule, however, in the treatment of fevers, of which the practitioner ought never to loſe ſight, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that wherever it is neceſſary to interfere, it is only the moſt vigorous deciſion which can do good. We cannot, as was ſaid before, depend with certainty upon bark, as a remedy poſſeſſed of the power of abſolutely cutting ſhort the cauſe of the fever of Jamaica; yet wherever the fevers of that country diſcovered ſigns of nervous affection, I do not know any thing in the materia medica, from which ſuch beneficial effects may be expected. If it did not actually ſtop the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, it was eminently ſerviceable in conducting it to a favourable iſſue. Opium, wine, ſnake-root, &amp;c. were often obſerved to heighten its good qualities: but the particular uſe of ſuch additions can only be regulated by circumſtances. Wine has been freely recommended in fevers with ſymptoms of nervous affection; and it muſt be owned, that its good effects were conſiderable, not only in real debility, but wherever the cauſe of the diſeaſe acted by weakening or depreſſing the powers of life. Wine was likewiſe obſerved to be more uſeful in caſes of mobility and weakneſs, than in caſes of ſtupor and ſuſpenſion of the nervous influence. But though it is actually a remedy of great value, its virtues appear to have been greatly enhanced. In many inſtances it was not proper in any quantity; in ſome, it was only proper in a ſmall quantity, and in very few, perhaps, could we allow of the quantities which are given in common practice. At one time I carried the uſe of wine in the nervous fever of Jamaica, to a very great length; but I afterwards learnt, that a third part of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity would have probably anſwered the purpoſe better. Though it undoubtedly is an uſeful cordial and tonic,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028890_0164_0FDE5BDB78B9F518"/>
it is ſtill inferior to cool air, and particularly to cold bathing.</p>
            <p>In thoſe treacherous and malignant fevers, which I have deſcribed in the third ſection of the ſixth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ordinary medical aids were often feeble and inſufficient. The courſe of the diſeaſe was generally rapid. There was little time left for deliberation; and where the firſt, at leaſt where the ſecond remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion paſſed over, without ſome bold and decided ſteps to prevent the return of the paroxyſm, or change the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſymptoms, the opportunity was probably never again in our power. The type of this malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever was uſually of the ſingle tertian kind; yet it was often found to anticipate, by ſuch long antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, that the ſecond paroxyſm ſometimes made its appearance, before any decided ſteps were taken by the practitioner to ſtop its progreſs, or often, indeed, before there were any ſurmiſes of danger. As this diſeaſe ſeemed to have a nearer reſemblance to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent, than ſome other ſpecies of the endemic of Jamaica; ſo bark appeared to be capable of produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more effect, in the preſent inſtance, than in thoſe caſes where the remiſſions were more obſcure. It ſtill, however, deſerves to be remarked, that ſuch ſcanty doſes, as were uſually given in Jamaica, could not be effectual; indeed, we could ſcarcely hope, that any powerful alteration could ariſe from leſs than half an ounce given at the ſhort interval of every other hour. I confeſs candidly, that I never ventured ſo far; yet I alſo confeſs, that I am by no means ſatisfied with the ſucceſs of the method of cure, which I adopted at firſt, in this diſeaſe. I loſt ſome patients before I was aware of danger, and perhaps ſuffered others to die, from a dread of ſtepping over the bounds of common practice. At laſt, I acted with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; and have cauſe to be ſatisfied with the ſucceſs of the attempt. As ſoon as I diſcovered the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the diſeaſe, the marks of which, for the moſt
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:028890_0165_0FDE5BE719617F60"/>
part, were plain in the courſe of the firſt paroxyſm, the head was immediately ſhaved, and covered with a bliſter, which reached half way down the neck; the feet were likewiſe put into warm water, previous to the expected return of the paroxyſm; the body was rubbed with brandy or rum; wine, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times opium were given in quantity ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilirate the ſpirits, or to produce a low degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication; bark was alſo preſcribed in larger doſes than uſual, during the remiſſions; and cold bathing was occaſionally employed with freedom. I do not ſay, that the return of the paroxyſm was abſolutely prevented by this method of treatment, but I have the ſatisfaction to add, that the fatal tendency of the diſeaſe was evidently obviated by it.</p>
            <p>I muſt farther obſerve, that bark has been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the principal remedy in thoſe fevers, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of which has been believed to be putrid; but the great fame of this remedy has proceeded from theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, rather than from actual obſervation. A real pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid diſeaſe, (as I have ſaid before), if we except the yellow fever, occurs very ſeldom in Jamaica. Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of languor and debility, however, are frequent in the fevers of that country; appearances which, though in fact, only ſigns of nervous affection, have often been imputed to a putrid tendency in the habit. Bark has been found to be efficacious in thoſe caſes of languor and debility, which have been falſely thought to ariſe from a putrefactive tendency in the ſyſtem. Hence this remedy has gained credit, on a foundation which does not exiſt. I may add with truth, that the power of the bark was very equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, in thoſe caſes where the marks of putrid tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were obvious. The principal dependence was then conſtantly placed in the cold ſalt-water bath; which, if well managed, produced moſt aſtoniſhing effects. An additional quantity of ſalt was often added to the water of the ſea; and care was taken
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:028890_0166_0FDE5B573621BA20"/>
that the coldneſs ſhould be as great as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the climate would permit. The chief depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I have ſaid, was conſtantly placed in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, where the putrid tendency prevailed in the general ſyſtem; but where it was more particularly confined to the bounds of the alimentary canal, ſaline draughts, in the ſtate of efferveſcence, were uſeful, as were likewiſe glyſters of cold water impregnated with fixed air. It is ſuperfluous to mention cool air, clean linen, cold drink and the liberal uſe of wine.</p>
            <p>The remedies, which I have hitherto mentioned, are ſuch, as ſeem chiefly intended to ſupport and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorate the general powers of life; but which are leſs immediately directed to obviate the fatal tendency of particular ſymptoms; which I propoſed to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the ſecond indication of cure. I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably depart material<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> from the uſual ideas of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners in the proſecution of this ſubject. I do not deny, that bark may be given with ſafety in fevers, which are accompanied with local affections, or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular determinations to particular parts; yet I muſt likewiſe obſerve, that bark is not the remedy on which the weight of the cure depends. Local affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or irregular determinations are often diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the name of the efforts of nature. I do not indeed diſpute, where the part of the body, to which the determination takes place, is of little importance to life, or more certainly, where it is an organ of excretion, that ſuch parts as are of greater conſequence, are, in ſome degree relieved in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this effect; and though there is ſtill an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety, there is leſs danger in conſidering this ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular action of the morbid cauſe, as an effort of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or a quality of the vis naturae medicatrix, by means of which, the health of the ſyſtem is eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rendered more ſecure. This, however, is only a circumſtance of accident. It does not appear to depend upon a regular deſign of nature, and cannot
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028890_0167_0FDE5B5E1AFB4D88"/>
be admitted with ſafety as the baſis of a plan of cure. We find, in ſhort, that though the life of the whole is ſometimes preſerved by it, the deſtruction or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of the part is generally the conſequence. But that the fallacious tendency of thoſe tumultuary efforts of nature may be more clearly illuſtrated, I ſhall adduce the example of fevers, diſtinguiſhed by an increaſed ſecretion of bile. It is an opinion, which ſeems to date its origin from Hippocrates, that bile vitiated in quality, or redundant in quantity, deſerves to be conſidered as the cauſe of the ſpecies of diſeaſe diſtinguiſhed by the name of ardent fever: and it muſt be confeſſed, that the frequent appearance of bilious diſcharges, in the fevers of hot climates, gives countenance to the ſuppoſition. From the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of this ſymptom, perhaps, the practitioners of the Weſt-Indies adopted the idea, that bile is the cauſe of the fever of that country; while the method of cure, which they uſually purſue, has ſerved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in their error. Prepoſſeſſed with an opinion of the prevalence of bile, they adminiſter cathartics and emetics with a liberal hand. If bile appears in the firſt evacuations, they conſider it ſufficient authority to proceed; if it does not appear, they conclude that the remedy has not been of ſufficient force to reach the ſeat of the diſeaſe; and therefore perſiſt in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, till the effect is at laſt produced. It is well known, that a repetition of cathartics and emetics ſeldom fails to produce the appearances of a bilious diſeaſe. Hence this ſymptom of fever, and all the dangers which follow it, are frequently the work of our own hands. That this is the caſe, appears from a relation of the method of cure, which I uſually adopted in ſuch fevers as were diſtinguiſhed by ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of this nature at an early period. Inſtead of encouraging the vomiting, or promoting the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bile downwards, I generally did every thing in my power to moderate, or even to check it.—
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:028890_0168_0FDE5B6C661348B0"/>
Sometimes I preſcribed an emetic; but it was more with a view to excite the action of the ſtomach and biliary ſyſtem, than to promote an evacuation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant or vitiated humours. After the operation of vomiting was finiſhed, a bliſter was uſually applied to the region of the liver, and ſuch a plan of cure was purſued, as ſupported a determination to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the body, and gave tone and vigour to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and general powers of life. By this mode of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bilious appearances vaniſhed ſpeedily, or ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be troubleſome; while by the repeated uſe of emetics and cathartics, they generally continued long, and often prevailed throughout the courſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. We may thus, I hope, conclude, without any unnatural inference, that there appears to be danger in encouraging thoſe tumults, which have been uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered as the efforts of nature. If they are in fact efforts, no perſon can pretend to deny, that they are generally precarious; nay, that they are often the immediate cauſes of death.</p>
            <p>I have now detailed the particular ſteps of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of cure, which I adopted in the remitting fever of Jamaica; a diſeaſe which I treated, in ſome reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, on a different plan, and if ſelf-love hath not blinded me with more ſucceſs than the generality of thoſe practitioners whom I had the opportunity of knowing, I treated the diſeaſe with ſucceſs; but I dare not affirm, as ſome have done, that under this method of treatment, I never loſt a patient. I proceeded, indeed, with diffidence and diſtruſt of the powers of the medical art; venturing no farther than to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the general powers of life, and to obviate ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a fatal tendency. Many pretend to cut ſhort the courſe of fevers, by the force of a ſingle remedy; but the means do not appear very obvious, and the effect was often precarious. I grant, that it is ſometimes in the power of the practitioner to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate the cauſe of diſeaſe by forcible means, or
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:028890_0169_0FDE5B76A5ABAD40"/>
to deſtroy a certain aptitude of conſtitution, in which this diſeaſe may be ſaid to conſiſt; but I muſt at the ſame time obſerve, that there is danger likewiſe, leaſt he extinguiſh life. The bark, which has been ſo much celebrated for checking the courſe of fevers, though generally ſafe, is ſeldom effectual: others are frequently dangerous. During the time that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Weſt Indies, I obſerved attentively the ſtate of body, which uſually attended recovery; as likewiſe thoſe appearances which preceded, and apparently were the cauſes of death. Tone and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, or a moderate degree of the ſtate of body diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the name of inflammatory diatheſis, without local affection, afforded the ſureſt ſigns of ſafety; general failure of the powers of life, or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular determinations to organs of importance, were the moſt certain appearances of danger. Thus, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obviating particular ſymptoms of a fatal tendency, it was the principal indication to ſupport the general powers of life, or to excite the tone and vigour of the ſyſtem. This was beſt accompliſhed by bark, wine, cool air, and above all, by cold bathing, which I am induced to conſider as the moſt important remedy in the cure of the fevers of the Weſt-Indies; and, perhaps, in the cure of the fevers of all hot climates. Though it might not abſolutely cut ſhort the courſe of the diſeaſe; yet it ſeldom failed to change the fatal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of its nature.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XI. YELLOW FEVER. (a)</head>
            <p>THE diſeaſe, known in the Weſt Indies by the name of yellow fever, particularly that ſpecies of the diſeaſe diſtinguiſhed by black vomiting, has not, ſo far as I know, been deſcribed by the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of any other country. In the autumnal fevers of moſt climates, indeed, as well as in the remitting fever of Jamaica, yellowneſs is not by any means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common: neither is vomiting of matter of a dark colour altogether rare, in the moments preceding death: yet in as much as I can judge, from what I have ſeen myſelf, or heard from others, the complaint which is the ſubject of the preſent treatiſe, poſſeſſes ſome characteriſtics of its own, different from thoſe of every other diſeaſe. I do not pretend to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, in what this characteriſtic difference preciſely conſiſts: yet I may ſay with confidence, that the ſpecies of this diſeaſe, which terminates in black vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, may be diſtinguiſhed with certainty from the autumnal fever of aguiſh countries, or from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic remitting fever of Jamaica, even in the firſt hours of its attack. I muſt, however, at the ſame time own, that there is a ſpecies of diſeaſe, where the remiſſions are obſcure, and where ſigns of nervous affection, or even ſometimes of apparent inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are more conſpicuous than ſymptoms of putreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that I have ſome difficulty in claſſing properly. There is not any thing more foreign to my intention than multiplying names, or eſtabliſhing diſtinctions which do not exiſt in reality; yet, as I have often ſeen inſtances of fever, to which yellowneſs and black vomiting did not ſeem to be eſſential; but in which paroxyſms and remiſſions were extremely obſcure,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:028890_0171_0FDE5B86151CB578"/>
or perhaps did not exiſt, I at laſt ventured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this ſpecies of illneſs had more affinity with the diſorder uſually known by the name of yellow fever, than with the common remitting endemic of the country. I ſhall therefore deſcribe it as a ſpecies of that diſeaſe; though I am leſs ſolicitous about fixing its place in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſological arrangement, than of giving a hiſtory of it, by which it may be eaſily recognized.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that there are ſeveral authors, who have written on the ſubject of the yellow fever; yet I had not the opportunity of conſulting any of them, except Dr. Hillary, during the time that I lived in Jamaica. This writer's method of cure was adopted very generally by the medical people of the iſland, and many of them were diſpoſed to think fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of its ſucceſs. I cannot however conceal, that I was diſappointed in every inſtance where I ſaw it employed. If, in any caſe, the patient recovered, this fortunate event appeared to be more owing to great natural ſtrength of conſtitution, or to a lower degree of diſeaſe, than to the efficacy of the method of treatment. But beſides, that this author's method of cure is feeble and ineffectual, the hiſtorical part is particularly defective; the diſeaſe, in ſhort, being only very imperfectly diſcriminated from the common endemic of that country. The conſideration of theſe circumſtances, induced me to throw together the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations which I had made on this ſubject, during the time that I reſided in the Weſt Indies; and though I am conſcious that they are imperfect, I ſtill hope that they contain ſome hints which may be uſeful to thoſe, who have had little experience of the fevers of hot climates.</p>
            <p>In our enquiries into the hiſtory of the yellow fever, ſome circumſtances preſent themſelves to our obſervation which are not a little curious. It has never been obſerved that a negro, immediately from
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:028890_0172_0FDE5B8C1FA40190"/>
the coaſt of Africa, has been attacked with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; neither have Creoles, who have lived conſtantly in their native country, ever been known to ſuffer from it: yet Creoles or Africans, who have travelled to Europe, or the higher latitudes of America, are not by any means exempted from it, when they return to the iſlands of the Weſt Indies. Europeans, males particularly, ſuffer from it ſoon after their arrival in the tropical countries; yet, after the natives of Europe have remained for a year or two in thoſe hot climates, eſpecially after they have experienced the ordinary endemic of the country, the appearance of the yellow fever is obſerved to be only a rare occurrence. But beſides, that this diſeaſe ſeldom diſcovers itſelf among thoſe people, who have lived any length of time in a tropical country, it has likewiſe ſcarcely ever been known to attack the ſame perſon twice, unleſs acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally after his return from a colder region. The remitting fever, on the contrary, does not ceaſe to attack ſuch as have reſided the greateſt part of their life in thoſe climates; or who have lived after the moſt regular and abſtemious manner; a fact which ſeems to prove, that there actually exiſts ſome eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference between the two diſeaſes; or which ſhews, at leaſt, that the revolution of a ſeaſon or two deſtroys in the European conſtitution, a certain apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or diſpoſition for the one diſeaſe, which it ſtill retains for the other.</p>
            <p>Having thus premiſed ſome circumſtances, which regard the general nature of the yellow fever, I ſhall proceed to give a more particular deſcription of the diſeaſe, previouſly dividing it into three forms, in each of which, I believe, I have frequently ſeen it appear. 1. Into a ſpecies of diſeaſe, in which ſigns of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction are evident at a very early ſtage, which is generally rapid in its courſe, and which uſually ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates in black vomiting. Yellowneſs ſeldom or never fails to make its appearance in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:028890_0173_0FDE5B93AAB4C510"/>
and perhaps it is only this form, which, ſtrictly ſpeaking, can be called the yellow fever. 2. Into a form of fever, which either has no remiſſions, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions which are ſcarcely perceptible; in which ſigns of nervous affection are more obvious than ſymptoms of putreſcency; and in which yellowneſs and black vomiting are rare occurrences. 3. Into another form, in which regular paroxyſms and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions cannot be traced; but in which there are marks of violent irritation, and appearances of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory diatheſis in the earlier ſtage, which give way after a ſhort continuance to ſigns of debility and putreſcency, to which yellowneſs frequently ſucceeds, or even ſometimes the ſo much dreaded vomiting of matter of a dark colour. The diſeaſe, which I have divided in the above manner into three diſtinct forms, appears to be in reality only one and the ſame. The difference of the ſymptoms probably ariſes from very trivial or very accidental cauſes; and it is a matter of great difficulty to diſcriminate thoſe ſigns, which are eſſential and neceſſary to its exiſtence. It is in ſome degree peculiar to ſtrangers from colder regions ſoon ofter their arrival in the Weſt Indies, and may generally be diſtinguiſhed from the remitting endemic of the country, not only by the obſcureneſs, or total want of paroxyms and remiſſions, but likewiſe by a certain expreſſion of the eye and countenance, with ſomething unuſually diſagreeable in the feelings, of which words convey only an imperfect idea.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>SECTION I.</head>
               <p>I SHALL deſcribe, in the firſt place, the moſt common and moſt formidable ſpecies of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which, as I obſerved before, is diſtinguiſhed by early ſigns of putreſcency, by an intenſe degree
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:028890_0174_0FDE5B99548CB630"/>
of yellowneſs; and, towards its termination, uſually by vomiting of matter of a dark colour. It was mentioned in the preceding treatiſe, concerning the remitting fever of Jamaica, that fever of different types had their different hours of invaſion; but no ſuch property was obſerved in the preſent diſeaſe. In ſome inſtances the yellow fever began in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though the evening, upon the whole, was the more uſual time of its attack. The firſt ſymptoms were languor, debility and head-ach, together with an affection of the ſtomach peculiarly diſagreeable. This laſt often preceded the others, and was in ſome meaſure characteriſtic; but it is impoſſible to give a clear idea of it in words:—anxiety, nauſea, and certain unuſual feelings were ſo ſtrangely combined, that any deſcription, which I might attempt to give of this complicated ſenſation, would hardly be intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible. The horror and ſhivering, which ſo uſually precede fevers, was ſeldom great in degree in the preſent inſtance; but it ſometime continued long, and was often accompanied with ſenſations of a very unpleaſant kind. The heat of the body, though rarely intenſe, was frequently of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent nature. The pulſe was weak and confined in its ſtroke. It was likewiſe frequent, and the nature of the arterial pulſations were creeping or vermicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; in ſhort there was a perpetual motion under the finger, combined with ſomething, which gave the idea, that the diſeaſe was not of the kind which has paroxyſms and remiſſions. Together with this, the eye was ſad and watery; or in ſome degree inflamed, having much that appearance, which is the conſequence of expoſure to the ſmoke of green wood. The face was often fluſhed; yet the fluſhing, in the preſent caſe, was different from that which ariſes from ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cauſes. There was a degree of confuſion, and often a degree of grimneſs joined with it, difficult to be deſcribed in words; but which a perſon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:028890_0175_0FDE5B9F80C3C918"/>
with the appearances of the diſeaſe, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately recognizes as a diſtinguiſhing mark of its character. The tongue was often moiſt, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſoul; the thirſt was ſeldom great, and though there was uſually a peculiar nauſea, there was rarely any ſevere vomiting or retching. The breathing was hurried, for the moſt part, with much anxiety and diſtreſs; while the patient frequently expreſſed ſufferings, which a perſon, unacquainted with the nature of the diſeaſe, would be diſpoſed to believe were not real.</p>
               <p>The ſymptoms, which I have enumerated above, are thoſe which uſually ſhew themſelves in the firſt twelve hours of the diſeaſe. I marked them with all the attention of which I was capable; yet ſtill I am fearful, that the hiſtory may not be ſo explicit as to be totally free from ambiguity. The characteriſtic marks of the yellow fever, are not by any means doubtful to a perſon well acquainted with the diſeaſes of hot climates; but they are not eaſily conveyed in words, and may often be overlooked by thoſe, who have drawn their information from books alone. I am induced to think ſo, from an inſtance which happened to myſelf. I had read Hillary's account of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, both before and ſoon after my arrival in Jamaica; I had likewiſe heard ſome converſation on the ſubject, ſo that I might be ſuppoſed to have been tolerably well informed of the general character of the diſeaſe; yet the firſt perſon, who came under my care in this illneſs, was within a few hours of death before I knew the diſorder, or even ſuſpected it to be of a dangerous nature. Fortunately for the peace of my conſcience, the patient had been viſited, on both the firſt and ſecond day after the attack, by a practitioner who had lived many years in the iſland; but, between careleſſneſs and inexperience, the poor man's ſituation was either not known, or not attended to, till approaches of death were viſible. The body
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:028890_0176_0FDE5BA83B22B3D0"/>
had been evacuated very plentifully by a ſolution of ſalts, during the two firſt days of the illneſs; but no material good ſeemed to enſue from it. The patient complained ſtill more on the ſecond day, than he had done on the firſt; but as the external ſigns of fever were moderate, I really ſuſpected that he complained without much cauſe. It ſo happened, that I could not viſit him on the third; and on the morning of the fourth, he became of a deep orange colour, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited black matter in great quantity. I then ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that this complaint, to which I had not paid particular attention, was actually the diſeaſe known by the name of yellow fever; but it appeared like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to be ſo far advanced in its progreſs, that I could do nothing more than witneſs the approach of death. My want of diſcernment, and in ſome degree my careleſſneſs, a charge from which I cannot alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether acquit myſelf, made ſo deep an impreſſion on my mind, that I turned over every circumſtance of the diſeaſe with which my memory ſupplied me; and I ſoon had that ſatisfaction to find, that the miſtake which I had committed, had not happened to me without leaving an uſeful leſſon. In ten or twelve days another perſon was affected in a manner ſo ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar to the former, that I ſuſpected the diſeaſe to be the ſame, and the event proved my ſuſpicions to have been well founded. From that time forward, I never found difficulty in diſtinguiſhing this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular form of fever, in the firſt hours of its attack, not only from the remitting endemic of the country, but even from the other two ſpecies of this diſeaſe, which I ſhall afterwards deſcribe.</p>
               <p>A trifling abatement of the ſymptoms, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken notice of, in ten or twelve hours after the commencement of this diſeaſe; but in no inſtance ſo far as I have obſerved, was there ever ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviation, as with any juſtice could be called a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. The ſymptoms of diſtreſs, where any abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:028890_0177_0FDE5BAD91B31CD8"/>
had been perceptible, recurred in a ſhort time with aggravation; and if there actually ever was any relief afterwards, it was only momentary and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The appearance of the eye became ſtill more deſponding, with a ſenſation of burning heat, and greater marks of inflammation, affording inconteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigns of the real genius and nature of the fever. The pain of the head was now violent; the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was confuſed and grim: the gums were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpongy, and diſpoſed to bleed; the tongue, which was ſometimes moiſt, ſometimes dry, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always foul; the thirſt was irregular; at one time intenſe, at another very little increaſed beyond what it naturally is. Nauſea, I obſerved above, was a common ſign, from the firſt hours of the illneſs; yet vomiting, during the firſt day or two, was not by any means a conſtant, perhaps ſcarcely a frequent ſymptom: neither, if it did take place, was it often found to be bilious. The liquor thrown up, for the moſt part, was clear; in ſhort, ſeldom altered from the ſtate in which it had been drank, unleſs by hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquired an unuſual degree of ropineſs, or by preſenting ſome flakes of a darker coloured mucus. To the above ſymptoms we might add, uncommon reſtleſſneſs and anxiety; a torment ſcarcely to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in words; watchfulneſs; a hurried and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult reſpiration; frequent deep and heavy ſighing, with more or leſs diſpoſition to faint, where any exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was attempted. It deſerves to be remarked, however, with regard to the diſpoſition to faint in the yellow fever, that it did not depend upon the ſame cauſe, as in ſome other diſeaſes. It ſeemed, in fact, to be owing to torpor of the nervous power, rather than to exceſs of mobility. The patient was often able to ſtand upright, for ſome time, even to walk to a conſiderable diſtance; and when at laſt overcome, was obſerved to fall down in a torpid, rather than in a fainting ſtate. Sweating was a rare occurrence in
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:028890_0178_0FDE5BB3B2A54D30"/>
this ſtage of the diſeaſe; at leaſt I do not find, that I ever had remarked any greater degree of it, than a clammy moiſture on the head and neck. It was alſo rarely obſerved, that the external heat was much increaſed beyond its natural ſtate; while the pulſe now began gradually to abate in point of frequency. The yellowneſs, which is intenſe in the laſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, was ſeldom ſeen in the period which I now deſcribe; yet, together with a general obfuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of countenance, a tawney hue rather than a pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was obſerved about the eyes and corners of the mouth, when the patient turned accidentally languid and faint. The body was frequently coſtive in the firſt days of the illneſs; and I have even ſeen ſome inſtances where ſtrong cathartics did not occaſion the uſual evacuations. The urine was generally high coloured, and turbid. In ſome caſes there was active hoemorrhage from the noſe; which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally followed with ſome relief from the violent pain of the head. I have alſo obſerved a high degree of delirium, though I never ſaw any inſtances, where this ſymptom was of long continuance.</p>
               <p>The duration of the tumultuary ſtate, which I have deſcribed is uncertain. Sometimes it did not exceed twenty-four hours, though it more generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the third day; ſometimes even longer. The ſymptoms, which now made their appearance, were many of them different in their nature from the former. The agony of diſtreſs, which was ſo ſtrongly depicted in the countenance of the patient, during the firſt days of the diſeaſe, was obſerved about this time to be ſenſibly diminiſhed; the eye became more cheerful, the countenance more ſerene and compoſed; yet yellowneſs of the ſkin became ſpeedily evident: the external heat and fever ſubſided; the pulſe became gradually fuller and ſlower, and approached by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to its natural ſtate: no ſweat or moiſture was now obſervable on any part of the body; the ſtate of
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:028890_0179_0FDE5BBC447455C8"/>
the ſkin impreſſed the idea, as if it were not pervious to any degree of perſpiration, and heat gradually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the ſurface and extremities; the tongue turned moiſt, and at the ſame time frequently clean about the edges: the gums turned redder, more ſpongy, and ſhewed a greater diſpoſition to bleed: vomiting was now troubleſome—the liquor thrown up was ropy, much in quantity, and abounding with villous or mucus flakes of a darker colour: thirſt in a great meaſure vaniſhed; but ſenſations of anxiety, diſtreſs and uneaſineſs in the region of the ſtomach ſuffered no material abatement.</p>
               <p>Things went on in this manner, ſometimes for one day only, ſometimes for two, three or more. The circulation in the extreme veſſels became gradually more languid; the natural heat retired from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the body, which was now dry and impervious; the pulſe returned nearly to its ordinary ſtate, or became ſlow, full, and regular; the yellowneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed faſt; ſo that the whole of the body was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently yellow as an orange, or of as deep a colour as the ſkin of an American ſavage; anxiety was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible; vomiting was irreſtrainable, and the ſo much dreaded ſymptom of vomiting of a matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the grounds of coffee, at laſt made its appearance. It deſerves, however, to be remarked, with regard to this formidable ſymptom, that the colour of what was thrown up, was often black as foot, where the diſeaſe had hurried on rapidly to the laſt ſtage: while it was not only leſs intenſely black, but was often tinged with green, where the progreſs had been ſlow and gradual. I obſerved before, that villous or mucus flakes were diſcovered early in the vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the patient, and that theſe appearances increaſed as the diſeaſe advanced in its progreſs. I may now add, that ſtreaks of blood were ſometimes found to be joined with them; the greateſt part of which ſeemed to come from the throat and gums. The
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:028890_0180_0FDE5BC26739CB38"/>
vomiting, which now returned at ſhorter intervals as the diſeaſe approached this fatal period, was ſeldom accompanied with violent retching. A quantity of liquor, ſometimes a quantity ſo enormous, that we could not help wondering whence it had been ſupplied, having been collected in the ſtomach, was diſcharged without much difficulty, and the patient enjoyed ſome reſpite till a like accumulation had again taken place. It may further be remarked, that as ſoon as the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited liquor acquired this dark and ſooty colour, the belly generally turned looſe, the ſtools being black and ſmooth, not unlike tar or molaſſes. The tongue likewiſe became clean, the gums became putrid; hoemorrhage, or rather oozings of blood were ſometimes obſerved at different parts of the body; while livid blotches frequently made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance on the belly and inſides of the thighs. The pulſe, which during the latter ſtages of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, could ſcarcely be diſtinguiſhed from the pulſe of a perſon in health, became at laſt quick, irregular, or intermitting; ſoon after which, coma or convulſions cloſed the ſcene. It may not be improper to remark, before leaving the ſubject, that the yellowneſs of the ſkin, which was ſaid to precede the black vomiting in moſt inſtances, in ſome caſes was found to ſucceed to it. In ſuch, the vomiting began unexpectedly, or without much previous affection of the ſtomach; the colour of it was uſually intenſely black, the patient turned yellow almoſt in an inſtant, and died in a very ſhort ſpace of time:—the diſeaſe, in ſhort, paſſed ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly from the firſt ſtage to the laſt.</p>
               <p>I may obſerve in this place, that the number of thoſe who recovered from the laſt ſtage of this ſpecies of the yellow fever, was extremely ſmall: yet, though ſuch fortunate inſtances were rare, they were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together wanting. The termination, however, did not appear to be by regular criſis. The black vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting ceaſed, ſometimes apparently in conſequence
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:028890_0181_0FDE5BC910003100"/>
of treatment, ſometimes evidently of its own accord; but a vomiting of a ropy, glutinous matter continued for a great length of time, together with an extreme irritability of ſtomach, and a very peculiar ſtate of the ſkin; which ſometimes did not recover its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſmoothneſs and unctuoſity, till after ſeveral weeks had elapſed.</p>
               <p>During the time that I lived in Jamaica, I opened ſeveral perſons who died of this diſeaſe; but it was ſeldom that I found any material variation in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances. Soon after death, and even ſometimes before death had actually taken place, the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came covered with large livid blotches; and, it is almoſt unneceſſary to mention, was extremely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. In opening the abdomen, the omentum and all its appendages were diſcovered to be in a dry and parched ſtate, and of an uncommon dark grey colour. But together with this dark grey colour of the omen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, and a want of the unctuoſity or moiſture, which is uſually found in the cavity of the abdomen, the ſtomach and inteſtines had a dirty yellow appearance, were highly putrified, and much diſtended with wind. The liver and ſpleen were generally enlarged in ſize; the colour of the liver was often of a deeper yellow, than that of any other of the abdominal viſcera; while the texture of the ſpleen was frequently leſs firm, than it is found to be in its natural ſtate. The gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bladder, for the moſt part, was moderately full; but the bile it contained, was black and thick, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like tar or molaſſes. The biliary ducts were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe enlarged, and moderately filled with the ſame ſort of bile, which was found in the gall-bladder: while the very blood veſſels of the liver bore the marks of uncommon diſtenſion. In the cavity of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach likewiſe, there was uſually more or leſs of a dark coloured liquor, ſimilar to what had been thrown up in the laſt ſtage of the illneſs. But beſides, that this dirty fluid was generally preſent in the ſtomach

in conſiderable quantity, the villous or inner coat of that organ was alſo abraded in various places; at the ſame time that ſome ſpots appeared on the ſurface, which were probably the beginnings of mortifications. The ſuperior portions of the inteſtinal canal were generally in a ſituation ſimilar to what I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; only it muſt be remembered, that the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid appearances were not yet ſo far advanced in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of the body, as it appeared on diſſection, throws conſiderable light on the nature of the yellow fever. It enables us to explain ſatisfactorily many of its leading ſymptoms; and may even afford uſeful hints in the conduct of the cure. It was mentioned above, that the natural heat and vigour of circulation retired from the ſurface and extremities of the body at a certain period of the diſeaſe; and that a copious and obſtinate vomiting enſued ſoon after this change had taken place. The fluid thrown up, which was uſually pituitous, glutinous, or flakey in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, acquired, after ſome time, a colour of various degrees of blackneſs. In quantity, it was often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate, bearing no proportion to the liquor which was drank; a circumſtance which could only be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ordinary determination to the ſurface of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being turned upon the internal parts; in conſequence of which, there was a preternatural diſcharge of fluid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cavity of the alimentary canal. Flakes, of a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus or villous nature, were likewiſe frequently obſerved in thoſe matters which were thrown up by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; an appearance which we could not have eaſily accounted for; unleſs we had diſcovered, in examining the dead body, that the inner coat of the ſtomach was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually abraded; but in what manner this happened, may be difficult to explain. It might either ariſe from the repeated action of ſevere vomiting; or, ſtill more probably, from the preternatural and forcible deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the exhaling veſſels of this cavity, forcing
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:028890_0183_0FDD2292F63D25A8"/>
off ſome portions of the villous coat, in the manner of cuticular bliſters. To which explanations I may add, that the black colour of the vomited matter, was evidently owing to a mixture of vitiated bile; the paſſage of which might be eaſily traced from the gall duct into the pylorus.</p>
               <p>The ſpecies of the yellow fever, which I have now deſcribed, is univerſally acknowledged to be a terrible diſeaſe; and there are few, I believe, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candid, as to boaſt of general ſucceſs in the manner of curing it. A road is therefore left open, not only for improvement, but almoſt for total innovation. The only author I have read on the ſubject, or the practitioners with whom I am acquainted, do not ſeem to have extended their views beyond the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the diſeaſe. There are ſome, who, from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that there is pain of the head and fluſhing of the face, recommend bleeding; others, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of nauſea or inclination to vomit, make trial of emetics; and many, from various cauſes, inſiſt on the indiſpenſible uſe of cathartics. My views, I muſt confeſs, are different from thoſe of preceding authors. Bleeding was employed occaſionally; emetics were cautiouſly avoided; but time appeared to be too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to be ſpent in attending to the effects of cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, which cannot often be known in leſs than twenty-four hours; and which at beſt are precarious or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Inſtead, therefore, of attempting to evacuate redundant bile, or to correct it when ſuppoſed to be vitiated, I exerted myſelf, from the firſt moment that I was called to the patient, to change the genius and natural tendency of the diſeaſe; or, if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the expreſſion, to take the buſineſs, as ſpeedily as poſſible, totally out of the hands of nature.</p>
               <p>I remark in the firſt place, that I generally began the cure of this ſpecies of the yellow fever with bleeding. Bleeding was employed in the preſent caſe, chiefly with a view of paving the way to remedies of
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028890_0184_0FDD229A6F31CD68"/>
greater efficacy. It was, however, found to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the violence of local pain, particularly the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the head-ach, and to be not altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect, in retarding the uſual rapid progreſs of the diſeaſe. It has hitherto been thought neceſſary, indeed almoſt indiſpenſible, to empty the firſt paſſages in this ſpecies of fever; but time is ſhort, and the good which accrues from ſuch evacuations, is not very certain, and often not eſſential. It was, therefore, thought ſufficient to truſt this intention, for the moſt part, to laxative glyſters; after the employment of which, (bleeding having been premiſed in ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity as was deemed proper,) the patient was waſhed clean, and bathed in warm water, in as complete a manner as the circumſtances of ſituation would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. It is needleſs to mention, that this was done with a view to increaſe mobility of ſyſtem, and to remove ſpaſmodic ſtricture from the extreme veſſels of the ſurface; in conſequence of which, greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit was expected from the application of cold ſalt-water, which was daſhed ſuddenly from a bucket on the head and ſhoulders. This practice may appear hazardous, to thoſe who argue without experience; but I can vouch for its general ſafety, and bear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to its good effects. Sweat, with perfect relief from all the feelings of anxiety and diſtreſs, was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the conſequence of this mode of treatment. If employed within the firſt twelve hours from the attack, it ſeldom failed of removing all the ſymptoms of danger: or of effecting a total and complete change in the nature and circumſtances of the diſeaſe; but if the progreſs was more advanced, though the ſame rule of practice might ſtill be proper, the execution required more boldneſs and deciſion. It is only poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to judge from the circumſtances of the caſe, at this period, of the neceſſity or propriety of bleeding, and of emptying the lower inteſtines by means of glyſters; but when this buſineſs ſhall have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:028890_0185_0FDD22BB1E348B40"/>
in ſuch manner as may be deemed right, or conducive to the main view, it will be adviſeable to ſhave the head, to bathe the whole body in warm water, and inſtantly to daſh cold water from a bucket on the head and ſhoulders. I have even ſometimes, where there was an appearance of greater obſtinacy, ventured to wrap the whole body in a blanket ſoaked in ſea water, or water in which was diſſolved a large portion of ſalt. If anxiety was great, or nauſea and vomiting troubleſome, I have alſo obſerved benefit from the application of a bliſter to the epigaſtric re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Opiates, joined with remedies which had a tendency to determine to the ſurface, were found to be ſerviceable; and wine, with a ſupply of freſh and cool air, in moſt caſes, was highly neceſſary. This method of proceeding will, perhaps, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable; but I can ſpeak confidently of its ſafety; and I may farther add, that unleſs ſome decided ſteps are taken to change the nature of the diſeaſe, during the continuance of this ſtage, our future endeavours to do good, will generally be in vain. I have hitherto promiſed ſucceſs in the cure of this fever, with a good deal of confidence; but if it ſhould ſo happen, that we are not called to the patient till the yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has ſpread over the whole of the body, or till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> black vomiting has begun to make its appearance, the proſpect, I muſt confeſs, is then very dark. The ordinary reſources of our art are feeble; and if good can be done at all, it can only be done by means, which in the common opinion of practitioners, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on raſhneſs. In this latter ſtage of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, ſo great a degree of torpor overwhelms the powers of life, that remedies do not produce their uſual effect, and our labour is often the ſame, as if we attempted to reſuſcitate a corpſe. I have, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſeen inſtances of ſuch unexpected recoveries from the moſt hopeleſs ſtate in fevers, that I ſeldom totally deſpair as long as life remains. I know that
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028890_0186_0FDD22BE7904A248"/>
death may be prevented, even after black vomiting has appeared with all its terrors, if a remedy can be found powerful enough to excite the action of the extreme veſſels, and to recall the determination to the ſurface of the body. For this purpoſe, I have employed alternately warm and cold bathing with ſucceſs. I have even wrapt the body, as I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, in a blanket, ſoaked in water, in which a large portion of ſalt was diſſolved, or which had been ſteeped in brandy or rum, enjoining at the ſame time the liberal uſe of wine, or even more powerful cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials. I have heard of ſome well-atteſted inſtances, where plentiful draughts of rum and water, have checked the vomiting, and apparently ſaved the lives of patients, after the medical people had given them up for loſt.</p>
               <p>I have now mentioned the method of cure which I purſued in the yellow fever of Jamaica; and I muſt be allowed to add, that the general indication ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be confirmed by a view of the hiſtory and progreſs of the diſeaſe, as alſo by conſidering the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances which are found after death. It was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the preceding pages, that the circulation became languid at a certain period in the courſe of this fever, and that the determination was, in fact, turned upon the internal parts, particularly upon the alimentary canal, and biliary ſyſtem. To ſupport, therefore, or to recall the determination to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, where it had begun to retire, was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal aim which was kept in view. It was purſued with vigour; and, I have the ſatisfaction to add, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with ſucceſs. I am afraid that the means may be thought hazardous; but I have never yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from them, even a momentary harm. I ſhall not therefore ceaſe to recommend them, till I find that others have tried them fairly, and found them dangerous or ineffectual.</p>

               <head>SECTION II.</head>
               <p>IN the preceding pages, I attempted to deſcribe the diſeaſe, which has been uſually regarded as the proper yellow fever of the Weſt-Indies, detailing at the ſame time, the particular ſteps of a method of cure, which I have cauſe to believe, was followed with more than ordinary ſucceſs. I now proceed to conſider another ſpecies of diſorder, which frequently makes its appearance among people newly arrived in hot countries, and which, from ſome ſtriking marks of affinity, I have been induced to rank as a ſpecies, or variety of the former. Yellowneſs, indeed, is not by any means common to it, and black vomiting is actually rare; yet paroxyſms and remiſſions are ſcarcely diſtinguiſhable, and the difference between it and the preceding, is perhaps, in fact, only acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental.</p>
               <p>I remarked before, that this ſpecies of diſeaſe, as well as the yellow fever, properly ſo called, appears but rarely among thoſe who have reſided any length of time in tropical climates. It was obſerved to begin, as fevers uſually do, with diſagreeable affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtomach, with languor, debility, and pain of the head. The horror of ſhivering, ſo common in the commencement of febrile diſeaſes, was ſeldom great in degree; but it often laſted long, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was accompanied with unuſual feelings. The pulſe was generally ſmall, frequent, and eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; the eyes were watery, muddy, or inflamed; the features were confuſed, and the countenance was ſometimes fluſhed: the thirſt was ſeldom great; and the heat of the ſkin was uſually moderate; but a deep and heavy ſighing, a hurried reſpiration, with an inconceivable diſtreſs and anxiety about the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia, gave ſtrong indications of the nature of the complaint.—In ſome inſtances I have known ſuch
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028890_0188_0FDD22C6308F0BA8"/>
ſevere and excruciating ſpaſms, as, in ſome meaſure ſeemed, to ſuſpend the ordinary functions of life.</p>
               <p>In twelve hours, or leſs, there was often ſome abatement in the violence of thoſe ſymptoms; but ſeldom ſuch material relief, as, with any degree of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, could be called a remiſſion. The ſkin became cool, and ſometimes moiſt; yet there ſcarcely ever was any ſweat. The pulſe became fuller, and often leſs frequent; the reſtleſſneſs and anxiety were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſenſibly diminiſhed; and the local pain often abated; but this reſpite was neither long, nor of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain duration. In a few hours, all the ſymptoms returned with aggravation. The eyes became more muddy; the countenance more confuſed; the head-ach, and other pains increaſed, together with ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of anxiety, and reſtleſſneſs, hurried reſpiration, and deep and heavy ſighing. The pulſe was now more frequent, ſmaller and harder; the thirſt was increaſed, with nauſea, and ſometimes with vomiting. The vomiting was ſeldom bilious: it was not often, indeed, that the matter thrown up, was altered from what had been drank, unleſs by having acquired an additional degree of ropineſs.—To the above ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms was ſometimes added an obſtinate coſtiveneſs, ſometimes ſuch a degree of purging and griping, as might eaſily be miſtaken for proper dyſentery.</p>
               <p>As the diſeaſe advanced in its progreſs, the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the violence of ſymptoms, which at firſt was ſometimes perceived towards the mornings, became gradually leſs and leſs perceptible, and at laſt was ſcarcely to be diſtinguiſhed. The anxiety and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs were now particularly diſtreſſing; the ſkin was ſometimes dry, though oftener moiſt, and in point of heat below the ordinary temperature of health; while it gave the idea to the perſon who felt it, as if there was a powerful ſpaſm ſubſiſting on the ſurface. I may likewiſe remark in this place, that a beautiful red colour of the cheeks, together with a ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:028890_0189_0FDD22C764CB4020"/>
and cherry plumpneſs of the lips, was frequently obſerved towards the latter periods of the diſeaſe. Yellowneſs, as was mentioned before, was ſeldom ſeen, unleſs in the very laſt ſtage of the illneſs; and vomiting of black, or even bilious matter was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely rare. There was, however, at all times, a great diſpoſition to faint, with more or leſs of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpecies of low delirium.</p>
               <p>The courſe of this ſpecies of the diſeaſe, was leſs rapid, than the courſe of that which terminates in black vomiting; the termination of the one being often protracted to the eighth or ninth day, that of the other ſeldom exceeding the fourth or fifth. The marks of criſis, as was obſerved before, were rarely diſcoverable in the firſt ſpecies of the yellow fever. They were likewiſe obſcure in the preſent, and I cannot pretend to ſpeak with confidence, of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of critical days. Where the termination was favourable, the pulſe became gradually ſtronger, and leſs confined in its ſtroke; the ſkin likewiſe became ſofter, while the impreſſion, which it made on the hand that felt it, communicated an idea that the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation was more vigorous, and the ſpaſm on the ſurface leſs obſtinate; the eye and countenance like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe brightened up; the anxiety and reſtleſſneſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed or decreaſed, and ſome appetite for food re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; but it was often difficult to mark the point of time preciſely, at which this change took place.—It may be obſerved likewiſe, where the termination was fatal, that death approached in two different ways. A patient, apparently poſſeſſed of vigour, was ſometimes ſuddenly ſeized with coma or convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and died unexpectedly; but it happened more frequently, that the powers of life were gradually and ſlowly extinguiſhed; the pulſe became weaker and more confined in its ſtroke; while the natural heat and circulation retired by degrees from the ſurface and extremities of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:028890_0190_0FDD22EDABF47100"/>
The cure of this ſpecies of the diſeaſe, though by no means eaſy, was leſs difficult upon the whole than that of the former. Inſtead of the torpor and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, which prevailed in the latter periods of the proper yellow fever, the mobility of the nervous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem was ſo much increaſed in the preſent ſpecies of diſeaſe, that remedies ſeldom failed of producing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effects: and wherever remedies produce effects, it generally is in our power to manage the buſineſs in ſuch manner, that ſome good may ariſe. It may be obſerved in the firſt place, with regard to the cure, that bleeding, which frequently was uſeful in the former ſpecies, was generally hurtful in the preſent; and that inſtead of retarding, it oftener accelerated the progreſs of the diſeaſe. Emetics were employed very commonly by the practitioners of the Weſt Indies, in this as in other caſes of fever; but I cannot help remarking, that languor and debility, frequently yellowneſs, and ſometimes a continual vomiting, which no remedies could reſtrain, were often the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of antimonial emetics of ſevere operation; and I have no doubt in ſaying, that the approach of death was actually haſtened, in ſeveral inſtances, by this method of treatment. Laxatives were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally of ſervice; but the ſtronger purgatives were frequently hurtful. Bliſters were often extremely beneficial; but it requires care and diſcernment to apply them in the proper circumſtances, ſo as to reap the full advantage. Opiates were ſometimes ſerviceable, and bark and wine, in moſt inſtances, were remedies of great value; but the principal truſt was placed in warm and cold bathing; which, under proper management, ſeldom failed of anſwering every expectation completely, or ſpeedily, of removing the chief ſymptoms of danger. Sometimes it appeared to cut ſhort the courſe of the diſeaſe abruptly.</p>

               <head>SECTION III.</head>
               <p>I HAVE now deſcribed two ſpecies of a fever, which ſeems to be, in ſome degree, peculiar to the natives of northern regions, ſoon after their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in the Weſt-Indies. In the one, a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the alimentary canal and biliary organs, with marks of putreſcent tendency in the general maſs of fluids, was diſcoverable at an early period; in the other, the brain and nervous ſyſtem were more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and principally affected; while the ſpecies, of which I now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> give ſome account, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited ſtrong marks of vaſcular excitement, with a very high degree of the apparent inflammatory dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis. This was more irregular in its appearances and more complicated in its nature, than the others. The marks of inflammatory diatheſis were generally very apparent in the beginning; but they uſually gave way or became complicated in the latter ſtages, with ſymptoms of putreſcency or nervous affection. In deſcribing the hiſtory of this diſeaſe, it may not be ſuperfluous to remark, that there is ſeldom any thing particular in the ſenſations of debility and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which precede the formation of the paroxyſm. The hot fit was generally obſerved to run high; the heat was often intenſe; the pulſe, which was quick, frequent and irregular, vibrated often in an uncommon manner, and with an uſual degree of force; the thirſt was ſometimes immoderate, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not greatly increaſed; the countenance was fluſhed; the eye gliſtened, and appeared frequently to be in ſome degree inflamed; the ſigns of excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were in general uncommonly high; yet the diſpoſition to faint was ſometimes ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. It deſerves farther to be remarked, that blood drawn from the arm did not commonly exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the uſual buffy appearance of real inflammatory
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028890_0192_0FDE5B3146836778"/>
diatheſis; and though times of aggravation and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviation were often diſcernible; yet they did not happen at regular and ſtated periods.</p>
               <p>It was obſerved frequently, that many of the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances ſuffered a material change, about the third day of the diſeaſe. The ſymptoms of high inflammatory diatheſis, which prevailed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, became mixed, more or leſs, with ſymptoms of putreſcency, or nervous affection. Delirium made its appearance; ſometimes it ran high, with ſtartings and ſymptoms of violent excitement; ſometimes there was a low and muttering incoherence with marks of languor and debility. The gums turned red and ſpungy, and ſometimes bled; the thirſt was frequently intenſe, the tongue dry, with vomiting and ſevere retching; yet vomiting of bilious or vitiated matters was a rare occurrence. The above ſymptoms gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally went on to increaſe, during the ſpace of ſix or ſeven days, about which period the powers of life either yielded to the diſeaſe, or ſigns of recovery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to appear: the marks of criſis, however, were ſeldom diſtinct and final; neither was the influence of critical days ſo much to be depended upon as in the common remitting fever of the country.</p>
               <p>It was mentioned above, that the nature of this fever was more complicated than that of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; ſo the indications of cure are likewiſe more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and perplexed. If we proceed on the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious view of the diſeaſe, we ſhall often do irreparable miſchief by copious and repeated evacuations; yet there will not be leſs danger, on the other hand, if, regardleſs of the preſent degree of excitement, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge freely in the uſe of ſtimulants. It is neceſſary to obſerve a middle courſe; and I muſt confeſs, that it is ſometimes difficult to do any thing, without doing harm. Bleeding was frequently employed in the cure of this diſeaſe, and in moſt caſes, it was a uſeful remedy, though leſs perhaps from its own
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:028890_0193_0FDE5B3A9F2A87E8"/>
effects merely, than from paving the way to other more powerful applications. It is, however, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being eaſily carried to exceſs; and ought not to be truſted to wholly for the removing of the irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, and high degree of excitement, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails ſo generally in the beginning of this diſeaſe. After bleeding, emetics and cathartics are employed very freely. I have always profeſſed myſelf an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the practice of giving emetics in the fevers of Jamaica; yet, I muſt confeſs, that antimonials were not only ſafer, but of more particular ſervice in this, than in any other ſpecies of fever, where I have ſeen them tried. Among the great variety of forms which have been recommended by practitioners, for the purpoſe of emptying the firſt paſſages, I have not found any one anſwer ſo well, as a thin ſolution of the ſal-catharticum, given at different intervals, with a ſmall portion of emetic tartar, and ſometimes with the addition of laudanum. The operation of this remedy was extenſive. It might be ſo managed, as to promote nauſea or vomiting, ſweat, or moderate evacuations downwards; at the ſame time that it proved very powerfully ſedative. I may likewiſe add, that I have ſometimes found benefit from nitre, camphire and opium, given in pretty large doſes, and accompanied with plentiful dilution. But though theſe remedies were often ſerviceable, and contributed in many caſes to moderate the high degree of irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, yet the chief dependence of the cure was much better truſted to cold bathing. After the ſurface of the body had been ſufficiently relaxed, by the previous uſe of warm bathing and fomentations, the effects of cold bathing were wonderful. The exceſſive irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was moderated or removed, and the powers of life were invigorated in a very ſingular manner in conſequence of it.</p>
               <p>I have attempted in the preceding pages, to give a ſhort view of a diſeaſe, which has not, I believe,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:028890_0194_0FDE5B41A32F1480"/>
been hitherto very accurately deſcribed by authors' or treated with much ſucceſs in practice. It is a diſeaſe of a continued kind; and, as I ſaid before, in ſome degree peculiar to the natives of northern lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, ſoon after their arrival in the tropical climates. I cannot help thinking, that it may be eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, even in the firſt hours of its attack, from the intermitting or remitting fever, which is the common endemic of hot countries: but I muſt at the ſame time add, that this diſtinction does not reſide in the preſence or abſence of one individual ſymptom. The ſtate of the pulſe, indeed, conveys information, that the diſeaſe is not of the kind which has paroxyſms and remiſſions: yet this information can only be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from a knowledge and actual compariſon of the two diſeaſes:—I do not pretend to deſcribe it in words. The ſtate of the eye and countenance, was likewiſe obſerved to be ſtrongly deſcriptive of the nature of the diſeaſe; as alſo were the deep and heavy ſighing, the hurried reſpiration, the anxiety and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs, with a certain uncomfortableneſs of ſenſation, which no words can expreſs; but I confeſs myſelf, at the ſame time, perfectly at a loſs to fix on any one ſingle ſymptom, which appearing at an early period, diſcriminated it with certainty from all other fevers. I have deſcribed it under three diſtinct and ſeparate forms; but I muſt alſo add, that they may ſometimes be found to be more complicated with each other, than they appear to be in the above deſcription.</p>

            <p>HAVING endeavoured in the preceding treatiſe, to give a more accurate hiſtory of the endemic fever of Jamaica, than is met with in books, and I am diſpoſed to flatter myſelf, having pointed out a more ſucceſsful method of cure than that which has been generally purſued; I ſhall now add a few obſervations on the intermitting fever of America; a diſeaſe, in which my experience has been tolerably extenſive. The frequent occurrence of intermitting fevers in every climate, together with the full and ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the diſeaſe has been treated of by many learned and ingenious writers, excuſes me from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into a minute and full diſcuſſion of the ſubject. I ſhall therefore employ only a few pages in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to illuſtrate particulars in the hiſtory of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which have been ſuperficially noticed; or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain ſome points of treatment, which, though not new, I have ventured to carry farther than is uſual in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice. As I had the opportunity of attending to the hiſtory of the intermitting fever in ſeveral of the ſouthern provinces of the continent of North Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, I ſhall firſt mention the more conſtant and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral courſe of the diſeaſe, and afterwards point out thoſe circumſtances of peculiarity, which ſeemed to ariſe from the difference of climate, or from the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſeaſon of the year. I ſhall likewiſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally take notice of the general ſtate of health of the troops who were employed on the ſame expedition,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:028890_0196_0FDE5B4F46478B40"/>
though I muſt alſo add, that I can only pretend to trace the progreſs of the fever with accuracy, in the regiment in which I had the honour to ſerve.</p>
            <p>I ſhall attempt, in the firſt place, to give an accurate deſcription of the paroxyſm of an intermitting fever, marking as carefully as I can, the order of ſucceſſion, in which the ſymptoms moſt uſually appear. We are taught by the deſcriptions of moſt writers, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider languor and debility as the firſt feeling or firſt eſſential ſymptom in the paroxyſm of an intermitting fever; but I cannot avoid remarking, that an unuſual affection at ſtomach, a flatulence,—in ſhort, ſomething diſagreeable, which I cannot eaſily define, but which was accompanied in many caſes with head-ach, and ſometimes with drowzineſs, preceded every ſenſation of languor or debility in moſt caſes, where my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations were made with ſuch care that they could be truſted to. I may alſo farther obſerve, that, as ſoon as this languor or debility began to be perceived, the veins began to ſubſide, the nails turned pale, and at laſt blue; the ſkin of courſe was dry and conſtricted; and there was ſometimes an evident diminution of hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, particularly of the heat of the extremities. To theſe ſymptoms was often added, a diſagreeable kind of yawning, with ſtrong ſenſations of wearineſs, and an irreſiſtible inclination to ſtretch the limbs. A ſenſation of cold was now felt in the back, as if water ran down upon it in ſeparate ſtreams. It ſoon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, indeed; but ſuddenly returned again in a more violent degree; in which manner it went on, ceaſing for an inſtant, and then recurring with aggravated vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, till the whole body became at laſt affected with rigour or ſhaking, accompanied, in a more eſpecial manner, with chattering of the teeth. The coldneſs having now arrived at its acme, or higheſt point of intenſity, glowings of heat were perceived in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals between the rigors or ſucceſſions. Theſe glowings grew gradually ſtronger, and continuing for a greater
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:028890_0197_0FDE60822475CD20"/>
length of time, at leaſt baniſhed every ſenſation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old. The heat, which now ſucceeded, was often much above the temperature of health; marks of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſometimes ran high; the veins became full<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the face was fluſhed, and the ſurface of the body bore marks of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. The duration of this ſtate was uncertain: ſometimes it did not continue the ſpace of one hour, ſometimes it laſted four or five. A damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at firſt began to appear on the forehead and breaſt, which extending itſelf gradually to the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, was at leaſt formed into a ſweat; in conſequence of which, the fever gradually ſubſided, and the body returned nearly to its natural ſtate.</p>
            <p>The above are the moſt uſual ſymptoms of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms of an intermitting fever. I have deſcribed them in the order of time in which they moſt uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. I muſt however remark, that ſymptoms are ſometimes obſerved different from thoſe which I have now taken notice of; as alſo, that the order of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, which I have mentioned, is not, by any means fixed and invariable. It is impoſſible to deny the common obſervation, that languor or debility is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and early ſymptom in almoſt every ſpecies of fever; but it is likewiſe certain, that there are many inſtances, where it is not in our power to perceive its actual preſence. It is therefore precipitate to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with Dr. Cullen, that all the future phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena depend upon this, as their eſſential and original cauſe. There may frequently be deception in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to deſcribe the ſituation of others; but that which we feel ourſelves is more to be truſted to:—and I can affirm, that I have often felt ſenſations of cold in my own perſon, previous to every feeling of languor or debility; previous, I might even ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſay, to any perceptible deviation from a ſtate of health. But beſides, that the exiſtence or perception of languor and debility, does not ſeem to be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the exiſtence of a paroxyſm of intermitting
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:028890_0198_0FDE5EC72960C9E8"/>
fever, I may likewiſe add, that I have ſeen inſtances; particularly in the hot months of ſummer, where the whole of this diſeaſe paſſed over, without the leaſt perceptible degree of a previous cold fit. It happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſometimes alſo, that during the continuance of the paroxyſm, there was ſcarcely any obſervable diſorder in the pulſe, or any material ſigns of external fever. The tumult and uneaſineſs, which terminate in moſt caſes by ſweat, went off in ſome by urine or ſtool, or perhaps declined in others, without the appearance of any preternatural evacuation. In like manner it was commonly obſerved, in the diſeaſe diſtinguiſhed by the name of partial intermittent, that there was not any perception of cold, nor increaſe of heat; no diſorder in the pulſe, or preternatural evacuation; in ſhort, not a ſymptom, which characterizes the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the diſeaſe, except local pain, which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a certain time, diſappears, and then returns again at a ſtated hour. To this we may add, that there are various inſtances, where the whole duration of a complaint, which indiſputably depends on the cauſe of intermitting fever, is occupied by a coma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſe diſpoſition, by convulſions, or even by tetanic affection. If we therefore conſider theſe phaenomena attentively, we ſhall find little cauſe to believe, that the moſt uſual ſymptoms of the intermitting fever, are ſymptoms without which the diſeaſe cannot exiſt; or that they are mutually the cauſe and effect of each other. The order of ſucceſſion I have obſerved is not fixed invariably; and caſes are numerous, where thoſe ſymptoms, which ſome authors have conſidered as abſolutely eſſential, do not appear at all. This fact is certain; and we may ſafely conclude from it, that the main hinge of action in a paroxyſm of fever has not been yet diſcovered.</p>
            <p>The vital and natural functions are variouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, not only in different people, but in the ſame perſon, in the different ſtages of a paroxyſm of the
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028890_0199_0FDD2295EA92D978"/>
ſame fever. The pulſe, in the firſt approach, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten remarked to be flower than natural, ſometimes it is more languid and weak. It ſoon however becomes more frequent, though it continues for the moſt part ſmall and contracted, till the latter ſtage of the cold fit. It then uſually acquires ſtrength and ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fulneſs, ſometimes greater frequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ncy and hardineſs; but as the ſweat begins to flow, the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and frequency abate, while the fulneſs increaſes; ſo that it returns by degrees nearly to its natural ſtate. The diſagreeable affection of ſtomach, (which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly obſerved was ſometimes the firſt perceptible ſymptom of a paroxyſm of the intermitting fever) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes frequently to nauſea or retching, ſometimes to ſevere and continual vomiting; which does not ceaſe till ſweating has become general all over the body. The reſpiration, which in the beginning of the paroxyſm, is uſually flow, and ſometimes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with ſighing, in the progreſs of the hot fit becomes frequent, laborious and high. It often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, likewiſe, that there is more than ordinary dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of perception in the mental faculties in the firſt approach of the fever; while this is often ſucceeded by extraordinary acuteneſs in the more advanced ſtages, particularly during the continuance of the hot fit. But though it is only during this period that excitement and delirium are obſerved to be common; yet inſtances are not wanting, where derangement of intellect is among the firſt ſymptoms of the diſeaſe, and where it continues among the principal through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole of the courſe. To the above appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances we may add, that the urine, which is thin and pale in the firſt ſtage, becomes high coloured in the progreſs of the hot fit; and as the ſweating advances, thick and turbid, frequently with the addition of a copious lateritious ſediment.</p>
            <p>I remarked formerly, in treating of the remitting fever of Jamaica, that certain hours of attack were
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028890_0200_0FDE5ECD158BB388"/>
in a very peculiar manner connected with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent types or forms of that diſeaſe; but I cannot pretend to ſay, that the ſame rules were obſerved to hold good, with any degree of certainty in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fever of America. Single tertians, indeed, began moſt uſually about twelve; though there were likewiſe many inſtances where they came on ſo early as ten in the morning, or ſo late as two in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon. The other forms were ſtill leſs regular. It was alſo taken notice of, that anticipations were common in the ſingle tertian of Jamaica; as alſo that they were irregular and long. In America they were ſtill more frequent; but ſeldom exceeded one or two hours at once. They often, however, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to a certain acme, or point in the diſeaſe, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a regular interval of time in their progreſs. It ſometimes likewiſe happened, that the type poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned gradually, till the complaint diſappeared finally, This, however, was much more rare than the other.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned, in the preceding pages, ſome general reſemblances of the intermitting fever of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, I ſhall next trace its peculiarities in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent provinces, in which the regiment to which I belonged, had the fortune to ſerve. I may obſerve, in the firſt place, that I joined the firſt battalion of the 71ſt regiment, on York Iſland, in the beginning of the ſummer 1778. Few of the men were then ſick; neither did the number increaſe materially, till towards the latter end of June. The intermittents, which appeared previous to this period, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſingle tertian; and of perfectly eaſy treatment. In the month of July, a dyſentery, of a very particular kind, became epidemic, and the ſporadic intermittent inſtantly vaniſhed. The ſtools in this complaint were numerous and bloody, the gripings were ſevere, but there was ſeldom any very material diſorder in the pulſe. The diſeaſe did not often terminate in leſs than ſeven days; ſometimes it continued a
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:028890_0201_0FDD22996DFB2610"/>
fortnight or longer. The ordinary treatment was very rarely of benefit; yet the complaint was of a nature ſo little dangerous, that I do not recollect a ſingle perſon who died of it. It diſappeared totally about the beginning of Auguſt, or rather changed into an epidemic intermittent, the type of which was uſually ſingle tertian. The paroxyſms of this fever were regular, the intermiſſions were diſtinct; and its nature was ſo far from being obſtinate, that I ſcarcely met with an inſtance which reſiſted the Peruvian bark, where that remedy was given in ſufficient quantity. This fever continued highly epidemic during the months of Auguſt and September. The frequency of new attacks was conſiderably diminiſhed in the month of October; yet ſuch as happened then, were generally accompanied with dangerous and alarming ſymptoms. Relapſes were common. But though the intermitting fever of this iſland was epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic in a conſiderable degree, it was not by any means of a fatal nature. If neglected in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, foundation was ſometimes laid for obſtinate complaints; but the diſeaſe was not fatal in its proper form to any one patient, who remained with the regiment. I cannot ſpeak with certainty of the iſſue of a few of the worſt caſes, which were ſent to the General Hoſpital, on the breaking up of the encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the month of November. The regiment was then embarked in tranſports, on an expedition to the ſouthward. The ſick were collected into one ſhip, which, after a ſtormy and tedious paſſage, arrived with the reſt of the fleet at Savanna, in Georgia, in the latter end of December. The voyage had an excellent effect on the health of the men. Out of a hundred and twenty convaleſcents, who embarked at New York, in the month of November, not a man died; and there only remained two, who were unfit for the ſervice of the field, on the day of our arrival in the Savanna river. During the months of January,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:028890_0202_0FDE5ED907716540"/>
February and March, the battalion of the regiment in which I ſerved, was a total ſtranger to ſickneſs. It was employed in long and almoſt continual march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till the latter end of April, when, encamping at Ebenezer, on the Savanna river, the intermitting fever ſoon made its appearance, and ſpread ſo rapidly, that before the end of June, very few remained, not only in this regiment, but even in the garriſon, who had not ſuffered more or leſs from this raging diſeaſe. It was commonly remarked in the hiſtory of this fever, that the type during the month of May, was uſually ſingle tertian, till the fifth or ſixth day; after which, paroxyſms were often obſerved daily, though generally unequal in force and duration: that is, the diſeaſe changed about this period, to a double tertian form. But though this was obſerved to be the caſe, during the greateſt part of May, the type of the fever was uſually double tertian, or quotidian, from its very commencement, in the month of June. The diſeaſe was then of the moſt ardent kind. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms were ſeldom uſhered in by a cold fit; and the remiſſions, for the moſt part, were very indiſtinct and imperfect. The heat of the weather was exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, during the greateſt part of the month; and ſtrange and alarming ſymptoms occurred frequently in the courſe of the diſeaſe. In ſome caſes a comatoſe diſpoſition, approaching to apoplexy, or rigid ſpaſms, reſembling a perfect tetanus, occupied the greateſt part of the paroxyſm; in others there were various local pains, deliria, bilious vomitings or purgings, with a multitude of other affections, which appeared on a ſuperficial view to conſtitute the whole of the complaint. Yet theſe, ſymptoms declining after ſome continuance, recurred again at a ſtated hour, and were finally removed, or at leaſt ſuſpended, by the Peruvian bark. I left the garriſon of Ebenezer in the beginning of July, and went directly to Savanna, where the ſame epidemic prevailed, though in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:028890_0203_0FDE5E0F62192BF8"/>
of leſs frequency, and with ſymptoms of a leſs alarming nature than at the above-mentioned place. At Savanna, it uſually retained marks of diſtinct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion, and its type was often of the ſingle tertian kind—in ſhort, it was ſimilar to the fever of Ebenezer in the month of May. From Savanna, I went to Beaufort in the beginning of Auguſt. The fever, which uſually prevails at this ſeaſon of the year, in all the ſouthern provinces of North America, was then epidemic among the troops who were ſtationed on this iſland. The type, however, was ſtill more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſingle tertian here, than at Savanna. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the paroxyſms was likewiſe more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſtinguiſhed by a cold fit; and the intermiſſions, for the moſt part, were more perfect and diſtinct. In a few caſes, indeed, marks of malignity were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable; yet the diſeaſe, upon the whole, was not of a fatal nature, or of obſtinate cure; though unleſs ſpeedily checked by bark, it often degenerated into dyſentery or dropſy, which were not only removed with difficulty, but in the circumſtances under which we laboured, were often of very precarious iſſue. This epidemic was ſtill acquiring force, when the outpoſts were ſummoned to the defence of Savanna. Its progreſs was, in ſome meaſure, ſuſpended during the active ſervice of the ſiege. The enemy, however, had no ſooner retired from before the place, than a fever began to rage with violence, which carried off prodigious numbers, particularly of the foreign troops. It was obſerved in the hiſtory of the preceding year, that few were attacked afreſh with the intermitting fever on York Iſland, ſo late as the months of October and November; but it was likewiſe remarked, that, where the diſeaſe happened at thoſe periods, the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were oftener malignant or dangerous. The ſame was in ſome reſpects the caſe at Savanna. The fever, which made its appearance after the ſiege, was or an alarming and violent kind. Marks of diſtinct
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:028890_0204_0FDE5EE4A3709DD8"/>
intermiſſion were ſeldom diſcoverable, delirium was a common ſymptom, ſpaſmodic affections were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times violent, and the courſe of the diſorder was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally rapid. The rage of this epidemic ceaſed in December; but relapſes continued to return occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, during the following winter; which was an unuſually ſevere one in that ſouthern latitude.</p>
            <p>There likewiſe ſtill remained ſome dyſenteric com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, which reſiſted every mode of treatment that could be deviſed. They yielded however to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the warm, weather, aſſiſted, in no ſmall degree perhaps, by the active ſervice of the ſiege of Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town. The recovery, indeed, was ſo complete, that, in the beginning of June, the whole of the regiment arrived at Camden in perfect health. The firſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion was ſent to occupy a poſt at the Cheraws, on the river Pedee. The diſtance is ſeventy-five miles; yet ſuch was the ſpirit and activity of the men, that they performed the march in three days, without fatigue or inconvenience. An open field, between four and five hundred paces from the bank of the river, was choſen for the encampment of this battalion; while a ſituation perfectly dry and cleared of wood, but nearer to the bank, was reſerved for the encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſecond, which was not expected to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive till after ſome time. In a fortnight or three weeks, the intermitting fever began to ſhew itſelf. It ſpread ſo rapidly, particularly in the ſecond bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion, that before the end of July, when the poſt was abandoned, few were left who had not felt its influence. The prevailing ſymptoms of this diſeaſe were much ſimilar to thoſe of the fever of Ebenezer. The type was frequently double tertian, or quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian; the remiſſions were indiſtinct; the bilious vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings and purgings were often exceſſive, and marks of malignity appeared in ſeveral inſtances. The approach of the enemy made it neceſſary that the poſt ſhould be withdrawn; but there was much
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028890_0205_0FDE5E1553150280"/>
difficulty in accompliſhing it. Two thirds of both officers and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> were unable to march; and it was not poſſible, in the ſituation in which we were placed, to find waggons ſufficient to carry them, together with the neceſſary proviſions and baggage; ſo that no other reſource was left, than to convey ſome part of them to George Town by water. Boats were therefore collected for this purpoſe, and ſuch men were put into them, as were judged leaſt likely to be ſoon fit for the ſervice of the field. Theſe, however, unfortunately fell into the hands of the militia, in their paſſage down the river, and were ſoon diſperſed into the different parts of the country; ſo that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak with certainty of the general iſſue of the diſeaſe. Thoſe who retired to Camden by land, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved unexpectedly in the ſtate of their health, in the courſe of the march. During the time that we lay at the Cheraws, the remiſſions were generally obſcure; but after the ſecond or third day's march, the type changed frequently from double to ſingle ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; at the ſame time that intermiſſions became clear and diſtinct. It may be difficult to determine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely to what cauſe this might be owing; whether to removal from a ſituation, where the fomes of the diſeaſe was in a very concentrated ſtate; to the mere exerciſe of travelling; or to the effects of cooler <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ntributed to operate this ſalutary change; though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> will probably be reckoned among the firſt inſtances, where travelling and getting wet, are recommended as being uſeful in the cure of fevers. During the month of Auguſt, and a great part of September, the army remained encamped near Camden. The weather was exceſſively hot, and fevers were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,—ſometimes malignant and dangerous; though they preſerved, in general, the diſtinct character of
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028890_0206_0FDE5EED8DB3A8F0"/>
intermittents. In the months of October and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember relapſes were numerous, and original attacks, though rare, were dangerous and alarming when they happened. Some inſtances of a diſeaſe were now obſerved of a more ſerious nature than any that had hitherto appeared. Inſtead of diſtinct intermiſſions, which prevailed during the preceding months, the ſmalleſt traces of remiſſion were ſcarcely perceptible; the countenance was duſky, and of a greaſy appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the tongue was conſtantly dry and parched; the head was often much affected, and grangrenous ſpots ſometimes appeared on the extremities. The duration of this diſeaſe often did not exceed ſeven days; ſometimes it continued a fortnight, or even longer. It was generally of a fatal nature; and where it happened to people who had been ſubject to the intermitting fever in the preceding months, it for the moſt part effected ſuch a change on the conſtitution, as deſtroyed the tendency to relapſe. But beſides this unuſual ſpecies of diſeaſe, which ſometimes appeared in the months of October and November, it was likewiſe obſerved that relapſes of the fever, which preſerved the diſtinct intermitting character, were not only leſs frequent, but commonly leſs alarming, in proportion as the weather turned cooler. Relapſes were often remarked in this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to terminate of their own accord, in a very ſhort time; and frequently to leave the body in a ſtate of greater vigour than they found it. I find a fact in my notes, with regard to this ſubject, which is curious and important. Between thirty and forty of the men of the regiment entered upon the ſervice of the campaign in ſo weak a ſtate, that they were unable at firſt to carry their arms. They however gained ſtrength ſpeedily as they proceeded on the march; and ſeldom forgot to mention, that they felt a new acceſſion of vigour after every accidental relapſe. But I muſt further obſerve, that, together with the
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:028890_0207_0FDE5E1BEE242DF8"/>
above changes which happened in the progreſs of the ſeaſon, the epidemic ſhewed a remarkable tendency to degenerate into dyſentery or dropſy in the months of September and October. The gripings in this ſpecies of dyſentery were often ſevere; the ſtools were large and watery; and times of aggravation and remiſſion were frequently obſerved, as in a regular intermittent. Indeed the intermittent, the dyſentery, and even the dropſical ſwellings ſo often alternated with one another, as evidently ſhewed that they all depended upon the ſame general cauſe. The cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign of the following winter was a very active one. The army travelled over a great extent of country, and was conſidered by many as performing very hard ſervice; but I have the ſatisfaction to add, that notwithſtanding occaſional forced marches, wading of rivers, expoſure to rain, accidental ſcarcity of bread, and no great profuſion of beef, with the total want of rum, the troops enjoyed in general a moſt perfect ſtate of health. Valetudinarians were reſtored to perfect vigour; and when we arrived at Wilmington, in the latter end of April, there ſcarcely was a man in the regiment to which I belonged, who was not fit for the duty of the field. In the ſummer cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign through North Carolina and Virginia, there was no room to complain of hardſhips. The camp abounded with a profuſion of the beſt proviſions; and the marches were ſeldom long or fatiguing. We arrived at Portſmouth towards the end of July, with a very moderate liſt of ſick. Portſmouth is ſaid to be unhealthy; and we ſoon were able to verify the obſervation: an intermitting fever, complicated, or alternating with a dyſenteric complaint, made its appearance ſoon after our arrival, and continued to increaſe during the ſhort time we remained in the place. A diſeaſe of a ſimilar kind continued to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the army, after our removal to York Town. It was not, however, by any means fatal in its nature,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:028890_0208_0FDE5EFCA5772BD8"/>
or difficult of cure, if attended to in time, though if allowed to go on, it often degenerated into dropſy, obſtructions in the abdominal viſcera, or a dyſenteric complaint which frequently proved fatal in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the following winter. The 71ſt regiment had now ſerved three campaigns in the ſouthern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and might be conſidered as being perfectly well ſeaſoned to the climate. It was in fact more healthy than any other corps in the army; there not being more than five or ſix unfit for the duty of the line, when the French and Americans inveſted the place. After the capitulation the proportion of the ſick of the army increaſed conſiderably. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of a fever, ſimilar to that which prevailed at Camden and Savanna, in the month of November, were obſerved in ſeveral regiments; but a ſpecies of dyſentery, which appeared often to have originated from an ill cured intermittent, was the complaint which proved principally fatal.</p>
            <p>From the above ſhort hiſtory of the intermitting fever, as it appeared in the 71ſt regiment, in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent provinces of North America, where that corps happened to ſerve, we may be enabled to form ſome idea of the changes, which are more conſtantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſeaſon and climate, or which ariſe accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the particular effects of local ſituation. In the ſpring and beginning of ſummer, the ſingle ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian was the moſt uſual type of the endemic of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, in every province which the regiment viſited:—the paroxyſms were diſtinct, and the intermiſſions were generally perfect. In the months of June, July and Auguſt, double tertians were common, and in ſome ſituations baniſhed every ſimpler form. As the weather turned cool, the ſingle tertian reſumed its place; ſo that any other type was ſcarcely ever ſeen. But beſides the above changes of type, which in ſome degree followed the changes of ſeaſon, dyſentery or dropſy frequently made their appearance in the months
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:028890_0209_0FDE5E2207E6F300"/>
of Auguſt, September and October, alternating with, or ſucceeding the intermittent; while fevers of a bad and uncommon kind were by no means rare in the months of October and November.</p>
            <p>I have thus obſerved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a curſory manner the more general changes of the intermitting fever, as influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by change of ſeaſon. I may alſo remark, that beſides ſeaſon, climate had a conſiderable effect in modifying the appearances of the diſeaſe. It thus happened, that the type was generally ſingle tertian on York Iſland, even in the heat of ſummer; in ſpring and winter other forms were rarely ſeen. In Georgia, the ſingle tertian was the prevailing form, only in the winter and ſpring. In ſummer, and ſome part of autumn, double tertians were common; and types of ſtill greater complication frequently made their appearance during this period, in ſome particular ſituations of the province. Dyſentery dropſy and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous fevers were likewiſe more frequent here in the autumnal months, than they were found to be in the neighbourhood of New York; while the courſe of intermittent, as long as the form was regular, was more ſpeedily checked by Peruvian Bark in Georgia, than in the more northern latitudes. The prevailing type of the climate of South Carolina, was ſingle ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, even in the ſummer and autumn; yet where the forms of the diſeaſe was in a high ſtate of concentra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as at the Cheraws, the type was of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated that remiſſions were ſcarcely diſcernible. The tendency of the endemic of this province, to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into dyſentery or dropſy in the antumn, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe leſs remarkable than in Georgia. The danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fevers of October and November were alſo fewer in number; though ſtill more frequent, and more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable than in the province of New York. The province of Virginia lies about halfway between New York and Savanna; and the general effects of its cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, on the common endemic of the country, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:028890_0210_0FDE5F061F98DE00"/>
with its local ſituation.—Deviations from the tertian type were more frequent than at the one place, leſs ſo than at the other.</p>
            <p>It appears from what has been ſaid above, that the ſingle tertian is the proper fundamental type of North America. It undergoes, as we have ſeen, a regular change and alteration, in conſequence of the ordinary changes of the ſeaſons, as alſo in conſequence of the effects of the various climates of the different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of that extenſive continent: but beſides theſe changes, which are more general and certain, we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe find, that the accidental circumſtances of local ſituation often produce very remarkable effects. In this manner, though the type of the fever which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on York Iſland, was properly ſingle tertian; yet double tertians, and even more complicated forms, were not by any means rare, in a part of the batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion which lay contiguous to a ſwamp. The real nature of the endemic fever of Georgia, is, perhaps, properly of the intermitting kind; yet remiſſions were often ſcarcely perceptible at Ebenezer; which is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated immediately on the bank of the river Savanna, and which, in ſome degree, is ſurrounded by creeks of freſh water. It may not be improper to remark with regard to Ebenezer, that few places in America have been obſerved to be more unhealthful; though ſuch a concluſion probably would not be drawn from a general view of its ſituation. It occupies a ſandy eminence of conſiderable elevation, and poſſeſſes a conſiderable environ of cleared ground. At Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanna, which is ſituated twenty-five miles nearer the mouth of the river, there were likewiſe many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of deviation from the ſingle tertian type, but ſtill fewer than at Ebenezer. The fever likewiſe was generally of a leſs dangerous kind. The obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appearances of the two places did not afford ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon for forming this concluſion. The ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Savanna would have probably been thought
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:028890_0211_0FDE5E2A1D96AD30"/>
to be the leaſt favourable to health. Though elevated and dry, and poſſeſſing a wider environ of cleared ground than Ebenezer; yet a ſwamp on the right and left, with a river and rice ſwamps in front, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened great ravage from intermittents. That they were leſs formidable than might have been expected, was probably in a greater meaſure owing to the bluff or ſand bank being higher than the ſituation of the town, and intercepting, in ſome degree, the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the river and great ſwamps.</p>
            <p>I obſerved on a former occaſion, that the ſigns of criſis, in the remitting fever of Jamaica, were generally clear and unequivocal. I muſt now own, that I have not been able to attain certainty, on this head, in the intermitting fever of America. In fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of a ſingle tertian type, the intermiſſions were frequently ſo perfect and complete, that it was not eaſy to ſay what was wanting to conſtitute perfect health: even in the hot months of ſummer, where the remiſſions were extremely obſcure, I often found it difficult to form an opinion to which I could confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently truſt; as it happened frequently, that thoſe ſigns, which I had been diſpoſed to conſider at one time as marks of final criſis, proved in the event only to be indications of more diſtinct intermiſſion, or of ſome change in the nature of the ſymptoms.</p>
            <p>Having given a ſhort view of the hiſtory and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the intermitting fever of America in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding pages, I ſhall now proceed to offer a few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the manner of treatment. And I may obſerve in the firſt place, that the intermitting fever is not in general a diſeaſe of a dangerous nature. If treated with deciſion in the beginning, it is for the moſt part removed very ſpeedily and very certainly; though if attacked with feeble remedies, it often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. The intermitting fever ſometimes proves
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:028890_0212_0FDE5F0703760450"/>
fatal from the actual violence of the ſymptoms of the paroxyſm, though the danger more generally ariſes from a tendency to degenerate into dyſentery or drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, or to form viſceral obſtructions. But beſides the danger, which ariſes from the actual force, or from the more tedious effects of the diſeaſe, we often find a character of peculiar malignity, in the intermittents of ſome ſeaſons and ſome ſituations, which deſerves to be particularly attended to. Malignity is a word of a vague meaning; and on different occaſions is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently applied. In the preſent inſtance, I refer the term to a peculiar character of the diſeaſe, expreſſed by a certain ſtate of the eye and countenance of the the patient. It was ſometimes obſerved, that the countenance of the patient was fluſhed; but at the ſame time dark and overcaſt; or that it was of a greaſy and duſky appearance, with a look of ſternneſs and deſpondence in the eye. Thoſe appearances, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly where a white glutinous covering appeared on the tongue, were conſtantly indications of concealed or lurking danger. They occurred often at Ebene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer and the Cheraws, and I had the misfortune to learn from experience, that whenever they occurred, time ought not to be ſpent in the frivolous prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are uſually thought neceſſary to precede the giving of bark. If we judge it not to be proper in any caſe to venture upon the uſe of bark, before the body has been ſufficiently prepared by emetics and cathartics, we ſhall too often meet with inſtances where the courſe of the diſeaſe will be finiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe preparations are completed. It has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened oftener than once to myſelf, that the fatal pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm commenced before I had gone through the uſual routine of preparation, which at that time I thought indiſpenſably neceſſary, before I attempted to cut ſhort the courſe of the fever by means of its well known ſpecific.</p>
            <p>Having premiſed ſo much with regard to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:028890_0213_0FDE5E31485F3BF8"/>
nature of the diſeaſe, I ſhall now add a few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations about the management of thoſe remedies which have been moſt uſually employed; ſome of which appear to be ſuperfluous; while there is only one of them which has a right to be conſidered as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. It is a common and obvious remark, that the intermitting fevers of the ſame ſeaſon ſhew a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral tendency to run over a ſimilar courſe, though the modes of treatment may be ſometimes directly oppoſite. As I had often taken notice of this fact during the time that I remained in America, I began to ſuſpect that the changes, which I had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to attribute to treatment, were in reality owing to a diſpoſition in the nature of the diſeaſe, which was little affected by the ordinary preſcriptions. But that I might in ſome degree aſcertain the truth of this ſuſpicion, I ſelected thirty caſes of fever, which had commenced within twenty-four hours of each other. This experiment was made at Ebenezer, in the month of May; where the diſeaſe, though highly epidemic, had not yet diſcovered any ſigns of malignity; ſo that danger was not apprehended from a delay of a few days. I claſſed thoſe thirty caſes in three diviſions, without paying regard to the nature of the ſymptoms of any individual caſe. To one I preſcribed a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of emetics, at ſuch intervals as were judged proper; for another, cathartics of various kinds, or managed in various manners; while I left the third wholly to its own courſe. I watched the progreſs of the diſeaſe attentively for the ſpace of eight days, and cannot pretend to ſay, that I obſerved any material difference in the changes or appearance of thoſe caſes, which were treated in ſo different a manner. The type, which was generally ſingle tertian at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the diſorder, changed for the moſt part to double tertian or quotidian, after the ſecond or third paroxyſm; though not in a different proportion, as far as I could judge, in thoſe which were left
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028890_0214_0FDE5F13F555B790"/>
entirely to Nature, or which were created in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which has been mentioned above. It deſerves however to be remarked, that the paroxyſms were uſually milder, more regular and diſtinct after the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> uſe of carthartics; as alſo that bark ſucceeded more ſpeedily and more certainly after a repetition of antimonial emetics.</p>
            <p>Where bleeding is judged to be proper or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the cure of the intermitting fever, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are generally ſuch as require that it precede every other in order of time. Bleeding was often found to be uſeful in particular caſes. It moderated the violence of ſymptoms, and ſeemed not to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect in removing a certain ſtate of the ſyſtem, which reſiſted the ſucceſsful operation of the bark; but I muſt likewiſe add, that there was ſeldom occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to employ it in the ſouthern provinces of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. It was blamed by ſome as increaſing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to relapſe: of this, however, I can ſay nothing from my own experience; and as I am diſpoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the loſs of a moderate quantity of blood, ſeldom does material harm in this diſeaſe; ſo I have reaſon to think, that it is ſeldom neceſſary in warm climates, particularly in the hot months of ſummer or autumn.</p>
            <p>Emetics have been employed in the cure of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents for a long time paſt. There are many prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, who conſider there uſe as indiſpenſable; and ſome have pretended, that the cure of the diſeaſe, in its earlier ſtages, may be truſted to this remedy alone. Emetic tartar, ſo managed as to operate at the hour of the fever's return, was ſometimes found to prevent the acceſs of a particular paroxyſm; but though obliged, from want of bark, to have recourſe to this method of treatment in numberleſs inſtances; my experience does not ſupply me with a ſingle one, where I could poſitively <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that it abſolutely cut ſhort the courſe of the diſeaſe. Relapſes, I muſt
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:028890_0215_0FDE5E3AB4CE18D0"/>
confeſs, diſappeared frequently in conſequence of the practice; but they likewiſe diſappeared frequently, where nothing at all was done: ſo that I cannot help being of opinion, either that the real effects of emetics have been miſtaken, or that the proper modes of managing them are not generally known. I muſt not however omit to mention, that emetics are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally of great ſervice, and that antimonial emetics eſpecially obviate the effects of inflammatory dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, and on particular occaſions facilitate the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful operation of the bark. They are likewiſe ſeldom followed by thoſe dangerous effects which frequently ariſe from the employment of them in fevers of Jamaica; though I certainly ſhould adviſe that they be uſed with great caution in the ſouthern provinces, in the ſummer and autumn, where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of the fever are obſcure.</p>
            <p>Cathartics have likewiſe been much employed by practitioners in the cure of intermitting fevers; and in few caſes, perhaps, can be omitted with ſafety. They certainly poſſeſs very remarkable effects in rendering the form of the diſeaſe regular and diſtinct; but they do not ſeem to be endued with a particular power of cutting ſhort its courſe.—The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the caſe can only point out the propriety or advantage of the various remedies of this claſs.</p>
            <p>The above are the uſual modes of evacuation, which moſt practitioners conſider to be indiſputably neceſſary previous to the exhibition of bark. I muſt however remark, that caſes ſometimes occurred in the ſouthern provinces, particularly in the hot months of ſummer, which only admitted of thoſe evacuations in a ſmall degree. Inſtead of the diſtinct and regular paroxyſms, which were expected to follow the uſe of emetics or cathartics, the diſeaſe was ſometimes obſerved to aſſume a languid and continued form, in conſequence of ſuch treatment, while it likewiſe in ſome inſtances recovered the diſtinction of paroxyſm
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:028890_0216_0FDE5F1E20B5B3F8"/>
and remiſſion, by means of applications, which excited the tone and vigour of the ſyſtem; particularly by means of exerciſe in cooler air, or accidentally by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure to rain.</p>
            <p>Peruvian Bark is the chief remedy, upon which we now depend, for the cure of intermitting fevers. It is a remedy, which like others, has undergone ſome reverſes of reputation, ſince its firſt introduction into Europe; and, though its efficacy is now fully acknowledged, perhaps over-rated by Engliſh practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, it does not ſeem yet to have gained the ſame general credit with other European nations. The French uſe it with caution, and many of the Germans are ſtill its enemies. It has been accuſed even by ſome of the Engliſh writers, of failing in the cure of intermittents; and blamed by many of occaſioning complaints more dangerous in their nature than thoſe it was intended to remove. I was early aware of theſe objections, and watched narrowly that I might diſcover its real effects; and am warranted in ſaying, that it has every right to be conſidered as a ſpecific in ague and fever; while it is totally free from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of occaſioning dyſentery, dropſy, or viſceral obſtruction. Thoſe complaints were always moſt frequent, where this remedy had been the moſt ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly employed.</p>
            <p>But though I have mentioned that bark is both a ſafe and efficacious remedy in the cure of intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fevers, I muſt alſo confeſs, that it is only ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſo by particular modes of management. It is probable that much of the bark, which is now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into England, is either in ſome ſhape adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or naturally inferior in quality to what it had been in former times; as we often read of cures ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by a ſingle drachm in the laſt century, which we ſhould ſcarcely now expect from an ounce. Three or four ounces ſeldom failed of checking the progreſs of the moſt formidable fevers of America; one or
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:028890_0217_0FDE5E5BD8096D58"/>
two frequently did not produce any ſenſible effect. Being perfectly convinced of the truth of this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I generally gave bark in caſes, where the circumſtances were judged proper for its exhibition, in doſes of two drachms; which I directed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated every two hours during the abſence of the fever. By this mode of treatment the diſeaſe was often ſo completely conquered, that the patient was frequently capable of returning to his duty in the ſpace of ſeven or eight days. Time ought not to be ſpent in frivolous preparations, or diſeaſes attacked with feeble remedies, where the health of ſoldiers is concerned. The ſpeedieſt cures are generally the beſt; and I have had many opportunities of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing more health and ſtrength gained during eight days in the field, than I ſhould have expected from a month's eaſe in an hoſpital, aſſiſted by the beſt advice of the phyſicians. The above-mentioned quantity of bark, for the moſt part, was ſufficient to effect a cure in ordinary caſes of the diſeaſe; but where danger appeared to be threatening, the doſes were often increaſed to half an ounce, or even more. In ſome caſes of obſtinacy, indeed, accompanied with a ſluggiſhneſs of conſtitution, I obſerved no other rule in the quantity than ſuch as proved diſagreeable to the ſtomach, or excited a tumul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the ſyſtem. The method was often ſucceſsful; and I may obſerve in general, that two ounces taken at five or ſix times, and in the ſpace of eight or ten hours, were often more effectual, than double the quantity in ſmall doſes, and at long intervals. If the large doſes of bark, which I have recommended, ſhould appear to any one to be dangerous or unneceſſary; I may add, that I have myſelf frequently taken an ounce at once; while I have likewiſe obſerved the cure to be tedious and uncertain with the moderate doſes of ordinary practice. I may farther remark, that this remedy was often rejected by the ſtomach, and in ſome caſes
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028890_0218_0FDE5F276E1516B0"/>
paſſed off almoſt inſtantly by ſtool; yet that the courſe of the fever ſeemed to be no leſs effectually checked by it, than when ſuch effects did not occur.</p>
            <p>The quantity of bark, which I frequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the intermitting fever of America, may appear to be greater than neceſſary: ſo the time at which it was ſometimes given, may alſo appear to be premature. Bark was ſeldom given in the fevers of the ſpring and beginning of ſummer, unleſs in caſes of relapſe, till after ſufficient evacuations had been premiſed. In the autumnal months, where ſigns of malignity and danger were diſcovered, the firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was often laid hold of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither was it uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly deemed neceſſary, to premiſe the evacuations of vomiting or purging. In relapſes I ſeldom let paſs the opportunity which the firſt intermiſſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded; by which means, thoſe who were ſubject to the returns of this diſeaſe, were rarely returned in the reports of the ſick.</p>
            <p>Where bark was given in ſuch quantity, and in ſuch manner as I have mentioned above, it generally was ſucceſsful in checking the progreſs of the diſeaſe; yet I muſt not omit to obſerve, that inſtances ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times occurred, where it totally failed of this effect, under every mode of management that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed. It would be uſeful to aſcertain thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances exactly; but this is a taſk which I cannot promiſe to perform. It was however remarked, that where the inflammatory diatheſis prevailed in very evident degree, bark was frequently given without ſucceſs: and owing to this cauſe, perhaps, it was leſs to be truſted to in the ſpring, (unleſs in caſes of relapſe), than in the hot weather of ſummer and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn. But beſides the obvious marks of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diatheſis, there appeared to be other conditions of the frame unfriendly to the ſucceſsful operations of bark. The exact nature of theſe, indeed, was perceived with difficulty; yet I have often obſerved
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:028890_0219_0FDE5E64E518FA90"/>
them to be connected with ſome of the following cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; <abbr>viz.</abbr> with a ſmall and hard pulſe, or with a pulſe where the ſtroke was obſcure or without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion, and where a creeping or vermicular motion was obſerved in the ſtate of the artery; to which was ſometimes added, a conſtricted ſtate of the ſkin, a clammy moiſture on the ſurface of the body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſigns of free perſpiration, and together with a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion or irregular action of the nervous influence. In the ſtate deſcribed above, bark alone was often given in great quantity, without producing any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect. It ſometimes ſucceeded where antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials, opiates and other antiſpaſmodics were joined with it; but bliſters applied to the back part of the head and neck, were ſerviceable above all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies in removing thoſe circumſtances, whatever they were, which ſtood in the way of its ſucceſsful operation. In ſome caſes which had proved obſtinate to every other means, the diſeaſe diſappeared imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after their application; and in every one where they were employed, ceaſed any longer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the bark. Bark alone undoubtedly has a right to be conſidered as a ſpecific in the cure of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting fever, but its virtues are occaſionally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the addition of aromatics, chalybeates, and particularly by a certain proportion of ſnake root. It was a practice with ſome of the country people of Carolina, to attempt the cure of the intermitting fever by means of Virginia ſnake root, given in doſes of two ſcruples or half a drachm. I made a trial of that remedy in ſeveral inſtances; but did not find that it was ſucceſsful. Joined however with the Peruvian bark, in the proportion of two drachms to an ounce, it was often obſerved to produce very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent effects. The cures were more complete and more permanent. There was not only leſs tendency to relapſe, but dyſenteries and dropſies were more rare, after I was fortunate enough to adopt this mode

of practice, than they had been during the preceding years.</p>
            <p>There have been many different conjectures about the mode of the bark's operation in the cure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting fevers; but none of them afford a ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory explanation of the ſubject. Bark is evidently bitter, aſtringent and aromatic; but how it becomes ſpecific in intermittents, in a degree ſo ſuperior to all other bitters, aſtringents and aromatics, is a myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery we cannot eaſily comprehend. It obviouſly poſſeſſes a power of giving tone and vigour to the powers of life; and often communicates to the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous ſyſtem, a certain ſtate or diſpoſition, known by the name of inflammatory diatheſis. Thus it is uſually obſerved, that where the nervous frame is weak and delicate, bark rarely failed of cutting ſhort the courſe of the diſeaſe, and its ſucceſs in ſuch caſes, is preceded, for the moſt part, by apparent changes in the general diatheſis of the ſyſtem. If ſtrength, fulneſs, and vigour of pulſe follow the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of bark, the fever frequently diſappears; but if thoſe ſigns are wanting, it is not poſſible to form any certain judgment of the future effect. In like manner, if ſigns of inflammatory diatheſis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to prevail during the courſe of the diſeaſe, bark ſometimes changes it to a continued fever; but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom checks its progreſs effectually. From theſe facts, which I have often ſeen verified, I am diſpoſed to conclude, that bark is only to be conſidered as an accidental ſpecific in the cure of intermittents, and that its ſalutary effects probably may be explained from the change, which it occaſions in the relative ſtate of the body. That bark is ſo often ſucceſsful depends, we may preſume, on the intermitting fever being ſo often connected with an attonic ſtate of the ſyſtem; from which cauſe it probably ariſes, that it is ſo much more effectual in ſummer and autumn, in warm weather and in warm climates, than in the
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:028890_0221_0FDE5E6E12ACCEB8"/>
oppoſite circumſtances. But though an attonic ſtate of the ſyſtem is frequently connected with intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fever, it is not conſtantly ſo; hence the diſeaſe is not invariably removed by thoſe proceſſes which excite tone, or give riſe to the inflammatory diatheſis. Exceſſive evacuations and other cauſes, by which the body has been reduced to the laſt ſtate of debility, have often interrupted the courſe of an intermittent. So that we have every reaſon to conclude, that bark is only relatively ſpecific, in as much as it deſtroys certain circumſtances of aptitude, whch are eſſentially connected in particular ſituations with the exiſtence of the diſeaſe. In this manner, voyages, journeys, new purſuits, or new modes of life, frights, the active ſervice of the field, or the hardſhips of ſieges have often removed intermitting fever, which had reſiſted the ordinary aids of medicine.</p>
            <p>I obſerved in a former part of this treatiſe, that it was ſeldom a matter of much difficulty to ſtop the courſe of the intermitting fever of America; but I muſt now add, that it was always difficult, ſometimes impoſſible to ſecure the patient againſt any future return of the diſeaſe. Bark, though much celebrated for this purpoſe, did not ſeem to prevent a relapſe with the ſame certainty with which it ſtopped the courſe of the fever, when actually preſent. It deſerves however to be remarked, that where bark had been given at regular intervals after the diſeaſe diſappeared, the paroxyſms in the relapſe were, in general, not only ſlighter, but had uſually more of the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diatheſis joined with them, while the complaint ſhewed more diſpoſition to terminate of its own accord, after a few revolutions. It is univerſally known, that the powers of bark ſeldom fail in the cure of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fevers, where given in ſufficient quantity; yet I muſt alſo obſerve, that its virtues do not ſeem to extend farther than to a temporary ſuſpenſion of the paroxyſms. That bark does not elimenate or
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:028890_0222_0FDE5F33F85A3D30"/>
deſtroy the actual cauſe of the diſeaſe, appears plainly from this fact, that relapſes are frequently the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of thoſe circumſtances, which occaſion debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or which counteract the effects of this tonic remedy. To which we may add, that though relapſes are often of a different type from the original fever, yet, as they generally happen on an even day from the ſuppreſſion of the paroxyſm, there can be little room to doubt that the old complaint again reſumes its courſe, though it probably, in the mean time, loſes ſeveral of its original ſymptoms. It is a fact likewiſe which we ought not to omit mentioning, but which in general, does not ſeem to be much attended to, that ſome periods are more remarkable for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe of intermitting fevers than others. I obſerved before, that relapſes almoſt conſtantly happen on the even days. I now add, that the moſt remarkable of thoſe days are the ſixth, the eighth, twelfth, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, twentieth, twenty-ſecond, twenty-eighth, and thirtieth. The fourteenth is remarkable for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes above all the others. Next to it we may rank the twelfth, twentieth, and twenty-ſecond; unleſs in times of very prevailing ſickneſs, where the ſixth and eighth often come in for a great ſhare. If we take pains to examine the particular circumſtances of the patient, and attend to the nature and degree of the prevailing epidemic, we may often be enabled to form a tolerable conjecture with regard to the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable period of return. Having therefore acquired from obſervation ſome general ideas of the different propenſities to relapſe in different ſituations, and in different ſubjects, I uſually began to give the bark in quantity, and to uſe other precautions on the fifth, after the ſuppreſſion of the paroxyſm, in caſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> where there were the ſtrongeſt ſuſpicions of a ſpeedy return; while this was delayed till the eleventh, nineteenth, or twenty-ſeventh in others, in proportion to the different degrees of healthineſs. This practice was
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:028890_0223_0FDE5E74A8614F90"/>
continued for the ſpace of three days, or till the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious period was paſt. But I muſt further remark, that beſides the propenſity, which was obſerved in fevers to return at the periods above-mentioned, the approach to the new and full moon was likewiſe found to be connected with relapſes in a very remarkable manner. Independent therefore, of the precautions, which were uſed at the ſeptenary periods, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to new and full moon was conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to.</p>
            <p>If the above directions were carefully complied with, we might in general prevent the diſeaſe from proving fatal, or from injuring the conſtitution ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially, though I muſt at the ſame time confeſs, that we could in reality do little more than preſerve the patient in a valetudinary ſtate, till cool weather, a change of ſituation, or ſuch a change in the manner of life as excited the active powers of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, contributed their part to effect a permanent eſtabliſhment of health. Being perfectly convinced of the truth of this obſervation, I generally remitted the men to the regiment, to be put upon the liſt of duty, as ſoon as I was certain that the courſe of the diſeaſe was actually ſtopt. The practice at firſt ſight may appear harſh; but I have found it to be ſalutary. Exerciſe, even ſome degree of exertion, promotes the recovery of health. Habits of ſloth and indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence are ſpeedily contracted in hoſpitals: the military ardour is gradually extinguiſhed, and bodily ſtrength is recruited more ſlowly than in the field, under every diſadvantage of fatigue or inclement weather.—Of the truth of this I have had ample experience.</p>
            <p>I have now pretty fully deſcribed the method of cure, which I purſued in the intermitting fever of America. I am not ignorant that other plans have been adopted, and other remedies employed by others; but as I have not had experience of any, except that which I have mentioned, I do not reckon myſelf
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:028890_0224_0FDE5F3B02B3AA68"/>
qualified to furniſh any remarks on the ſubject. Bark, indeed, is ſo ſafe, and at the ſame time ſo effectual, that I ſhould be ſlow in recommending any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, where this can be procured in ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. The ſtrongeſt proofs of its value ariſe from a comparative view of the mortality of the intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fever, in different regiments, which were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on the ſame ſervice, but which were treated in different manners by their reſpective ſurgeons.—The Heſſians were all of them inveterate enemies to the bark; and there were ever ſome of the Britiſh ſurgeons who employed it very ſparingly. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality among the troops truſted to the care of thoſe, was uniformly in great proportion. There was a Heſſian regiment, the ſituation of which I had the opportunity of knowing exactly, that loſt one third of its men by this diſeaſe and its effects, during one year's ſervice in Georgia. There were Britiſh regiments alſo, which loſt more than a fourth; while there were others, which did not loſe a twentieth. The whole of theſe regiments were engaged on the ſame ſervices; they were all alike foreigners in America; and there appeared to be no obvious cauſe for ſo great a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the degree of mortality, except a difference in the management of the bark. Bark was ſcarcely ever employed in one caſe; in another it was uſed with timidity; whilſt it was given with the earlieſt opportunity, and in quantities far exceeding the uſual practice in the third.</p>
            <p>I have deſcribed, in the preceeding pages, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which I adopted in the cure of the intermitting fever of America, whilſt that fever preſerved its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and proper form. I have likewiſe mentioned the beſt means I am acquainted with, of guarding againſt its return; and it will not be improper in the next place, that I add a few remarks on ſome of its moſt uſual and formidable effects. The intermitting fever of America ſhewed a ſtrong diſpoſition to
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:028890_0225_0FDE5E7A794B1958"/>
change into a ſpecies of dyſentery, or a purging and griping at particular ſeaſons of the year, and more eſpecially in particular local ſituations. Dropſy was likewiſe a frequent effect of this complaint, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the viſcera were not by any means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, where the intermittent, from neglect or other circumſtances, had been allowed to go on in an uninterrupted courſe.</p>
            <p>The changes from intermitting fever to dyſentery, and from dyſentery to intermitting fever, were ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the months of Auguſt and September, that thoſe diſeaſes ſeemed evidently to depend on the ſame general courſe; aſſuming at different times the one or the other form from cauſes which we could ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom aſcertain. In thoſe caſes of dyſentery the ſtools were uncommonly copious and watery, and remiſſions and exacerbations frequently appeared at regular pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods; but though the cure was often attempted by the bark, it did not in general ſucceed.</p>
            <p>I muſt begin with acknowledging, that I ſhall not be able to give a complete or accurate hiſtory of the progreſs and final termination of this ſpecies of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery, into which the intermitting fever is ſo much diſpoſed to degenerate; as I ſhall likewiſe only have it in my power to mention the general methods of cure, which were purſued in the earlier ſtages of the diſeaſe. Where it was found that a cure could not be accompliſhed in a reaſonable time in the field or regimental hoſpital, dyſenteric patients were generally removed to places where they could meet with better accommodation; ſo that the diſeaſe in its latter ſtages has ſeldomer fallen under my obſervation.</p>
            <p>I muſt obſerve in the firſt place, that this ſpecies of dyſentery had no right to be conſidered as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious diſeaſe. It appeared in fact to be no more than an intermitting fever, which, from ſome cauſe or other excited its principal force on the alimentary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Remiſſions and exacerbations were generally
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:028890_0226_0FDE5F42433E46C8"/>
obſervable in the one diſeaſe, as well as in the other in the earlier ſtages; yet theſe appearances became gradually leſs and leſs remarkable, and there appeared at laſt marks of permanent affection of the inteſtines. The ſkin now became dry and harſh, the fleſh waſted, and the bowels were uncommonly irritable, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly where the <hi>prickly heat</hi> had retired from the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; the diſeaſe was now evidently ſupported by the exiſtence of permanent local affection.</p>
            <p>With regard to the cure of this ſpecies of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint I have little to obſerve, which is not generally known. Bark was ſometimes employed to check its courſe; yet I muſt confeſs, that bark alone was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom found to be ſucceſsful. Where there were no marks of an actual inflammatory ſtate of the ſtomach and bowels, it ſucceeded better when joined with aromatics, powder of camomile flowers, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with ſnake root. Laxatives were preſcribed frequently, and ſeemed often to be proper. They were however more uſeful where ſome other thing was joined with them, which had the quality of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining to the ſkin. Opium in various forms was a common remed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and often a uſeful one before there were marks of permanent affection of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines. Ipecacuanha, or ſuch preparations of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as promoted the evacuations by the ſkin, were frequently combined with it. The great object which I purſued in this diſeaſe was to reſtore and ſupport a free perſpiration, to diminiſh the irritability, and to ſtrengthen the tone of the alimentary canal. I was diſpoſed to expect benefit from warm bathing, fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c. but the ſituation in which we were placed did not admit of a trial of them. Exerciſe was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and even ſome degree of exertion. Change of air was ſerviceable in many caſes, well ſeaſoned food in ſome, and wine in others. The above plan was purſued in the beginning of the complaint with tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſucceſs; but if it failed, or could not, from the
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:028890_0227_0FDE5E84AE3AE660"/>
circumſtances of the ſervice, be properly executed, the diſeaſe then loſt the remitting form, the body became lean and exhauſted, the ſtools bloody, with a very irritable ſtate of the bowels. In ſuch caſes there was often ulceration, various degrees of inflammation, or obſtructions in the coats of the inteſtines. Bliſters applied to abdomen or loins, and kept open, were often ſerviceable; medicated glyſters, varied according to the nature and ſeat of the affection, were likewiſe of benefit; and in the latter ſtages I have ſeen much good from the employment of ſtrong aſtringents. In illuſtration of this I ſhall mention the caſe of an officer, who was attacked with this ſpecies of dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, ſoon after the ſiege of Savanna. Every thing, which the medical people of the garriſon could ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt was put into execution, without much benefit. The diſeaſe continued through the whole of the winter without material abatement; the fleſh waſted, the ſkin became dry, with ſuch other ſymptoms as are uſual in this complaint. In the month of March, a perſon of the country recommended the decoction of the bark of a tree, (probably of the ſpecies of the Simarouba,) which appeared to be poſſeſſed of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſhare of aſtringency. It checked the purging and griping inſtantly; ſo that the diſeaſe ceaſed for the ſpace of three weeks. The appetite was good, the ſtools copious, and in ſome degree lienteric. The griping and even purging at laſt returned; the decoction was repeated, but had not the ſame effects. Other aſtringents, the extract of logwood, terra ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponica, &amp;c. checked it for a ſhort time, but no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ground was gained. He died in the month of May.</p>
            <p>Dropſy ſucceeding, and ſometimes alternating with intermitting fever, was not by any means a rare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in America, particularly in ſome ſeaſons, and in ſome ſituations. The ſwellings generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in every part of the body. They were uſually
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:028890_0228_0FDE5F4BAFA4AF90"/>
leucophlegmatic, though I have alſo ſeen ſome inſtances of tympanitis; a diſeaſe which was commonly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to proceed from improper management of the bark.</p>
            <p>With regard to the cure of dropſical complaints, I have little to obſerve which is not generally known. It conſiſted not only in evacuating the water, but in communicating to the ſyſtem ſuch a degree of tone and vigour as reſiſted farther accumulation. With this view exerciſe, and even ſome degree of exertion, was proper: wine, even more ſtimulating liquors, high ſeaſoned food, frictions and warm clothing, were ſerviceable. I ſhould likewiſe have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to expect benefit from ſea bathing; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not venture to ſay, that I have ever made a proper trial of it. Bliſters were alſo uſeful; not only as occaſioning a diſcharge of the waters, but as exciting the action of the vaſcular ſyſtem. Among the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous claſs of diuretics, there is not any one, which has ſo powerful effects as cantharides, in ſubſtance or in tincture; and among the corroborants, I ſhould be inclined to give the preference to chalybeates, colombo root, and Peruvian bark. It may not be improper to mention in this place, that I have ſeen ſome inſtances where a general anaſarca has been completely cured by the accidental ſupervening of convulſions.</p>
            <p>Obſtructions of the abdominal viſcera are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reckoned among the common effects of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fevers. They are frequently attributed to the early or improper uſe of bark; but appear in fact generally to ariſe from the long continuance of the diſeaſe. I cannot add any thing to the manner of treating them that is not known to every one.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIII. A GENERAL REVIEW OF THE PRACTICE OF PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEDING AUTHORS IN FEBRILE DISEASES.</head>
            <p>HAVING deſcribed the method of cure, which I followed in the remitting fever of Jamaica, the yellow fever and intermitting fever of America; it will not, I hope, be deemed ſuperfluous to give a ſhort ſketch of the general principles, which have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the practice of phyſicians in febrile diſeaſes, from the days of Hippocrates, till the preſent times; a ſubject of which I have not yet ſeen a connected view. There is reaſon to believe that the ſcience of medicine made conſiderable progreſs in different parts of the world, particularly in Egypt, at an early period; but diſtinct records of the art, prior to the age of Hippocrates, are either loſt, or ſo blended with the writings which are aſſigned to that author, that we do not know how to diſtinguiſh them. The practice of Hippocrates in fevers, has been accuſed of being feeble and inert; and it is certain, that many of the moſt effectual remedies of modern times, were unknown to that venerable phyſician; yet if we take the pains to eſtimate candidly the whole mode of proceeding, we ſhall be forced to acknowledge, that its effects were leſs inactive than has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally imagined. The mode of treatment adopted by the Coan Sage, ſeems not only to have done evident good, but ſometimes to have actually cut ſhort the courſe of the diſeaſe. Sweating at an early period, the moſt effectual means we yet know of cutting off the courſe of fevers, was employed frequently by this author; and though antimonials were then unknown, yet ſweat, excited by a ſimpler proceſs, was often obſerved to produce very deciſive effects. Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:028890_0230_0FDE5F5238D2E7D0"/>
indeed, has been leſs circumſtantial in the detail of remedies than we could have wiſhed. He has however related the dietetic part very diſtinctly. His rules are always judicious, and his regimen ſometimes of ſuch efficacy, as evidently to operate very conſiderable changes in the ſtate of the ſyſtem. It appears frequently to have been his aim to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to exterminate the fever in its early periods, or to endeavour to cut ſhort its courſe abruptly, by direct or indirect oppoſition to its proximate cauſe: yet this idea was not purſued beyond a certain point. After the fourth day had paſſed, Hippocrates uſually contented himſelf with ſupporting the general powers of life with proper diet and nouriſhment, allowing nature after that period to perform the work her own way: in other words, to complete the buſineſs by the ſlower operations of coction and criſis. Theſe two views, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the attempts to cut ſhort the diſeaſe abruptly in its beginning; or in the late periods, the endeavours to ſupport the powers of life, till the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural termination might arrive, comprehend the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules of practice followed by this celebrated phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician: and I much doubt if the moderns, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their pretenſions, have actually diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered any other indications more deciſive, though I willingly allow, that they have made great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the mode of executing thoſe I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. At leaſt, I acknowledge for my own part, that I am not yet acquainted with any mode of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which the natural courſe of a continued, or even obſcurely remitting fever can certainly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, after the firſt days of the diſeaſe are paſt;—that is, after a diſtinct formation of the type; before that happened, the ſweating proceſs is frequently ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. But though the attempt to cut ſhort the diſeaſe in its beginning, or to ſupport the powers of life in the later periods, comprehend this author's general rule of practice; yet we find conſiderable
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:028890_0231_0FDE5E929283DA58"/>
diverſity in the manner of accompliſhing theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent purpoſes. The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or an attempt to counteract the derangements of morbid cauſes, may be conſidered as the firſt general maxim, which was eſtabliſhed in the cure of diſeaſes. Hippocrates has this maxim conſtantly in his eye, and endeavours by various means, according to a ſuppoſed diverſity in the mode of action, to cut off the immediate exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of fever. In this manner the preſence of heat and bile, or the ſuppoſition of obſtructed perſpiration, have ſeverally furniſhed him with different indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. His ideas however are not preciſe; ſo that his practice frequently fluctuates between conjecture and experiment. If the diſeaſe does not yield to one mode of treatment in a given time, he frequently paſſes to its oppoſite much at random.</p>
            <p>The doctrines of Hippocrates acquired ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral credit, in every part of the world where they were known, that we do not remark any material innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the cure of fevers, till the time of Eraſiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus; a ſpace of near two hundred years. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening period, indeed, was diſtinguiſhed by philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who employed their time in inveſtigating the ſtructure and economy of the human frame, as well as by phyſicians, who improved the art of medicine by the invention of new remedies. Plato, Ariſtotle and Theophraſtus were the moſt eminent of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; Petro is chiefly diſtinguiſhed among the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. (1) This author, as we find recorded both by Celſus and Galen, attempted to extinguiſh a fever by copious drenching with cold water; ſoon after which, he nouriſhed his patient with wine and ſtrong foods, a cuſtom which was in ſome degree imitated by Clophantus. Hints, however, of the firſt of thoſe practices are found in the writings of Hippocrates, ſo that we may juſtly conſider Eraſiſtratus, as the firſt who departed ſo far from the principles of the Coan Sage, or who arrived at ſo high reputation, as to be
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:028890_0232_0FDE5F582D8361E8"/>
regarded by poſterity as the author of a new method of curing diſeaſes. I mentioned in a former part of this treatiſe, the opinion which Eraſiſtratus enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained concerning the cauſe of fevers. All that we know of his practice may be compriſed in a few words. Eraſiſtratus was every where the inveterate enemy of bleeding. He was likewiſe the author of a certain plan of abſtinence, which, with a little modification from Aſclepiades and Themiſon, made a conſpicuous figure in the annals of phyſic for ſeveral ſucceeding ages.</p>
            <p>Herophilus, who lived much about the ſame time with Eraſiſtratus, acquired alſo high reputation in the medical world; but unfortunately we have it not in our power to give a particular detail of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries. Soon after the period I have mentioned, the ſcience of medicine was divided into three diſtinct branches; <abbr>viz.</abbr> as the art is employed to remove diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes by diet, by drugs, or by manual operation. Serapion likewiſe, who is conſidered as the author of the empiric ſect, made his appearance not long after this diviſion of the profeſſion into ſeparate branches. His followers were numerous, and many of them were reſpectable; but we are not enabled to give a diſtinct account of their practice on the ſubject of fevers. The ſummary views of Celſus and Pliny, or the accidental fragments in the volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous works of Galen, furniſh only imperfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Contentions, however, ran high between dogmatics and empirics, the former of whom were chiefly guided by reaſonings, as the latter truſted ſolely to experience.</p>
            <p>The Greeks, for many ages, were the only people we are acquainted with, who cultivated the ſciences with induſtry. For near five hundred years they were almoſt excluſively the profeſſors of the healing art. The Romans were cautious of admitting the refinements of learning into their ſtate; and had
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:028890_0233_0FDE5E99AF0BEE18"/>
nearly attained the height of their glory, before they willingly received phyſicians into their city. Aſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piades the Bithynian, the contemporary and friend of Pompey and Cicero, appears to be the firſt, who practiſed medicine at Rome with any degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. This author left his native country, with the deſign of inſtructing the Roman youth in the arts of eloquence; an acquirement, which was held in high eſtimation among that warlike people; but not ſucceeding in this purſuit, according to his wiſhes, he ſoon diſcovered, that the profeſſion of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine offered a fair opening for the exerciſe of his talents. The ſtate of the art, indeed, was then pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly propitious to his undertaking; the former ſame of Hippocrates being divided between Eraſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratus and Herophilus, and ſome authors of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piric ſect. Aſclepiades was two diſcerning not to perceive, that new doctrines could not fail of drawing followers, and too enterprizing not to attempt to carry this purpoſe into execution. He probably, in the firſt place, read over all that had been written by former phyſicians; the moſt eſſential parts of which, he ſelected with a good deal of art, and ſo modified as to form a ſyſtem, which appeared to be complete, and which exhibited upon the whole, conſiderable appearances of novelty. If we take the pains to trace his opinions to their ſources, we ſhall find that Democrites or Epicurus furniſhed him with his phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, that Herodicus ſupplied him with the hints of bathing, friction, and geſtation, that the plan of abſtinence, or faſting for three days, was learnt from Eraſiſtratus; and that Petro and Cleophantus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him in the practice of giving cold water, and of allowing greater indulgence in the uſe of wine.—But though the authors I have mentioned furniſhed Aſclepiades with the hints of his doctrines and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; yet we may obſerve, that he has always mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled theſe after his own faſhion, and carried them
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:028890_0234_0FDE5F5DB1618E48"/>
farther than had ever been done by their original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors. It was remarked above, that the profeſſion of medicine was divided into different ſects before the time of Aſclepiades; yet, as far as we can judge from the imperfect information which has been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us, this author was the firſt, who deſerves the name of an active phyſician. Previous to the time of this enterprizing Bythynian, medical men truſted the cure of fevers chiefly to the efforts of nature; and were only ſolicitous about the mode of death. Aſclepiades, aſſuming a bolder principle, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to cut ſhort the fever in the midſt of its courſe: and it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that by ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſuddenly from the extremes of torture to the higheſt gratification of the appetites, ſuch changes were effected in the ſtate of the ſyſtem, as probably ſometimes accompliſhed the purpoſe. Such were the general views of this author. It may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to add a few remarks on ſome of the remedies which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e employed.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to ſix the date, when friction and warm bathing were firſt numbered among the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the phyſicians. They appear, however, from the teſtimony of Celſus, to have been uſed with caution by the ancients. Aſclepiades not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in them with freedom, but ſo conducted the management of bathing, that it might be juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a luxury of the higheſt elegance. Geſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, another of the gymnaſtic remedies employed by this author, even in an early period of ardent fever, is an experiment of a ſtill bolder and more deſperate kind; and ſuch as ſucceeding writers with one voice ſeem to have condemned:—perhaps without examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or fair trial. I am ſenſible that the opinion, which I am to offer on this ſubject, is not likely to meet with general approbation; but the opportunity which I enjoyed, during the late war, of ſerving with a regiment, which was almoſt conſtantly in the
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:028890_0235_0FDE5EA06DAB44D8"/>
field, enables me to confirm the truth of it by ample experience. The good effects of geſtation or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, even in awkward conveyances, were very obvious in almoſt every ſtage and ſituation of the ardent bilious fever; but I ſhall relate ſome inſtances of its ſucceſs, which appear to preclude all poſſibility of doubt. At Ebenezer in Georgia, at a ſeaſon, when the thermometer, in the cooleſt part of the houſe, often ſtood at ninety-ſix, and even ſometimes roſe above it, I was ſeized with the ardent bilious fever, which at that time made dreadful ravage among the troops. For ſix or ſeven days I did not once ſhut my eyes; my thirſt was great, yet every ſort of liquid, which I could procure, was nauſeous; the diſtinction of paroxyſm and remiſſion was no longer perceivable; the pulſe, at the wriſt, was neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly frequent nor ſtrong; but the pulſation of the deſcending aorta was ſo great, as to ſhake the whole frame; anxiety and reſtleſsneſs were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable: in ſhort, the torment was ſo exceſſive, that human nature could ſcarcely ſuffer more. The ſituation was precarious; and without much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion I indulged the deſire of being carried to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanna; though the diſtance was not leſs than twenty-five miles. An open carriage, the only conveyance which the country afforded, was provided for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and I was put into it, in a very feeble and diſtreſſed condition. Fortunately the day was cloudy, and cooler than ordinary. The roads were likewiſe ſoft and ſandy. Though the carriage was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, the motion was no ways unpleaſant; and I had not travelled two miles before I felt a wonderful increaſe of vigour. It rained heavily about half way, and before I reached Savanna, I was drenched to the ſkin. The effects which might have been expected, did not follow. Inſtead of being hurt, I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizingly benefited. I walked into the houſe with ſtrength and firmneſs, eat ſomething without diſlike,
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:028890_0236_0FDE5F645C251400"/>
and ſlept ſound the following night; in ſhort, obtained a perfect remiſſion of the fever. This is a ſtrong inſtance of the good effects of travelling in fevers; yet it is only a ſolitary one. I ſhall add another, which places the fact on a ſtill firmer baſis. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in a former part of this treatiſe, that while the 71ſt regiment lay at the Cheraws, the endemic of the country prevailed among the men in a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual degree. The diſeaſe was often without diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of paroxyſm and remiſſion; the anxiety and reſtleſsneſs were intolerable, bilious vomitings and purgings were frequent, and exceſſive. While near two hundred men were in this ſituation, an order arrived for abandoning the poſt. It being impoſſible, as we were ſituated, to provide waggons to tranſport ſo great a number of ſick, about forty of thoſe who were leaſt likely to be ſoon fit for ſervice were ſent down the river in boats. Of the particular fate of this party I cannot ſpeak with certainty; but I have the ſatisfaction to add, that not a man died of thoſe who retired to Camden by land; aud that after the third day, ſcarcely a fever was left, which had not aſſumed a regular intermitting form. This appears at firſt ſight almoſt an incontrovertible proof of the ſalutary effects of geſtation; but I muſt not at the ſame time omit to mention, that benefit alſo probably reſulted from a change, which accidentally happened in the ſtate of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> weather. The weather, (which, during the time we remained at the Cheraws was uncommonly hot,) became unexpectedly cool after the march was begun; together with rain, from which the ſick men had nothing to ſhelter themſelves. This inſtance of expoſure to rain furniſhes a proof of a fact of much importance. It is generally believed that getting wet with rain is hurtful to a perſon in health. It is no leſs commonly ſuppoſed to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly pernicious in ſickneſs; but the contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be ſometimes the caſe. I have ſeen the happieſt effects from the application of cold, even
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:028890_0237_0FDE5EA69D11AE50"/>
from getting accidentally wet with rain in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, beſides the preſent. Increaſe of tone and vigour was generally the conſequence; and life was evidently protracted, ſometimes perhaps ſaved, by accidents, or modes of treatment, which, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of mankind, would have been reckoned the cauſes of death.—But though I have mentioned the accidental good effects of geſtation, and even of expoſure to rain in different ſtates of the ardent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; I ſhall not be ſo paradoxical, as to recommend ſuch experiments in common practice. I muſt how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be allowed to obſerve, that we have little cauſe to be afraid of their pernicious effects. Motion and travelling, as far as my experience goes, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly hurtful in caſes of local pain and inflammation; or in derangement of intellect; but, on the contrary, conſtantly ſerviceable in anxiety and reſtleſsneſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the ſtate of the ſtomach; as alſo in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the biliary ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>I mentioned before, that Aſclepiades practiſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine at Rome with great reputation. He propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated his doctrines with a good deal of ſucceſs; but ſuch is, and ever has been the fate of our conjectural art, that no ſyſtem has yet preſerved its credit undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed for any length of time. The views of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, with regard to diſeaſes, had hitherto been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and complex; even fevers had been often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, by the ſame perſon, as depending on differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſes. Themiſon, a pupil of Aſclepiades, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to remedy the perplexity which neceſſarily ariſes from this inſtability of arbitrary conjecture; and endeavoured to reduce all the diſorders, to which the human body is liable, to two general claſſes;—<abbr>viz.</abbr> to thoſe which ariſe from an increaſed degree of ſtricture, or its oppoſite affection, preternatural laxity; to which he afterwards ſubjoined ſome complaints, which appeared to partake of the nature of both.—The idea of ſimplifying diſeaſes did not probably ariſe
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:028890_0238_0FDE5F696DAFBD60"/>
in the mind of Themiſon, till the latter period of his life; on which account, perhaps, the doctrines were left in ſome meaſure unfiniſhed; and it is to Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, who lived in the time of Nero, that we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for completing the methodic ſyſtem, and for enlarging the bounds of its ſame. Soranus likewiſe added to its credit. It is a misfortune, which we muſt regret, that except Coelius Aurelianus, there is not one of the many authors who were attached to the tenets of this ſect, whoſe works have eſcaped the wreck of accident or time. This only remaining author appears to have copied, by his own confeſſion, almoſt literally from Soranus.</p>
            <p>It does not belong to this place to enter deeply into the tenets of the ſect, with regard to diſeaſes in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but leads to views of ſome importance in the theory and treatment of many diſorders. It proceeds on the ſuppoſition of circulation in all parts of the body; and with a little latitude may be ſuppoſed to comprehend the affections of the animated ſolid or contractile fibre. Fever is conſidered by the writers of this ſyſtem, as a diſeaſe of the claſs of ſtricture; and if we had authority to add ſpaſmodic, we might believe the methodics had diſcovered a very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant phenomenon in the hiſtory of febrile diſeaſes.—But this ſome may think is granting them too much. If we take the trouble to trace their doctrine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the cauſe of fever, to its ſource, we ſhall find that the hints of it are furniſhed expreſsly by Aſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piades, who perhaps borrowed his ideas on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from Eraſiſtratus, or even from Hippocrates.—But as ſtricture, aſſigned by the writers of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodic ſect as the cauſe of fever, is not perhaps radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally different from the obſtruction of preceding au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; ſo we do not find much material difference in their manner of conducting the cure. The followers of Hippocrates, Eraſiſtratus and Themiſon proceeded equally on the idea of reſtoring permeability in the
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:028890_0239_0FDE5EAC4D59F800"/>
minuter canals of the ſyſtem; a purpoſe which they conceived would be beſt affected by certain proceſſes of attenuation and relaxation. Thus Hippocrates diluted plentifully, and gave nouriſhment only ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, during the firſt days of a fever. Eraſiſtratus enjoined a general abſtinence, Aſclepiades preſcribed a term for the duration of the abſtinence; while The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſon limited it ſo rigidly to the ſpace of three days, that the practice was diſtinguiſhed by the name of diatriton, as its followers were known by that of dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritarii. This idea of diatri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on conſtituted an object of much importance in the ſyſtem of the methodic phyſicians. It directed all their movements, and is the only view, which can properly be called their own. The mode of application of the remedies of preceding authors was occaſionally modified by this ſect; but except that which I have juſt mentioned, we do not diſcover much that is fundamentally new.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper in this place to take notice of the practice of cold bathing in fevers, which was introduced at Rome in the infancy of the methodic ſect; and which afterwards acquired great celebrity in different parts of the world. The Emperor Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, who for the greateſt part of his life was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with ill health, was at laſt attacked with a complaint of ſo obſtinate a kind, that the uſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications did not afford him any relief. Warm bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and all that train of remedies had been tried in vain. The Emperor was ſenſible of his deſperate ſituation; and his phyſician Antoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Muſa, baffled in all his attempts, ventured, though apparently at great hazard, to preſcribe the cold bath. The health of Auguſtus was unexpectedly reſtored by it; and the phyſician was highly honoured, and amply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. It is a misfortune that we do not know the ſpecific nature of the diſeaſe, under which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror laboured; but we have reaſon to conclude, from the circumſtances which attended the cure, that it
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:028890_0240_0FDE5F7046778098"/>
was a fever of a bilious remitting kind; perhaps com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with catarrhal affection, and waſting of the body. But though the ſucceſs of cold bathing, in the inſtance I have mentioned, was much greater than expectation; yet the remedy did not long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>retain its credit. It was ſoon afterwards employed in the caſe of Marcellus, a youth of great hopes, and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heir to the empire; but the event proving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, it fell ſuddenly into diſrepute,—probably without ſufficient cauſe. We find however that Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, in leſs than half a century, afterwards ventured to recommend it in a certain ſpecies of the flow or hectic fever; though Charmes, a phyſician of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles, appears actually to be the firſt who rendered the uſe of the remedy general. Galen employed it frequently with great freedom and boldneſs. The Arabians, particularly in peſtilential diſeaſes, went ſtill farther than the Greeks or Romans; and we preſume, from the fact recorded by Buſbequius, that it was ſometimes preſcribed at Conſtantinople, even ſo late as the ſixteenth century. I do not know that it has been often tried in Europe, ſince the revival of the medical ſciences in the Weſt. I mentioned in a former part of this treatiſe, that I had employed it frequently in the fevers of Jamaica; I now add, that I have ventured upon it in the fevers of this country with ſo great ſucceſs, that I ſhould expect the moſt beneficial effects might reſult from a proper manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. (2)</p>
            <p>We are indebted to Celſus, who lived in the time of Tiberius, for preſerving many of the opinions and practices of preceding phyſicians, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would probably have been loſt. This author, not leſs remarkable for candour, than for the elegance and perſpicuity of his manner of writing, does not ſeem to have been blindly devoted to the tenets of any particular ſect. He has favoured us with valuable extracts from the works of the moſt celebrated dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics;
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:028890_0241_0FDE5EB366A37AC0"/>
he has likewiſe taken notice of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable opinions and practices of the Empirics, without omitting to mention the innovations of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clepiades and Themiſon. With regard to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular merit as a phyſician, we may obſerve that he every where diſcovers an excellent judgment, and that his practice is generally decided without being raſh.</p>
            <p>So great have been the ravages of time or accident among the writings of the early phyſicians, that it is ſcarcely poſſible altogether to avoid error in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to trace the various revolutions in medical practice, prior to the time of Galen. From that downwards we are enabled to give a more certain and better connected view of the ſubject; there being few of the principal writers of this latter period, who have not been preſerved entire. When Galen came firſt to Rome, which was in the time of the Emperor Antoninus, the practice of medicine was chiefly in the hands of the followers of the methodic ſyſtem. The practice of diatriton, or abſtinence for three days was then in high faſhion, not only with the profeſſed pupils of Theſſalus, but even with the few remaining adherents of Eraſiſtratus. Galen every where declares himſelf its inveterate enemy; and often tranſgreſſes the bounds of liberality and decency, in his attempts to turn it into ridicule. His own endeavours are expreſsly exerted to revive and eſtabliſh the principles of Hippocrates; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete thoſe parts, which the want of time or the want of experience of his maſter had left imperfect. He poſſeſſed uncommon fertility of genius, a great flow of language, and a judgment by no means deficient; yet, from a ſophiſtical ſpirit of philoſophizing, he frequently ſo entangled his opinions with theoretical diſtinctions, that his views are often uncertain, and ſometimes embarraſſing. The principle with which he ſets out is directly to oppoſe the actual exiſtence
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:028890_0242_0FDE5F76F10BBD88"/>
of fever; he next recommends to remove, at leaſt to avoid an increaſe of thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which give riſe to the diſeaſe. Theſe ideas are drawn from the writings of Hippocrates, and are ſuch as no perſon will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: but, as the cauſes of fever are ſuppoſed, both by Hippocrates and Galen, to be many and various, ſo the indications of cure often require to be executed in different, and ſometimes in directly oppoſite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. This neceſſarily gives riſe to confuſion; and entangles the practitioner in the mazes of doubt and conjecture; to obviate which, as much as poſſible, the learned commentator of Hippocrates has thought fit to divide fevers into three general kinds, <abbr>viz.</abbr> ephemeral, continued, and hectic or habitual; the cauſes of which he ſuppoſes to be ſo little analogous to one another, as to demand particular management in the method of cure.</p>
            <p>We look in vain for new views, or material im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in the management of fevers, in the writings of thoſe Greek phyſicians who followed Galen. Oribaſius profeſſedly is no more than a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of the opinions and practices of other men; and Aetius, on the preſent ſubject, does not aſpire to much higher fame. There are, indeed, few of his obſervations, which may not be found in the volumes of Galen, or ſome preceding writer; yet he ſeems generally to have comprehended what he wrote. He digeſted the knowledge which he found in books with care and judgment; and gives an arrangement ſo clear and perſpicuous, that the perſon may derive information from Aetius, who would be overwhelmed and loſt in the prolixity of Galen's diſcuſſions.</p>
            <p>From thoſe writers, however, who trod implicitly in the footſteps of Galen, we muſt be allowed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Alexander of Tralle, a phyſician who lived in the ſixth century. This author wrote his book on fevers at a very advanced age; and though the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe perhaps does not contain many ideas, which may
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:028890_0243_0FDE5EBA830D8268"/>
not, in ſome ſhape or other, be found in the writings of his predeceſſors, yet the obſervations have the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance every where of having originally ariſen from actual experience. The language, which is conciſe, clear and perſpicuous, is wholly his own. The am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous circumſtances of diſeaſes are more accurately diſcriminated than in any preceding work which has deſcended to the preſent times; and though the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of accounting for things may be ſometimes erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, yet it has had little influence on the practical indications, which are almoſt unexceptionably judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. As Alexander of Tralle wrote at a time of life when fame muſt have been indifferent to him, and to a friend, whom he was more ſolicitous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct than to amuſe with the ſplendour and variety of his learning, we have an additional cauſe to give our confidence to his obſervations. His manner is candid and ingenious; and the treatiſe before us may be conſidered by the practical phyſician, as the moſt valuable of the remains of the ancients. Judicious cautions are every where interſperſed, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able changes in the management of remedies are ſometimes attempted; but the practice of giving opiates in a certain ſtate of fever is the only practice of this author, which has any title to be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation.</p>
            <p>Paulus is the next phyſician of note, who lived after the days of Galen. He was born in the iſland of Aegina, and travelled over many countries. It is probable that he was ſufficiently acquainted with every diſcovery, which had been made by his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; yet Galen, on the ſubject of fever, is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor whoſe works he has principally followed. His book on fevers, indeed, contains all the material doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and obſervations of that voluminous writer; and thoſe who dread the labour of encountering the prolix and ſophiſtical diſquiſitions of the commentator of Hippocrates, may find a very diſtinct analyſis
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:028890_0244_0FDE5F7C5E269120"/>
of his opinions and practices in the treatiſe of Paulus A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having endeavoured in the preceding pages to give a ſhort view of the methods which were uſually pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the moſt eminent of the Greek phyſicians, in the cure of fevers, it will be neceſſary in the next place to take ſome notice of the improvements of their immediate ſucceſſors, the Arabians. This taſk will be ſoon performed; the Arabians have not in reality opened any views in the curative indications of febrile diſeaſes, which were unknown to their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; or which require that we ſhould ſpend long time in endeavouring to explain them. The medical ſcience evidently drew its origin from the Eaſt; yet it was alſo ſoon reconveyed to the countries from whence it ſprung, with improvements and additions from the genius of the Greeks. We learn from Herodotus, that Democedes, a native of Crotone, who had ſtudied medicine in the iſland of Aegina, far excelled all the phyſicians of the Perſian court, even ſo early as the time of the firſt Darius; though the court of this Prince probably could boaſt of all the ſkill, both of Aſſyria and of Egypt. Cleſias ſometime after was held in great eſtimation by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes; and the invitation, which was held out to Hippocrates by the Perſian monarch, indicates very clearly, that the Greeks, even then, were more famed for medical ſkill than the inhabitants of the Eaſtern countries. The iſlands and ſhores of the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean ſeem through the whole hiſtory of medicine, to have produced the greateſt number of phyſicians. Crotone and Cyrene were famous for ſeveral ages: and Alexandria, at a later period, roſe into great cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity. Students flocked to it from every part of the world; it was even neceſſary that every one, who aſpired to wealth or reputation in phyſic, ſhould ſpend ſome time in this celebrated ſeminary. It was owing perhaps, in ſome degree, to the vicinity of
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:028890_0245_0FDE5EC09D2CFA98"/>
this illuſtrious ſchool, that the province of Syria en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at one time, a conſiderable ſhare of learning and learned men. The works of the moſt eminent of the Greek phyſicians were tranſlated into the dialect of the Syrian country, in the ſeventh and eighth centuries; by which means they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, in ſome meaſure, propagated in the Eaſt: though we alſo are informed by Abulpharage, an Arabic writer, who had preſerved many curious anecdotes of private hiſtory, that the doctrines of Hippocrates were planted in the Choraſan, at a ſtill earlier age, by the phyſicians, who followed in the train of Aurelian's daughter, who was married to Sapores king of Perſia: nor is it improbable, that theſe doctrines were ſtill more generally diffuſed through the Perſian dominions, by the alliances of friendſhip, as well as by the long wars, which were afterwards carried on between the Greek empire and the celebrated Khorrou Pawiz. But though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Syria and Irak were an enlightened na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at an early period; their neighbours, the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, who afterwards attained ſo great a name in ſcience no leſs than in war, remained long in a ſtate of illiterate ignorance. Before the eſtabliſhment of iſlamiſm, there ſcarcely was a native Arab, who could either write or read. The little genius they poſſeſſed was chiefly exerted in compoſing verſes, or in colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rhetorical harangue. They appear, indeed, to have acquired ſome practical knowledge of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heavenly bodies; and it is likewiſe reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that they had the ſame ſkill in medicine, as is common to ſavage nations; but there is no reaſon to believe, that they, as yet, had made progreſs in the medical art, conſidered in a ſcientific view. Hareth, a native of Tayef, who lived in the time of the prophet, and who ſeems to have been in habits of intimacy with that ſingular man, is the firſt of the Arabs, whoſe name is recorded among the
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:028890_0246_0FDE5F8219FDEA58"/>
phyſicians of the Eaſt. This perſon, who acquired ſome knowledge of medicine at Niſabour, and other places in the Choraſan, returned home after ſome time, with great wealth, and no ſmall ſhare of fame. He practiſed among his countrymen with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; but how far he ſpread the light of ſcience among them is uncertain. The Saracens advanced rapidly in conqueſts and the eſtabliſhment of their faith; but we do not hear any thing of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the healing art, till the ninth century. Syrians and Perſians, generally of the Jewiſh or Chriſtian religion, laboured ſometimes for the warlike Arabs in the ſervile occupation of curing diſeaſes, at leaſt we do not know that any of the Saracens attained much eminence in medical ſcience, till the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Honain and his pupils laid open to them the treaſures of the Greeks. We are ill qualified at this period to judge of the merit of theſe tranſlations. But if we may be allowed to form concluſions, from the uſe which has been made of them, we ſhall not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be diſpoſed to entertain a very high opinion of their accuracy. In many inſtances, the later Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian phyſicians have expreſſed the ideas of Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates and Galen only very looſely; and in ſome few caſes, perhaps, have not very clearly comprehended their meaning. But, as the later Saracens were ſeldom ſkilled in any language except their own; the original tranſlators are probably alone blameable for the whole of theſe miſtakes.</p>
            <p>The medical authors, who wrote in the Arabic language between the ninth and fifteenth centuries, and, who ſtill lie concealed in the leſs acceſſible dreſs of their native country, are almoſt innumerable: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are thoſe, who have been introduced into the common acquaintance of Europeans few in number, or ſmall in volume. If I poſſeſſed a complete ſeries, even of thoſe who are commonly known in Europe, the examination I have entered upon might be drawn
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:028890_0247_0FDE5F87A7F6AAC8"/>
out to a conſiderable length; but as I have no hopes of obtaining that ſoon, I ſhall content myſelf with giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome idea of the Arabian ſyſtem of practice in fevers, from the works of Avicenna, the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and beſt known of the Oriental phyſicians. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, indeed, of one of the writers of this nation may, in a great meaſure, render an inquiry into the others unneceſſary. Thoſe, at leaſt whom I have ſeen, do not differ materially from one another; or perhaps eſſentially from the Greeks who went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. The canon medicine, the principal work of Avicenna, exhibits a ſyſtematic view of the whole art of medicine, theoretical as well as practical. I have read over with care all that relates to fevers; and though there is little, perhaps which may not ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately be traced to Galen or Hippocrates; yet the author has not copied ſervilely from either of them. He is more full and particular than the one; leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix and tedious than the other. I muſt however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the diſtinctions and diviſions, which he has attempted to introduce into the hiſtory of fevers, are not only unneceſſary, but actually ſerve to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs the indications of cure. His general theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are thoſe of Galen. In the general conduct of the cure, he treads in the footſteps of the ſame maſter. He appears, indeed, to be more fearful of the lancet; while he is not perhaps always judicious, or conſiſtent with himſelf, in the manner of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. On the contrary he has admitted cool air ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more freely, and has perhaps carried cold drink even to a bolder length, than had been done by the Greeks. Cool air, cold drink, and even the external application of cold, may be reckoned among the moſt effectual remedies in the fevers of hot climates; and this author has conducted the management of them, in a luxurious, elegant and efficacious manner. But though the works of Avicenna furniſh a general view of the practice of the Arabian ſchool of phyſic, it is ſtill in ſome degree a defective one. As he has not
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:028890_0248_0FDE601F7580D2B8"/>
furniſhed us with a detail of the caſe of an individual, we are not able to judge preciſely of his powers of diſcerning the diſeaſe, or of his deciſion in the manner of treating it.</p>
            <p>The medical ſcience, which after the taking of Alexandria was little cultivated by the ſlothful Greeks, or barbarous nations of the Weſt, ſprung up with new vigour in the province of Syria, in Irak and Arabia; and followed every where in the train of the Saracen conquerors. Extending with their arms over the northern coaſts of Africa, it ſoon found its way into Spain; and, even ſo early as the eleventh century, was conveyed to Salernum in Italy, by Conſtantinus Africanus, a native of Carthage, who had lived long in Aſia, and who was well acquainted with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and medical knowledge of the Orientals. The Arabians were the firſt who opened the ſources of che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry; they alſo made great improvements in the art of ſurgery, and even deſcribed ſome complaints which in earlier ages were not taken notice of but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted but little from the ſyſtem of the Greeks in the management of febrile diſeaſes. After the fall of the Roman empire the genius of learning made no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion in Europe for a very long period of time. The native European ſlothfully acquieſced in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect knowledge of Arabian writers, which was obtained from the inelegant, and perhaps often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful tranſlations of the Jews, who, for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, were no contemptible profeſſors of the medical art. But, though ſome part of the knowledge of the Arabian phyſicians was communicated, in this manner to the nations of the Weſt, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries; yet a part of the ſixteenth paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over, before it was poſſible to trace any marks of improvement. Commentaries were written without number; but, for many years, there ſcarcely was an individual in all the ſeminaries of Europe who dared to think for himſelf. It has been cuſtomary to date
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:028890_0249_0FDE5F8ECC3C62A0"/>
the revival of ſciences in the Weſt from the taking of Conſtantinople, by which the ſtores of Greek lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature were in ſome degree opened to the world. The language of Galen began then to be more generally underſtood, and the writings of Avicenna fell rapidly into neglect; yet the advantage which accrued to medicine from the change, does not appear to have been great. The mind was exerciſed in a wider field of learning; but it was ſtill in chains to the authority of the ancients. The opinions of Galen and Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates were copied, recopied and commented upon by hundreds; but there were very few who ventured to uſe any judgment of their own. Among the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated of the followers of Galen we may reckon Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, Foreſtus, Lommius and Senn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtus, men of conſiderable talents, but who were too ſcrupulouſly devoted to the principles of their maſter, to open a new road in the practice of the art. This was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for Paracelſus, who early in the ſixteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury ventured to attack the opinions of his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and the authority of Galen. Paracelſus poſſeſſed a conſummate ſhare of aſſurance, together with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of remedies which were not generally known at that time. He acquired ſome acquaintance with the chemical diſcoveries of the Arabians, in the courſe of his various travels, and applied in practice what he had learned, on his return to his native country. He deſpiſed the authority of the regular phyſicians, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed remedies with great boldneſs, and often with ſingular ſucceſs. This ſucceſs was even very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably exaggerated by report; and there appear to have been many, who followed him implicitly; while others exerted themſelves in modifying and improving his ideas. Under this laſt view we may rank Van Helmont, a perſon, who effected a very material innovation in the manner of curing febrile diſeaſes. Van Helmont poſſeſſed conſiderable learning; but diſcovered, at the ſame time ſuch marks of warmth and enthuſiaſm of
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:028890_0250_0FDE602587ACBCA8"/>
genius, as diminiſhed his credit with contemporary and ſucceeding practitioners. The terms which he employs, are ſometimes ridiculous; and his reaſonings are frequently disfigured with fancy and whim; yet his ideas are generally important, and often well founded. The archaeus of this author does not differ materially from the ſentient principle (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) of Hippocrates; and perhaps comprehends the whole idea of the vis medicatrix naturae of the moderns. Van Helmont proceeds to the cure of fever on the important principle of exciting, or calling forth the powers of life, to exterminate an offending cauſe; ſo that we may actually conſider him as the firſt, after Aſclepiades, who attempted to take the buſineſs wholly out of the hands of nature. He diſregards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of coction and criſis; and makes a decided ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to cut the diſeaſe ſhort at an early period. He is likewiſe an enemy to bleeding, purging, vomiting, and the various evacuations which had been employed by his predeceſſors, attempting to accompliſh his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſolely by the means of ſweat, and inſenſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. The ſucceſs of his practice was ſo great, that he deems the man unworthy the name of phyſician who ſuffers a fever to exceed the fourth day; a degree of ſucceſs, which all the powers of antimony have not yet enabled us to boaſt of.</p>
            <p>The circulation of the blood having been proved inconteſtably about the middle of the laſt century, hopes were reaſonably entertained, that the healing art would be benefited by the diſcovery. It does not however appear that medical men, for ſome time at leaſt, either argued more clearly, or practiſed more ſucceſsfully. The advocates of the galenical and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical ſchools had gradually approached to each other; ſo that the doctrines and practices of thoſe contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties were now inſenſibly blended together. Sometimes the one mode of thinking predominated, ſometimes the other; but chemical principles every
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:028890_0251_0FDE5F954530DF68"/>
where gave ſcope to the imagination, which often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in the wildeſt extravagance of conjecture. Among the number of thoſe conjecturers, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at much eminence and ſame, we may reckon Sylvius de le Bae, who lived in the end of the laſt century, and introduced a conſiderable innovation in the manner of treating fevers. His theories are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known. They appear to be totally deſtitute of foundation; yet unfortunately are the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of all his practical indications. His principal view conſiſts, in regulating the mixtures of bile and pancreatic juice. He likewiſe lays ſo great a ſtreſs upon the nature of the occaſional cauſe, as gives riſe to doubt and ambiguity. Thus he ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes acids, though oftener aromatics, volatiles, and opiates. But as we poſſeſs ſome caſes, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have healed, in the Leyden hoſpital, with all his ſkill and attention, we are enabled with more certainty to form a judgment of the particular merits of his practice. It has not any claim to extraordinary ſucceſs; yet it is evidently innocent of the great harm which ſome later authors have imputed to it. In ſhort, if we except opiates, we may conſider the reſt of his remedies as very feeble and ineffectual.</p>
            <p>During the time that Sylvius flouriſhed in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, a new theory of fevers was offered to the public in England by Dr. Willis, the celebrated author, to whom we are ſo much indebted for bringing into view the importance of the nervous ſyſtem, in the economy of the human frame. It does not however appear, that this writer's theory ever extended far, or that it was the cauſe of much innovation in practice.</p>
            <p>The method of treatment, which was generally adopted in the fevers of England, at the time when Sydenham began to ſtudy medicine, conſiſted prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in bleeeding, in vomiting with antimonials, in evacuating the inteſtinal canal by means of glyſters or gentle laxatives; and, in the latter periods of the
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:028890_0252_0FDE602C64A6C830"/>
diſeaſe, in attempting to raiſe ſweat by hotter alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmics. In the firſt conſtitution of ſeaſons deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by this author, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the years 1661,-62,-63,- and 64, we do not find any material deviation from this general plan of cure; which was the plan fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Willis, and other contemporary phyſicians. In the next conſtitution, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the years 1667, 68 and part of 69, Sydenham forces himſelf on our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by an attempt to effect a very important inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The fever which prevailed during the laſt mentioned years was generally of long duration. It was uſually accompanied with profuſe ſweatings, and often diſtinguiſhed by petechial eruptions. Cordials, and hot regimen were ſometimes obſerved to cut ſhort its courſe abruptly; yet dangerous ſymptoms were ſtill more frequently the conſequence of this ſtimulating mode of treatment, than a favourable ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. The ſagacious Sydenham, inſtructed by repeated experience of the bad effects of this common method of cure, adopted a contrary one; which he purſued with boldneſs, and apparently with great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. It may not be improper to obſerve in this place, that our author is not to be conſidered as the inventor of the antiphlogiſtic method of treating fevers. The ancients, particularly the Arabians, carried the cooling ſyſtem ſtill farther than the moderns. About this time however it had fallen into general neglect; and Sydenham undoubtedly poſſeſſes the merit of reſtoring it; more perhaps from his own obſervation, than from a knowledge of what had been done by his predeceſſors. Part of the year 1669, the years 1670,-1671 and 1672, form another conſtitution of ſeaſons, according to this author's arrangement of diſeaſes. The epidemic aſſumed a different appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the former. It was chiefly diſtinguiſhed by ſymptoms of dyſenteric affection. Our author, however, ſtill adhered to the outlines of the antiphlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtic plan; and treated the diſeaſe ſucceſsfully with
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:028890_0253_0FDE5F9B71778B30"/>
bleeding, and the repeated uſe of laxatives. The method of treatment, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> adopted, admits of a remark. In the former epidemic, the profuſe ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were checked; in the preſent, the inteſtinal evacuations were encouraged; in one caſe he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to promote, in the other to thwart the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature; practices ſo oppoſite that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily reconcile them. The next conſtitution, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the years 1673,-74 and 75 diſcovered a fever with a new train of ſymptoms, and in Sydenham's opinion of a very different race. It was principally diſtinguiſhed by pleuretic and rheumatic affections, by coma and ſtupor. The general antiphlogiſtic practice was ſtill perſiſted in; and the whole of the cure was truſted to diſcretional bleeding, bliſtering the back part of the head and neck, with the repeated employment of glyſters. The hotter diaphoretics were cautiouſly avoided. In the year 1684, this diligent obſerver imagined he diſcovered the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a fever of a perfectly new and unknown kind; a fever accompanied with more or leſs derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of intellect, and many other ſymptoms of ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous affection; the ſpecies of diſeaſe, perhaps, which noſologiſts have diſtinguiſhed by the name of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus. But though this ſpecies of fever was ſuppoſed by our author, to be extremely different in its nature from any that he had yet ſeen, we do not however perceive, that this idea ſuggeſted to him any material difference in the mode of treatment.</p>
            <p>From the ſhort view which has been given of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham's practice in fevers, it is eaſy to perceive the riſe and progreſs of the method of cure which he adopted. Antiphlogiſtic proceſſes were carried to a greater length by the ancients, than the moderns have yet dared to riſk. But there is little reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that Sydenham owed the ideas of the alterations which he introduced to information from preceding writers. His practice bears every where authentic
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:028890_0254_0FDE6032B3E56A68"/>
marks of having ariſen from his own obſervation.—The moſt common termination of fevers, is by ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or increaſed perſpiration; a fault obſerved by Van Helmont, and which furniſhed that author with the idea of proſecuting the cure of the diſeaſe wholly on this plan. The practice ſeems to have been early adopted in many parts of Europe; and it even conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in general reputation in England, at the time that Sydenham began his medical ſtudies. Sweating undoubtedly is often beneficial, and may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, upon the whole, as the moſt certain means of exterminating the cauſe of fevers; yet bad effects of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reſulted from it—then probably more owing to the manner in which it was conducted, than to the real hurtfulneſs of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thing itſelf, viewed in the light of a general remedy. Sydenham, who does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have diſcriminated between the actual effects of ſweating and the effects of the manner of exciting it, condemns the practice in general terms, and paſſes to an oppoſite method of treatment with a good deal of boldneſs. It has ever unfortunately been the fate of phyſic, like every other conjectural art, to paſs from one extreme to its oppoſite by large ſtrides; and thus, even the ſagacious Sydenham, who had ſeen the bad effects of treating remedies in fevers with much of the inflammatory diatheſis, was induced to employ antiphlogiſtic proceſſes in thoſe ſpecies of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which we ſhould be diſpoſed to believe do not well admit of them. The new, or nervous fever, in the opinion of the practitioners of the preſent age, could not well bear the plentiful evacuations preſcribed by this author; at leaſt, we may ſafely affirm, that ſuch evacuations are not by any means neceſſary.—But I ſhall diſmiſs this ſubject with obſerving, that the practice of Sydenham, if we except the article of bleeding, can only be conſidered as feeble, and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inſignificant. His remedies ſometimes, perhaps, obviate the fatal tendency of ſymptoms; but are not
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:028890_0255_0FDE5FA1DDF20BD0"/>
capable of having any decided effects on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> courſe of the diſeaſe. I may likewiſe add, that his practice is directly at war with the principle of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> theory. If fever is conſidered an effort of nature to exterminate ſomething hurtful from the conſtitution, bleeding and thoſe evacuations, which diminiſh the powers of life, are not the proper means of effecting this purpoſe. But the truth is, the practice of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham was his own; his theory was that of the times in which he lived, formed from a mixture of the doctrines of Van Helmont, Campanella and Dr. Willis.</p>
            <p>It may not be ſuſpected, perhaps, from the remarks which I have made on the practice of Sydenham in fevers, that I do not conſider him as the author of ſo much eſſential improvement, as has been generally imagined. I muſt however acknowledge, that he deſerves the higheſt praiſe for the accurate and well diſcriminated hiſtory of acute diſeaſes, which he has left us. The deſcriptions are complete, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſo peculiarly choſen, that the diſeaſe itſelf is actually before the eyes of the reader.

               </gap> the great, and as yet the unrivalled excellencies of Sydenham; but in admitting ſuch eſſential differences in the cauſe of epidemics as he has done, he neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily leads us to embarraſſment, and often leaves the practitioner in a ſtate of uncertainty. The diſeaſe deſcribed by Sydenham, in the various conſtitutions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſeaſons between the years 1661 and 1685, ſhews external marks of conſiderable diverſity; yet I muſt confeſs, that I ſee but little reaſon for ſuppoſing, that theſe appearances ariſe from cauſes which are totally and fundamently diſtinct. The fever of Sydenham, in all its forms, is in fact the common endemic of England. Circumſtances however often aroſe then, and ſtill ariſe, which modify the general cauſe in ſuch a manner, that the diſeaſe appears <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

ſymptoms of nervous affection, and at another, with a general diſpoſition to affections of particular organs. Theſe modifying cauſes, which are more general or particular, more obvious or obſcure, often continue for a certain train of ſeaſons, and influence very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially the character of the reigning epidemic. The general cauſe of the fever is in reality one and the ſame, yet I muſt alſo acknowledge, that the modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are evidently many and various, and often very remotely different from each other.</p>
            <p>Chemical principles for ſome time paſt, had the principal ſhare in enabling medical writers to account for the phenomena in fevers; but about the end of laſt century, the mechanical philoſophy was again revived, and being incorporated with the doctrines of the chemiſts, the laws, and various derangements of the human frame, were then explained on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of hydraulics, or chemical mixture. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors who adopted this mode of reaſoning were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and ſome of them were of great eminence; but at preſent I ſhall only take notice of one of the greateſt of them, the celebrated Boerhaave, who formed a ſyſtem, which was conſidered as the moſt perfect that had hitherto been offered to the public. The doctrines of this author acquired uncommon fame. They ſoon extended over all Europe, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſtill prevail in the greateſt part of it. But though Boerhaave has preſented us with a methodical explanation of the phenomena in fevers; and has detailed the method of cure with clearneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; yet we do not find, that he has furniſhed much that is new and original in practice. He is every where cautious, and in moſt inſtances judicious; though he has committed a principal error in forming indications of cure, from a ſuppoſition of lentor and viſcidity; a cauſe the very exiſtence of which we have every reaſon to doubt.</p>
            <p>During the time that Boerhaave flouriſhed in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> Profeſſor Stahl, at Halle in Saxony, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſome new opinions, which acquired conſiderable fame, and which have been conſidered, in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as forming a peculiar ſyſtem. The leading principle of this author, as is confeſſed by all, admits only of a feeble and inactive practice. I might even add, that it frequently leads to a pernicious one. Thoſe tumults, or ſufferings, which paſs by the name of the efforts of nature, are extremely deceitful; and have obviouſly, in many inſtances, a deſtructive tendency. I mentioned before that they are truſted with danger; yet Stahl, proceeding on this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, boaſts extraordinary ſucceſs in the cure of the petechial fever, which prevailed in moſt parts of Saxony towards the end of laſt century.</p>
            <p>In a review of thoſe authors, who have written on febrile diſeaſes, it would be unjuſt to omit men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning Hoffman, contemporary with Stahl, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor in the ſame univerſity. The actual alterations which this author has introduced into the cure of fevers, are not perhaps very great in themſelves; yet his important diſcoveries, in regard to its theory, entitle him to great conſideration. The moſt of the remedies, which he employed, are found in the writings of his predeceſſors, or contemporaries; yet they were not, perhaps, always preſcribed by them with the ſame intentions. The theory of Hoffman opens a road for the trial of antiſpaſmodics, merely on the footing of antiſpaſmodics; a claſs of remedies of much importance in the cure of febrile diſorders. In practice, Hoffman is more decided than Stahl; and his views, perhaps are more extenſive than thoſe of Boerhaave. He is likewiſe uncommonly candid; and has furniſhed us with a great variety of hiſtories, which ſerve in many caſes to illuſtrate the nature of the diſeaſe.</p>

Bliſtering with cantharides, which had been employed with caution, and which was even ſuſpected of deleterious effects by many, was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into practice in the end of the ſixteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, aad about the beginning of the preſent began to be, as employed, a common remedy in many ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of fever: its good effects were often obvious, and, according to the prevailing mode of reaſoning, were ſuppoſed to ariſe from a quality which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides were believed to poſſeſs, <hi>of attenuating</hi> the blood. This mode of operation is no longer admitted; but the remedy ſtill retains its credit. Few people pretend that bliſters are poſſeſſed of ſpecific powers in ſhortening the courſe of fevers; yet every one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that they obviate many ſymptoms of dangerous tendency, and that they often diſpoſe the diſeaſe to aſſume it proper form. In fevers, accompanied with local affection, their beneficial effects are univerſally acknowledged; and, even in many caſes of general irritability, they often produce very fortunate changes. But I muſt obſerve, with regard to this, that much depends on managment, and the mode of application. In local affections the local application is moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; in caſes accompanied with much general irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, the back part of the head and neck ought, perhaps, to be preferred to others. I have thus fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen in fevers, where there was much general irritability, that bliſters applied to the extremities evidently aggravated the diſeaſe; while I have alſo obſerved, that they as certainly diminiſhed the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and frequency of the pulſe, and diſpoſed the patient to reſt, where they were applied to the back part of the head and neck. There is another remedy that I ſhall take notice of before leaving this ſubject, which poſſeſſes ſtill higher reputation than bliſters.

Antimonial preparations have been employed occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally in fevers for many years paſt; but they did not gain eſtabliſhed credit in this country, till within theſe thirty years. The diſcovery of the famous powder of Dr. James appears to have been the cauſe of a conſiderable innovation, in the manner of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing febrile diſeaſes. The practice of Boerhaave did not go farther than to obviate ſymptoms of fatal tendency; it left the diſeaſe to purſue its own courſe. Dr. James aſſumed a bolder ground, and promiſed to cut ſhort the fever abruptly by means of his powder. There are many who ſtill tread in his footſteps; I acknowledge, as I have hinted before, that their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts may be often ſucceſsful in the early ſtages of the illneſs, or often uſeful towards a critical period. I cannot however believe, that this powder, or any preparation of antimony with which we are yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, poſſeſſes the power of abruptly terminating a fever wherever it is employed; at leaſt, to effect this requires a management of which I confeſs myſelf ignorant. The effects which Dr. James promiſed from his powder, others have attempted to obtain from emetic tartar; but I have reaſon to think with inferior ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The wonderful power, which the Peruvian bark is obſerved to poſſeſs, in ſuſpending the courſe of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents, has led the practitioners of the preſent times to employ it, with the ſame views, in fevers of various denominations. But after what I have ſaid of the uncertainty of its effects in checking the courſe of the remitting fever of Jamaica, it will be needleſs to repeat here, that I do not expect to find it of much efficacy, in ſhortening fevers of a more continued kind. I muſt, however confeſs, that, even in many of theſe, it is a remedy of great value. It ſupports, in a very eminent degree, the tone and vigour of the powers of life.</p>
            <p>Opium has been preſcribed occaſionally in fevers
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:028890_0260_0FDE60452C48DA60"/>
for a long time paſt; but it is only of late years, that it has been recommended, as a general remedy in ſome particular ſpecies of this diſeaſe. The practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of the Weſt Indies, preſcribe opium with more freedom, than is generally done in England. It is frequently employed to mitigate ſymptoms; and in ſome ſituations which were very alarming, I have given it in very large quantity with unexpected good effects. In the flow fevers of this country I have frequently had recourſe to it; and, combined with antimonials and camphire, have found it to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, of great value. Opium in general was more cordial than wine. In caſes of deſpondence and diſtreſs it gave a confidence to the mind, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted a pleaſureableneſs to the ſenſations above all other remedies. In ſhort, it appeared often, not only to be inſtrumental in conducting the diſeaſe to a favourable termination, but it enabled the patient to paſs through it with comfort to himſelf.</p>
            <p>I have mentioned in the preceding pages, the moſt eminent of thoſe authors, who have written on the cure of fevers; giving at the ſame time ſuch extracts from their works, that the reader, who has not the opportunity of conſulting the originals, may be enabled to form ſome idea of the ſucceſſive changes, the improvements, and oftener perhaps the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have ariſen in the method of treating febrile diſeaſes, from the earlieſt records of the art to the preſent times. The apparent changes are more numerous than the real ones; while the moſt oppoſite modes of treatment do not often appear to have much perceptible effect on the event. The cure of fever has been hitherto purſued on two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and oppoſite views, <abbr>viz.</abbr> on the idea of exciting the powers of life, by means of heating and ſtimulating remedies; or of diminiſhing the reaction of the ſyſtem by evacuations and other antiphlogiſtic proceſſes. The above extremes of thoſe directly oppoſite modes
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:028890_0261_0FDE5FB4B02E88A0"/>
of treatment have approached gradually to each other, or been variouſly combined by different practitioners. It cannot however fail of appearing ſtrange to a perſon, who views the ſcience of medicine in a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical light, to hear one ſet of men aſſerting that the proper cure of fever conſiſts in exciting the powers of life, or in enabling nature to expel the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe by force; while another, with no leſs confidence, maintains that the plan of moderating or diminiſhing increaſed action is that which ought alone to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. From ſuch contradictory aſſertions we cannot eaſily avoid concluding, either that the moſt oppoſite means produce the ſame effect, or that nature has a preſcribed mode of proceeding in fevers, which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary medical aſſiſtance is not powerful enough to controul. There are many eminent practitioners, who have been conſcious of this truth. The candid Sydenham himſelf acknowledges, that thoſe, whom he treated with all his ſkill and attention, and who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed all the comforts that affluence could afford, did not often fare better than the poor, who were only ſparingly furniſhed with neceſſaries, and who met with little aſſiſtance from medicine. I have myſelf ſeen many examples of the ſame kind. Sometimes I purſued the uſual methods of cure with care and perſeverance; ſometimes I left the buſineſs almoſt entirely to nature, and I cannot ſay, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the event gives me much cauſe to be vain. But though I may appear to be ſceptical with regard to the effects of common practice, I ſtill cannot help being of opinion, that we may arrive at a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection in the management of febrile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. So ſanguine, indeed, are my expectations, that I cannot eaſily forgive myſelf, when the event of this diſeaſe happens to be unfortunate. The remitting fever of Jamaica is not a diſeaſe by any means devoid of danger; yet I ſhould not be ſatisfied with myſelf, from the view which I now have of the ſubject, if I
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:028890_0262_0FDE604BACB962F8"/>
loſt one patient in fifty. I own indeed that this is a degree of ſucceſs, which neither I, nor perhaps any other man has yet attained. I muſt however add, that I have not always had the liberty of doing what I wiſhed to do; neither have I always dared to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon what I judged not proper to be done. The prejudices of patients in ſome caſes, and the idea of reſponſibility in others, confine us to the beaten track, though we may be conſcious in ourſelves that it never can lead us to our object. If theſe obſtacles, were removed, a man who will act with deciſion, may promiſe almoſt any degree of ſucceſs in the remitting fever of the Weſt-Indies, in conſtitutions which are free from habitual complaints.</p>
            <p>The conſtant fluctuation which has hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the opinions of phyſicians concerning the cauſes of fever, and in their practices with regard to its cure, oblige us to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> doubtfully of the real progreſs of the healing art. Hippocrates was allowed to have practiſed with more ſucceſs than his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. Aſclepiades was believed by many to have been ſtill more fortunate than Hippocrates; yet the road which he purſued was totally different. Galen, who reviewed and improved the ſyſtem of the Coan ſage, roſe to great eminence, and marked out the path of medical practice for many centuries. The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Paracelſus ſhook his authority; and theſe in their turn gave way to newer modes of thinking. In this manner there have been ſuch perpetual revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the modes of treating febrile diſeaſes, that we can ſcarcely avoid concluding, that little or nothing of the matter is yet known with certainty. Medical writers have wandered from conjecture to conjecture, for more than two thouſand years; and we do not yet perceive any proſpect of theſe conjectures being nearer to an end.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX. CONTAINING SOME HINTS WITH REGARD TO THE MEANS OF PRESERVING THE HEALTH OF SOLDIERS SERVING IN HOT CLIMATES.</head>
            <p>HAVING treated pretty fully of the remitting fever of Jamaica, and intermitting fever of America, I ſhall now offer a few thoughts on the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious means of preſerving the health of ſoldiers in warm climates; taking the liberty at the ſame time to ſuggeſt ſome ideas, which might perhaps be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attended to by thoſe who ſuperintend the medical eſtabliſhments of the army.</p>
            <p>The climate of the Weſt-Indies has been fatal to the European conſtitution, even ſince its firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by Columbus. To the armies and navies of England it has been particularly deſtructive. The ſad fate of the troops who went on the expedition to Carthagena will be long remembered; neither will the loſs ſuſtained at the Havannah, Martinique and Gaudaloupe ſoon be forgotten; while the deſtruction, occaſioned by the effects of climate at St. Lucia, St. Juan, and even in Jamaica, during the late war, is ſtill freſh in our memories. As it appears from a comparative view of the mortality of the troops em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in theſe different ſervices, that we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited but little by the experience of our former mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, it might probably be ſuppoſed, that the great ſickneſs, obſerved on theſe occaſions, has actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ariſen from the irremediable effects of climate, or unavoidable hardſhips of ſervice in hot countries; but there is reaſon to believe that this is not wholly the caſe. I will venture to aſſert, nor ſhould I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with difficulty in proving, that much
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:028890_0264_0FDE5FC09B8CD758"/>
of it has proceeded from the inexperience or inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who conducted the expeditions, or from ſuch errors in the medical departments as might have been eaſily obviated. It is ſuperfluous to obſerve, that the health of the ſoldier is an object of principal importance in enſuring the ſucceſſes of war. We have many inſtances of expeditions apparently well concerted, which have failed from the exceſſive ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the troops: and too many proofs of this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs proceeding from a neglect of ſuch precautions, as might have contributed to the preſervation of health. I have accuſtomed myſelf to look at this ſubject for more than fifteen years. I have turned it often in my mind, and cannot diſcover that much judicious attention has yet been paid to it. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not often perceive that health has been an object of conſideration, in fixing the permanent ſtations of troops; or that it has been much regarded in chooſing encampments in the field. Exerciſes, which might inure the body to hardſhips, have not been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently enforced; and ſuch ſorts of diet, and ſuch modes of life, as might obviate the danger of diſeaſes, have been little attended to; while the beſt regulations for a ſpeedy and deciſive plan of cure do not appear to have been adopted. I ſhall be obliged, in tracing this ſubject, to advance ſome ideas which are contrary to the opinions of ſome celebrated authors, which combat popular prejudices, or which interfere with the views of intereſted men. I may be reckoned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous perhaps in cenſuring freely; but I am conſcious that I do not advance any thing which has not truth for its foundation.</p>
            <p>It has frequently been the practice, in times of war, to ſend new raiſed regiments to ſerve in the iſlands of the Weſt-Indies; and though the injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the practice has long been diſcovered, it does not yet appear to be diſcontinued. During the late war there were ſeveral corps ſent out to thoſe
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:028890_0265_0FDE605234479B20"/>
countries newly recruited, the conſequence of which was, that though not a man died by the ſword; yet in the ſhort ſpace of two years, there ſcarcely was a ſoldier left. A great part of this dreadful mortality undoubtedly aroſe from the climate; yet ſome ſhare of it ſeems likewiſe to have proceeded from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances of raw undiſciplined troops.—Men newly enliſted in England, are generally of groſs and full habits, and too often accuſtomed to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and diſſipated modes of life. Under ſuch circumſtances, a ſudden tranſition to a hotter air, joined with full meals, and the habitual indolence of a paſſage at ſea, cannot fail to produce a plethoric ſtate of the body, which is often rendered dangerous by the incautious uſe of ſtrong liquors, or the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary exertions required in performing military exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, under the influence of a powerful ſun. I do not pretend to inſinuate that thoſe are the cauſes of remitting fever, but I am very ſenſible at the ſame time that they are cauſes which occaſionally aggravate its danger, and which even ſometimes accelerate its appearance. In ſoldiers who have been inured to a military life, ſuch change of climate operates with diminiſhed effect. The bulk of the fluids is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps diminiſhed by a continuance of leſs full living; while the tone and elaſticity of the moving powers are increaſed by habits of exerciſe and exertion.—The diſpoſition to commit exceſſes is likewiſe repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the rigour of diſcipline; and the mind acquires a philoſophical firmneſs from long ſervice, which not only contributes to the preſervation of health, but which enables the individual to ſuſtain with fortitude the attack of diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>In paſſing from a cold to a hot climate, the firſt thing that occurs to be conſidered, is the effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſimple increaſe of heat on the human frame. Expanſion of the fluids, and conſequent ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the veſſels is conſtantly obſerved to take place
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:028890_0266_0FDE5FC6EE060738"/>
from ſuch a change, frequently however accompanied with diminiſhed energy of the moving powers, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly where heat is combined with dampneſs of the air. To obviate therefore this natural effect of heat is the firſt general object to be attended to, in tranſporting troops to the tropical climates. The Engliſh, from the conſtitution of their bodies, and ſtill more perhaps from their manner of living, ſuffer more from thoſe ſudden changes than ſome other European nations. The French and Spaniards are not only leſs groſs conſtitutionally, but eat likewiſe leſs animal food, and drink their liquors greatly more diluted, than the natives of England. They do not probably owe more to medical aſſiſtance than the Engliſh; yet they are known to eſcape better from dangerous diſeaſes; and their ſafety I might add has been remarked to bear ſome proportion to the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent degrees of abſtemiouſneſs, which they are known to obſerve. An idea prevails with the generality of people, who viſit warmer or more unhealthy climates, that it is neceſſary to eat and drink freely, as a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt the attacks of endemic fevers; but a very narrow obſervation will ſerve to ſhew, that good living, as it is called, has no ſuch effects; and we may even ſoon perceive, unleſs blended by long eſtabliſhed prejudices which flatter our appetites, that it actually is attended with pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. The moſt abſtemious, ſo far as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, eſcaped the beſt, not only from the attacks, but particularly from the danger of diſeaſes. With regard to the diet of a ſoldier, ſerving in a hot cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, I ſhould be diſpoſed to believe, that one ſpare meal of animal food would be perfectly ſufficient in twenty-fours: and if it were eaſy to alter eſtabliſhed cuſtoms, it would be moſt proper, perhaps, that it were made in the cool of the evening. Coffee, or tea for breakfaſt might likewiſe be ſubſtituted with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in place of the ordinary allowance of rum:
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:028890_0267_0FDE605878104F68"/>
but this I muſt confeſs would be a dangerous expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, Our ſoldiers have been ſo long accuſtomed to conſider this gratuitous allowance of rum as their right, that no man could anſwer for the conſequences of with-holding it. The practice certainly is perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and the man, who firſt introduced it into the army, did no good ſervice to his country. I do not deny that a judicious uſe of ſpirits might be of benefit occaſionally: neither do I pretend to ſay, that, even the hardeſt drinking can be conſidered as a general cauſe of fevers; but it would not be difficult to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce evidence, that hard drinking aggravates the violence, and increaſes the danger of the diſeaſe, when it happens to take place; while I cannot perceive much reaſon for concluding, that the uſe of ſpirituous liquors has ever been productive of general good to the army, particularly in warm climates. But as I have juſt mentioned, that ſpirituous liquors have little claim to be conſidered among the number of thoſe things, which contribute to the preſervation of health: ſo I may add, with perfect confidence, that the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of rum granted to ſoldiers, has done much harm by ruining diſcipline, and good behaviour. If it is with-held for one day, diſcontent immediately begins to ſhew itſelf among the men. If with-held for any length of time, complaints ſometimes riſe to a ſtate of mutiny, and deſertions become numerous. But beſides this, that ſoldiers ſeldom perform extra-duty with alacrity, unleſs they are bribed with a double allowance of liquor. A double allowance, drank un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluted, as is generally the caſe, is frequently ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to produce ſome degree of intoxication. I need not mention the diſaſters to which an intoxicated army is expoſed. Diſaſters of a very ſerious nature have actually happened from this cauſe, and they might have happened oftener had the enemy been always vigilant, and bold enough to have ſeized the opportunity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="unknown:028890_0268_0FDE5FCC4F6544D8"/>
A deal might be ſaid on the ſubject of abſtemiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Moderation both in eating and drinking is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially neceſſary to the health of troops newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in hot climates; but a truth ſo obvious need not be enforced by many arguments. The example of the French and Spaniards afford a very convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one. It is known to every medical perſon, that the fevers of hot climates are generally moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in full and plethoric habits. It ought to be an object of attention therefore to obviate this cauſe of mortality, by means of ſpare living, and the cautious uſe of ſtimulating liquors: but ſoldiers have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ittle ſelf command, and ſeldom reſiſt the gratification of their appetites. Hence it becomes the duty of their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to enforce their compliance with what is proper, and to preclude them, as much as is poſſible, from the means of obtaining what is pernicious; but this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires great vigilance and attention, and often great ſeverity. It is not enough that ſoldiers are obliged to eat in meſſes. The officers ought daily to inſpect their meals, and inflict penalties where they obſerve tranſgreſſions. And further, as it is a matter of much importance to preſerve troops in a ſtate of health fit for action, and as the courſe of fevers is often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly rapid in the Weſt-Indies, it would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, perhaps, that the ſurgeon reviewed the men daily. The diſtant approach off the diſeaſe would be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſcovered by this means, and the danger of it might probably be ſometimes averted by timely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Before men appear in the ſick-reports, the fever is often conſiderably advanced in its progreſs.</p>
            <p>Beſides the alterations which might be made in the diet of troops, on their arrival in hot climates, ſome changes in the mode of cloathing might, perhaps, be likewiſe adopted for the ſake of eaſe and convenience, if not for purpoſes of real uſe and economy. Round white hats would be the moſt proper covering for the head; and dowlas might be ſubſtituted with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:028890_0269_0FDE605E0ED36900"/>
in room of the thick cloth, of which the coats of ſoldiers are uſually made. There can be no grounds for ſuppoſing, that a ſoldier will not fight as well in dowlas as in ſcarlet; and there is certain proof that he will perform duties, which require exertion, with greater ſafety and effect, as the nature of his cloathing will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him cooler by ſome degrees. But though ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations may be hinted, there is little room to believe that they will be attended to. In the preſent rage for military ſhew, it will be a difficult taſk to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince men to lay aſide an uniform, which adds ſo much to the brilliancy of the appearance. Much ſtreſs ſeems at preſent to be laid upon the dreſs of the ſoldier, and I do not pretend to argue, that it is a matter of perfect indifference. It has certainly very often had viſible effects upon the enemy; but theſe effects have oftener proceeded from a knowledge of the character of the troops who wore it, than from any thing formidable in the uniform itſelf. But to leave this ſubject of dreſs, I ſhall only obſerve, that a flannel or cotten wrapper would be more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to a ſoldier, ſerving in the Weſt-Indies, than a blanket; and perhaps the expence of it would not be much greater. It would ſerve for his covering in the night, and would ſecure him againſt the effects of cold, where occaſions obliged him to go out.</p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour in the next place to point out ſome of thoſe benefits, which may be derived to health, from habits of daily exerciſe. This is an object of the greateſt importance, but unfortunately it is an object very little attended to in the Britiſh army. It appears, indeed, to be little regarded in moſt of the armies of modern Europe. I ſhould incur a charge of preſumption, perhaps of ignorance, did I attempt to point out the exerciſes which are the moſt proper for the forming of ſoldiers. Thoſe only which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the preſervation of health, belong to this place. I may however remark, that the eſſential part of the
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:028890_0270_0FDE5FD32AF4BFF8"/>
art of diſciplining troops, conſiſts in imparting ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of heroiſm and virtue to the minds of the men, in improving the exertions of their limbs, and in ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge of the correſpondence of their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when called into action. If I durſt take ſo great a liberty, I ſhould be inclined to ſay, that our ordinary exerciſes are flat and inſipid in their nature; that they occaſion no exertions, and excite no emulation: they neither improve the active powers of the body, nor inure the ſoldier to bear fatigue and hardſhip. The Romans, who owed more to the diſcipline of their armies than any nation on earth, were extremely ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and perſevering in their exerciſes. They prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed their ſoldiers in every ſpecies of ſervice that might occur; ſo that nothing at any time happened wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> which they were unacquainted. Actual war was in reality a time of relaxation and amuſement to the ſoldiers of this warlike people, who appear to have been trained for the ſervice of the field, as horſes are for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nting or the courſe. The Romans were not only ſenſible of the advantages which thoſe habits of exerciſe procured them in action; but had alſo the penetration to diſcover, that they were emmently ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in the preſervation of health. The words of Vegetius are remarkable. "R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i militari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſe, quam medicos." I made the ſame remark during the time that I attended a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in America, without knowing that it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſo great authority. I obſerved, when the men were in the field, ſometimes even complaining of hardſhip and fatigue, that few were reported in the liſt of the ſick: when removed to quarters, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped for any length of time in one place, the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital was obſerved to fill rapidly. This obſervation was uniformly verified, as often as the experiment was repeated.</p>
            <p>An idea has been long entertained, that the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean

conſtitution cannot bear hard labour in the ſun, or perform military exerciſes with ſafety, in the hot climates of the Weſt-Indies. Hence a plan has been ſuggeſted, and in ſome degree I believe adopted, that regiments ſerving in thoſe countries, he furniſhed with people of colour to do the drudgery of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. But this appears to be an innovation which ought to be admitted with extreme caution. It will evidently ſerve to increaſe ſloth and idleneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the perſons of colour can perform the military duty in the field, their ſervices will go but a ſhort way in preſerving the health of the troops. A ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, notwithſtanding he may have received the King's pay for twenty years or more, remains in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree a tyro till his body has been inured to fatigue, and prepared to bear without danger the effects of the climate, in which he may be deſtined to ſerve. This is a part of the military diſcipline, indeed, no leſs neceſſary than a knowledge of the uſe of arms, and though it is a part of it, difficult to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, there is ſtill room to believe, that it may be effected, even in the ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> dreaded climate of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica. It is a common opinion, that the fatigues of an active campaign in the Weſt-Indies, would be fatal to the health of the troops; but the opinion has been aſſumed without fair trial. The exertions of a ſingle day have often been hurtful. This was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the caſe in America, where the ſoldiers had remained for ſome time in a ſtate of reſt; but bad effects from the greateſt exertions, in the hotteſt weather of ſummer, were extremely rare in that country, after the campaign had been continued for a few days. But that I may not ſeem to reſt an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſo great importance on a bare analogy, I ſhall beg leave to obſerve, that young European planters undergo greater fatigues, and remain daily expoſed for a longer time to the heat of the ſun, than would fall to the lot of ſoldiers in the actual ſervice of the
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:028890_0272_0FDE5FD9C561EE00"/>
field. I might likewiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> confirm the opinion, that an Engliſhman is capable or ſuſtaining fatigue in the Weſt-Indies, equally well with the African, or the native of the iſlands, by mentioning a journey which I once performed myſelf. I lived about four years in Jamaica, during the greateſt part of which I believed that death, or dangerous ſickneſs, would be the conſequence of walking any diſtance on foot; but I afterwards learnt that this apprehenſion was vain. I left Savanna la Mar in the year 1778, with the deſign of going to America; but having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in a hurry, and forgot a material piece of buſineſs, I found a neceſſity of being put aſhore, after having been two or three days at ſea. I was landed at Port Morant, in St. Thomas's in the Eaſt, from which I went to Kingſton by water, where learning that there was a veſſel at Lucca, in the Weſtern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the iſland, nearly ready to ſail for New-York, I ſet out directly, that I might not loſe the opportunity of a paſſage. My finances not being in a condition to furniſh horſes, I left Kingſton on foot, about twelve o'clock, and accompliſhed a journey before it was dark of eighteen miles. I did not find I was materially fatigued and ſtill perſiſting in my reſolution, travelled a hundred miles more in the ſpace of the three following days. It may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to remark, that I carried baggage with me, equal in weight to the common knapſack of a ſoldier. I do not know that ſo great a journey was ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on foot by an European, in any of the iſlands of the Weſt-Indies; not ſo much I am convinced from inability, as from idea that ſuch exertions are dangerous. But as it appears from the above fact, that the European conſtitution is capable of ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing common military fatigues in the climate of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica; ſo I may add that it ought to be a principal object of military diſcipline, that ſoldiers be practiſed with frequent marching, and the performance of
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:028890_0273_0FDE606A6D95C4F0"/>
other exerciſes of exertion, if it is actually meant that they ſhould be uſeful in times of war. The fate of battles, I might obſerve, depends oftener on rapid movements, in which the activity of the limbs is concerned, than on the expert handling of arms, which is acquired by the practice of the manual. I obſerved formerly, that abſtemiouſneſs and temperance were among the beſt means of preſerving health, or obviating the danger of the diſeaſes to which troops are liable on their firſt arrival in hot climates; but the rules of temperance are little regarded by Engliſh ſoldiers at any time, and almoſt conſtantly tranſgreſſed wherever extraordinary labour is required of them. To ſuch cauſes of exceſs, joined with the great heat of the ſun, we may perhaps impute many of the bad effects of marching, or of moderate fatigue in the Weſt-Indies. In the journey which I have juſt now mentioned, I probably owe my eſcape from ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to temperance and ſpare living. I breakfaſted on tea about ten in the morning, and made a meal of bread and ſallad, after I had taken up my lodging for the night. If I had occaſion to drink through the day, water or lemonade was my beverage. In the year 1782, I walked between Edinburgh and London in eleven days and a half; and invariably obſerved, that I performed my journey with greater eaſe and pleaſure, where I drank water, aud only breakfaſted and ſupped, than when I made three meals a day, and drank wine, ale, or porter. In the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſummer I carried the experiment farther. During the months of July and Auguſt, I travelled in ſome of the hotteſt provinces of France. I ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally walked from twenty-five to thirty miles a day, in a degree of heat leſs ſupportable than the common heat of Jamaica, without ſuffering any material in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience. I breakfaſted about ten o'clock on tea, coffee or ſyrup of vinegar, made a ſlender meal of animal food in the evening, with a great proportion
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:028890_0274_0FDE5FDF4B5250C0"/>
of ſallad and vegetables; but never drank the weakeſt wines without dilution. The great refreſhment which I found from ſyrup of vinegar and water, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces me, that the Romans had good cauſe for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vinegar ſuch an eſſential article among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of their armies.—The ſtate of luxury and our depraved appetites, unfortunately do not ſuffer it to be adopted by the Engliſh. I ought perhaps to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> apology to the reader for introducing my own experience on the preſent occaſion: but I muſt add, that I have only done it, becauſe it enables me to ſpeak from conviction, that an Engliſh ſoldier may be rendered capable of going through the ſevereſt military ſervice in the hotteſt iſlands of the Weſt-Indies, and that temperance will be one of the beſt means of enabling him to perform his duty with ſafety and effect.</p>
            <p>I mentioned before, that the military exerciſe of the Engliſh army is ill calculated to excite a ſpirit of emulation among the men. It is in fact conſidered only as a piece of drudgery, in which there are few who have any ambition to excel. It has little effect in improving the activity of the limbs, or hardening the conſtitution of the body; ſo that it may better ſuſtain hardſhip and fatigue. But feeble as its effects are in the view of increaſing exertion, or preſerving health, it is generally almoſt intirely diſcontinued when troops arrive in hot climates; a practice, which has ariſen from a ſuperficial and miſtaken view of the ſubject. Sloth and indolence are the bane of a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in every climate; exerciſe and action are the greateſt preſervatives of diſcipline and of health. It would be reckoned preſumption in me, and it does not belong to this place to point out thoſe exerciſes which might be proper for the forming of ſoldiers. But every one knows that walking, running, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, leaping, fencing and ſwimming, are often called into actual uſe in the practice of war. Theſe are
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:028890_0275_0FDE6070ED953850"/>
ſuch exerciſes likewiſe as excite emulation, and are practiſed with pleaſure by the individual. They harden the body, increaſe the power of the limbs, and by furniſhing the officer with a view of the different degrees of activity, may often enable him to place his men in the ranks, according to the uniformity of their exertions; a more uſeful mode of arrangement in time of action, than uniformity of exterior form. I may add in this place, that ſea-bathing will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely uſeful in moſt caſes, in increaſing the vigour and preſerving the health of ſoldiers ſerving in warm climates. There no doubt will occur many caſes, in which it is improper; but in general it may be employed with great benefit. I chiefly impute it to this cauſe, that I did not experience a ſingle day's indiſpoſition, during the four years that I lived in Jamaica.</p>
            <p>It has been known for many ages, that the cauſe of intermitting and remitting fevers, the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable diſeaſes of hot climates, owes its origin to exhalations from ſwampy and moiſt grounds. It often happens likewiſe, that thoſe low and ſwampy grounds are the moſt acceſſible parts of a coaſt or that towns and ſettlements have been placed near them—to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack or defend which falls to the lot of the ſoldier. It not being therefore in the power of a military commander to remove the natural diſadvantages, which I have mentioned; it is only in his power to ſhew his judgment and attention, by applying the beſt remedies to obviate their effects. It is certainly an object of the utmoſt conſequence to preſerve troops in a ſtate of health fit for action: and no perſon will deny, that every care ought to be employed in chooſing the beſt ſituations for quarters, or even temporary encampments, that the nature of the duty will permit. We learn from experience that fevers are little known in rough and hilly countries, where water flows with a rapid courſe; while we likewiſe
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:028890_0276_0FDE5FE502AFF530"/>
know, that they are common in low and champaign countries, where water ſtagnates, or has only a ſluggiſh motion: independent of which, thoſe ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are in the neighbourhood of ſwamps, or near the oozy banks of large rivers, have always been obſerved to be particularly liable to ſuch diſeaſes. If therefore the circumſtances of the ſervice do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, no room can be left to doubt about the propriety of ſtationing troops in the mountanous or hilly parts of a country; while I may likewiſe add, that where neceſſity confines them to the plain, the ſea ſhore will in general be found to be the moſt eligible. But beſides the above general character of local ſituations there are likewiſe ſome ſubordinate circumſtances, which deſerve to be particularly attended to in chooſing the ground of encampments. It is very commonly believed that high and elevated ſituations are the moſt uniformly proper for this purpoſe; but this in fact is not, by any means, a general rule. A high and dry ſituation does not contain any thing hurtful in itſelf; but it is more than others expoſed to the effluvia which are carried from a diſtance. It is the peculiar nature of exhalations to aſcend as they proceed from their ſource; in confirmation of which truth I have had ſeveral opportunities of witneſſing, that this cauſe of diſeaſe was carried to riſing grounds in a ſtate of great activity; while it apparently paſſed over the plain or vallies which lay contiguous, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any material effects. From the knowledge of this fact we are furniſhed with this obvious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that it will be proper to interpoſe woods or riſing grounds to the progreſs of thoſe noxious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours; or where ſuch natural advantages do not exiſt, it might be ſerviceable to burn a chain of fires in a temporary encampment, or even to raiſe a parapet wall to over top the barracks, where neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a more permanent ſtation.—It would be a matter of utility, could we determine with any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:028890_0277_0FDE6076E7B88C70"/>
to what diſtance from its ſource, the noxious effluvia extend; but this is a queſtion which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope to aſcertain very exactly. It is not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly the ſame in all ſituations, depending on the concentrated ſtate of the exhalation at its ſource, the obſtacles it meets with in its progreſs, and the nature of the ground over which it paſſes, or to which it is directed. I have known its influence very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at the diſtance of a mile and a half, on the top of a hill of very conſiderable elevation.</p>
            <p>The conveniences of trade have often tempted co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts to place their towns on the banks of rivers, without regard to the healthfulneſs of the ſituation.—The choice of ſuch ſpots, injudicious as it evidently is, has been greatly approved of, and warmly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as preferable to others for the encampment of troops, by a very celebrated medical authority. Sir John Pringle conſiders the banks of large rivers as extremely proper for this purpoſe, on account of a free circulation of air; but I am ſorry to obſerve, that Sir John Pringle's opinion on this occaſion appears to have ariſen from his theory, rather than that his theory has ariſen from obſervation. We have actual experience of the unhealthfulneſs of the muddy banks of large rivers in hot climates; and we have little cauſe to dread diſeaſes, which originate from confined air in America, the Weſt-Indies, or perhaps in any country where troops are employed in the field.</p>
            <p>I have juſt now obſerved, that the banks of large rivers, in the opinion of Sir John Pringle, afford the moſt eligible ſituation with reſpect to healthineſs for the encampment of troops. I may add, that the ſame author has likewiſe recommended open grounds, for this purpoſe, in preference to woods; and that the ſame favourite idea, <abbr>viz.</abbr> a free circulation of air, has influenced his advice. I will not contend, that open, dry and cultivated grounds may not be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to grounds covered with wood, where the heat
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:028890_0278_0FDE5FEB2AA00C60"/>
of the climate is moderate; but I have no doubt in aſſerting, that encampments on lands, the woods of which have been newly cut down, as is generally the caſe in times of war, are of all others the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthful. I have myſelf ſeen ſeveral examples of it. Perhaps it is in a great meaſure owing to this cauſe, that new countries are generally ſo fatal to the firſt ſettlers; as alſo, that troops ſuffer ſo remarkably in carrying on the ſieges of places which are ſurrounded by woods: it being conſtantly obſerved, that effluvia from moiſt lands, when firſt expoſed to the action of a powerful ſun, are always highly pernicious. The Romans, whoſe obſervations on ſubjects which relate to war, may be oppoſed with confidence to the authority of the moſt celebrated moderns, were fully ſenſible of the advantages of encamping under the ſhelter of wood. We learn from Vegetius, that their armies reſorted to the cover of a wood, not leſs carefully, than that they avoided the vicinity of ſwamps or marſhes. There are in reality various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which contribute to render ſuch ſituations both healthy and agreeable. If troops are encamped in the body of a wood, the noxious effluvia, which may be carried by the winds from neighbouring ſwamps, are ſtopt in their progreſs; the lofty ſhade of the trees preſerves the air cool and more refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than the atmoſphere of the open country; while we know from experience, that moiſt and ſwampy lands do not ſend forth their noxious vapours, in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable degree, unleſs where they are acted upon by the heat of a powerful ſun.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only further obſerve, with regard to the cauſe of intermitting and remitting fevers, that a ſpace of time almoſt conſtantly intervenes between expoſure to the noxious effluvia, and the ſubſequent appearance of the diſeaſe. It is not indeed uniformly the ſame in all caſes, appearing to depend not only on the concentrated ſtate in which the exhalation is
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:028890_0279_0FDE607C7B527660"/>
applied to the body; but on the general aptitude of the individual, and the various occaſional or exciting cauſes, which facilitate or reſiſt its operation. It was in a few inſtances only, that I ſaw the diſeaſe appear before the ſeventh day. It was oftener the fourteenth, twentieth, or even longer. Upon the whole I may remark, that ſeptenary periods has a conſiderable power in influencing the time of its appearance.</p>
            <p>Having offered a few obſervations in the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pages, on the diet, exerciſes and choice of the quarters or encampments for troops in hot climates; I ſhall now add a few hints reſpecting medical care and management. It will probably be ſuppoſed, that no attention with reſpect to this ſubject has been omitted. Regiments are provided with ſurgeons, and armies have always been furniſhed with ample hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital eſtabliſhments. But this perhaps is not enough. It is neceſſary that the duties of theſe ſtations be well executed, as well as well deſigned. The office of ſurgeon to a regiment is an office of truſt and of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary importance; the appointment to it, however, does not ſeem in general to be ſufficiently attended to. The ſurgeoncies of regiments, till lately, were allowed to be bought and ſold; in conſequence of which abuſe, little other qualification, came to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, than the command of the purchaſe money. Thus it often happened, that young men, who had attended a courſe of anatomical lectures, or walked the rounds of an hoſpital for a few months, came at once to be entruſted with the care of the lives of ſix or ſeven hundred ſoldiers, who, as they are raiſed and maintained at a great expence, deſerve, on the ſcore of economy, independent of every other conſideration, to be well taken care of. It would be ſuperfluous to uſe any arguments to prove the prodigality of committing the care of a regiment to men, who have not had profeſſional experience in any country, and who are totally unacquainted with the diſeaſes of the countries
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:028890_0280_0FDE5FF1BA658A08"/>
to which they are frequently ſent. If we are diſpoſed to believe that there is any thing in medical treatment, we can ſcarcely avoid making the concluſion, that many lives are loſt from this cauſe. It muſt not be underſtood, that I mean any thing direſpectful to the ſurgeons of the army, by this inſinuation. I know that a regiment is an excellent ſchool for medical knowledge; and that the beſt practitioners have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally appeared in the army; but I wiſh ſtrongly to inculcate the propriety of obliging candidates for this office, to produce evidence of their qualifications, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are admitted to ſuch an important truſt. It is not enough, that a young man, who offers himſelf to take charge of the health of a regiment, ſhould know to perform an operation with dexterity. Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a knife in reality is the leaſt part of a regimental ſurgeon's duty. The office of phyſician is his daily employment, to execute which properly, both years and experience are required. It certainly ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be an object of concern with thoſe who are entruſted with the office of ſuperintending the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal appointments of the army, that the candidates for ſurgeoncies be obliged to ſubmit to ſuch trials, as may in ſome degree afford proofs of their abilities. It would be a proper regulation, perhaps, that no man be permitted to propoſe himſelf for the ſurgeoncy of a regiment, before he has arrived at ſuch an age, as may have furniſhed him with general experience; and further, that he give teſtimony of actual abilities by the treatment of diſeaſes in an hoſpital, under the inſpection of an able phyſician, to whom the duty will be preſcribed to examine the mode of practice with rigour. A trial of this ſort might be better truſted to than the recommendatory letter of a profeſſor; or even the diploma of Oxford or Edinburgh. There is not any thing chimerical in the propoſal. Nothing in ſhort is more practicable; but it is ſcarcely to be expected, that men of talents and education will give
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:028890_0281_0FDD22946CFCC4F8"/>
themſelves ſo much trouble, that they may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a ſervice which holds out few advantages. The ſalary of regimental ſurgeons is ſmall; and it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no paradox to ſay, that this is a cauſe of great expence to the nation. The bare ſubſiſtence, which the ſervice affords, furniſhes no inducement for men of abilities to enter, at leaſt to remain any length of time in the army, which unfortunately has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in no other light, than as a place, where ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons may paſs their noviciate; but which they are generally diſpoſed to leave, as ſoon as they are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to execute the duty properly. Medical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is gained only by experience but independent of medical knowledge, an acquaintance with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, characters and diſpoſitions of ſoldiers is a matter of ſo great importance, that old ſurgeons, even of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior abilities as medical men, have generally been obſerved to have a proportionably ſmall liſt of ſick in their reſpective corps. The qualities that are principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required in a regimental ſurgeon, excluſive of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal learning and knowledge, are acuteneſs in diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the characters and diſpoſitions of men, and above all, boldneſs and deciſion in the application of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Life is often loſt in unhealthy climates, by the dilatorineſs and timidity of common practice.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned juſt now, that there appears to be a remiſſneſs in examining the qualifications that are requiſite for the office of regimental ſurgeon, I might perhaps, with equal juſtice, extend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark to the appointments in the general hoſpital.—The power of appointing phyſicians or ſurgeons in the hoſpital, has generally been lodged with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in chief, and I might ſay, without tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the bounds of truth, that merit has not always been the beſt claim for promotion. It would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious to be more particular in cenſuring what is paſſed. It is only hoped, that the ſubject will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, and ſuch remedies applied, as will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:028890_0282_0FDE5FF8B80366B8"/>
ſimilar abuſes in future. The general hoſpital has ever been a heavy article in the expences of war; and if it were fair to form an opinion of the whole, from the part which I have ſeen, I ſhould not heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in declaring, that the eſtabliſhment is in a great meaſure ſuperfluous. I have no doubt, in obtaining the ſuffrages of people of experience, that general hoſpitals are ruinous to military diſcipline; that they promote ſloth and indolence, the worſt diſeaſe to which a ſoldier is liable, and that they extinguiſh very ſpeedily the ardour for the ſervice of the field.—There is in fact no exaggeration in the aſſertion, that the man, who has ſpent two or three months in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral hoſpital, is leſs of a ſoldier than when he was firſt recruited. It is only I may add by habits of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, even by toils and fatigue, that men at laſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the properties of good ſoldiers: while it is only by conſtant practice of ſuch diſcipline, that they are preſerved in a ſtate fit for the performance of their duties. Theſe active qualities are ſpeedily extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the habits of ſloth and indolence, which prevail in general hoſpitals; but beſides this, it is likewiſe certain, that cures are often there protracted to months, which might have been accompliſhed in the courſe of a few days, if circumſtances would have permitted the men to remain with their regiments.—Regimental ſurgeons have many inducements to exert themſelves in reſtoring their men ſpeedily to health, which act only with feeble power on thoſe who have the management of general hoſpitals. The former likewiſe poſſeſs ſome advantages, of which the latter are deſtitute. They know the habit and diſpoſitions of the patient; they ſee the diſeaſe in its firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and are enabled to ſeize the moſt favourable moments for acting with deciſion. The above are conſiderations, which ought to make us backward in removing ſick ſoldiers to general hoſpitals; I may add, that ſuch is the nature of military diſeaſes, that
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:028890_0283_0FDD2297884BD338"/>
there does not, perhaps occur one caſe in twenty, which might not be treated properly by the ſurgeon of the regiment, if attention, and a very little expence were beſtowed in providing neceſſary accommodation. But beſides that, the diſeaſes of ſoldiers are ſeldom of ſuch a kind, that they might not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> properly by regimental ſurgeons, if government were at the expence of ſupplying a few conveniencies.</p>
            <p>I may farther obſerve, that together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence naturally attached to general hoſpitals, and uniformly hurtful to military diſcipline, there is often actual danger to life, by removing men in critical ſituations, or by the neceſſary intermiſſion of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aſſiſtance, where continual and vigorous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are required The diſeaſes of hot climates, particularly the fevers of the Weſt-Indies, are often moſt acute and rapid in their courſe. The ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of a regiment perceives the approach of danger, and, ſenſible that his ſituation does not enable him to do juſtice to his patient, determines to remove him to the general hoſpital. But time is loſt before this can be accompliſhed. It is ſeldom that any thing is done after it is deemed proper to ſend a ſick man away; neither does it commonly happen, that any thing material is attempted on the day on which he is received. Thus one day at leaſt, ſometimes two are completely loſt in caſes, where every moment is of conſequence. Time is precious in the fevers of hot climates; and the deciſion or neglect of an hour often determines the fate of a patient.</p>
            <p>It is an obſervation, which cannot fail of having frequently occurred to people who have ſerved any time in the army, that it would be a very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the ſervice, if ſick ſoldiers could always be taken care of by the reſpective ſurgeons of the regiment. I have endeavoured to ſhew, that the plan is practicable and eaſy; and I may further add, that the expence neceſſary for ſuch an arrangement,
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:028890_0284_0FDE5FFE64E586B0"/>
would not amount to one third of what is uſually ſpent in general hoſpital eſtabliſhments. If this idea were adopted, nothing more would be required, than that proper lodgings, proper proviſions, and a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſupply of medicines, were furniſhed for the ſick; that the ſurgeon of the regiment be well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for his ſtation; and that an inſpector be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for a certain portion of troops, to take care that the duty be well and diligently executed. By this means a general hoſpital, as far as regards me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical treatment, might be aboliſhed, or at leaſt greatly abridged. Where fighting was expected, extra-ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical aſſiſtance would ſtill be neceſſary. Such an inſpection of regimental hoſpitals, as that I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſeems to be perfectly ſufficient for the care of the health of an army, in ordinary occaſions. The greateſt precautions, however, ought to be taken, that the inſpection does not degenerate into a nominal duty. The inſpector ought to viſit the different quarters, examine minutely into every article of the management of the hoſpitals, and order that general reports be publiſhed annually; and that ſome mark of approbation be beſtowed upon thoſe ſurgeons, who appear to have executed their duty with the greateſt diligence and ability. It ought to be a concern of government, however, that no perſon be appointed to inſpect regimental hoſpitals, who is not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the diſeaſes of the climate, in which the troops happen to ſerve.</p>

               <p>THOUGH I have deſcribed the endemic fever of Jamaica as diſtinctly as is in my power; yet as I have often obſerved that we attain more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate ideas from the detail of a particular hiſtory than from general deſcription, I ſhall ſelect from my notes two or three caſes which may ſerve to give a clearer view of the different ſpecies of the diſeaſe. And in the firſt place I ſhall deſcribe an inſtance of fever, which was diſtinguiſhed through the whole of its courſe by ſymptoms of the general inflammatory diatheſis.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Lennox, a ſoldier of the 60th regiment, aged 40, of a firm and compact habit of body, was ſeized on the 3d of December, between eight and nine in the morning, with a ſlight horror or ſhivering, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded and accompanied by other uſual marks of fever. The ſymptoms of coldneſs and ſhivering went off in the courſe of eight or ten minutes. A hot fit ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, with a good deal of head-ach, hurried reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, conſiderable thirſt, a ſtrong, full, and frequent pulſe. After a continuance of four or five hours, ſweat began to appear on the head and breaſt, which extending gradually to the extremities brought with it a tolerable diſtinct remiſſion of the fever. 2. The fever appeared to be gone off very completely by ten o'clock at night. The patient reſted well during
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:028890_0286_0FDE6002E79EB728"/>
the night, and continued in this ſame ſtate of eaſe till about five o'clock in the evening. He then became uneaſy and reſtleſs, with head-ach and a ſlight feveriſh heat. 5. The feveriſh indiſpoſition declined in the courſe of the night. He became eaſier towards morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and about ſeven might be ſaid to be in a ſtate of remiſſion. About nine a paroxyſm commenced, ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the paroxyſm of the firſt day, though with a ſtill ſlighter degree of horror and ſhivering; the hot fit ran ſtill higher, with much head-ach, thirſt, and a ſtrong vigorous pulſe. The ſweating at laſt made its appearance, and the violence of the fever declined: there ſtill however remained ſome degree of head-ach, pain of the back, and thirſt, with an averſion to food, and a more than natural frequency of pulſe. 6. Reſted tolerably; but ſtill is not free from head-ach and pain of the back: the tongue is dry and foul, and the coat which covers it is ſmooth, but of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable thickneſs, and of a cream colour. About four in the evening the paroxyſm of a fever made its appearance, ſimilar, in ſome degree, to the paroxyſm of the fourth, but of a much greater degree of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. It continued for eight hours, and declined gradually towards morning. 7. There were no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable marks of fever at ſeven in the morning. A little after nine, however, a paroxyſm commenced, ſimilar, in every reſpect, to the paroxyſm of the fifth. 8. About three in the afternoon a paroxyſm began ſimilar to the paroxyſm of the ſixth, but ſtill more violent. It declined after the uſual duration, and was ſucceeded on the ninth by another paroxyſm ſimilar to that of the ſeventh. The remiſſion which ſucceeded appeared to be ſtill more perfect than any of the preceding; the ſweat was even more copious, and the pulſe became ſofter and more expanded after it than it had hitherto done. 10. A paroxyſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned about half paſt two, ſimilar to the paroxyſm of the eighth, but not leſs violent in degree. It termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:028890_0287_0FDE608E8D4297A0"/>
however, in a more fluid and univerſal ſweat; the pulſe and the ſtate of the ſkin returned perfectly to what they were in health; the mucous coat ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the tongue; the eye and countenance aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed their natural ſerenity, and unequivocal marks of final criſis appeared on the morning of the eleventh. The above caſe is an inſtance of the double tertian; the fever of the even day terminated the diſeaſe; and the pulſe through the whole courſe was vigorous and ſtrong, or marks of inflammatory diatheſis, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate degree, were conſtantly preſent.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Henley, a ſoldier of the 60th regiment, was ſeized on the 6th of May, about five in the evening, with a nauſea, or unpleaſant affection at ſtomach, marks of great languor and debility, a ſlight feeling of coldneſs and horror, a very weak and frequent pulſe, head-ach, pain of the back, and other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which are uſual in the acceſſion of fevers. After a continuance of ten or twelve hours, theſe ſymptoms were ſo far gone off, that the patient was conſidered to be in a ſtate of remiſſion. 7. The exacerbation of the fever returned again about the ſame hour in the evening at which it had firſt come on, though without marks of preceding coldneſs or ſhivering. The pulſe was ſmall, obſcure, and extremely frequent; the heat of the body was not increaſed very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially; the thirſt was only in a moderate degree, but there was much nauſea, an averſion to food, a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to faint in an erect poſture, deep and heavy ſighing, tremor of the tongue, and a ſad and deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate of the eye and countenance. 8. The ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of fever abated towards morning, and a remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though by no means a diſtinct one, took place. The pulſe became ſomewhat ſlower and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded; the ſighing and anxiety abated a little, and there was evidently a ſtate of greater eaſe; though there ſtill remained marks of great debility, and ſigns
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028890_0288_0FDE6009843BA610"/>
of ſpaſmodic ſtricture on the ſurface of the body. The heat was lower than it uſually is in health. About five in the evening the ſymptoms, which had prevailed in the former paroxyſms, returned again, but with conſiderable aggravation. The head was affected with delirium, and there was a conſiderable degree of tremor and ſtarting. 9. Eaſier in the morning, though the remiſſion was in no degree more complete than the former. About the uſual hour in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame ſymptoms returned with aggravation. 10. The remiſſion as the former; the heat of the body below natural; the pulſe obſcure and frequent; the ſigns of debility very great. The exacerbation returned again at the uſual hour; the paroxyſm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſomewhat more violent; the delirium was higher, the heat greater, and the pulſe acquired rather more ſtrength and fulneſs. 11. Eaſier in the morning, with a remiſſion in every reſpect as complete as the former; the pulſe diſtinct, and rather more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded; and, upon the whole, an appearance of rather more vigour. The paroxyſm was renewed in the evening as uſual. 12. Remiſſion in the morning rather more complete: more vigour in the pulſe. The exacerbation as uſual. 13. In the morning, inſtead of the uſual remiſſion, there appeared marks of a complete and final criſis; the ſighing, which had been troubleſome throughout the courſe of the diſeaſe, vaniſhed; the eye and countenance aſſumed their uſual ſerenity and cheerfulneſs, the pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſlower, ſofter, and more expanded; and the tongue parted with its coat or covering. The above is an inſtance of fever with ſymptoms of ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous affection.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Sergeant Negli, on the 2d of November, about eight in the morning, was ſeized with horror, ſhivering, and other Symptoms, which are uſual in the acceſſion of fevers. The not fix did not run very
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028890_0289_0FDE60946F53B518"/>
high, and before evening the paroxyſm was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably abated. 3. This patient is now in the ſtate of remiſſion, the heat of the body is not greater than natural; but the caſe ſeems to be attended with ſome ſymptoms which are not very common in the fevers of this country. The countenance is clouded, dark, and grim; the appearance of the eye is ſad and deſponding; and he expreſſes an uneaſineſs in his feelings which is not eaſily accounted for. 4. The paroxyſm returned about four in the morning. It was greatly more violent than the preceding; and though it might be ſaid to remit very completely, if we judge by the heat of the body and ſtate of the pulſe; yet there ſtill remained ſome uncommon and unpleaſant feelings. The eye and countenance were not only dark and deſponding, but the tongue was covered with a ſlimy mucous coat, through which the red ſurface appeared obſcurely; there were ſtrange and unaccountable twitchings of the ſtomach and bowels, diſturbed ſleep, frightful dreams, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boding apprehenſions. 5. A paroxyſm came on this evening near twelve hours ſooner than it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. After expreſſing an eaſineſs at ſtomach, and throwing up ſome matter of a dark colour, he was ſuddenly ſeized with a ſtupor and inſenſibility, from which he could not be rouſed by all the applications of art. He died in about ſixteen hours. This caſe affords an inſtance of fever with marks of a peculiar malignity. The appearances of danger were ſudden and unexpected; and, as it was among the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the kind which I had ſeen, I was diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and in ſome degree confounded at the event.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Thomſon a young man aged twenty, after more than uſual exerciſe in the heat of the ſun, was ſeized with ſickneſs, ſhiverings, and other ſigns of fever, about nine o'clock in the morning of the 3d of February. The pulſe was hard, frequent, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028890_0290_0FDE600F1B26B6D0"/>
irritated; the eye was ſad, and ſometimes gliſtening; the countenance fluſhed, but rather dark and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt; the reſpiration hurried; nauſea was troubleſome, with a good deal of anxiety and reſtleſſneſs. The paroxyſm continued long, and did not indeed go off very perfectly at laſt. 4. Reſted but indifferently; is now ſomewhat eaſier, though the remiſſion is far from being perfect; the thirſt is conſiderable; the tongue dry and foul, the ſtomach loathes all ſorts of food; and he ſeems to be much diſtreſſed with flatus and ructus; the ſtools are dark-coloured and foetid; the pulſe is more frequent than natural, hard and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated, and the ſkin is only partially moiſt. 5. An exacerbation of fever happened about nine in the morning. The ſymptoms were of the ſame kind as in the firſt paroxyſm, only ſomewhat more violent in degree. The anxiety at ſtomach was particularly diſtreſſing, and there appeared ſtill more evident marks of putreſcent tendency in the alimentary canal, 6. An uneaſy night: an imperfect and obſcure remiſſion; the gums redder than they naturally are: the eye has a gliſtening appearance, and the countenance is ſtill confuſed and clouded: the tongue is dry; the thirſt great; and ructus and flatus are very diſtreſſing: the pulſe ſtill irritated and quick: there is not any very remarkable diſpoſition to faint in an erect poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the ſtools foetid. 7. The exacerbation returned about the ſame hour as on the fifth, and with ſtill greater aggravation: the ſymptoms of diſtreſs in the ſtomach and bowels were particularly alarming; with nauſea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idoroſe belchings, and large watery foetid ſtools. 8. Somewhat eaſier in the morning, though the remiſſion can only be ſaid to be obſcure. 9. The exacerbation happened at the ſame hour as on the ſeventh, and continued for nearly the ſame length of time. 10. Inſtead of obſcure remiſſion, marks of final criſis are now evident; the pulſe is returned nearly to its natural ſtate; the eye and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028890_0291_0FDE5E43580B1B08"/>
countenance have aſſumed their uſual ſerenity; the ſkin is moiſt, and gives no marks of remaining ſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic ſtricture; the anxiety and ructus have ceaſed; and the ſtate of the ſtomach and bowels appears to be almoſt natural. The above is an inſtance of fever, in which there were very evident ſigns of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſcent tendency in the alimentary canal; even ſome obſcure marks of its progreſs in the general ſyſtem, complicated, however, with an irritated ſtate of the vaſcular ſyſtem, or ſuch ſymptoms as might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as belonging to the apparent inflammatory diatheſis.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) Cunningham, a ſailor, aged twenty-five, was ſeized on the 5th of July, about five in the evening, with ſickneſs, ſhiverings, head-ach, and the other uſual ſigns of the remitting fever of the country. Its more diſtreſſing ſymptoms were nauſea and vomiting. 6. The remiſſion is tolerably diſtinct; but there is ſtill a good deal of head-ach, thirſt, and ſigns of debility; the tongue is dry, and the pulſe is more frequent than natural. The paroxyſm returned about five in the evening with increaſed vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, accompanied with ſevere retching, and copious vomiting of bilious matter. 7. Better in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the vomiting has ceaſed, and the remiſſion is tolerably diſtinct. The exacerbation returned at the uſual hour, with the ſame diſtinguiſhing ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of copious bilious diſcharges. 8. Remiſſion in the morning as uſual; the exacerbation in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the preceding, with diſtreſſing and ſevere vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting. 9. The uſual remiſſion in the morning. The paroxyſm likewiſe recurred in the evening about the uſual time, but not with the uſual ſymptoms. Inſtead of vomiting of bilious matters, there was ſome degree of delirium, tremors, ſtartings, and other ſymptoms of nervous affection. 10. Theſe ſymptoms remitted in the morning, but there ſtill
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028890_0292_0FDE60150122C580"/>
remained ſigns of great irritability and weakneſs. The ſame train of ſymptoms returned again in the evening: the delirium and tremors were ſtill in a higher degree; the pulſe was ſmall and frequent; and there was occaſionally a great diſpoſition to faint in an erect poſture. 11. Better in the morning, though there are not yet any marks of criſis. The exacerbation returned again in the evening, with ſymptoms ſimilar to thoſe of the preceding paroxyſm. 12. Remiſſion in the morning ſimilar to the former. Exacerbation in the evening rather more violent. 13. Remiſſion as the former; the pulſe however ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be rather fuller than it has been ſince this change happened in the circumſtances of the diſeaſe. The paroxyſm returned at the uſual hour ſtill more violent, though with greater marks of vaſcular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement. 14. Evident marks of criſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the tongue begins to part with its covering; the eye and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance appear clear and animated; the pulſe is ſlower and fuller; and the ſtate of the ſkin does not give any indication of exiſting ſpaſmodic ſtricture. This caſe preſents an inſtance of fever, the firſt part of the courſe of which was diſtinguiſhed by uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bilious diſcharges during the time of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms; the latter part of it by affection of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſyſtem.</p>

               <p n="1">1. As I mentioned before that we attain more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate ideas from the detail of particular caſes than from general hiſtories; I therefore relate the method of cure, which was purſued in thoſe examples which are deſcribed in the ſixth chapter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Lennox.—On the 4th of December, or ſecond day of the diſeaſe, the ſolution of ſalts with a ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of emetic tartar was given by a wine glaſs full at a time, till it operated plentifully. 5. Some powders of nitre and camphire. 6. Two ſcruples of bark were given every two hours during the remiſſion, with an injunction that the nitrous powders be repeated dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of the paroxyſm. 11. The above plan was perſiſted in till marks of criſis appeared. Not more than one ounce of bark was given during all the remiſſions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Henley.</hi> 7. The uſual ſolution of ſalts was given, but without any addition of emetic tartar. It operated plentifully. 8. The bark was begun this morning, with injunctions that it be adminiſtered every two hours during the remiſſions. 9. A bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was applied to the back of the head and neck, with a bolus of camphire, opium, and valerian. Wine was ordered, together with the bark, as ſoon as the remiſſion ſhould begin to appear. This plan was perſiſted in till the criſis arrived, which was on the 13th.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Negli.</hi> The patient was purged on the 3d with the uſual ſolution of ſalts, to which was added ſo conſiderable a portion of emetic tartar, that it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe operated by vomit. 4. Bark was given in the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028890_0294_0FDE601A27C029A8"/>
uſual quantity, and at the uſual intervals. 5. As ſoon as the fever came on, bliſters were applied to the head, and likewiſe to the legs; but they produced no perceivable effect. The patient died, and probably fell a ſacrifice to the diſeaſe, from my not having early enough perceived the malignity of its nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Thompſon.</hi> 4th, The ſolution of ſalts with eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic tartar was adminiſtered in the preſent caſe as it had been done in the others. It operated plentifully, but had no material effect upon the diſeaſe. 5. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line draughts in the ſtate of efferveſcence were given frequently. Bark and wine were ordered in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, with as much lemonade as the patient choſe to drink. 9. Glyſters of cold water, impregnated with fixed air, were employed two or three times with apparent benefit. 10. The bark, wine, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line draughts were given liberally, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the diſeaſe ſeemed to complete its natural courſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Cunningham.—6. The nauſea and vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were ſo diſtreſſing in the firſt paroxyſm, that, in compliance with the patient's earneſt entreaties, I conſented to give an emetic. 7. The ſymptoms were aggravated, and the emetic was repeated but without advantage. 9. Anodynes were given during the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm with ſaline draughts in the act of efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. They moderated the vomiting but did not entirely remove it. Bliſters were applied to the head and legs; bark and wine were given in conſiderable quantity; but the diſeaſe continued till the 14th with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out material alteration.</p>

               <p n="1">1. As the cold bathing, which I have ſo ſtrongly recommended in the cure of fevers, has an exterior appearance of being a raſh and hazardous remedy, I ſhall relate ſome caſes which may enable the reader to judge more preciſely of its real effects. Cold-bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I may remark, appears to have been occaſionally employed by the Greek and Roman phyſicians, after the time of the Emperor Auguſtus; but I was only a young man when I went out to the Weſt-Indies, and cannot pretend to ſay that I was acquainted with the writings of thoſe phyſicians, or that I poſſeſſed much knowledge of diſeaſes, except the little that could be retained from a curſory hearing of univerſity lectures. The firſt hints of this practice were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accidental, and aroſe from a converſation I had with the maſter of the veſſel, in which I went paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger. This perſon commanded a tranſport in the war 1756, and was preſent at the ſiege of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah. As he was talking one day of the ſtate of the fleet, he mentioned accidently, that ſome men were ſent aboard of his ſhip ill of fevers; ſeveral of whom, he obſerved, jumped into the ſea during the dilirium which attended the paroxyſms of the diſeaſe. Some of them, as might be expected, were drowned; but the moſt part of thoſe who were recovered from the waves appeared to be greatly benefited by the ducking. The fact, which, from the veracity of the man, I thought I could depend upon, ſtruck me ſtrongly, and I reſolved, in my own mind, to bring it to the teſt of experiment as ſoon as an opportunity ſhould offer: neither was it long after my arrival in Jamaica, that I had occaſion to viſit a ſailor whoſe ſituation ſeemed to juſtify ſuch a trial. The poor
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028890_0296_0FDE620C788E0318"/>
man was aboard of a ſhip, which lay at anchor about a mile from the ſhore. He had been ill two days; the delirium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; his eyes were red and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; his reſpiration was hurried; he was anxious and reſtleſs in a high degree, whilſt together with thoſe marks of excitement, he was occaſionally languid and diſpoſed to faint. His ſkin being dirty furniſhed an oſtenſible excuſe for trying this remedy. But it was previouſly thought proper to draw ſome blood from the arm; which being done, ſome buckets of ſalt water were daſhed on the ſhoulders. He was now laid in bed: a copious ſweat enſued, ſucceeded by a diſtinct remiſſion, and a total change in the nature of the ſymptoms. The ſucceſs I met with in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was more than I had expected; I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore encouraged to try the ſame mode of bathing in a perſon who came under my care ſome weeks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and who had been ill of a fever ſix or ſeven days. This patient had been bled and bliſtered;—emetics and cathartics had been likewiſe employed, and bark had been given in the uſual manner, for the three laſt days. The fever, however, had now in a great meaſure loſt its type. The man was low and languid; his eyes were dim; his viſion indiſtinct;—his pulſe was ſmall and frequent, and, when the head was raiſed from the pillow, not to be felt. Though it did not appear that he could reaſonably be expected to live long, I ſtill wiſhed to get him conveyed to the deck, that a trial might be made of the effects of cold bathing; but the ſituation was ſo tickliſh, that I felt ſome uneaſineſs in ſetting about it. At laſt he was lifted through the hatch-way in a blanket, though I muſt confeſs that I was not without apprehenſions that he might die under my hands. Some wine was then poured down his throat; and he was ſprinkled with cold ſalt water, as he lay on the deck. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be ſomewhat invigorated by this proceſs, he was raiſed up very gently, and ſeveral buckets of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028890_0297_0FDD22A371B00050"/>
the ſea-water were daſhed about his head and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. He was then laid in bed; the pulſe ſoon became large and full. I left him in a copious ſweat, and was agreeably ſurpriſed next day to find him ſitting on the deck, to which he had walked on his own feet. I ſhall only mention another inſtance of the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of cold bathing in the fevers of the Weſt-Indies, which is perhaps more deciſive than either of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. A boy, aged fourteen, had been ill of a fever ſeven or eight days. Nothing had been omitted, in point of treatment, which is uſual to be done in ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes. Bark and wine had been carried as far as could be ſerviceable, or even ſafe; yet death ſeemed to be approaching faſt. The ſucceſs of cold bathing, in ſome inſtances ſimilar to the preſent, ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded my expectation that I was induced to make trial of it in the caſe before me, though I was not altogether without apprehenſions that death might be the conſequence of the attempt. The buſineſs, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was accompliſhed without accident; and next day the boy was able, not only to ſit up in bed, but even to walk over the floor. After inſtances ſo unequivocal as the above, it would be ſuperfluous to mention any others. I ſhall only add, that I have tried the remedy, in various ſituations, always with ſafety, generally with aſtoniſhing ſucceſs; ſo that I cannot forbear recommending it even at an early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, in the fevers of the Weſt-Indies. It commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates tone and vigour to the powers of life, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes irritability in a degree far ſuperior to all other cordials or ſedatives. The bathing was managed in the following manner: the water, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be of a refreſhing degree of coolneſs, was generally daſhed by means of a bucket on the head and ſhoulders. It was likewiſe found that its good effects were heightened, in ſome caſes, by previous bleeding, and by the previous uſe of warm bathing. This may ſeem a raſh practice to thoſe who argue
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028890_0298_0FDD22A4F8260218"/>
without experience; but, ſetting aſide the authority of the ancients, we find it confirmed by the example of a perſon who was not a phyſician, and who, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be ſuppoſed to be leſs under the influence of a favourite opinion from which he might be led to diſguiſe the truth. Buſbequius, who was ſent on an embaſſy to Soliman the Great, was obliged to travel to Amaſia, where the Sultan then ſojourned. In his return home he was ſeized with a continued fever, and very ſeverely harraſſed by it. The diſeaſe gained ſo much ground during the journey, that he found it neceſſary to ſtop at Conſtantinople to attend to the recovery of his health. The practice which was adopted to effect this may appear to be ſingular, and by many, perhaps, will be thought to be hazardous and raſh. He mentions, that, after enjoying the luxury of warm bathing, he was ſuddenly ſprinkled with cold water. His words are, "Idem, ſcilicet, Quaquelbenus me a balneo exeuntem frigida perfun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debat, quae res etſi erat moleſta, tamen magnope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> juvabat." (Iter. Conſtant. p.) His phyſician, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelbenus, who ſeems to have been a man of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent judgment and careful obſervation, had probably learnt the practice in his travels in Aſia, as it does not appear to have been commonly known in Europe at that time.</p>

               <p n="1">1. But beſides theſe teſtimonies of phyſicians, in favour of the practice of drenching with cold water, the memoirs of Baron Trenck furniſh us with a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and very convincing proof of the efficacy of this remedy, in extinguiſhing, almoſt like a charm, the violence of a burning fever. The Baron, when ill of a fever in the priſon at Madgeborough, unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately broke the pitcher which contained his daily allowance of water. The fever was violent, and he ſuffered the moſt inexpreſſible torments of thirſt, for the ſpace of twenty-four hours. When the uſual ſupply was brought to him next day, he ſeized the pitcher with eagerneſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d drank the water with ſuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dity, and in ſo great quantity as is ſcarcely cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. The conſequence was a total removal of the diſeaſe. To this I might add an inſtance, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to myſelf at Savanna in Georgia, in the year 1779. In the exceſſive hot weather of the month of July, I was ſeized with the endemic of the country, in a more violent degree than was commonly ſeen. In the third paroxyſm of the diſeaſe, my deſire for cold water was ravenous. A pitcher of it was drawn from the pump, which I drank off inſtantly without the leaſt abatement of the thirſt. The draught was repeated in a few minutes, in quantity not leſs than a quart. The thirſt was effectually quenched, and the fever ſeemed to vaniſh. But though the fever appeared to be extinguiſhed as it were by a charm; yet the ſtomach and hypochondria became diſtended, yellowneſs of the eye and countenance ſucceeded, with a conſiderable degree of debility which remained for two or three days. I muſt, however, remark with regard to this caſe, that the effects were not the ſame as they have been uſually reported to be by
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028890_0300_0FDE60A1EF5D07D0"/>
authors. The fever was extinguiſhed; but neither vomiting, ſweat, or any other ſenſible evacuation enſued. The ancients, I may further obſerve, ſeem to have adminiſtered cold drink only in the advanced ſtate of fever, when ſigns of coction began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; in which caſe, it is impoſſible to form a certain opinion of its preciſe ſucceſs. That cold water may be employed with effect, it is neceſſary that the thirſt be intenſe, perhaps that it be purpoſely provoked, and that it be fully and complete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y ſatiated. If managed in this manner, it probably will not often fail of extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the fever; yet I muſt not omit to mention, that unleſs it is managed with a great deal of caution and judgment, it may alſo often irrecoverably extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the powers of life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In ſupport of this opinion, I ſhall mention a caſe, which fell under my own obſervation about a twelvemonth ago. I was called to a young man, a ſailor, ill of a fever of a very dangerous and alarming kind. It was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> day of the diſeaſe before I ſaw him. He had not been hitherto in the leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by any thing that was tried; neither did any remedy which I could think of, though employed with almoſt deſperate boldneſs, in any degree check the progreſs of the diſeaſe. The power of ſpeech was loſt, and even ſwallowing was performed with difficulty; the eye was languid, nay almoſt without motion; the countenance was ghaſtly; and many livid ſpots, ſome of them nearly the ſize of a ſix-pence, made their appearance on different parts of the body. I propoſed bathing, and the friends of the young man, conſidering the ſituation as deſperate, conſented that I ſhould make a trial of it; more, perhaps, to comply with my deſire, than from expectation of any benefit that might reſult from it. But in ſetting about it, it unfortunately happened, that an utenſil proper for the purpoſe could not be procured, ſo that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028890_0301_0FDE60A881FACA48"/>
we were compelled to be contented with a general fomentation. This was applied in as complete a manner as circumſtances would permit. A blanket was ſoaked in warm ſalt water, and the body was wrapped in it from head to foot. In a ſhort time the ſkin became ſoft and warm, ſweat began to flow; the eye and countenance began to reſume their anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had been almoſt extinguiſhed, the pulſe roſe; ſwallowing was performed with leſs difficulty; and next day the colour of the ſpots was evidently brighter. So far the change was favourable; but a regular ſupply of wine and cordials having been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected during the following night, the pulſe ſunk, and things returned nearly to their former ſituation. The fomentation was again repeated, in conſequence of which the extremities and ſurface of the ſkin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came warm and moiſt, an effect which was no ſooner produced, than the blanket was ſuddenly removed, and the face and breaſt, particularly, were ſprinkled with cold water, in which a large portion of ſalt was diſſolved. The cold had the effect to cauſe the patient to ſhrink at the firſt, yet in a ſhort time he appeared to be refreſhed very remarkably. The powers of life grew gradually ſtronger; though the marks of criſis were not very evident for ſeveral days. To the above I might add ſome other inſtances, where effects were ſimilar; but I avoid ſwelling the notes to too great extent, by entering into particular details. I ſhall therefore only obſerve in general, that cold bathing was uſually of ſervice. It imparted general tone and vigour to the powers of life, and by increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the activity of the vaſcular ſyſtem, probably ſometimes rendered the criſis complete, where it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally would not have been ſo; but I cannot venture to ſay that I ever carried it ſo far that the diſeaſe could be ſaid to be precipitately extinguiſhed by it.</p>

               <head>NOTES TO THE CHAPTER UPON YELLOW FEVER.</head>
               <p>(<hi>a</hi>) IN compliance with the language of medical authors, I have deſcribed the following diſeaſe under the name of Yellow Fever, though I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſenſible, that the appellation is not by any means proper. There are ſome inſtances of the diſeaſe perhaps where yellowneſs does not at all appear, and in no one does it ordinarily ſhew itſelf till the latter ſtages. I know alſo that moſt of the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of Jamaica conſider it only as an aggravated ſpecies of the remittent; the common endemic of hot climates. It appeared to me I muſt confeſs in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent light; but I ſhall attempt to deſcribe the two diſeaſes accurately, and leave it to the reader to judge for himſelf. It may not however be improper in this place to take notice of the opinion of Dr. Moſeley. Dr. Moſeley has lately written a treatiſe on this diſeaſe, and endeavoured to perſuade us that it is no other than the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or ardent fever of the ancients. But the yellow fever of the Weſt-Indies, by Dr. Moſeley's own confeſſion, is in ſome manner peculiar to ſtrangers newly arrived in tropical climates. The <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028890_0303_0FDE60B473EFE9E8"/>
natives or foreigners: in fact it has not, as far as I can perceive, any claim to be conſidered as a diſtinct ſpecies of diſeaſe. If I rightly underſtand the ſpirit of Hippocrates, or the deſcription of the ſtill more accurate Aretaeus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in reality is only an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental condition of the common endemic of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where the force of the fever is chiefly exerted upon the ſtomach and alimentary canal. In this manner it appears frequently in Jamaica, and in the ſouthern provinces of America. In the hot months of ſummer, it appears occaſionally in every climate: and is not neceſſarily accompanied with, nor does it depend upon a general inflammatory diatheſis of the ſyſtem for its exiſtence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Authors ſeem generally to have attributed the black colour of the vomitings obſerved in this diſeaſe to blood effuſed into the cavity of the ſtomach; but the falſity of this opinion is ſufficiently proved by the appearances which are obſerved on diſſection.</p>
