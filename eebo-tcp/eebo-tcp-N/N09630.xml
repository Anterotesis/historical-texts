            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>REASONS WHY The People called QUAKERS do not pay TYTHES.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. BECAUSE Tythes were appointed by God, only under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, for the Portion of the <hi>Levites</hi> in lieu of their Inheritance in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as well as for their Service in the Temple, which being long aboliſhed and deſtroyed, all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to pay Tythe, as of God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ceaſed therewith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe being a Part of the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law, which was abrogated by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's offering himſelf once for all a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World, to pay or receive Tythes now, is to continue that in Part, which he came to aboliſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe we are of the Judgment, all compulſory Maintenance of Miniſters is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus our great Lord and Law-giver, who firſt and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others ſhould be heard in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012257_0004_0F8A6BD5F710BDA0"/>
and whoſe Injunction we are of Opinion virtually prohibits the Practice under the Goſpel, as the ſame is expreſſed in his Charge to the firſt Miniſters thereof, <hi>Matth.</hi> x. 8. <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe we find no Precept nor Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent in the New Teſtament for the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or paying of Tythes: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we underſtand the Payment of Tythes, and all forced Maintenance of Miniſters to be in direct Oppoſition to the Apoſtolical Doctrine and Practice, as the ſame are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the ſacred Writings of that Age,<note place="margin">Acts xx. 33, 34, 35.</note> and evidently appears from the following concurring Scriptures. <hi>I have, ſaith</hi> Paul, <hi>coveted no Man's Silver or Gold, or Apparel; yea, you yourſelves know, that theſe Hands have miniſtred unto my Neceſſities, and to thoſe that are with me, I have ſhewed you, that ſo labouring you ought to ſupport the Weak, For ye remember, Brethren,</hi>

                     <hi>our Labour and Travail, for labouring Night and Day, becauſe we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached unto you the Goſpel of God. For we behaved not ourſelves diſorderly among you,</hi>

                     <hi>neither did we eat any Man's Bread for nought but wrought with Labour and Travail Night and Day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you;</hi> and again,

                     <hi>verily that when I preach the Goſpel I may make the Goſpel of Chriſt without Charge that abuſe not my Power in the Goſpel.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> who well underſtood his great Maſter's Mind herein, writes thus to thoſe who had been called to the ſpiritual O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight of the Churches. <hi>Feed the Flock of God which is among you, taking the Overſight thereof, not by Conſtraint,</hi>

                     <hi>but willingly, not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready mind, neither as being Lords over God's Heritage, but being Enſamples to the Flock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Becauſe by Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Selden</hi>'s Hiſtory of Tythes, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that Tythes were not claimed, or ſaid in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church for the three firſt Centuries.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Becauſe Tythes were one of the many Innovations and Impoſitions introduced in the Church, in the Night of groſs Darkneſs and Apoſtacy from the original Purity, and as ſuch to be rejected, withſtood and teſtified againſt in the Reformation or Return from the Apoſtacy.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Becauſe Tythes for the ſole Uſe of the Pariſh-Prieſt obtained not till about the 13th Century, when they were appointed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012257_0005_0F8A6BD7F7CB0908"/>
to be ſo paid by a decretal Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Becauſe the Ordinance of the Pope, directing the Payment thereof, appears a plain Contradiction to the Ordinance of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, whoſe Ordinances in point of Conſcience, we are bound to obey.</p>
                  <p>"But we find it is urged againſt us, that the Clergy do not now claim Tythe by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, but as the Proviſion for their Support appointed by the Laws of the Land; that although they were formerly granted by Princes or People bigotted to <hi>Popery,</hi> and blinded by miſguided Zeal, or paid in Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Ordinances of <hi>Popes or Popiſh</hi> Councils: Yet being now the Grant of the Parliament, and the Payment thereof by the Legiſlature ordained and made a Part of the Laws of the Land; it is the Duty of all, as Subjects to comply therewith, and to pay or ſet out their Tythe as the Law directs."</p>
                  <p>To this we anſwer, that we pay all due Reſpect to the Laws of the Land, and where for Conſcience-ſake, we cannot actively comply with the Law, we have patiently ſubmitted to the Penalties annexed to the Non-compliance therewith: And when theſe Penalties become greivous, we have, with proper Reſpect, not thought it unreaſonable
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012257_0005_0F8A6BD7F7CB0908"/>
or unbecoming us, to lay our <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Caſe before Parliament, in order to ſeek Redreſs.</p>
                  <p>But this Objection appears to us more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than ſolid: The National Laws in this Particular are grounded on Conſiderations inadmiſſible by us, they enforce the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tythes on the Suppoſition of Divine Right, as <note n="*" place="bottom">Preamble to the Act 32 Hen. VII.</note> 
                     <hi>due to God and holy Churh,</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore claims Tythe by the Laws, virtually claims them as due by Divine Right, for the Law, as far we underſtand, grants them on no other Conſiderations, and therefore our Reaſons againſt paying them are not invalidated by the Reaſoning of ſuch as urge the Law of the Land againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Yet further our Scruple is really conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, we think our Saviour hath utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed Tythes, with the ceremonial Law to which they belonged, and hath virtually prohibited all extorted Maintenance to Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſters; that his immediate Followers ſo believed and ſo acted is evident to us from the whole Tenor of their Writings: that his Authority in his Church is ſuperior to every human Authority, we preſume will be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally allowed; that no Man or Body of Men as Men are infallible, is a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Principle; and that neither the Magiſtrate
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012257_0006_0F8A6BD96CEF9DC8"/>
nor the Legiſlature, more than any other Men can anſwer for our doing or omitting, what in Conſcience we believe to be our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>On theſe clear Principles we think our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves juſtified in not paying Tythes, in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding our active Compliance with the Laws of the Land whieh enjoin us to pay them, and, declining voluntarily to contribute in any Way to the forced Support of Miniſters: On the ſame Principles, we allow no Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends for the Support of our own.</p>
                  <p>We admit the Power of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and the Obligation of human Laws their full Scope in Civil Society, as far as they regard meerly Civil Matters, and ſo far we pay full Submiſſion thereto, reſerving to God the Things which are God's, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the ſole Dominion over the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; whoever will carry his Reaſoning from the Force of human Laws farther than this, in our Apprehenſion, will extend it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Limits of Scripture, of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and thoſe of the Reformation.</p>
                  <p>From Scripture, where human Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted the Divine Law in the Conſcience, we have ſundry Inſtances of Divine Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012257_0006_0F8A6BD96CEF9DC8"/>
attending the preferring of the Divine Law.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the Caſe of <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> who refuſed Compliance with the King's Decree in falling down to worſhip the golden Image. 2dly, Of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who in Diſobedience to the Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> with his Windows open towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> prayed and gave Thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. 3dly, In that of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who, when commanded by the Rulers of the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſpeak no more in the name of Jeſus, durſt not yield Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Command, reaſoning thus: "Whether it be right in the Sight of God to hearken unto you more than to God, judge ye·" <hi>Acts</hi> iv. 19. On this Principle the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Martyrs ſealed their Teſtimony with their Blood; and on this Principle the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Reformers expired in the midſt of the Flames.</p>
                  <p>We truſt this Objection is now fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered on inconteſtible Principles, and that no injurious Inſinuations can be fairly drawn from our Reaſoning, as if we meant any Parallel between the Rulers of thoſe Times, and our own: We are fully ſenſible of our Obligation to the preſent Government, for their Indulgences to us: Our Conduct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks our Diſpoſition: To Facts as the beſt

                  <head>BRIEF REMARKS, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>THE modern Advocates for Eccleſiaſtical Impoſitions alledge,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Tithes are become in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Demand of a <hi>civil Nature,</hi> becauſe they are given by the Laws of the Land.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they are <hi>a Debt juſtly due</hi> to the legal Claimants, for the ſame Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That they are <hi>equitable Demands,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every Tenant in the Kingdom, of whom they are required, is allow'd the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of them by his Landlord, in the Rent of his Farm.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From theſe Premiſes they infer, that ſuch as refuſe <hi>actually</hi> to pay them when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether they be of the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Claimants, or conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uos Diſſenters from them, act contrary to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012257_0009_0F8A6BDB4C0C4638"/>
moral Honeſty, and the Precepts of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which command Submiſſion to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Powers.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe Allegations appears to be founded upon a ſuppoſition, that Laws made by a civil Power render the Subjects of thoſe Laws of a civil Nature. But certainly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Matters do not change their Nature, and become civil, through any Exertion of human Authority concerning them.</p>
                  <p>Tithes were exacted in this Nation for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly upon Principles wholly ſuperſtitious, as particularly appears from the Grant of King <hi>Stephen;</hi> the Preamble to which runs in this manner:
<q>Becauſe through the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Divine Mercy, we know it to be ſo ordered, and by the Church's publiſhing it far and near, every Body has heard, that by the Diſtribution of Alms, Perſons may be abſolved from the Bonds of Sin, and acquire the Rewards of heavenly Joys. I <hi>Stephen,</hi> by the Grace of God King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being willing to have a Part with them <hi>who by an happy kind of Trading,</hi> exchange heavenly Things for earthly, and ſmitten with the Love of <hi>God,</hi> and for the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my own Soul, and the Souls of my Father and Mother, and all my Forefathers and Anceſtors,</q>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He then proceeds to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012257_0009_0F8A6BDB4C0C4638"/>
the Confirmation of Tithes and other Grants, for the peculiar Emolument of Eccleſiaſticks.</p>
                  <p>To claim Tithes as civil Dues becauſe they have obtained the Sanction of the civil Power, is not according to the Senſe of thoſe Laws upon which that Demand is founded. See Stat. 27th and 37th of <hi>Hen.</hi> viii. which after ſuppoſing them, in the Phraſe of thoſe Times, <hi>due to God and holy Church,</hi> and that withholding the Payment of them, is acting <hi>againſt right and good Conſcience,</hi> do not make an Aſſignment of Tithes to the Clergy, <hi>de novo,</hi> as a new Grant, but <hi>taking it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> that they are due to them <hi>by Divine Right, ex officio,</hi> or by virtue of their office, do therefore enforce the Payment of them. And accordingly, both theſe Statutes, and that of <hi>Edward</hi> vi. which is grounded upon theſe, reſtrain all Suits and Trials on account of Tithes to the eccleſiaſtical Courts; which demonſtrate they were <hi>not enacted as Dues of a civil Nature.</hi> Thus, theſe very Laws which are ſaid to render this Demand of a civil Nature, evidently imply the contrary, by preſuming it is of Divine Right; and as the Clergy claim Tithes upon the Authority of theſe Laws, they muſt claim them upon that Preſumption. If they have no Divine Right, they have therefore no Right at all. The Truth is, they have procured Power, by Laws grounded on erroneous Principles,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012257_0010_0F8A6BDC0CAF19D0"/>
to demand and force them out of the Hands of the Owners.</p>
                  <p>Tithes are not impoſed in the manner of a civil Tax. They are not paid to civil Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. They are founded on religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. The Intent of impoſing them is, to ſupport religious Miniſters in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of religious Duties. Being not requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a civil, but a religious Purpoſe, the Payment of them is to be treated as a Matter of religious Concern.</p>
                  <p>I with pleaſure acknowledge, that I am well aſſured, divers of the Clergy appear tender of exacting upon Diſſenters from the legal Eſtabliſhment, being neither willing to uſe Force upon Conſcience, nor to claim any Part of the Property of thoſe who receive no Obligation at their Hands. Yet the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of many ſufficiently evidence, they have not yet laid aſide the Practice <hi>of reaping where they have not ſown, and gathering where they have not ſtrawed.</hi> Notwithſtanding which, it is a certain Truth, that no other Miniſtry upon Earth but that of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> who were allow'd no landed Inheritances, appear to have been Divinely authorized to receive Tithes of the People. Theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having a Divine Command for them, had a Divine Right in them; yet were not impowered to take them by Force, but to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012257_0010_0F8A6BDC0CAF19D0"/>
receive them as an Offering from their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.<note place="margin">1 Sam. ii. 16, 17.</note> The juſt Condemnation of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi> is a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sentence upon all who ſucceed them in <hi>forcible Practices.</hi> In the fulneſs of Time, CHRIST,<note place="margin">Rom. x. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>who is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth,</hi> by the Introduction of <hi>Christianity,</hi> aboliſhed the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law and its Prieſthood,<note place="margin">Heb. vii. 12, 13.</note> with all the Services and Appropriations thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing. Since that Time, no Sett of Miniſters upon Earth can ſhew a Divine Right to the Tenth of other Men's Produce, on account of their Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>The Command of Our Lord to his Meſſengers is,<note place="margin">Mat. x. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>freely ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, freely give.</hi> This clearly intimates, his Miniſtry is not a ſcholaſtic, or human Acquiſition, that a Man may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſively and externally bred to, or that he ought to be bred to <hi>for a Livelihood,</hi> but <hi>the free gift of</hi> GOD <hi>for the People,</hi> and that it ought to be <hi>as freely diſpenſed to them</hi> by his Miniſters. Yet ſeeing it is juſt and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry theſe ſhould be provided for, when called from their proper Employments at Home, to attend the Service of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Abroad,<note place="margin">Ver. 10.</note> for <hi>the Workman is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Meat</hi>; therefore they have a Right to partake of what is ſet before them,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012257_0011_0F8A6BDCDAC23840"/>
and to accept ſuch Requiſites as are freely communicated to them, by thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them and their Doctrine, whoſe Duty it is to miniſter to their Neceſſities. Yet the Servants of CHRIST <hi>are not authoriz'd by him to demand, much leſs to force</hi> any Thing from <hi>thoſe who reject their Teſtimony.</hi> They are not by the Scriptures allow'd, either Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over their Faith, or over their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. This hath been the Uſurpation of after Times, under the grand Apoſtacy.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. As the Foundation upon which Tithes are exacted is not of a civil Nature, neither can they be a <hi>juſt Debt</hi> upon thoſe who are of diſtinct Societies in point of Religion from that of the Demanders. The <hi>Quakers</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, have no Connection with the legally eſtabliſhed Clergy, but in a natural or in a civil Relation. They are not of the ſame religious Society with them, therefore theſe are <hi>no Miniſters to them,</hi> and by conſequence, can have no equitable Demand upon them as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>The freeborn People, or civil Body of this Nation, ſince <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> gain'd the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant, conſiſts not of any one Sort of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, whether more or leſs in Number, but of many different religiouſly-connected Societies, each of whom has its own peculiar Miniſters. The Miniſters of any one of theſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012257_0011_0F8A6BDCDAC23840"/>
Societies, are not Miniſters to any other of theſe Societies; therefore no one particular Sett of theſe Miniſters can, with Propriety, be called the Clergy, or Miniſtry of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor any Demand be juſtly made upon the whole civil Body by them as ſuch; for they are Miniſters to no other Part of the Community, but that one religious Society they are joined to, and adopted by. And every Perſon freed from the Shackles of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and really diſpoſed to Uprightneſs and Impartiality, muſt eaſily diſcover the Reaſonableneſs of every ſuch Society's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting their own Miniſters, who think they ought to be maintained, without ſeeking to ſave their own Pockets, by <hi>forcibly obliging</hi> thoſe of other Societies to aſſiſt in defraying <hi>the Expences proper to themſelves only.</hi> And as it is reaſonable, it would not be leſs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, in that large religious Body, out of whom the Legiſlature and Magiſtracy are ſelected, to maintain their own Miniſters, without putting them upon, or allowing them in the diſagreeable and diſreputable Practice of diſtreſſing others for that Prupoſe. The Enjoyment of all the lucrative Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Government amongſt themſelves, added to their own Poſſeſſions, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well enable them to afford it. This would alſo contribute much to the Peace of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and the Security of private Familes, as it would prevent all future Occaſion to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012257_0012_0F8A6BDD8C07BA28"/>
a Spirit in the Clergy injurious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well as others, by entruſting them with a Power of an oppreſſive Nature, over the Liberty and Properties of thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly diſſent from them.</p>
                  <p>The encroaching Part of the Clergy have always adopted, with peculiar Fondneſs, the Words <hi>Right, Dues,</hi> and <hi>Property</hi>; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſtile their Demands by theſe Names, in order to impreſs them upon others as ſuch, and too many have been taken with the Snare. Theſe Terms are juſtly applicable to Inheritances fairly deſcended, to Poſſeſſions honeſtly acquired, or uprightly purchaſed. For in theſe the Proprietors have a juſt and moral Right, was there no external Law in Being to confirm it. To them juſt Law gives no Right, it only adds Security to Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. If by any Law this Property be render'd inſecure, or any Part thereof alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Proprietor againſt his Will, or without yielding him an Equivalent, ſuch Law is a Violation of Equity, which is GOD'S ſtanding Law, and muſt therefore be in its Nature null and void; for no human Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is divinely warranted to diſpenſe with the Law of Equity. And as <hi>an</hi> Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Writer obſerves, <note n="*" place="bottom">Animadverſions on a Pamphlet, intitled, 'The Rights of the Clergy of <hi>Ireland,' &amp;c.</hi> Page 25.</note>
                     <q>As I derive not my Property from the Laws, but only the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012257_0012_0F8A6BDD8C07BA28"/>
Security thereof, the Legiſlature cannot properly reaſſume it, as they never gave it; unleſs my Poſſeſſion thereof interfere with the publick Good, and then not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Equivalent.</q>
But this cannot be ſaid of ſuch Poſſeſſions as are only given to any by Law, to which there is a prior or juſter Claim in others.</p>
                  <p>An erroneouſly founded Law may autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize a Perſon to commit wrong with legal Impunity, but it cannot ſanctify the Act of wrong, nor juſtify the Actor in reality. If it could, there would be no Neceſſity to render an Equivalent to private Poſſeſſors, for the Damage done to their Eſtates in order to the publick Service. But certainly the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture judges Right, in impowering the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners and Truſtees it appoints to erect publick Buildings, or to lay out Roads, to make Compenſation to the Owners of private Property, for the Injury their Eſtates may ſuffer thereby. And why the Clergy ſhould be indulged with a Prerogative to act as if Wrong was Right in their Hands, is what the reſt of Mankind want a Reaſon for. 'Tis natural from their Station and Pretences, rather to expect a better, than a worſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from them than from others. But their Predeceſſors, by taking advantage of the People's Ignorance, and the Superſtition themſelves had introduced, in <hi>Popiſh</hi> Times,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012257_0013_0F8A6BDEB57C2768"/>
craftily obtained Laws in favour of their lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative and ambitious Views; and though theſe Laws ſtill remain in Being, yet their Foundation being wrong, they cannot be binding upon Conſcience ſo as to compel <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Obedience</hi>; becauſe thereby thoſe in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to whom they are enacted, would <hi>of Right</hi> be obliged to become <hi>Parties to Injuſtice even in their own Wrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have often been amuſed with an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Diſtinction between <hi>legal Juſtice</hi> and <hi>moral Righteouſneſs.</hi> But how can it be right to conſider <hi>Law</hi> as <hi>ſeperate from Equity,</hi> and yet call it <hi>Juſtice?</hi> 'Tis paying too great a Compliment to Power, at the Expence of Truth and Righteouſneſs; for what <hi>Juſtice</hi> can there be in <hi>Iniquity?</hi> If in any caſe legal Injunction differs from moral Right, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me ſo far from being right, that wherein it differs, it is wholly wrong; and no human Power hath Authority from GOD to ſupercede any Law of his, whether that which he writes in the Heart of Man, or that which is fairly gathered from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the New-Teſtament. All the Laws of Men inconſiſtent with either of theſe, are naturally void and of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> force, becauſe they are againſt <hi>a prior preceding indiſpenſable Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which all Men are under to their ſupreme Lord and Lawgiver.</hi> And, it is unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the Duty of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Legiſlators, to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012257_0013_0F8A6BDEB57C2768"/>
make the Laws agreeable to the Precepts and Doctrines of the Goſpel; otherwiſe the real practical <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who cannot yield actual Obedience to them, muſt be proportionably excluded from the Benefit of the Laws, whilſt the Time-ſerving Sycophant, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Conformiſt, and the inequitable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, reap the full advantage of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. It is alledg'd, that Tithes are equitable Claims, becauſe every Tenant is allowed the Value of them by his Landlord, in the Rent of his Farm.</p>
                  <p>Were this a real Fact in the Caſe of others, it has no relation to the <hi>Quaker,</hi> who makes no ſuch Bargain with his Landlord, nor who could accept of no ſuch Conditions, were they propoſed to him. He takes the Land ſimply as he finds it, and where it has the Incumbrance of Tithes upon it, he comes under no Obligation with his Landlord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to pay them, becauſe it is againſt his Conſcience to do it; but for Conſcience-ſake he peaceably ſuffers them to be taken from him. But this will not always content the Parſon. If he cannot force the <hi>Quaker</hi> into the Sin of Hypocriſy, by an active and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Delivery of Tithe againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he'll ſometimes abſurdly complain he is defrauded. Thus his Demand is not only for what he improperly ſtiles <hi>his Due,</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="unknown:012257_0014_0F8A6BDF46DAA768"/>
but alſo for what cannot poſſibly be due to any Man: <hi>the Sovereignty of other Men's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Compliance againſt Conſcience hath frequently been urged by Clerical Advocates, as a point of Gratitude neceſſarily due to the Government, and expected by it, in return for the Relief it hath in other Reſpects af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us. As to the Government, we have not been wanting affectionately to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our Obligations, and to render it any Service in our Power, conſiſtent with our religious Duty, and we cannot in reaſon imagine, that its View in eaſing our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in ſome Particulars, is to lay us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Obligation to violate them in others.</p>
                  <p>The Pretence of Tithes being paid by the Land, and therefore allow'd by the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord to his Tenant, that he may pay the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for him, is fallacious. For though the Proprietor may be obliged to let his Land for leſs than he might do, was not the Burden of Tithe upon it, 'tis not becauſe of any voluntary Contract between Landlord and Tenant, that the latter ſhall pay Tithe for the account of the former; nor is the Value left in the Tenant's Hands for that Purpoſe. Every conſiderate Perſon muſt readily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, <hi>it is not the Land,</hi> but <hi>the Increaſe</hi> that Tithes are taken out of; and that their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012257_0014_0F8A6BDF46DAA768"/>
is more or leſs, according to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of the Increaſe: And if the Landlord is a Loſer by reaſon of this Exaction, the Tenant is more ſo, the Tithe being taken out of his Increaſe, and in proportion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anthony Pearſon, in his great Caſe of Tithes,</hi> hath long ſince ſhewed, that it is not the Land which pays the Tithe, where there is Land in the Caſe, but the Produce which is raiſed by the Skill, Care, Expence, and Labour of the Occupier, in whoſe Power it is to make it <hi>much, little,</hi> or <hi>nothing,</hi> at his pleaſure. If he ſows it with Corn, it may happen, as it hath frequently done, that the Tithe is worth <hi>three times the Rent of the Land it grows upon.</hi> If he paſtures it with Sheep, the Tithe will be leſs; and leſs ſtill if he feeds it with Cows, or breeding Cattle. If he eats up his Graſs by Horſes, or barren Cattle, an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Rate is required. If he plants Wood, and lets it ſtand for Timber, or ſtocks it with Beaſts which are <hi>ferae Naturae,</hi> of a wild Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or lets his Land lie waſte, or eats his Meadow, or Corn ſtanding, no Tithe can be required. Theſe Inſtances evince, that Tithes are paid by the <hi>Stock,</hi> or <hi>perſonal Eſtate</hi> of the Occupier, and not by the Land, for which the Tenant has not an Equivalent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:012257_0015_0F8A6BE32C825538"/>Though the <hi>Quaker</hi> pay leſs Rent for a Farm with the Burden of Tithes upon it; than he might was it free from that Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, 'tis not by way of Agreement with his Landlord to pay Tithes for him, as will clearly appear by-and-by, but becauſe his Landlord cannot let it higher to any Tenant, as every one is ſenſible the Tenth of the Produce, raiſed upon ſuch Land, will be taken from him.</p>
                  <p>But was the Argument under Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a good one in any reſpect, it reaches not the Caſe where <hi>Quakers</hi> are the Land-Owners, nor where Land is out of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in Cities, corporate Towns, and other Places where no <hi>praedial</hi> Tithe ariſes, and therefore a <hi>Modus,</hi> or certain Value in ſtead of Tithe, is demanded of the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders as ſuch, for the Maintenance of the Clergy, as by Law eſtabliſh'd.</p>
                  <p>We have already ſeen, where Tithes are taken, it is entirely from the Produce of every Huſbandman's and Houſholder's Eſtate, whether real or perſonal, from whence this Portion of their Property is alienated meerly by Law. And if when private Property is thus alienated from the right Owner, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unjuſtly, it is then become the <hi>equitable Right</hi> of thoſe the Law hath aſſign'd it to, the Law in ſuch caſe doth not confirm and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012257_0015_0F8A6BE32C825538"/>
defend Right where it properly is, but <hi>changes Wrong into Right,</hi> and may upon the ſame Foundation, overturn all the private Property in the Kingdom, and cauſe it to change hands at pleaſure, to the Ruin of the Right Owners, and for the peculiar Emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe, in a ſeparate Intereſt, who may have Addreſs and Influence ſufficient to procure the Enaction of ſuch Laws in their favour. But ſurely this would be contrary to Equity, and that which would be totally wrong if wholly done, muſt be wrong in part ſo far as it goes, and will remain to be wrong ſo long as it is continued, If an Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance impoſed upon Land, or the Produce thereof, continue till it leſſens the Value of the Land, ſuch Incumbrance, can never <hi>by that Continuance, equitably</hi> become the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of its Procurers, though it may be forcibly poſſeſſed by them. If we put the Caſe fairly, we may readily perceive in whom the Right centers.</p>
                  <p>A Perſon ſtands poſſeſſed of an Eſtate in Land, either by juſt Inheritance, or fair Purchaſe, clear of all Incumbrance: A mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of artful Men, in combination for their own particular Intereſt, by untrue Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces procure a Law to impower them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and upon refuſal to ſeize a part of the Increaſe ariſing from the Occupation of this Land, without rendering the Occupier any
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012257_0016_0F8A6BE39E840300"/>
thing adequate for it: In conſequence of this Impoſition the Value of the Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes leſſen'd; ſo that during the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Burden, if it happens to be ſold, it muſt be diſpoſed of for leſs than its real Worth. Who in this Caſe is the Loſer? Certainly the <hi>Seller,</hi> and <hi>his rightly ſucceeding Heirs.</hi> If therefore the Purchaſer ſtands juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indebted to any Perſon on account of the Abatement in Price, occaſioned by the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, it cannot be to the <hi>Tithe-Claimer, who has no equitable Right</hi> in the Eſtate, but to the <hi>Seller who has.</hi> But if the Tithe-Claimant annually takes from the Purchaſer to the <hi>exact Amount,</hi> of the Seller's Loſs, in point of Equity, he ſtands indebted to the Seller for it. If he take <hi>more than that Amount</hi> from the Purchaſer, he ſtands indebted both to the Buyer and Seller. And if the Land-Owner, is oblig'd to let his Land at a Rent below its real Value, by reaſon of ſuch Impoſition, the Tithe-taker ſtands Debtor to him for the Amount of the Difference in his Rent; ſo he alſo doth to the Tenant, or Occupier, for all that is taken out of his Produce above this Difference. It is theirs in Equity, and muſt ever remain to be their Right, and the Right of their proper Heirs and Succeſſors, unleſs by Gift, Sale, or Demiſe, they alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it by their own Act, or Conſent, and can never equitably revert from one Impoſer to another, by virtue of human Law, which
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012257_0016_0F8A6BE39E840300"/>
whenever it differs from, and enforces againſt Equity, is unequal, and what is unequal is immoral, and by conſequence antichriſtian.</p>
                  <p>It has been alledg'd, that Becauſe the Buyer paysleſs for the Purchaſe of an Eſtate, the Produce of which is ſubjected to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Tithes, than he might do if it were not ſo, that he therefore <hi>conſents</hi> to the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them by making the Purchaſe; wherein he alſo <hi>avails himſelf</hi> of the Law, by the <hi>Abatement</hi> he receives in the Price.</p>
                  <p>That he who purchaſeth an Eſtate, the Produce of which is Titheable, pays leſs for it than if it had remained free from that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is true; but why? Becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a Rent of it anſwerable to the full Value: therefore it is worth no more to him than he gives for it. If a piece of Land is Tithe-free, the Buyer pays the full Value for it, and fixes a Rent accordingly. If it is liable to the Demand of Tithe, he pays leſs for the Purchaſe, and receives a Rent proportionably lower to the difference in Price: So that the Matter ſquares with the Landlord without his being affected with the Tithe. How then does he avail himſelf of the Law, in the Purchaſe, and bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under Obligation to pay Tithe, which in reality he does not pay? If any Perſon receives the Benefit of the <hi>Abatement,</hi> 'tis not
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012257_0017_0F8A6BE749EBE2F0"/>
the Landlord, but the Tithe-Exactor, who takes it from the Occupier; and the Loſs which accrues in the <hi>Abatement,</hi> falls upon the original Seller under the Incumbrance, and his Heirs. And where the Land-Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er occupies his own Eſtate, he is liable to that Demand, not as Land-Owner, but as Occupier; and if he ſtands equitably indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any Perſon, for the Abatement in the Purchaſe, it muſt be to thoſe in whom the Right, according to Equity, remains; that is, to the original Seller abovementioned, or to his rightly ſucceeeding Heirs; and not to thoſe Demanders whoſe Claim is founded on untrue Pretenſions, and exacted by Law againſt Equity.</p>
                  <p>To thoſe who plead the <hi>Gift of Tithes</hi> from former Poſſeſſors of the Land, or that alledge the <hi>Length of Time,</hi> the ſucceſſive Claimants have been in Poſſeſſion of theſe Impoſitions; I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No Anceſtor of mine had a Right to give away from me the Fruits of my Labour and Expence, which never could be his, for Purpoſes I cannot in Conſcience and Equity comply with. My miſled Predeceſſor never could be intitled to diſpoſe of my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Properly for me, before I exiſted, in ſupport of the prevailing Errors of his Age.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:012257_0017_0F8A6BE749EBE2F0"/>2. No length of Time, or term of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, can aboliſh the eternal Law of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor render that right which ſtands upon a wrong Foundation. Right and Wrong are not convertible Terms; nor is it in the Power, of Time, either to reverſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile their contrary Natures, which muſt always neceſſarily remain in their true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions.</p>
                  <p>We have alſo been told, that by voting for Repreſentatives to ſit in Parliament, we give our Conſent to all the Laws they make, and ought therefore to yield <hi>active Obedience</hi> thereunto without reſerve.</p>
                  <p>Though I cannot acquieſce in this Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet I am ſubject <hi>upon Principle,</hi> to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is enjoined by the Legiſlature, yielding active Obedience, when according to my Conſcience and paſſively ſubmitting when oppoſite thereto. But though I ſubmit to theſe Injunctions, I cannot eſteem them <hi>as my Act and Deed,</hi> when in my Conſcience I believe them to be wrong. That Elector who by giving his Voice for Repreſentatives, obliges himſelf <hi>actively</hi> to obey every Thing they may enact, eſpecially in religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, makes too full a ſurrender of his juſt Rights, to be warranted either by the Laws of God, or the Rules of right Reaſon; both
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012257_0018_0F8A6BE76E913BF0"/>
which determine the perfect Reſignation of the Conſcience to be due to God only.</p>
                  <p>By divers of the ſame Arguments, which I have already conſider'd, is the Demand upon us, for thoſe called <hi>Church-Rates,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to be defended. I ſhall therefore now, juſt briefly add the Grounds of our Scruple againſt the Payment of them.</p>
                  <p>We cannot look upon theſe, any more than the Stipends of the Clergy, as <hi>a civil Tax:</hi> Becauſe they are for the Support of Buildings pretended to be made holy by the Biſhop's Conſecration, and where ſuch a manner of Worſhip is practiced as we cannot join with; for buying, waſhing, and mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Surplices; for purchaſing Bells, Organs, and Books to pray and ſing by; for defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Expence of Entertainments for Prieſts, Church-wardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at Viſitations; and for Fees to Regiſters, Apparitors, and the like Attendants on ſuch an eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction as the Doctrine of the Goſpel doth not authoriſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Submiſſion</hi> required in the New-Teſtament to the higher Powers of the Earth, is not a Reſignation of the Rights of Conſcience, nor of that unalienable Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty therein which belongs to GOD only,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012257_0018_0F8A6BE76E913BF0"/>
into the Hands of Men.<note place="margin">1 Pet. i. 13.</note> '<hi>Tis a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake,</hi> either actively when agreeable to the Conſcience of the Subject, or paſſively when againſt it. This was the Subjection our Saviour led into, both by Precept and Example, and that his Apoſtles and true Followers practis'd through all Ages; of which the Perſecutions they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered are ſo many Proofs.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt therefore in Matters of religious Concern, Things remain to be impoſed on us, which we conceive to be contrary to moral Equity, and the Precepts of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, we muſt in Duty to the ſovereign Lord of all, continue to bear our Teſtimony againſt them, by our Non-compliance with them. For our Conſtancy in this reſpect, we are often reflected upon with Aſperity as <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>obſtinate,</hi> and aſſumingly called upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reſign our Principles, or to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act them in Practice; and ſo to render our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves either Cowards, or Hyprocrites.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the Charge of <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> I have already ſhewn to whom it properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, in theſe Caſes. And reſpecting <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy,</hi> what the Warmth of our Miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters calls by that opprobrious Name, when applied to us, we think, in propriety ſhould be ſtiled Firmneſs, or Conſtancy.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012257_0019_0F8A6BE8428E4C00"/>
Obſtinacy is an Inflexibility in the Wrong, againſt ſufficient Evidence. Firmneſs or Conſtancy, is a Perſeverance in the Right, through all the Attacks of Oppoſition. The firſt ariſeth from Ignorance, or Humour; the laſt from <hi>Principle.</hi> Upon <hi>this</hi> our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct reſpecting the Demands I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd is founded.</p>
                  <p>Our Principles, in brief, touching the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Miniſtry, are, that the true <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of CHRIST are the <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of CHRIST, therefore muſt be ſent by <hi>himſelf</hi>; that the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is <hi>the Miniſtration of the holy Spirit,</hi> either <hi>primarily</hi> by its imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Influence, or <hi>ſecondarily</hi> by inſtrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Means; therefore the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Diſpenſers of it muſt be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Spirit,<note place="margin">2 Cor. iii. 6.</note> and not of the Letter only, that conſequently their prime and eſſential Qualification is that of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in order to enable them to declare the Mind of GOD to the People,<note place="margin">1 Pet. iv. 10, 11.</note> and to ſpeak profitably to their preſent Conditions; and that, as they at Seaſons <hi>freely receive</hi> this true Qualification for the Miniſtry, they muſt in Duty admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it <hi>as freely,</hi> without any Stipulation for, or View to temporal Intereſt whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. How then can we conſiſtently receive, or actively ſupport a Miniſtry different from all this? An Order of Men who upon their
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012257_0019_0F8A6BE8428E4C00"/>
Entrance, pretend to receive the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> as a neceſſary Qualification to the Miniſtry, and declare <hi>they truſt they are inwardly moved by it to take that Office upon them,</hi> yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in their Speeches and Writings, at leaſt too generally, <hi>deny</hi> that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is either neceſſary to the Qualification of a Miniſter, or that it is now to be expected, or experienced, and even deride the very Profeſſion of it.<note place="margin">Rom. viii. 9.</note> Yet it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably true, that <hi>if any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt he is none of his</hi>; and conſequently cannot be a Miniſter of his.</p>
                  <p>If it be our Duty to walk in Sincerity, and to act in all things conſiſtent with our religious Principles, how can we <hi>actively</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Maintenance of a Miniſtry which denies and oppoſes them? How can we in oppoſition to the true Prophets, CHRIST, and his Apoſtles, actually ſupport ſuch as they concurrently declared againſt? Thoſe who run,<note place="margin">Jer. xxiii. 21 xiv. 14. 1. Pet. iv. 10, 11. Mat. vii. 7. Mic. iii. 11.</note> yet are not ſent of GOD, but one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who ſpeak not as the Oracles of GOD, but after their own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, or the Traditions and Injunctions of others; who make uſe of their Miniſtry as a Means to ſupply their Wants, or to gratify their Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice or Ambition, and have too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012257_0020_0F8A6BE8CC23E900"/>
been found impoſing and oppreſſing under the Sanction of Law, againſt the true Intent and Tenour of the Goſpel? Would not our actual Contribution to the Maintenance of ſuch, indicate an Approbation of them, and be a Confirmation of their Practices?</p>
                  <p>And how can we coherently aſſiſt in the Support of thoſe Formalities and Uſages in Religion and Worſhip, which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly concern'd to diſuſe? We profeſs it to be our indiſpenſable Duty, faithfully to follow that heavenly Principle which is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and unchangeable in its Nature. Can this admit us to pull down, what it led our Predeceſſors to build, with the Loſs of their Liberty and Properties, and divers of them with that of their Lives alſo? Is CHRIST di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided? Or, can he who is the ſame Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, To-day, and For-ever, change with the Times, and fluctuate with the unſtable Imaginations, and corrupt Intereſts of Men? To differ with the World in Profeſſion, and to coincide with it in Practice, is irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the Stability of Truth. If we are led by the Spirit of Truth into a profeſſed Diſſent, we ſurely diſown the Truth by a contrary Conduct; and whilſt our Friends are pained for us, to ſee our Weakneſs, our Adverſaries muſt deſpiſe us, to behold our Inconſiſtency.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="unknown:012257_0020_0F8A6BE8CC23E900"/>Seeing therefore, we cannot actively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with theſe Demands, without ſetting human Authority above Divine, without joining hands with things againſt our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to practice, and without falling into the Abſurdity of acting a Self-contradiction; notwithſtanding the Abuſes we receive from our Oppoſers, we muſt ſtill chuſe rather pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to ſuffer, than meanly to comply, or hyprocritically to conform.</p>
