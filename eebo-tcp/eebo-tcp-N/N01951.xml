            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ONE Objection made againſt the goodneſs of divine Providence which a late Learned Writer<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Sherlock's</hi> Diſcourſe of the Divine Providence. Pag. 324. Edit. 4.</note> takes notice of, is, <hi>God'</hi>s <hi>Partial &amp; unequal Care of his creatures;</hi> the foundation of which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is; <hi>that there are various Ranks &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men in the world; Rich and Poor, High and Low, Princes and Subjects,</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever atheiſtical wits may argue from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of mens Conditions, certain it is that the various Ranks and degrees of men are for the advantage and benefit of mankind in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, in as much as without this variety, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Vertue &amp; Reſtraint from Vice, that now they have; and there could be no ſuch thing as Government in the world, which is a thing ſo neceſſary to the well-being of it, that any thing conducive hereunto Rather argues a good Providence over the world, than the Contrary.</p>
            <p>Government is a great Bleſſing to this Sinful &amp; Miſerable world, &amp; if it ſhould be deſtitute thereof, it would ſoon become a heap of Confuſion, a ſtage of mournful Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, a Theater of woful Spectacles; the whole world might fitly be called, Aceldama, a field of Blood; or Golgotha, a place of a Scull. One man would be as a wolf to another, the wicked would devour the man that is more Righteous than he, men would be as the fiſhes of the Sea, &amp; as the creeping things, that have no Ruler over them, as the Prophet ſpeaks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hab. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.

            <p>The Pſalm ſeems to Relate to the time when Saul &amp; other of Davids Enemies were overthrown, and he had Entered upon the Kingdom of Iſrael, altho' he had not Gotten full poſſeſſion of it. And herein David in the name of other pious perſons profeſſeth his Thankfulneſs unto God for his wonderful providence over all things, and in ſpecial to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf v. 1. <hi>Unto thee, O God do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near, thy wondrous works do declare.</hi> And then he makes a promiſe agreeable to ſuch a frame of ſpirit, Even that he would do the duty of a Juſt &amp; pious Ruler. v. 2. <hi>When I ſhall receive the Congregation, I will Judge uprightly.</hi> This general Promiſe he ſeems more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to Explain, in the following verſes, in that he Promiſes to Endeavour to Reſtore the Decayed ſtate of Things in his Kingdom v. 3. <hi>The Earth and all the Inhabitants of it are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved: I bear up the Pillars of it, Selah.</hi> or—<hi>I will bear up</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi> as Tremellius &amp; Junius Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

it. And as a means to this Reſtitution of things in his Kingdom, that he would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Madneſs &amp; Haughtineſs of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. v. 4, 5. <hi>I ſaid unto the fools deal not ſo fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; &amp; to the wicked, lift not up the horn Lift <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Shewing that it is not to be aſcribed to chance, or humane policy &amp; power, but to that wiſe &amp; powerful providence which God Exerciſeth over the world. v. 6, 7 <hi>For promotion cometh neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South. But God is the Judge: he putteth down one, &amp; ſetteth up another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the verſe now Read, we may Obſerve</p>
            <p n="1">1. The perſon ſpoken of, the Moſt High God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Relation he ſtands in to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>he is the Judge.</hi> The Judge by way of Eminency. It is the work of a Judge to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine matters of Right. To Diſtribute Rewards and Puniſhments. To Determine Controverſies Relating to Commutative Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. In theſe Reſpects God may be Called the Judge. He determines the Eternal ſtate of men. Rom. 2. 16. And alſo he determines what their Condition in this world ſhall be,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002323_0008_0FDC0F576C1E20E0"/>
whether high or low, whether they ſhall be Rich or poor, the men of the world are as ſo many Rivals, Competitors or Candidates for Riches &amp; honours, &amp; God as Judge, doth by his all governing providence, paſs Sentence, who ſhall have them &amp; who ſhall go without them. Again a Judge Sometimes in Scripture Signifies the chief Ruler in a ſtate. So in Iſrael before Saul'<hi>s</hi> Reign the Chief Rulers were called Judges. Ruth. 1. 1. <hi>Now it came to paſs in the dayes when the Judges Ruled.</hi> God may be Called the Judge in this ſenſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole world is governed by him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may herein obſerve thoſe works that are aſcribed to God, that are agreeable to ſuch a Relation. He putteth down one &amp; ſetteth up another. He diſpoſeth of men to their Several Ranks &amp; poſts, as the chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of a ſtate conferreth offices and places of truſt on ſome, and degrades others, So the moſt High depreſſeth and Exalteth whom he pleaſeth.
