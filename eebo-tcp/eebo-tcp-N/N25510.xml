            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſubject of the preſent hour, to the conſideration of which I am called by the honorable Truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees of the Dudleian Lecture, was once eſteemed highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant; but for many years its importance has been gradually leſſening, partly through the candor and catholiciſm which mark this enlightened age, and partly on account of the thorough diſquiſitions of the ſubject by the ableſt hands. Every thing has already been ſaid, that can be ſaid directly in point. However, ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect recapitulation of what has been learnedly and judiciouſly obſerved by the worthy gentlemen who have gone before me, together with ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving reflections, will be attempted at this time; attempted by <hi>one,</hi> whoſe enfeebled age might have been alleged as ſufficient to excuſe him from any attempt of the kind.</p>

            <q>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>PHILIPPIANS, i. 15—18.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <p>Some indeed preach Chriſt of envy and ſtrife; and ſome alſo of good will: the one preach Chriſt of contention, not ſincerely, hoping to add affliction to my bonds: but the other of love, knowing that I am ſet for the defence of the goſpel. What then? notwithſtanding, ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Chriſt is preached; and I therein do rejoice, and will rejoice.</p>
            </q>
            <p>THE paſſage is not greatly obſcure: it needs no labored elucidation; but plainly imports, that St. Paul had fixed his main object: this object he ever held as principal, and to this every other muſt give way. It was the publiſhing the pure goſpel of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> it was to make known the riches of God's grace to a ruined world, through the power and grace of the promiſed Meſſiah. The apoſtle, in the paſſage before us, would by no means give counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the vile principles and views of ſome who had undertaken to preach Chriſt—not of good will—not ſincerely, but of pretence, and a malign intention to hurt his character, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the weight of his bonds; but not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, as the goſpel was preached, was ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the Gentiles, <hi>this</hi> was matter of great joy to our apoſtle. Some preached Chriſt of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033857_0004_0FF9611F44DBBE70"/>that is, grudging Paul the honor paid him by thoſe who became Chriſtians by his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Some preached Chriſt, that is, they preached the true doctrines of Chriſtianity, in ſtrife and contention, raiſing diſputes againſt Paul, endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oring to leſſen his character as an apoſtle, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his benevolent labors in the miniſtry. But, bleſſed be God, there were others, who preached Chriſt of good will, or (as the Greek word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies) with good pleaſure, taking great delight in the truth and importance of the goſpel: theſe were indeed fellow-helpers unto the truth, and fellow-laborers with Paul in the ſame important work. Thus ſtood the caſe, when our apoſtle put the queſtion. What then? though there is ſuch a mixture in the character of the preſent preachers of the ſame goſpel, ſhall this prevent my joy and gratitude at the ſpreading of the goſpel? ſhall this depreciate either the nature or importance of the truth itſelf? No, by no means: Chriſt is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: this is the main point in view, and therein I do rejoice, and will rejoice.</p>
            <p>To methodiſe my thoughts on this occaſion, I ſhall conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. What is implied in preaching Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To whom the preaching of Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The manner of their induction into office, and their equality therein.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Some of the unhappy effects of the jarring ſentiments of profeſſing Chriſtians on this ſubject.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033857_0005_0FF96126892504C8"/>I ſhall then</p>
            <p n="5">V. Name ſome conſiderations which have a tendency to conciliate the hearts of Chriſtians, and regulate their conduct in regard to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to conſider what is implied in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In general, to preach Chriſt, is to hold to public view, and comprehenſively illuſtrate, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which God has given, both in the Old and New Teſtament, concerning <hi>him.</hi> It is to declare, not in words which man's wiſdom teaches, but which the Holy Ghoſt teaches, the perſonal glories and amiable perfections of Chriſt, as the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father; the brightneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon; the chief among ten thouſand, and altogether lovely; fairer than the children of men, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely higher than the princes of the earth, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heaven: for divine perfections are aſcribed unto <hi>him;</hi> and in <hi>him</hi> dwelleth all the fulneſs of the <hi>Godhead</hi> bodily.</p>
            <p>Again. To preach Chriſt is to publiſh, and as much as in us lies, to explain the nature of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial offices, as they are repreſented unto us in the word of God—to declare what he has done, and ſuffered—what he is ſtill doing for us, as the one only Mediator between God and man. It is to exhibit <hi>him</hi> in <hi>our nature,</hi> the Mediator of the goſpel covenant, executing the offices of Prophet, Prieſt, and King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:033857_0006_0FF9612D27CCB880"/>
He is the great Prophet ſent of God, whom God promiſed to raiſe up like unto Moſes, whom his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall hear. He has declared unto us the things which he has ſeen with the Father, revealing all things neceſſary for our ſalvation; ſo that he who runs may read and underſtand the eſſentials of his religion.</p>
            <p>Again. To preach Chriſt is to exhibit the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture account of his prieſtly character. It is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the world his atoning ſacrifice—that he has once ſuffered for our ſins, the juſt for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that <hi>he</hi> might bring us unto God—that <hi>he</hi> is the great High-Prieſt of our profeſſion, who has made reconciliation by the blood of the croſs; and by one offering, has perfected forever them that are ſanctiſied. In this character of High-Prieſt, <hi>he</hi> is paſſed into the heavens, exalted to the right hand of the Majeſty on high; and is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come to God by <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again. To preach Chriſt is to repreſent <hi>him</hi> in the character of an Almighty Prince, who rules the nations in righteouſneſs, and judgeth the people with equity; whoſe kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and of whoſe dominion there ſhall be no end. God hath ſet <hi>him</hi> upon his holy hill of Zion, given all power in heaven and earth into his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial hands. He has given <hi>him</hi> a name above every name, and to <hi>him</hi> every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue confeſs, to the glory of God the Father, or Deity. He is the glorious King of his church: he claims the moſt cheerful confidence in his royal care and grace, and ready obedience to all the laws
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033857_0007_0FF96138D1009D88"/>of his kingdom. In a word, he enlightens, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for his church—he rules and defends it, and will keep it by his mighty power, through faith unto eternal ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Now to preach Chriſt is to publiſh and declare, to teſtify and diſplay, according to the ſcriptures, theſe glories of his name, uncorrupted by the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this world—and repreſent <hi>him</hi> under all theſe amiable and infinitely important characters.</p>
            <p>But moreover, as Chriſt has ſet before us his own example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps, and that the ſame mind ſhould be in us which was alſo in <hi>him,</hi> to preach Chriſt therefore, is to relate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of his holy life, and to conſider his amiable and perfect moral character as delineated in the goſpel. He was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, and ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arate from ſinners; <hi>he</hi> did no iniquity, neither was guile found in his mouth: in his perſon, in his examples and doctrines, he has ſhewed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto us, and taught us what is the good, the perfect and acceptable will of God. He was, in a moſt diſtinguiſhed manner, an example for us in his fervent prayers, his regard to God's holy law, his contempt of the world, and benevolence to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. His doctrine dropt as the dew, and diſtilled refreſhing as the ſmall drops of the rain, while he was making known the way of life through faith in him, and repentance for the remiſſion of all ſins; while he explained the former part of revelation, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed a new diſpenſation, which ſhall continue to the end of the world. He fairly and fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the terms of our reconciliation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033857_0008_0FF9613BF78EA800"/>in a new and conſtraining light, the moſt powerful motives to moral obedience. Now the preachers of Chriſt will endeavor, with a moſt careful hand, to imitate their Divine Maſter, in the doctrines they teach, and the motives with which they inculcate the morality of the goſpel. In this ſenſe, they will learn to call no man Maſter on earth, nor ever teach for doctrines the traditions of men: one is their Maſter in heaven, even Chriſt. They will avoid every attempt to ſave men's ſouls, on the one hand, by dry, empty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, and metaphyſical niceties; and, on the other, by warm effuſions, and unfounded imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inations of miſguided zeal: they will not perplex their inſtructions by attempts to pry into thoſe ſecret things which belong only to God. But, in fine, they will teach and inculcate with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diligence and care; they will preſs home to men's conſciences, in the plaineſt and warmeſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the things which are moſt plainly taught in the goſpel, moſt inſiſted upon by Chriſt and his apoſtles, and repreſented as of the higheſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the ſouls of men.</p>
            <p>But I cannot diſmiſs this head without obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the gracious promiſe of the <hi>aiding Spirit,</hi> and the ſure hope of the reſurrection to eternal life, are important parts of that bleſſed goſpel, which the miniſters of Chriſt have committed unto them, and neceſſarily implied in preaching Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The beloved Savior ſays, in his comforting fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel addreſs to his diſciples, "I will pray the Fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and he will ſend the <hi>Comforter,</hi> the Holy
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033857_0009_0FF96146E8046668"/>Ghoſt, unto you; <hi>he</hi> ſhall teach you all things." It is true, indeed, that the miraculous teachings of the Holy Ghoſt, and that power by which the apoſtles wrought miracles, are not now to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: however, theſe ought to be adduced, in the claſs of miracles, as proof of the goſpel itſelf: but there is a gracious promiſe of his divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is always to abide with Chriſtians. His enlightening, his ſanctifying, his comforting influence will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Lord, through, or by the Spirit. In fine, my brethren, there is no doctrine in the New Teſtament more abundantly taught, than the importance of divine influence; or, the graces of the Holy Spirit in the all-glorious work of our redemption. It is true, the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar modus, or preciſe manner of <hi>his</hi> influence on rational free agents, cannot be fully comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the ſubject is well expreſſed in that well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known exhortation of the apoſtle, "Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling; for it is <hi>God</hi> who <hi>worketh</hi> in you both to <hi>will</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> of his own good pleaſure."</p>
            <p>Again. The reſurrection, and the expreſs prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe of eternal life to all true Chriſtians, are mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with diſtinguiſhed importance in the goſpel of Chriſt. Life and immortality are brought to light by the goſpel. Chriſt is the reſurrection and the life. <hi>His</hi> doctrines, and eſpecially his <hi>reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrection</hi> from the dead, have thrown more than tenfold light on this ſubject above any the philoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophers could boaſt, or even the Jewiſh church were
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033857_0010_0FF961C751BE28F8"/>favored with. The promiſe is abſolute: "Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth on me, though he were <hi>dead,</hi> yet ſhall he live; I will raiſe him up at the laſt day:" "Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo." On the whoſe all judgment is committed unto the Son; and the important day is marked in the divine irrevocable decree, when all who are in their graves ſhall come forth; they who have done <hi>well,</hi> to the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life; and they who remain impenitent, to the reſurrection of ſhame and contempt.</p>
            <p>Thus, my reſpected friends, I have given a few important hints in regard to what is implied in preaching Chriſt. His character is drawn from God's own teſtimony, and the ſcripture account given directly in point. His perſonal glories, and mediatorial offices, his doctrines, his examples, his promiſes, and eſpecially, that of the Holy Ghoſt, his own reſurrection, and his power to raiſe the dead, the judgment to come, and the important iſſue of <hi>that</hi> all-intereſting day, are <hi>all</hi> eſſential parts of that goſpel which was preached by Paul and others, in the publication of which he greatly rejoiced.</p>
            <p>I have dwelt the longer, my friends, on this head, that we might be appriſed of the <hi>grounds</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of the Apoſtle's rejoicing. Shall we not ſay with a believing heart, and adoring tongue, What tidings are theſe to a guilty, periſhing world? Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings publiſhed by the goſpel of Jeſus! the prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe of pardon, peace, and eternal life; for Chriſt of God is made to every one who repents of his ſins and believes this goſpel, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, eternal life. Glory to God in the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033857_0011_0FF96154251A0048"/>higheſt, for there is on earth peace, and good will towards men. But we are now</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider to whom the preaching of this goſpel is committed.</p>
            <p>If we conſult the ſacred oracles (and they ſhall be my only guide) methinks we ſhall not be at a loſs for an anſwer. This goſpel was imperfectly and preparatively committed to the twelve diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whom Chriſt ſent out to preach in all the cities and ſuburbs of Jeruſalem, as you will ſee. Then to the ſeventy, ſent on a like errand, and by the ſame authority. After this, and before the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of our bleſſed Lord, this goſpel was largely and fully committed to the eleven diſciples, in the moſt gracious words, "And Jeſus came and ſpake unto them, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth: Go ye, therefore, and teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxviii. 18—20.</note> On the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, they were endued with the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and this goſpel was preached by the apoſtles and by ſuch as were by them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the great body of the Jewiſh nation, and afterwards by Paul and Barnabas to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile nations; for the Holy Ghoſt had ſaid, "Separate me Paul and Barnabas to the work to which I have appointed them." Immediately after this, the preaching of this goſpel was <hi>committed</hi> to men, who are promiſcuouſly ſtyled, for more than two centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Biſhops, Paſtors, Elders and Teachers.</hi> But this leads me</p>
            <p n="3">III. To conſider the manner of their induction, and their <hi>equality</hi> in office.</p>
            <p>Here I ſhall briefly obſerve a few things, I hope ſatisfactory to an unprejudiced, impartial inquirer. They were inaugurated or inſtated in this office by the authority of Jeſus Chriſt; empowering thoſe who were already in office, by his ſpecial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to commit to others the things which they had received in ſolemn charge from him.</p>
            <p>The firſt account we have of a goſpel-ordination is recorded Acts xiii. 1—3. "There were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers: as they miniſtered to the Lord, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Holy Ghoſt ſaid, Separate me Barnabas and Paul to the work whereunto I have called them: and when they had faſted, and laid hands on them, they ſent them away;" that is, to preach to the Gentiles, to ſettle churches, and organize them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to goſpel order. Here let us note, Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas and Paul were called of God. Ought not all candidates for the miniſtry to be inwardly called and moved by the Holy Ghoſt, as well as called by the ſuffrage of a church and people, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this great work? All the parts mentioned in the New Teſtament as conſtituting the ordination ſervice were performed—impoſition of hands— faſting—and prayer. And let us carefully remark, the <hi>ordainers</hi> were the <hi>prophets</hi> and <hi>teachers</hi> of the <hi>church</hi> of Antioch: theſe teachers were without doubt the ordinary paſtors: they could not be biſhops in the preſent Epiſcopalian ſenſe: for there
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033857_0013_0FF96162076AD1A8"/>was a plurality of them in this <hi>one</hi> church; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in the ſenſe of the two firſt centuries, theſe prophets and teachers were called Biſhops, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and Elders.</p>
            <p>But I paſs to note their <hi>equality</hi> in office: for if all are equal, then the queſtion is at an end; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all then have the ſame power of ordination.</p>
            <p>Let it be remarked, that the apoſtles, conſidered as the firſt preachers under this new diſpenſation, received their authority from Chriſt; they were equally ſent to preach the ſame goſpel, and to gather and ſettle on the ſame model, churches among the Jews and Gentiles in all parts of the world, to appoint them officers, both for inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and government: theſe were to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the churches, for their edification in faith and holineſs till the ſecond coming of Chriſt. Now the apoſtles, in virtue of this power, received im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Chriſt, conſtituted no more than <hi>one</hi> order of ſtanding officers in the church (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the order of deacons, with whom we have nothing to do in the point before us.) In proof of this, let us obſerve—neither Chriſt nor any of his apoſtles have given any inſtructions deſcriptive of any perſons ſit for the work of the miniſtry, adapted to any inequality or difference in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral office. Had there been any difference like that which is now pretended, different qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would have been required, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the different truſts ariſing from ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent offices; but the holy ſcriptures no where intimate that ſuch different truſts are neceſſary; very far from this, my brethren, they have point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the qualifications of <hi>one order</hi> only, under
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033857_0014_0FF961EC4CB069C0"/>the common name of Preſbyters, Biſhops, Paſtors, and Elders, as you will ſee at large in the Epiſtles to Timothy and Titus.</p>
            <p>It is farther to be obſerved, that the ſcriptures no where ſo much as hint that any difference is to be made, in the manner of ordaining or charging miniſters, as though there were any diſtinction in their office. They are not in a ſingle inſtance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to exerciſe their ordaining or charging power adapted to diſtinct orders, as though they were to place ſome in a higher, and ſome in a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rank. There is not a word that intimates any thing like this. Nay, my friends, the ſcriptures preſent to view a directory for the ordination of one order only. Will you turn to and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider St. Paul's inſtructions reſpecting the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the churches in <hi>Crete?</hi> Titus was left by Paul in this iſland, on purpoſe to ſet in order the things that were wanting; that is, to ordain fixed paſtors in the ſeveral churches there. Were theſe paſtors differently deſcribed? Were ſome endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with extraordinary gifts and exalted power above their brethren? Not a word of this: they were exactly of the ſame rank. Titus could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nothing different to them; for he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nothing different from Paul.</p>
            <p>To our point alſo is the inſcription of Paul to the Philippians, i. 1. "To all the ſaints which are at Philippi, with the <hi>biſhops</hi> and deacons." No goſpel paſtors but of one order are here mentioned; theſe are called <hi>biſhops.</hi> But obſerve, theſe could not be ſuch biſhops as are now contended for by the Church of England; for there was a plurality in the ſame church; which, as the venerable Dr.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033857_0015_0FF96172CD901F48"/>Chauncy well obſerves, is a flat contradiction to that eſſential article in the Epiſcopal ſcheme, <hi>"One church one biſhop."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall mention one inſtance more, which I think full in point: you will read it, 1 Peter, i. 1. The apoſtle directs this epiſtle to the Chriſtians ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia, and Bithynia. Had this apoſtle known any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of order, he would no doubt have noticed it: ſurely he would not have overlooked the higher and more honorable order. But inſtead of this, he mentions only ſuch paſtors as were of equal rank; and expreſsly urges <hi>them</hi> to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcharge of their duty, as officers in the church. "The elders that are among you, I exhort, feed the flock of God." Likewiſe the direction given by James, v. 14. "Is any ſick among you? let him call for the <hi>elders (elders</hi> plural) of the church, and let them pray over them," &amp;c. In a word, they have all received their authority from the ſame hand, they are called to the ſame work, and they are charged in the ſame language; and they are expreſsly charged to call no man Maſter on earth, for one is their Maſter in heaven. But I cannot omit a paſſage which I think of great weight in this diſpute. It is from our Lord's own mouth, Luke xxii. 24, &amp;c. There was alſo a ſtrife among them, which of them ſhould be counted greateſt. Obſerve theſe were the twelve diſciples. The diſpute was, which of them ſhould be greateſt in that kingdom of the Meſſiah, which they thought juſt at hand. Chriſt grants he was about to ſet up a kingdom, and that they ſhould be offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in his kingdom; but corrects their miſtake
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033857_0016_0FF96203CACE6F08"/>about a preference and ſuperiority one above an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. He ſays, "The kings of the Gentiles exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe lordſhip over them; and they that exerciſe authority upon them are called their benefactors;" that is, are flattered with high titles;—"but ye ſhall not be ſo: but he that is greateſt among you," is fond of being exalted above his brethren,— let him check his ambitious views, and learn to conform more to the meek and humble ſpirit of my goſpel;—"let him be as the younger, (or as it might be rendered) let him be as the leaſt; and he that is chief (that is, would be thought chief), let him be as one that doth ſerve."</p>
            <p>Thus, my brethren, all who enter upon the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel miniſtry ſhould preach Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and themſelves equal <hi>ſervants</hi> of men's ſouls for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
            <p>Theſe imperfect hints muſt ſuffice, that I may have a few minutes juſt to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. A few of the unhappy effects of the jarring ſentiments of profeſſing Chriſtians on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>If I miſtake not, this dividing ſpirit began to work as early as the apoſtolic age. I am of Paul, I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, was the language in the mouth of the church at Corinth. The reproof from Paul's own mouth is very inſtructive: "Who is Paul, and who is Apollos, but miniſters of Chriſt, and fellow-workers in the kingdom of Chriſt? Was Paul crucified for you?" &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This ſame ſpirit moſt certainly laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great Papal apoſtacy and hierarchy. They originated by ſmall beginnings. Firſt a claim was laid in for metropolitan dignity; next,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033857_0017_0FF96185A7465240"/>dioceſan importance; and ſo, ſtep by ſtep, till the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſted ſucceſſor of St. Peter claimed infallibility and ſupremacy over all paſtors and churches through the whole world; and even kings and potentates counted it an honor to have their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſanctioned by him.</p>
            <p>To this unhappy diſpute, in its principles and progreſs, are to be aſcribed thoſe rivers of Chriſtian blood, ſhed by the hands of moſt cruel perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. This clothed the three witneſſes in ſackcloth, and drove them into the wilderneſs. At length the Proteſtant reformation took place. Was the diſpute then at an end? Alas, no; the ſame ſpirit of party zeal for rank in a national church greatly obſtructed the reformation, and marred much of its glory. Nor did it ceaſe its baneful influence, till the rage for uniformity drove more than two thouſand faithful paſtors from their pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits and beloved flocks. Yes, my friends, this baniſhed our reſpected anceſtors from their native country, and many of them from fair habitations and opulent circumſtances. They ſought, they found an <hi>aſylum</hi> in theſe inhoſpitable wilds. Thus a part of Chriſt's church has been in moſt humil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iating and afflicted circumſtances, ariſing from the unhappy miſtakes and bigotry of thoſe, who nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertheleſs call themſelves Chriſtians. But, like the ſacred buſh, his church, though burning, has not been conſumed.</p>
            <p>In this happy land our fathers planted the tree of Chriſtian liberty, and though it has not always been cultured by their hand as it ought, yet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the divine cultivation, and by the wonderful
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033857_0018_0FF96219A4861900"/>providence of God, it has at length ſent forth its boughs unto the rivers, and its branches unto the ſeas.</p>
            <p>But perſecution and bloodſhed ſtand not alone as the ſad effects of the diſpute in hand; there are things pernicious in themſelves, and fatal in their conſequences, which ought to be ranked with them. What unchriſtian altercations have taken place among Chriſtians profeſſing for ſubſtance the ſame faith and hope! what alienation of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! what diviſions, ſeparating very brethren! what terms of reproach! Bitter words, like drawn ſwords, againſt ſome whoſe labors have been crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with remarkable ſucceſs! They have felt the emphaſis of the apoſtle's words, "cruel mockings."</p>
            <p>Again. This has deprived the Chriſtian church of the miniſterial labors of many hopeful youth, who were devoting themſelves, and were deſigned to ſerve in the goſpel as paſtors and teachers. The fact is notorious. Many have gone into ſecular branches of life—have turned their attention to oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er purſuits, abandoning their firſt pious choice of the miniſtry, merely becauſe they could not ſubſcribe to the terms of their admiſſion into the miniſtry.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add—Theſe unhappy diviſions, and their conſequent effects, have furniſhed deiſts, and all the enemies of Chriſtianity, with their moſt ſucceſsful weapons.</p>
            <p>Behold, ſay they triumphantly, behold how boaſted Chriſtianity is torn in pieces by her own ſons! She is like a houſe, a kingdom divided againſt itſelf, which cannot ſtand. Thoſe very Chriſtians are not agreed who ſhall be the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this good news from <hi>heaven.</hi> See how they bite, defame, and devour one another! It is
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033857_0019_0FF96193B08B8D20"/>thus we would have it! How unjuſt and unfair their reaſoning is, has been often demonſtrated by the advocates for Chriſtianity; and we truſt, we hope, we pray, that their triumphing will be ſhort.</p>
            <p>We are very happy, on this occaſion, to have in our power to ſay, that many of the ſad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this diſpute which we have been enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating, are <hi>rapidly</hi> on the decline: ſome have totally ceaſed. A ſpirit of catholiciſm and candor has now taken the ground long occupied by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and bigotry. A ſpirit of univerſal <hi>tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is approved and cheriſhed. We cordially embrace our reſpected Epiſcopalian brethren, and eſteem many of them highly for their work's ſake, though differing in ſentiments on the ſubject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; and there are a reſpectable number who tender <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the ſame Chriſtian embrace. Would to Heaven it was univerſal.</p>
            <p>Permit me now in the cloſe of this too lengthy diſcourſe,</p>
            <p n="5">V. To hint a few things tending to conciliate the hearts of Chriſtians, and regulate their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in regard to the ſubject before us.</p>
            <p>Are we not all agreed in the eſſential articles of Chriſtianity? Do we not all profeſs for ſubſtance, one faith, one baptiſm, one Lord, one Mediator, one God and Father of us all? Are we not all placed under one glorious Head, and hold in hope the <hi>ſame heaven?</hi> May not Chriſt be preached with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>at all</hi> intermeddling with the diſpute before us? Let us then love as brethren; let us carefully wave, both in preaching and in our private walks, whatever has a tendency to alienate our affection,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033857_0020_0FF9623414F54BA0"/>leſſen our candor, or continue any diſputes; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes which have already been much too long in the church.</p>
            <p>Let us never forget, that <hi>infallibility</hi> belongs not to human kind. "Humanum eſt errare." Here we all ſee darkly through a glaſs. Poſitive nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and dogmatical boaſts, are not the marks of wiſdom, but of a young or weak mind. As our opponents may be miſtaken, are we ſure there are no miſtakes with us? Let us then make large al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances for the prejudice of education, the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and manners of different ſocieties, and the imperfect manner in which all view the different ſides of the queſtion in diſpute. Let us meet one another as far as is conſiſtent with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Let us bear one another's burdens, and ſo fulfil the law of Chriſt. To endeavor to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preach our opponents, and, if poſſible, go beyond them in living what we preach, is not pride, but laudable Chriſtian emulation; and happy will it be for us, if, inſtead of appealing to them for our authority to preach, we are able to addreſs our people in the language of the apoſtle, "Ye are our epiſtle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men: for as much as ye are manifeſtly declared to be the epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtered by us; writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of ſtone, but in fleſhly tables of the heart."</p>
            <p>Let us avail ourſelves of the ſpirit which breathes in our <hi>happy conſtitution.</hi> It removes far from view much of the ſpirit of the times of which we have been ſpeaking; it frowns on bigotry and tyranny of every kind; it cheriſhes rational liberty, virtue,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033857_0021_0FF961A3304AE270"/>and all the ſocial affections. Let us then hold it dearer to us than thouſands of ſilver and gold. As it is the price of very much of our fathers' blood and treaſure, O! may it be guarded as the apple of our eye, from every foe, domeſtic or foreign, and be tranſmitted unimpaired to our children, and theirs, to the lateſt generation.</p>
            <p>The ſure word of prophecy, and benevolent Chriſtianity, lead us to look a little forward, to times more happy than any the world has yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced; when diſcords and contentions of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery kind ſhall utterly ceaſe; when we ſhall all "ſee eye to eye;" when there ſhall be no more occaſion for any one to ſay, "Know the Lord, for all ſhall know him." Can we fail to join in this ardent petition—Lord, haſten on theſe moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous times; accompliſh theſe divine prophecies; fulfil that good word on which thou haſt cauſed thy ſervants to hope: even ſo, Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</p>
            <p>I ſhall be permitted to addreſs one word to the dear Youth, members of this reſpected Univerſity; eſpecially to ſuch as are deſigned to be employed in preaching Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Need I, my dear young friends, remind you of the preciouſneſs of time, and the talents now in your hands? Theſe you will carefully improve; once neglected, they are irretrievably loſt! and you will mourn at the laſt, ſaying, "How have I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof!" It is preſumed you will endeavor to increaſe your <hi>fund</hi> of knowledge day by day, that you may <hi>all</hi> be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to act your part well in the callings in which you may be placed in manly age.</p>

But to you, eſpecially, who are intentionally can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates for the goſpel miniſtry, permit me to ſay, Study to be, in a ſenſe, independent of all books but the Holy Bible, while you carefully read ſuch helps as are in your way: truſt to none but the Book of God—with that in your hand, prayerfully peruſed, ſyſtemiſe for yourſelves—to the law and to the teſtimony—and let a—<hi>Thus ſaith the Lord</hi>— decide all.</p>
            <p>You will not forget, that while there are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in ſentiment concerning the manner in which you are to be inducted into the goſpel miniſtry, there is no diſpute at all upon this great point, viz. That all power is derived from Chriſt, and is by him delegated to perſons of a particular char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, and is to be employed by <hi>them</hi> for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the church. Beware, then, of "run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before you are ſent," and of puſhing your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelve immediately forward into the deſk. Let modeſty and candor be traits in your early life, and they will not forſake you when you are old: modeſty and candor bloſſoming in youth, will grow with your growth, and bring forth ripe fruit in age.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Inducted, you will fix your main attention on the chief object of your ininiſtry—you will preach not yourſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus, your Lord—ſtudy to make yourſelves approved in the ſight of God
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033857_0023_0FF8D669D6CE2A50"/>and man—pray always—pray fervently, eſpecially for the ſacred aids of the Divine Spirit, and the Lord ſend you good ſucceſs, and give you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in all things; then, inſtead of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, will be the children, and long, long after we, the fathers, ſhall be diſmiſſed from our labors and ſleep in the duſt, you will cloſe life well, and hear from our common Lord that bleſſed euge pronounced on you, Well done, good and faithful ſervants, enter into the joy of your Lord.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>adieu—Dear Alma Mater, adieu.</hi> May <hi>you</hi> long remain an ornament to our <hi>riſing empire</hi>—our <hi>happy Republic</hi>—may you nurture and ſend forth many ſons, trained in the paths of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the moſt important branches of literature, pillars to the ſtate, and able miniſters of the New Teſtament. Thus may you be to the end of time a nurſing mother both to the church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>My affectionate wiſh, and fervent prayer, will ever be—that the Benefactors, Governors, and Inſtructors of this moſt reſpectable Univerſity may have the richeſt of Heaven's bleſſings reſting in all their boſoms; and at laſt, meet a glorious remun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of all their charities, labors, and cares in the world of everlaſting felicity—to which happy world may God conduct us all, through the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.—AMEN.</p>
