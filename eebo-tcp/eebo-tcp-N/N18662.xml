            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>To create the diſpoſition requiſite to the proper acceptation of ſuch diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, it is neceſſary to call to the public mind the variant characters of the ſeveral ſtates when they were provinces of a more extended empire—the cauſes which produced that difference of character—the means which were deviſed to increaſe and perpetuate that variation and the ends to which thoſe characteriſtic differences were intended to be inſtrumental. Reflexions duly ſerious upon theſe circumſtances will remind the people of the ſeveral ſtates, that they are natural friends, whoſe amity and union have been too often viewed with jealouſy by rival eyes. They will perceive the wiſdom and the high duty of cultivating a ſpirit of mutual allowance and conceſſion; and a careful examination of their actual ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will convince them, that greater bleſſings will reſult from a perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and ſedulous cultivation of their intereſts at home, than from almoſt any arrangements, which the conceptions of foreign nations will probably lead them to propoſe.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of our preſent ſituation and of ſome intereſting circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which have grown out of it, is the object of this inveſtigation, in which the benefits to be derived from a liberal intercourſe with foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will not be undervalued. As no apology is neceſſary for ſuch an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, a miſcellaneous enquiry into ſeveral matters, which are always deeply inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting to nations, and into others which have reſulted from our public operations, will be proſecuted without further introduction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the exports of the united ſtates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It has been apprehended by perſons of obſervation, at home, and the idea has prevailed in the councils of a foreign nation<note n="*" place="bottom">See the report of a committee of the lords of the Britiſh privy council, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in the gazettes (of March) in Charleſton, South Carolina.</note>, that the exports of the united ſtates for the year preceding October, 1790, were greater in value than could be expected again, by reaſon of the prices for grain which were conſequent on
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024230_0003_0FC57E23A7438380"/>the ſcarcity in France. The exports of the ſubſequent year will aid us in te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ing this opinion, which attracts the more attention, becauſe it is ſometimes ſuggeſted that agriculture and trade have been injured by the meaſures of the government in regard to the public debt. The firſt return of exports, on which this conjecture was founded, includes a term of thirteen months and a half, and amounted to 20,415,966 dollars. From this aggregate value a ninth part is to be deducted, to equalize it with one year's exportation, which reduces the ſum to 18,147,526 dollars. It is very well known, that the prices of our produce through the year lately returned, and which ended with September 1791, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>llen to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent rates, and it will be perceived on a compariſon, that our exports ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their aggregate value thoſe of the former year. The laſt return, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively of two quarters of Charleſton, was

               </p>
               <p>There remains not, therefore, the leaſt cauſe to doubt, that our total expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were eighteen millions and a quarter, and conſequently more than in the antecedent year. It is to be obſerved, too, that the high prices which were current through the time of the firſt return, muſt have produced an exportation of all the grain, that could be got to market, and none of the old crop could have been left as uſual, to ſell with the new. The obvious effect of this muſt have been an unuſual deduction from the exports in the laſt year. The valuation of the exports of theſe ſtates immediately before the revolution is not p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="6 letters">
                     <desc>••••••</desc>
                  </gap>ly aſcertained: but the whole exportations from N. America, including the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colonies, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and the Bahamas, were computed to have been in 1771<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dollars, 15,280,000. In theſe were compriſed the ſhipments between thoſe iſlands and the main, and from province to province, as every veſſel, which departed from one American port for another, was obliged to clear out her cargo, as if deſtined for a foreign country. It will appear to be ſafe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract for the difference produced by theſe two circumſtances, one half of the former exports, when it is remembered that two-thirds of the quantity of tonnage is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the intercourſe between the various parts of the preſent union, which is engaged in that with foreign nations; and that the Britiſh Newfoundland fiſhery alone, was eſtimated at more than 2,200,000 dollars in 1775. The increaſe of the tonnage employed in the foreign trade affords another proof of the increment of our exports. About 330,000 tons were laden in the preſent united ſtates in the year 1770, part of which were deſtined for ports now within the union. About 600,000 tons have been loaded in each of the two laſt years for foreign ports, though our exports being in a much greater degree manufactured, are now contained in a ſmaller compaſs: and boards, ſcantling, and ſtaves, which are our moſt bulky commodities, have not increaſed in half the ratio of the tonnage employed.</p>
               <p>An addition may be alſo made to the amount of the return for the increaſed ſupplies in proviſions, cordage, and other materials, for the uſe and outfit of foreign ſhips. Since the prices of ſalt proviſions have been reduced below thoſe of Ireland, and many articles applicable to ſhips' uſe, have been manufactured here, this item has become very conſiderable; and ſo far as the articles are ſold to foreigners, they are eſſentially exports.</p>
               <p>Under this head, the increaſed number of ſhips ſold to foreign nations, may be fairly mentioned, and although much has been ſaid of the number formerly diſpoſed of abroad, it is not doubted that a greater value was ſold in that way in the time of the laſt return. Of this fact ſome further illuſtration will probably be given in the ſequel. It will be ſufficient to obſerve here, that the whole quantity
<pb n="5"
                      facs="unknown:024230_0004_0FC57E298F112998"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>of tonnage built, and native veſſels repaired the laſt year, exceed in value one million of dollars.</p>
               <p>The enlarged conſumption made within our country by foreign perſons of every deſcription, who are certainly much more numerous than they formerly were, is as profitable to the country, as the ſame value in exports would have been. This item will appear to be very conſiderable, when the expenditures of foreign miniſters, conſuls, tranſient and reſident foreigners, fleets and ſeamen, mind.</p>
               <p>The export trade of the united ſtates and the great increaſe of the home con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption have placed the American producers on a very advantageous footing. The competition which exiſts in our markets, between the purchaſers for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of foreigner, of various nations, for our own merchants, for the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in the ſeaports and parts adjacent to the coaſts, and for the uſe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers, together with the occaſional ſhipments made on their own accounts by the ſouthern planters, by the millers of the middle ſtates, and by the owners of the eaſtern fiſhing veſſels, afford the cultivators and fiſhermen ſo many alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives, that they can always obtain the beſt prices which circumſtances will juſtify. In ſhort, theſe ſeveral demands, at once various, ſteady, and extenſive, efficiently ſupport our agriculture: and though peculiar enterprize and faculties in commerce and manufactures, the power of capital, and an intimate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our trade and interior ſyſtem, enable a particular nation to participate largely in the exports of the united ſtates, the remainder of the world receive from us a very conſiderable value, and the variety of demand which the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our exports proves to exiſt, affords us certain relief from the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the commercial errors of any of thoſe countries, whoſe citizens are our conſumers. Whenever ſuch errors ſhall occur—or ſo far as they may have already taken place, to diffuſe a knowledge of our reſources among all nations, to inſpire them with confidence in our laws and modes of dealing, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert our commodities by manufactures, into every ſhape which their occaſions may require, will prove the efficacious corrective, by enabling us to obtain from wiſe nations a favourable market for our productions.</p>
               <p>It is ſatisfactory to obſerve the regular increaſe of manufactured goods in our returns of exported commodities. The number in each of the two laſt years is upwards of one third, in a liſt which amounts to near three hundred article. Hence we may infer, that <hi>the time is really arrived, when foreign trade is increaſed and enlivened by home manufactures.</hi> This idea, together with the domeſtic commerce produced by them, will be more particularly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed in another place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the manufactures of the united ſtates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In conſidering this ſubject it will be unneceſſary to adduce any arguments to influence the judgment of the eaſtern parts of the union. Many of our citizens near the ſea-coaſt of the middle ſtates are equally convinced of the beneficial effects of manufactures. The cultivators in the ſouthern and weſtern country, and a reſpectable proportion of our mercantile citizens are apprehenſive of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to themſelves and to their country from the purſuit of this object. Theſe are two deſcriptions of perſons whom it is in every view our duty to ſatisfy, if the truth and reaſon will permit; and it is principally from a due attention to them, that the ſubject i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> propoſed to be examined here.</p>
               <p>An opinion has prevailed that the ſouthern ſtates will be ſacrificed to the eaſtern, and in ſome degree to the middle ſtates, by the plan of manufactures. It is plain, however, that as the ſoil of the eaſtern ſtates is not equal to the production of a ſufficiency of proviſions and raw materials for their own uſe, they muſt reſort to the more ſouthern ſtates for ſeveral raw materials and for new ſupplies of proviſions. It is known, too, that ſome valuable articles for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024230_0005_0FC57E2B251C59D8"/>cannot be produced but in the ſouthern ſtates, ſuch as cotton, and indigo, and that tobacco is almoſt confined to them. The ſouthern ſtates and weſtern country will have conſiderable advantages in the ſupport which the home market of the manufacturers will give at all times, and eſpecially in time of war, (when freights will be high, and ſhipping ſcarce) to their agricultural and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed productions. Even now, in profound peace, it is the caſe. Hemp was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the ports of the middle ſtates, from the lands of the ſouthern ſtates, at leſs than five cents per <abbr>lb.</abbr> in 1791. Nothing would have kept it up to that rate, but the rope and twine manufactories of the middle and eaſtern ſtates. The breweries of Philadelphia draw nearly as much of their barley from the Cheſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peak as they derive from the lands of Pennſylvania.

The ports of Philadelphia and New York, take three-fourths of their ſhip timber from them, juſtly preferring veſſels of live oak and red cedar to all others. The owners of the coal mines of Virginia, enjoy the monopoly of all the ſupplies for the manufacturers of the more northern ſtates, who live in the ſea ports: a demand which is increaſing rapidly. No lead mine of any conſequence is yet worked, except one near the ſuperior waters of James river. The ſouthern ſtates abound with iron, and have much more fuel of all kinds than the northern ſtates, and they have ſtreams for the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful water works. Few or no very abundant depoſits of coal have been yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered further north or eaſt than the waters of the Ohio and Cheſapeak, even in internal ſituations. The iron manufactures of the united ſtates are already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant in value, and immenſely ſo in point of utility, or rather of <hi>neceſſity.</hi> Farms, manufactories, ſhipping, fiſheries, fleets, and armies, all demand them. In ſhort, the all-important landed intereſt would languiſh, and its progreſs in proſperity would be retarded in the counties of the ſouthern ſtates, even near the ſea, if our preſent manufactures were to be aboliſhed, and all future eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments of that kind were to be given up. <hi>But their inland and weſtern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cannot be ſupported, unleſs manufactures ſhall be promoted and introduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</hi> In the counties of Pennſylvania beyond the Allegany mountain, are 63,000 inhabitants, and probably 10,000 of theſe are farmers. The <hi>wool</hi> of that country is yet very inconſiderable—their furs are more abundant. From theſe two raw materials, no leſs than 10,140 wool hats, and 2,200 fur hats are manufactured yearly in thirty-three hatters' ſhops. Sail cloth, (which, when manufactured, would be worth 30 cents per <abbr>lb.</abbr>) could be made at Pittſburg, Wincheſter in Virginia, Hillſborough, and Saliſbury in North Carolina, Camden in South Carolina, and Auguſta in Georgia, out of hemp, the value of which, there, does not exceed 4 or 5 cents. To bring a ton of hemp to the ſea ports from thoſe towns, except Auguſta, coſts from 35 to 40 per cent. of its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. To bring a ten weight of ſail cloth from the ſame places to the ſame ports would not coſt above 6 or 8 per cent. and the manufacturers' proviſions and fuel are attended with ſimilar ſavings. Deduct for a moment the demand of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign commerce from both Alexandria and Wincheſter, and the latter would appear to be moſt vigorous and flouriſhing; becauſe it manufactures more, having not ſo high a market for its proviſions and raw materials. Theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations apply with equal force to the whole ſtate of Vermont and to all our interior country. The nation that ſupplies us with hempen, flaxen, and iron ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, takes immenſe quantities of hemp, flax, and iron from Ruſſia. Theſe Ruſſian raw materials are purchaſed at the eaſtern extremity of the Baltic, are tranſported to another country and manufactured there, are brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024230_0006_0FC57E2CA3ADD1D0"/>incite us to foſter manufactures of the ſame kinds, there and elſewhere. Till that ſhall be the caſe, we ſhall continue to drag thoſe raw materials through the ſame bad roads, and ſhip them under charges of carting and freight equal to a third, an half, and two thirds of their value, according to the diſtance. The preſent ſyſtem of neglecting and repelling the eſtabliſhment of manufactures, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to occaſion immenſe deductions from the profits of our lands; and due conſideration, it is believed, would convince us, that the beſt intereſts, nay the neceſſities of our landholders require the introduction of ſome kind of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory in almoſt every vicinity.</p>
               <p>The countries ſouth of Pennſylvania are remarkably rich in foſſils. Coal, cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, iron, lead, and other minerals are found in either Maryland, Virginia, North or South Carolina, or Georgia, or all of them. Mineral appearances occur every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The promotion of manufactures is neceſſary to draw theſe forth; and as they have immenſe foreſts of wood, and the moſt powerful mill-ſtreams, there can be no doubt, that they will be brought into uſe, as ſoon as thoſe means ſhall be adopted.</p>
               <p>The family manufactures of the middle and interior counties of Virginia, North Carolina, and the interior counties of Georgia, South Carolina, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland are ſaid to be greater in value, than the articles of foreign manufactures, which they uſe; and were they univerſally awake to the facility, profits, and national importance of this mode of manufacturing, they might extend it much further, without impeding their farming operations, while, at the ſame time, they would provide a new uſe for their agricultural productions.</p>
               <p>A ſingle ſtate, Pennſylvania, has upwards of fifty paper mills, which work up materials of no value. The manufactures from thoſe mills are computed at two hundred and fifty thouſand dollars—the hands employed in them do not exceed one hundred and fifty, or two hundred. That ſtate contains about one ninth of the people of the united ſtates, and their contributions to the expenſes of the government and the intereſt of the public debt, are conſequently about 400,000 dollars. Their paper-mills, therefore, indemnify them for five-eights of their quota! It is the duty of government to encourage the other ſtates to do the ſame, eſpecially as it can be done by <hi>water-means,</hi> and not by <hi>men</hi> diverted from their farms. The ſouthern ſtates do not want a capacity for this manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which has acquired an eſtabliſhment in Maryland, and has appeared as far to the ſouthward as North Carolina.</p>
               <p>It may be ſafely affirmed, that the manufactures of <hi>leather</hi> in the united ſtates exceed in value <hi>all our annual burdens.</hi> We import few or no ſhoes. In each of the two laſt years we have procured from abroad no more than 70,000 pair of ſhoes and boots for 4,000,000 of people. If we uſe only one pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and a half per annum per perſon, at ſeventy-five cents, they will amount to 4,500,000 dollars, which exceeds every demand of the general and ſtate governments. The hides, ſkins, bark, lime, thread, briſtles, and wax, nay, the very heel-pegs, are all drawn from our lands and farms. Recollecting this, and ſimilar facts, we cannot queſtion the utility of manufactures to the farmers, planters, and landed intereſt. If the manufacture of ſhoes in this country, were aboliſhed, our annual debt to foreign countries would be increaſed to an amount equal to all our public contributions. Similar obſervations might be made on ſeveral other articles, though on none to ſo great an extent. Cattle thrive with little attention in the mild winters of the ſouth, and being more woody, they have a greater quantity of bark than moſt of the other ſtates.</p>
               <p>The manufactures of wool in Great Britain have been ſtated by their miniſters at £. 16,800,000 ſterling—and the ſimple manufactures of liquors in that country are ſaid to conſume twenty-five millions of buſhels of grain. Were there no other proofs, we could not doubt the importance of manufacture, to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024230_0007_0FC57E30648741E0"/>the agriculture of that country. They nouriſh and ſupport it. We make up all our wool—our lands produce cotton with great facility; and we manufacture liquors as eaſily as Britain. There is no doubt, that the latter branch already affords to our farmers an <hi>annual market</hi> for 1,0,000 buſhels of grain. This manufacture is well underſtood and carried on in all the ſouthern ſtates.</p>
               <p>The objection, that manufactures take the people from agriculture, is not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, as elſewhere obſerved; ſince women, children, horſes, water, and fire, all work at manufactures, and perform four-fifths of the labour; and as many manufacturers migrate to the united ſtates, it may be fairly queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>quantity</hi> of agricultural induſtry is not <hi>increaſed</hi> by the impulſe and demand a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The employment of the new medium, the public certificates (which may be taken at £. 15,000,000 ſterling) in a country that formerly had no. £ 3,000,000 ſterling of medium, renders manufactures neceſſary at the time. It may be ſaid, lands will employ it. But farms ſold well at the time when £. 3,000,000 ſterling was probably the utmoſt ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>NUMBER II.</hi> Concerning the manufactures of the united ſtates.</head>
               <p>IN purſuing the conſideration of American manufactures as beneficial and neceſſary to the ſouthern ſtates, it will be uſeful to take a curſory view of the indications of attachment and diſpoſition to them, which are diſcovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in that quarter.</p>
               <p>Virginia appears to be making a greater <hi>progreſs</hi> in merchant mills than any ſtate in the union, though ſome are yet far before her in thoſe beneficial works. Maryland and Delaware which are in the ſouthern moiety, are ſecond only to Pennſylvania in this branch. There is little doubt that more <hi>pig and bar iron</hi> is made to the ſouthward of Pennſylania, than to the northward of it. A lead mine has been opened in Virginia which is extending its ſupplies through the union, and promiſes fair to be commenſurate with the preſent demand: and there is one, which is now worked, in the territory ſouth of the Ohio. But no lead mines are in conſiderable operation in the ſtates north or eaſt of Virginia, though a ſmall beginning upon one in the weſtern parts of Pennſylvania is made. An aſſociation in Virginia, another in the territory ſouth of the Ohio, and a company in the weſtern diſtrict of South Carolina, have provided themſelves with carding and ſpinning machinery on the Britiſh plan, to manufacture their <hi>native</hi> cotton. The planters in the ſouthern ſtates raiſe quantities of this raw material, unthought of before the war, and until the diſcuſſions of the ſubject of manufactures, which took place after the treaty of peace. The family manufactures in <hi>cotton</hi> are much greater in the four ſouthernmoſt ſtates, than in the four eaſtern ſtates. There are not wanting conſiderable numbers of <hi>ſheep</hi> in the five ſouthern ſtates, yet by the two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of exports, it appears that no <hi>wool</hi> has been ſent <hi>from thence</hi> to foreign markets. It has been common to receive wool in Pennſylvania from the eaſtern ſtates, though they manufacture ſo much, but it is not known that any is ever received there for ſale from the ſouthern ſtates. Wool has been tranſported to Salem in North Carolina, and to Wincheſter in Virginia, from the city of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, for the hat manufactory.</p>
               <p>There has been full as great a current of emigration of <hi>flour millers, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, tanners, hatters, cabinet-makers, diſtillers, coopers, &amp;c.</hi> to the ſouthern ſtates from thoſe north of them, in proportion to numbers as of farmers; ſo that the workſhops of the middle and northern ſtates yield a double benefit to their fellow citizens in the ſouth, in ſupplying them with manufactures, and artizans.</p>
               <p>There is greater <hi>variety</hi> in diſtillation in the four ſouthern ſtates than in the four eaſtern—that is, <hi>the manufactory is eſtabliſhed on a broader baſis.</hi> It is alſo more <hi>certain</hi> in the ſouth than in the north. In the latter, melaſſes is the principal ingredient and being from an external ſource, may be loſt to the eaſtern diſtillers. Their manufactory is even now at hazard, unleſs they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the grain of the country to the ſouthward of them. But in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſtates they manufacture ſpirits from melaiſes, peaches, apples, ſeveral kinds of grain, and probably will, as their country is cleared, extend it to <hi>the grape.</hi> This has been tried with ſucceſs in the experimental way, at Galliopolis, near the Scioto.</p>
               <p>The legiſlature of North Carolina made a loan of money ſince the late war to aſſiſt introduction of the paper manufactory.</p>
               <p>An aſſociation, containing forty of the moſt reſpectable planters and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, in the weſtern diſtrict of South Carolina, has been eſtabliſhed within a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024230_0009_0FC57E33638E7A60"/>few years for the promotion of manufactures, and agriculture. A ſubſcription to the amount of about 25,000 dollars has been made in the territory ſouth of the Ohio for the purpoſe of carrying on the cotton manufactory. An indication of zeal not equalled in any middle or northern ſtate, conſidering that the whole population of the government is 30,000 whites, and 5,000 blacks.</p>
               <p>The preparation of tar, pitch, turpentine, ſpirits of turpentine, and roſin, in North Carolina and its vicinity, may be deemed a manufacture as juſtly as the making of linſeed oil, potaſh, or ordinary tanning. A very ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity indeed, of theſe articles, will be made in the ſtates north of Virginia, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap>ſe nature forbals; but they will, from obvious reaſons, increaſe in the ſouth.</p>
               <p>During the exiſtance of the ſtate impoſt laws, two of the ſouthern ſtates (Maryland and Virginia) impoſed extra tonnage, not only upon foreign ſhips, put upon thoſe of the other ſtates, by which they evinced a ſtrong diſpoſition to encourage the <hi>manufacture of ſhips.</hi> The ſame two ſtates laid duties on the importation of ſpirits manufactured in the other parts of the union.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of Maryland impoſed conſiderable protecting duties to encourage their own manufactures. The legiſlature of Maryland have encouraged the glaſs manufactory in that ſtate by a conſiderable loan. That of Virginia paſſed a ſpecial act ſince the peace, to encourage the manufactory of ſnuff and tobacco.</p>
               <p>There are more factories of <hi>cordage and cables</hi> in two of the ſouthern ſtates, Maryland and Virginia, than in any two of the ſtates of New Jerſey, New York, Connecticut, and New Hampſhire. Virginia laid a duty of two-thirds of a dollar on cordage by her ſtate impoſt law.</p>
               <p>The important manufactory of ſhips has become greater in each of the three ſtates of Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina, than it now is in New Hampſhire. The ſouthern ſtate of Maryland manufactured in 1790 as many veſſels as any two of the northern ſtates of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Iſland.</p>
               <p>The paper-mill in the united ſtates, which is moſt remote from the ſea, is to be found in the town of Salem, in North Carolina, three hundred miles from the ſea. No ſuch manufactu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ge (a Moravian ſettlement) in the ſouthern ſtate of North Carolina, exiſt in any part of the union north of Maryland, equally remote from the ſea.</p>
               <p>There is one ſcene only, in the Atlantic counties, in which coal, iron, and waterfalls are found together in abundance. That ſcene, is therefore, peculiarly qualified for the iron branch of manufactures. The city of Richmond on the banks of James river, in Virginia, which is the place contemplated, may be conſidered in a permanent view as having an inconteſtable natural advantage over any more northern ſeaport in this intereſting branch. How profitable would it be to Virginia, were all her pig and bar iron paſſed under the tilt hammers or through the rolling and ſlitting mills which might be erected at that place.</p>
               <p>Some of the produce of the fiſheries, as before obſerved, are to be deemed manufactures. The he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This will not be deemed a mere ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of ingenuity, when it is remembered that the Britiſh and Iriſh give bounties on their fabrics, and even on the bulky articles of flour, grain, and biſcuit, to <hi>enable the exporter to deliver them with advantage in foreign mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</hi>

In places from whence thoſe articles cannot be export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without a great expenſe of tranſportation, it is very deſirable to give them this <hi>ſecond uſe</hi> but in ſituations too interior to be affected by the demand for exportation, and where of courſe they are not required for the purpoſes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal commerce, this new uſe muſt be created for them, or <hi>they will not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,</hi> and agriculture will conſequently languiſh. This view of the ſubject ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts the indiſpenſable neceſſity of manufactures to the proſperity of the interior and weſtern country as before intimated. Nor will theſe ideas appear, on examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be merely plauſible conjectures. They are no leſs ſupported by the ſtate of things, than by probability and reaſon. The towns of Waſhington, Pitts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, Bedford, and Huntingdon, in Pennſylvania, (the neareſt of which is 150 miles from a ſea port, exhibit the ſtrongeſt proofs, that manufactures are the beſt ſupport of the interior landed intereſt, and are neceſſary at once to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation and proſperity of the cultivators of the middle and weſtern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

               <p>It appears from this table, that in thoſe county towns (or ſeats of juſtice) in the interior and weſtern parts of Pennſylvania, the neceſſity for manufactures has occaſioned a little congregation of artizans, in the proportion of twenty-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven parts in one hundred, of the whole village in the ſmalleſt inſtance, and in the proportion of thirty-ſeven parts in one hundred, in the largeſt. The town of Waſhington, which is the moſt remote, and is beyond the Ohio, has been created ſince the late war. Its diſtance is about 300 miles weſt of Philadelphia. The variety of its manufactures is ſtriking, and it may he ſafely affirmed, that at the ſeats of juſtice, in the counties of Delaware, Bucks, Cheſter, and Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery, which are neareſt to Philadelphia, as great a number of manufacturers, in proportion to their reſpective population, does not exiſt, though the family manufactures are more conſiderable in theſe, and though they have numerous tanneries, iron works, powder mills, paper mills, blackſmiths, hatters, ſhoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, weavers, and other valuable workmen, in their villages and ſcattered throughout their populous townſhips. This, however, is the caſe, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, likewiſe in the townſhips of the weſtern ſcene above deſcribed.</p>
               <p>In the midland counties of Pennſylvania, manufactures have reſulted from <hi>a flouriſhing agriculture,</hi> and, immediately on their birth, have contributed to the proſperity of the cultivators. The borough of Lancaſter, which is the largeſt inland town in the united ſtates, is ſixty-ſix miles from a ſeaport, and ten from any practiſed boat navigation. The number of families was in 1786, about 700, of whom 234 were manufacturers. The following is the liſt of them. Fourteen hatters, thirty-ſix ſhoemakers, four tanners, ſeventeen ſaddlers, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five tailors, twenty-five weavers of woolen, linen, and cotton cloth, three ſtocking weavers, twenty-five white and black ſmiths, ſix wheelwrights, eleven <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

There were in 1786, alſo within thirty-nine miles of the town, ſeventeen furnaces, forges, rolling mills and ſlitting mills, and within ten miles of it eighteen corn mills, ſixteen ſaw mills, one fulling mill, four oil mills, five hemp mills, two boreing and grinding mills for gun barrels, and eight tanneries. The increaſe ſince 1786, muſt have been very conſiderable; for the attention of the united ſtates has been very much turned to manufactures ſince the year 1787. It may be ſafely affirmed, that the counties of Lancaſter (in which the borough is) York and Berks are the moſt vigorous in Pennſylvania, perhaps in the union, and that there are none in the ſtate in which there are more manufactures, is beyond all queſtion. They are all fifty miles or more, from the neareſt ſeaport. Information through ſeveral channels, affords the greateſt reaſon to believe, that the interior of Frederick and Elizabeth towns in Maryland, Stanton in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, Lexington in Kentucky and other towns in the ſouthern ſtates, would prove on examination, ſimilar to thoſe of Pennſylvania, and that the improvements in neceſſary manufactures are as viſible and as rapid, as thoſe in agriculture<note n="*" place="bottom">The following account of the ſize and of the manufactures of Wincheſter, in Virginia, is furniſhed by a perſon lately a reſident in that place.

Coaſtwiſe there is alſo a great trade in theſe and many other manufactured articles, and in raw materials and proviſions for the manufacturers within the united ſtates.</p>
               <p>An argument of great importance to the ſhipholders, exporters, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writers, and, indeed to the cultivators of the earth, in ſupport of manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is to be drawn from their tendency to promote in an eaſy, certain, ſafe, and cheap way, the naval capacities and ſtrength of the united ſtates. The tranſportation of proviſions, coal, raw materials, and other articles from the ſouthern and middle ſtates to the northern, and the diffuſion of the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of the towns on the coaſt, throughout the union, already employs many veſſels. The rice, indigo, cotton, hemp, flax, iron, hides, furs, tar, pitch, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, rozin, wax, tobacco, wood and timber, flour and grain, ſhipped from the ſtates, on, and to the ſouthward of the Cheſapeak, for the manufacturers in the middle and northern ſtates, give employment at this time to a very reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion of our tonnage. This cannot be doubted, when it is remembered that our coaſters are 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It appears from this table, that in thoſe county towns (or ſeats of juſtice) in the interior and weſtern parts of Pennſylvania, the neceſſity for manufactures has occaſioned a little congregation of artizans, in the proportion of twenty-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven parts in one hundred, of the whole village in the ſmalleſt inſtance, and in the proportion of thirty-ſeven parts in one hundred, in the largeſt. The town of Waſhington, which is the moſt remote, and is beyond the Ohio, has been created ſince the late war. Its diſtance is about 300 miles weſt of Philadelphia. The variety of its manufactures is ſtriking, and it may he ſafely affirmed, that at the ſeats of juſtice, in the counties of Delaware, Bucks, Cheſter, and Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery, which are neareſt to Philadelphia, as great a number of manufacturers, in proportion to their reſpective population, does not exiſt, though the family manufactures are more conſiderable in theſe, and though they have numerous tanneries, iron works, powder mills, paper mills, blackſmiths, hatters, ſhoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, weavers, and other valuable workmen, in their villages and ſcattered throughout their populous townſhips.

               <p>SOME of the benefits to the coaſting trade and other parts of the domeſtic commerce reſulting from manufactures, have already been intimated in treating of the manufacture of liquors. Beſides theſe, bark and hides for the tanneries, iron, lead, ſteel, copper, hemp, flax, wool, cotton, ſilk, wood, timber, furs, tobacc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, flaxſeed, and gram, for the manufacturers of thoſe articles, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, fuel, indigo, and other objects of their conſumption and uſe, together with the goods made by them, are, and conſtantly will be purchaſed, tranſported from place to place, and ſold, creating a great part of the employment for 110,000 tons of coaſting veſſels, exerciſing a large portion of commercial induſtry and ſkill, and affording a return of profits, on a very conſiderable ſum of mercantile capital, employed in the buſineſs. This branch of our trade is of <hi>peculiar</hi> importance; becauſe we have no tranſmarine colonies, and while the redundancy of ſhipping owned by moſt nations, will leave us but little chance of materially increaſing our veſſels in the foreign trades, the extenſion we may give, in the courſe of ten years, to our home trade and navigation, will probably be very great. We have brought cotton, ſugar, and ſaltpetre, to manufacture from India, ſulphur from the Adriatic, hemp, flax, and iron, from Ruſſia, copper from Sweden, furs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digo, and mahogany, from the gulph of Mexico, and coal for our workmen from England: and we cannot doubt, therefore, that we ſhall tranſport theſe commodities and others, from ſuch of the ſtates as produce them, to thoſe which ſhall create, or have already eſtabliſhed, a manufacturing demand.</p>
               <p>Foreign commerce being limited by the combined value of our imports, and exports, any mercantile capital, which accumulates beyond the ſum requiſite for thoſe purpoſes, would want employment of a commercial nature, if the merchant were not able to have recourſe to manufactures. This is not a mere ſpeculation in poſſible events; for conſiderable trading houſes, and others of reſpectable ſtanding, have actually entered into ſuch purſuits.

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024230_0017_0FC57E4AC79DB500"/>would make a greater ſum in freight back. This circumſtance is rendered of the more conſequence, by reaſon of our diſtance from the greater part of the conſumers of our ſurplus produce: and it is obvious, that ſhips will then be moſt profitable, when the meaſurement of all our imports, ſhall be equal to the meaſurement of all our exports. Veſſels, which depart and return fully la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, cannot fail to enrich their owners.</p>
               <p>No arguments will be neceſſary to convince the judicious and reflecting mind, that the employment of large capitals and of many merchants and traders is moſt certain and eaſy, where there is the greateſt number and variety of objects to buy and ſell. As our commercial towns, therefore, have offered manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured commodities to thoſe who come thither to trade, they have increaſed in buſineſs. Pot aſh, pearl aſh, country rum, domeſtic liquors, loaf ſugar, &amp;c. have already contributed to ſwell their exports, by attracting foreign demand, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the number of profitable objects of ſhipment. Theſe will naturally multiply under the hands of our manufacturers, and inſtead of markets, in which nothing but lumber, tobacco, ſtock, proviſions, and raw materials were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to be obtained, our ſeaports will be converted into magazines, in which all thoſe articles will be purchaſeable, and the various commodities manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured from them. For theſe goods in whatever ſhape, purchaſers will never be wanting: <hi>cheap merchandiſe as certainly attracts buyers, as water finds its level.</hi> Nor is this mere ſanguine hope, or ingenious ſuggeſtion; for it is an obvious truth, that the greateſt manufacturing nations in the old world, are the greateſt traders to foreign parts. Holland, when moſt remarkable for manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, traded to the amount of eighty millions of dollars per annum in the commodities of other countries.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The political concord and attachments, which grow out of mutual benefits, are the moſt rational and permanent. In this view, the cement, which will be given to the national union, by the interchanges of raw materials, proviſions, fuel, and manufactures among the ſeveral ſtates, is of ineſtimable value. If European nations have ſhown diſpoſitions of amity and mutual forbearance, on theſe conſiderations, it cannot be doubted that ſiſter ſtates will evince equal wiſdom and virtue. If many parts of our union, from policy or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary neceſſity for manufactured ſupplies, have been willing to exhibit the greateſt liberality towards thoſe foreigners, with whom they have been recently at the wideſt variance, it muſt appear very deſirable, that the capacity at once to accommodate them and engage their regard, ſhould be transferred from diſtant ſtrangers, to their own continent, and their own kindred. If the merchants and manufacturers of the opulent nation with whom the united ſtates ſo long waged war, influenced by the hope of our conſumption, cried aloud for peace, and, on the moment of its return, preſſed with all the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies of commerce to our ſhores, the exiſting friendſhip of the ſeveral parts of the union for each other muſt be ſtrengthened by ſimilar influences, as they ſhall be progreſſively created.</p>
               <p>The animated proſecution and liberal encouragement of manufactures, is at this moment a great political duty. The national legiſlature has increaſed the impoſt on foreign merchandiſe, to defray the expenſes of the Indian war. The continuance of a great part of the duties is to be no longer than that of the hoſtilities which occaſioned them to be laid.

The ſhoes, boots, horſemen's caps, hats, buckles, buttons, ſadlery, ſpears, rifles, gunpowder, and other articles for the uſe of the army, are made by American manufacturers. It is perceived, that war, which often interrupts foreign commerce and generally diminiſhes the prices of agricultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral productions for exportation, has in this inſtance no effects of that nature; but by judicious arrangements, may be rendered inſtrumental to the greateſt ſupport of the landed intereſt—<hi>the national manufactures.</hi> The lamentable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voc of the field muſt inevitably diminiſh the number of our cit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is detrimental to the united ſtates that the manufactures they conſume are drawn from nations whoſe citizens pay much greater contributions to their government than our manufacturers, and conſequently that we ſo far forth are ſubject to their taxes, impoſts, and exciſes. In Great Britain, for example, their national taxes are ſeven times as large as ours, in proportion to the numbers of people in the two countries; and their poor rates and church rate are <hi>each</hi> more than double our whole national contributions. The monopolies of thoſe countries fall heavily upon the conſumers, among their citizens; and thoſe, who purchaſe their fabries, bear a part of this burden, which lies on their manufacturers.

The company's civil and military charges would, in two years like the preſent, pay all the expenſes of our government, and diſcharge our national debt. The reſtrictions on navigation and trade in the European nations alſo enhance the price of raw materials and articles of conſumption required by their manufacturers, all which falls ultimately upon the people of the united ſtates, ſo far as their fabries are conſumed here.

               <p>This part of the national buſineſs has given riſe to doubts, whether the united ſtates are really in a proſperous ſituation. The apprehenſion is believed, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to have proceeded from ſeveral errors. The eſtimation of the imports has probably been made at the prices current in America, which is more than the united ſtates pay for them, by the total value of the following particulars. 1ſt, Such part of the ſhipping charges abroad, as accrue to the benefit of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the united ſtates, who may be on the ſpot to make the ſhipment: 2dly, that part of the freight upon them, which is paid to our own veſſels: 3dly, that part of the premium of inſurance upon them, which is paid to American un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwriters or inſurers: 4thly, the whole amount of the duties, and cuſtom-houſe ſees, on the goods, which amount to ſeveral millions of dollars. 5thly, the amount of the tonnage and fees on foreign veſſels, which are deductions in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the country, from the value of the goods imported in them: 6thly, the porterage, ſtorage, cooperage, weighing, guaging, meaſuring, commiſſions on ſales here and other incidental expenſes on that part of the imports which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to foreigners: 7thly, the profits of our merchants on that part of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which belongs to them: 8thly, the waſteage of goods belonging to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigners between their arrival or time of valuation and the time of ſale: 9thly the benefit of credit, which is not leſs than two and an half per cent. on the whole value of our imports: and 10thly, the value of thoſe importal goods which remain in the country, being the property of perſons intending to become, or who will ultimately become citizens of the united ſtates.

               <p>An opinion ſomewhat ſingular and of conſiderable importance will be hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this ſubject. <hi>The united ſtates, to make the utmoſt advantage of things in their preſent improveable ſituation, ſhould have little or no balance in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour on their general commerce.</hi> If their exports, outward freights, ſales of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and lands, &amp;c. amount to twenty-four millions of dollars per annum, they will find their true intereſt in importing the whole value in well-ſelected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. It is better, for example, that they import melaſſes, hemp, cotton, wool, bar iron, hides, ſkins, furs, ſaltpetre, ſulphur, copper, tin, braſs, paper, mahogany, &amp;c. to manufacture; tools for artizans, and materials and utenſils for conſtructing works, improving waſte lands, and cultivating farms, and breeding cattle, horſes, and ſheep; than that they ſhould bring back the equivalent in gold or ſilver. The ſum we annually import in articles of that nature, more precious to us than the moſt precious metals, would conſtitute an immenſe balance in our favour: ſuch, indeed, as would, in a few years, oppreſs our country with too copious a circulating medium, or compel us to export it.</p>
               <p>That the exports and other means of paying for our imports are much more adequate to the occaſion, than they were during ſeveral years ſubſequent to the peace, is manifeſt from the ſtate of our private credit in Europe.</p>
               <p>A diſtinction, and, it is conceived, a very important one, has been already intimated in favour of ſuch of our imports as are of a nature adapted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the value of our lands, or to employ or aſſiſt our citizens: and in regard to thoſe which are for immediate conſumption, the quantity cannot be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our former imports, conſidering the increaſe of population. We have almoſt abſolutely ceaſed to import ſhoes, boots, ſadlery, coarſe hats, plate, ſnuff, manufactured tobacco, cabinet wares, carriages, wool and cotton cards, hanging paper, gunpowder, and other articles; and we have exceedingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed our impertation of coarſe linen and woolen goods, cordage, copper uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils, tin utenſils, malt liquors, loaf ſugar, ſteel, paper, playing cards, glue, waſers, fine hats, braziery, watches and clocks, cheeſe, &amp;c: and we either make theſe articles from native productions, by which the whole value is ſtruck off from our imports, or we manufacture them of foreign raw materials, which coſt loſs than the goods uſed to do, eſpecially as they often yield a great freight to our own veſſels. Thus the freight of the melaſſes to make rum, imported in one year, at two dollars per hhd. was not leſs than 140,000 dollars. The ſame obſervation occurs as to hemp, cotton, iron, copper, braſs, tin, ſaltpetre, ſulphur, mahogany, hides, dye woods, and other raw materials.</p>
               <p>From theſe circumſtantial evidences, there would appear to be little danger of miſtake, in concluding, that our imports, on a medium of two or three years, have not been diſproportionate to our exports, and other ſafe and regular means of balancing the amount of our ſupplies. But though the documents for a compariſon between the preſent imports, and thoſe antecedent to the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are leſs perfect than is to be deſired, ſome which offer are worthy of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our imports from Great Britain in 1770, making ſome addition for thoſe from Ireland and adding 20 per cent. to bring them to their market value, were worth <hi>here</hi> above £. 2,400,000 ſterling. In this item, the information ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from a report of the lords of the Britiſh privy council, is principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on, though a part of it is ſupplementary eſtimation. To this ſum is to be added, a proportion of the imports into all the American colonies in 1770, from all the reſt of the would but Great Britain, which, after deducting therefrom £. 73,000 ſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l. for the value imported into Bermuda, the Bahamas, the northern Britiſh colonies, and Newfoundland, leaves £. 1,050,000 ſterling, at the value here. The total value
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024230_0021_0FC57E53ABEDF4D8"/>of our imports in 1770, would then appear to have been more than £. 3,450,000 or about 15,000,000 dollars, as they would have ſold in the American market; excluſive of the contraband trade, which was conſiderable. This will be ſeen by a reference to the firſt number of theſe reflexions, to be full ſeven millions of dollars more than our exports at the ſame time. If then our imports were to bear the ſame proportion to 18,250,000 dollars (our preſent exports) the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er might be above 34,000,000 dollars, without creating more alarm than we had then reaſon to feel. This view of the ſubject may convince us, that our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports were too copious, at leaſt in ſome quarters, for ſeveral years before the war; and hence we find a heavy load of private debt was created and remains upon the citizens of ſome of the ſtates at this day. Happily for the united ſtates, the reduction of the priers of ſupplies, by the preſent freedom of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, by the agency of ſkilful merchants inſtead of planters inexperienced in trade, by the introduction of machinery in Europe, and by their own manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing induſtry, has kept down their imports many millions of dollars below that ſum, although the import and tonnage have directly or indirectly contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to enhance the nominal amount, without increaſing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In taking a ſurvey of the American commerce, the attention is pleaſingly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to the increaſe of ſhip-building, the new manufactories of articles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the equipment of veſſels, and the improvement in the art of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building, as well as the ſuperior quality of the materials now uſed in their conſtruction. The largeſt number of veſſels built in any one year before the late war, as far as it can be aſcertained, was equal to 24,358 tons; and at leaſt 32,000 tons of ſuperior quality were built in 1791. The timber and plark are more choſen, and iron is more copiouſly uſed at this time, becauſe the veſſels are not intended for ſale, and the ſenſible practice of ſalting them, is becoming very frequent. It is important, too, that the art of ſhip-building is diffuſed more generally than any other equally important one, which is carried on within the united ſtates.</p>
               <p>The export trade in our produce is more beneficial than heretofore to the landed intereſt, becauſe the cultivators do not, as formerly, anticipate upon their crops abroad, by ordering out ſupplies at the diſcretion of the European merchant; to be paid for in ſhipments of their crops upon their own account and riſque. The pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rs in Maryland and Virginia, particularly the tobacco planters, ſuffered extremely from an inconſiderate purſuit of that practice before the reſolution. The American merchant is now more frequently their importer; and as he underſtands the mode of procuring goods cheap, the real profits of the import and export trade of the country, are in a greater degree divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the planter and the trader.</p>
               <p>The reduction of the prices of Eaſt India and China goods, of every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of manufactures in which labour ſaving machmery and ſlight apply, and of wines, occaſion our imports to be obtained on more favourable terms. This beneficial effect is increaſed by the freedom of our import trade, which lets in the productions and manufactures of all countries by a direct intercourſe with them, which was formerly forbidden. From the ſame cauſe, ſuperior prices for our produce and manufactured artic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The coaſting trade has become very great, and the derangement of the Weſt India trade muſt extend it exceedingly, during the current year, from the failure of melaſſes. The increaſe of manufactures, and foreign reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024230_0022_0FC57E56520CAE88"/>on other branches, have contributed to elevate this valuable part of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; and the former (manufactures) will continue ſteadily to increaſe its importance. The veſſels, which take ſupplies of flour, and many other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles from the middle and northern ſtates to South Carolina and Georgia, make very frequent voyages, and they return lets than half laden: but if the planters ſhould purſue the cultivation of hemp, flax, hops, and cotton, they may come trick with full cargoes. A ſimilar remark may be juſtly made in regard to other ſtates.</p>
               <p>The fiſheries do not appear to have recovered their former value; but it is plain, they have increaſed yearly ſince 1789: and they are even now more valuable than they appear to be. The conſumption of oil, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The profecution of manufactures has created ſome increaſe of our foreign trade, and will extend it. If we did not purſue that branch of induſtry, we ſhould not import copper, iron, and hemp, from the Baltic; cotton, ſaltpetre, and white callicoes from India; and cocoa, dye-woods, mahogany, cotton, and hides from the Weſt Indies, and the ſouthern parts of the American continent. Some of theſe importations are regularly and extenſively made; others are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing. Without them we ſhould have no intercourſe with ſome of theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and much leſs than we now have with others. In like manner, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with reveral countries is increaſed by manufactured exports. The demand for our potaſh, diſtilled ſpirits, ſhips and boats, ſteel, malt liquors, cheeſe, bar iron, ſlit iron, ſteel, gunpowder, carriages, and other articles, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions a greater and more beneficial trade with many foreign ports. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſay how rapid and how conſiderable the progreſs of this part of our commerce will be. The exported manufactures of Great Britain, in 1791, were greater than thoſe of fifty years ago, by twice the value of our preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>
               <p>It is extremely favourable to American commerce, internal and foreign, that a variety of changes have taken place in the affairs of the would, which have opened branches of trade formerly withhold from us by monopoly, or other circumſtances. The act of ſeparation from Great Britain enabled us to trade to China, Bombay, and Surat; and the enterpriſe of our citizens ſoon diſcovered the way. The curious perfection of manufacturing machinery in Europe, has made it the intereſt of the foreign India compames to fell us their piece goods in the markets of the cad, without taking them at ſecond hand.

               <p>THESE valuable inſtitutions were unknown to us before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, being added to the political economy in the latter part of the war. The paper emiſſions in the times of the provinces, had yielded ſome of the advantages of bank notes, though with leſs ſafety to thoſe who received them. But the degree in which they were unavoidably recurred to, in the courſe of the war, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely deſtroyed the utility of paper money in 1781. The ſtate of public credit, and indeed of the public affairs in general, as well as the exigencies of the cultivators, merchants, and manufacturers, required an efficient ſubſtitute for an inſtrument of negociation and dealing, of ſo great compaſs. The ſcheme of a bank preſented itſelf in the manner, which is univerſally known, as the moſt probable mean of accommodating the general neceſſities, political, agricultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and commercial. The promiſes, which the plan made, were abundantly fulfilled; and at the ſame time a ſtandard of public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and action in regard to the rights of property, was unobſervedly erected, at a moment when the recent courſe of events had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it very deſirable, as well from political as moral conſiderations. It has been found, accordingly, that the laws which concern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, in the places where banks have been eſtabliſhed, have quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquired a ſtability, if they were good, and have meliorated, if they were before exceptionable, notwithſtanding any ſuppoſed or real errors in the plans or adminiſtration of the inſtitutions.</p>
               <p>In re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ecting upon theſe eſtabliſhments, one cannot but call to mind a ſuggeſtion, which frequently occurs, that too large a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the capital of the united ſtates, has been applied to them. Few pecuniary operations are of as much importance. In eſtimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extent to which we might have gone with prudence, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the ſtate of that buſineſs in a ſucceſsful and at the ſame time the beſt known ſcene of trade in Europe, may be of ſome uſe. In the city of London, the bank of <hi>England</hi> (excluſively of that of Scotland) has operated with a capital of more than fifty millions of dollars about forty-ſix years. The population of <hi>England,</hi> on a medium, during that term, has been leſs than double that of the united ſtates at preſent, yet the capital of its bank has been above five times the capital of our national bank, and near five times the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of all the ſubſcriptions which are yet paid into all the banks in the united ſtates. There are, moreover, a great number of private banks in the ſame city, probably not leſs than ſixty in number, ſome of which have more capital ſtock, than any bank in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, except that of the united ſtates. The aggregate amount of their capitals is probably equal to that of the bank of England. Beſides theſe, there are very many conſiderable private banks ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered through the kingdom. In addition to theſe, there are the public and the private banks of Scotland. If the banks of England
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024230_0025_0FC57E5F4A1C0B10"/>and Scotland, public and private, out of London, be equal to the private banks of London alone, then the capital of thoſe inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Great Britain, will be 150,000,000 dollars, or above fourteen times as many dollars as there are perſons in that kingdom, though the whole of the ſtocks of the banks in the united ſtates, which are paid in, are not equal to three times the number of their inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. Again. If the banks of Great Britain be meaſured by the exports of that iſland, it will be found, that the latter, at their higheſt value (ninety millions of dollars) are only three fifths of their aggregate bank capital, and that our exports, at 18,250,000 dollars, are above two thirds more than all our bank capital, which is actually paid in. Taking the Britiſh imports at 80,000,000 of dollars, and thoſe of the united ſtates at 24,000,000, the compariſon will be ſtill more in favour of the diſcretion, which has been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the united ſtates. But a very important meaſure of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions yet remains to be applied, by which prudent men will be diſpoſed to teſt the ſubject—<hi>the quantity of ſpecie.</hi> The bank capital of Great Britain being, as above ſtated, about 150 millions of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and the quantum of ſpecie being never eſtimated at more than 22,000,000 <abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling, or 97,700,000 dollars, the aggregate bank ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals of the united ſtates, as now paid in (ten and one half millions of dollars) would be as prudently, and ſolidly founded on a quantity of ſpecie a little leſs than ſeven millions of dollars. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it would be impoſſible to aſcertain the preciſe amount of the ſpecie of the united ſtates, eſtimates carefully made, appear to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a belief, that it is equal to that ſum. But while examinations like theſe ſeem to abate and even entirely to deſtroy, the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that we may have purſued the buſineſs of banking to the injury of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, ſome circumſtances of a prudential nature are not to be overlooked. When forming theſe eſtabliſhments, we may commit errors, perhaps, in carrying into one ſcene too great a proportion of the capital appropriated to their creation. Hence the ſound policy of ſubtracting from the maſs of the bank of the united ſtates, to eſtabliſh branches at New-York, Boſton, Baltimore, Charleſton and (as is ſaid to be intended) in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, miniſtering to the convenience, the neceſſities, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of government, the planter, the farmer, the merchant, the navigator, the fiſherman, the ſhipbuilder, the manufacturer and the mechanic, in ſix ſeveral and variant ſcenes, inſtead of accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in one great maſs, a ſuperabundant capital—A political magnet attracting through devious courſes and attaching all things to its own vicinity.</p>
               <p>It is poſſible to err, too, in the diſpoſition of banking eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by ſuperadding to thoſe which already accommodate a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſcene, rather than introducing the new inſtitutions into places hitherto without them. The united ſtates contain five or ſix great local ſubdiviſions of trade, reſulting principally from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious dictates of <hi>the nature of things.</hi> In moſt of thoſe great ſpheres, there is more than one conſiderable and flouriſhing trading town, though there is in each, one which has an acknowledged pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. When a reaſonable portion of bank capital has been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into one of theſe commercial <hi>metropoles,</hi> the eſtabliſhment of a new bank would ſeem to be moſt expedient in the trading town of the next degree of conſideration. It is true, that ſo far as the operation
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024230_0026_0FC57E61422C9460"/>is an employment, or application of the property of individuals, it muſt be left, (within the laws) to their own will; but as the act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation places the ſubject within the power of the legiſlatures, and within the ſphere of their cares and duties, ſo it is highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant that theſe inſtitutions be modified in their original formation, upon prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A precious conſequence has reſulted from the diſtribution of banks through different parts of the united ſtates. Like all great objects, theſe inſtitutions, while operating very beneficially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the buſineſs of a country, are liable to be rendered inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to local party views. Being committed, as in the united ſtates, to ten ſeveral boards of directors, ſelected for the ſervice on account of their property, integrity, talents, and attention to buſineſs, and whoſe primary duties are the legal, diſcreet, and beneficial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of their truſt, it is not probable, nor, indeed, is it in their power, to deviate from their proper walk, into the ground of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical combination and intrigue.</p>

In this reſpect, the bank of England, and the bank of Ireland (which are among the beſt accredited of thoſe inſtitutions in Europe) exceed that of the united ſtates in the proportion of one third. It is very favourable to our inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that the national debt, and ordinary and extraordinary expenſes of both Great Britain and Ireland are much greater in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to wealth and numbers, than thoſe of the united ſtates, and that our government is not leſs free from error, nor more like to be diſturbed than theirs. It cannot, therefore, be more unſafe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in our inſtitution, which contains three fourths, than in theirs which is wholly compoſed of public debt. It is, moreover, true, and worthy of obſervation, that moſt of the other banks in the united ſtates (and particularly the three largeſt) have voluntarily and by their own operations placed conſiderable portions of their ſtock up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credit of the united ſtates, by purchaſing largely of the public debt, and by giving at this time extenſive credits founded upon its ſecurity. The market value of the public debt, which is generally greater in ſpecie than its nominal amount, renders that part of the bank ſtock, which is compoſed of it, intrinſically more valuable than that which is in coin.</p>

The body of the planters, that is, thoſe who cultivate tobacco, rice, indigo, and cotton, are, as a general deſcription of cultivators, the beſt inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in regard to the object of their particular purſuit, though it is manifeſt that they have abundant matter for increaſed attention in perfecting their cultivation, in aſcertaining thoſe ſpecies of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable plants, which are moſt excellent, moſt certain, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive, in the improvement of their implements of huſbandry, in the acquiſition of auxiliary implements and machinery, in perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the modes of curing their produce, and preparing it for market and particularly in the attainment of an adequate ſubſtitute for the ordinary ſpecies of labourers, a ſupply of which has become precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. It appears to be worth their conſidering, too, as well with an eye to profit, as humanity, whether an advantageous variation in the employment of ſome of the blacks might not be made, by introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon every eſtate ſome of the ſimpler manufactures to employ children, old and invalid perſons of both ſexes, and particularly the females during that term when two lives depend upon their health.</p>
               <p>The merchants, navigators, fiſhermen, and ſhipbuilders of the united ſtates may be ſafely affirmed to be four deſcriptions of our citizens, whoſe induſtry is as uniformly energetic and well directed, as thoſe of any country in the world, though it is certain that a much ſtricter economy prevails among perſons of ſome foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions engaged in thoſe purſuits—an example demanding ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
               <p>The manufacturers in ſome branches purſue their occupations under the diſadvantages of very few errors; yet thoſe citizens would be ſenſibly benefited, were they able to relieve themſelves of certain parts of their labour by the attainment of the auxiliary machinery, which are the purchaſe of larger capitals than are yet engaged in their line. Circumſtances, however, of various kinds are daily contributing to remove this inconvenience. The bulk of the manufacturers do not want induſtry, nor ſkill enough to ſucceed in thoſe ſimple manufactures, to which it is moſt their intereſt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves. It may be rather ſaid, that they manufacture ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary kinds of fabries, from the nature of the demand, than that they manufacture badly. Their buſineſs is, moreover, progreſſively advancing, and has felt, on ſeveral occaſions, ſome of them recent, the foſtering hand of goverument.</p>
               <p>The mechanic branches have been, till this time, on nearly as good a footing; but thoſe employed in the erection of buildings ought now to ſeek the and of ſuch parts of ſcience as have relation to their calling. Architecture has been little ſtudied. It ought not to be forgotten, that a competent knowledge of it is no leſs conducive to economy and convenience, than to elegance and ſplendor.</p>
               <p>The moſt important of all the employments of our citizens, that of <hi>the farmer,</hi> remains to be noticed. It is very much to be feared, that in point of execution, a candid examination would prove that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024230_0028_0FC57E652E0DF678"/>this beſt of purſuits is moſt imperfectly conducted. The proofs are, innumerable inſtances of impoveriſhed lands, bodies of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow lands, in the old ſettlements, which remain in a ſtate of nature, an almoſt univerſal inattention to the making or preſerving of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, the frequent inattention to the condition of the feed grain, evidenced by the growth of inferior grain in fields of wheat, and by the complexion of the flour in ſome quarters, the bad condition of barns, ſtables and fences, and in ſome places the total want of the former, the deficiency of ſpring-houſes or other cool dairies in extenſive tracts of country, the want, or a trifling ſtock of bees, the frequent want of orchards, and the neglect of thoſe which have been planted by preceding occupants, the neglect of the ſugar tree, the neglect of fallen timber and fuel, accompanied with the wanton felling of timber trees for fuel, the neglect of houſehold manufactures in many families, the neglect of making pot-aſh, the non-uſe of oxen, and above all, the growth in ſubſtance, of large bodies of farmers on lands of ordinary quality, while the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of extenſive ſcenes, hardly extract from much ſuperior lands, a miſerable ſuſtenance and more miſerable clothing.</p>
               <p>It is a fact very painful to obſerve, and unpleaſant to repreſent, but it is indubitably true, that <hi>farming</hi> in the grain ſtates, their great beſt buſineſs, the employment moſt precious in free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is, too generally ſpeaking, the leaſt underſtood, or the leaſt economically and attentively purſued, of any of the occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which engage the citizens of the united ſtates. It is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, however, with ſatisfaction, that great changes have been lately made, and that the energy, ſpirit of improvement, and eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, which have been recently diſplayed, promiſe the regular and rapid melioration of the agricultural ſyſtem. All other things have taken a courſe of great improvement—and it cannot be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the yeomanry of the united ſtates will permit themſelves to be excelled by any of their brethren, in the moſt precious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of a good citizen—<hi>uſefulneſs in their proper ſphere.</hi>

                  <hi>Concerning the laws which intrench upon the rights of property.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not remembered that the acts of the national legiſlature have been deemed by any of the poſſeſſors of any deſcription of property, unfavourable to their rights, except the proceedings in regard to the public debt. It is no leſs curious than true, that a part of the community affirm that the government have injured the country by too much liberality, while another part charge the legiſlature with impairing the contract.</p>
               <p>In taking a view of this ſubject, it ſhould be remembered, that the ſtate of things when it was taken up, was in every reſpect critical and uncertain. It was difficult to ſay what the country could perform, and more ſo to tell what they would comply with. It was perceived, on the one hand, that as ſuch a ſtate of <hi>public <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t</hi> as preceded the year 1789, would ruin a government more energetic than that of the united ſtates, ſo its immediate melioration was a matter of the moſt imperious neceſſity. On the other hand, the non-exiſtence of one ſingle efficient funding ſyſtem, <hi>yielding a full ſpecie intereſt,</hi> in any one ſtate, and a number of painful facts in the financial operations of ſome of the legiſlatures, created a conviction, that there was either an inability or diſinclination in all to render a ſpecie pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024230_0029_0FC57E682A689910"/>in the full extent of the <hi>explicit</hi> contracts. Some of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts were found not to be explicit containing promiſes of large ſums under the name ſpecie, which it could not have been the expectation of the government at their date to diſcharge, or of the creditor to receive in coin; becauſe they promiſed to pay as ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, what was notoriouſly much leſs valuable than contracts previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly liquidated at forty nominal dollars for one in coin. The claims of the original creditors alſo were ſtrongly repreſented, while the conduct of every ſtate in the union, in its particular finances, had diſcountenanced a diſcrimination in their favour; and the eſtabliſhed laws of property were urged againſt a reduction of the owners prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal: queſtions were alſo raiſed about the original intrinſic value of the money and property received by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nired ſtates, leading to the deviſing of a new ſcale of depreciation. By infuſing into the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for a ſettlement of the debt, two qualities—<hi>a reduction of the intereſt</hi> and <hi>a temporary irredeemability of the principal,</hi> which have coſt the debtor nothing, and the creditor very little; by vigerous and well deviſed efforts to recover credit at home and abroad, an arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was formed, and executed, which has given better payment to the creditor than could reaſonably have been hoped. It is plain to every obſerver, that, but for the indiſcretions of ſome of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic creditors, who ſuperadded to the trials and fluctuations of a convaleſcent ſtate of credit the late unparalleled difficulties of the holders of the ſtock, the three ſpecies of the public poper, taken at a medium, would have been worth the nominal value in the market. <hi>Hitherto it never has been.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There yet remain, however, in the united ſtates ſome laws which affect the rights of property. The operation of inſtalment and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation laws is not terminated in two or three of the ſtates. In two or three others, paper money is a tender in all or in particular caſes. In ſome quarters, real eſtate is protected from execution for debt; and in others, the judgments of the courts are ſuſpended, if the income of the eſtate bears a certain proportion to the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors' demand. In ſome of the ſtates, preferences are given to the claims of citizens, before thoſe of citizens of the other ſtates, or of foreigners; and a variety of ill exiſts in many quarters, in the form of inſolvent laws. The ſederal conſtitution, and thoſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the ſtates, have barred the introduction of theſe evils in regard to new tranſactions; and the ſtates which are not chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with them, in regard to paſt affairs, have reaped, in the laſt three years an ample reward for their wiſdom and virtue. Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may almoſt be called <hi>the palladium of communities.</hi> Their <hi>moral</hi> ſafety at leaſt is always at hazard, when that is unwarrantably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded. In every caſe wherein difficulties to obtain his own are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed in the way of the honeſt and induſtrious citizen, his loſs is not all the public injury. A fellow-citizen—perhaps a member of a legiſlature (and through him a legiſlature itſelf) is corrupted in his principles.</p>

                  <hi>Concerning the public debts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When it is remembered, that the terms upon which the debts of the ſtates were aſſumed by cougreſs, are not more favourable than thoſe on which the ſedral debt was funded, and when it is called to mind, that the unaſſumed debts of all the ſtates are leſs valuable
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024230_0030_0FC57E696F6C78F0"/>in the market than thoſe which were aſſumed, it will appear, that the public creditors of the union have little reaſon to complain. When the advantages of the temporary irredeemability, and of the opportunity of inveſtment in the bank are recollected, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon, if any exiſted, appears to be diſſipated. On the other hand, when it is remembered, that long after the promulgation of the funding ſyſtem and of the bank, the poſſeſſors of ſpecie might have procured certificates upon very advantageous terms, that the united ſtates draw a fifth of the profits of the bank without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing any of the capital, that the grant of irredeemability is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary. and ſo perfectly nominal, that we have now a right to pay off more than we have money to diſcharge; when it is alſo borne in mind, that the terms given by congreſs to the public creditors, were exceeded (by law at leaſt) in ſeveral of the ſtates, and that two of them have added to the benefits of their citizens from the funding ſyſtem, without diſcriminating in favour of the original creditor, or againſt the preſent holder, the arrangement of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral government appears to be conſiſtent with the public intereſts and with <hi>the wiſdom of the ſtate legiſlatures.</hi> If the funding ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of congreſs has been thus equally juſt and beneficial with thoſe of the ſtates, it has been accompanied with many advantages which cannot be queſtioned. Public credit is reſtored—in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that, the contracts for all public ſupplies are made for caſh on the deliveries or performance—the money, thus early pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, is paid by anticipation on the proffer of indubitable ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by the various coutractors; and intereſt in favour of the united ſtates has been allowed for the promptitude of her treaſury—half a million of dollars of ſpecie claims have been diſcharged; and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes of the public de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Loans upon five per cent. upon four and a half per cent. and upon four per cent. intereſt, have been effected in two opulent ſcenes in Europe, ſolely by means of our reſtored credit, to repay in the hour of need, to that ally, the monies lent to the united ſtates in a like ſeaſon.

The relief of ſome of the ſtates from their burdens, has been ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beneficial conſequence of the funding of the debt. It is but a few years ſince one of the moſt frugal, vigorous, and productive counties in Pennſylvania roſe againſt the collectors of the taxes. The appreciation and ſale of the immenſe maſs of ſederal ſecurities, owned by that ſtate, has enabled her to diſcharge all her obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though ſhe has aboliſhed her general land tax, and diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued her exciſe, both of which ſhe has collected for forty years.</p>
               <p>Some anxiety has been created by the ſhare of our debt, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigners have obtained. But this was a powerful means of bringing the whole into its preſent beneficial action, by elevating its actual to its nominal value. It is not at all probable, that it will be drawn from the country. It has been obſerved, in the moſt tranquil and proſperous ſtate of Europe, that a great proportion of the families of thoſe foreigners, who have made large inveſtments in the united ſtates, either in the times of the provinces, or ſince the revolution, have become inhabitants of this country, even when in its rudeſt infant ſtate. At this ſerious moment, when almoſt every tranſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic country ſeels or apprehends diſorders, our chances are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely increaſed. The united ſtates, advanced in the means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence comfort, and of elegance, now preſent to them an object of greater deſire in a tranquil liberty, which they are ſtruggling to obtain, a teeming agriculture, and a proſperous commerce, both foreign and internal. Conformably with theſe reflexions, we may affirm, that no great object in our affairs has failed to attract the notice of the foreigners, who have engaged in our funds. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal navigation of South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennſylvania, New-Jerſey and New-York, are among the witneſſes of this truth. The banks, both national and ſtate, the turnpike roads, and toll bridges, the ſales of city eſtates, of cultivated farms, and particularly of unimproved lands, commerce, ſhip-build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, manuta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tures, confirm the fact. Let us continue to exhibit an honeſt ſpirit in our laws and conſtitutions, an efficient execution of them, and due abſtinence from unneceſſary wars, and there cannot exiſt a doubt, that we ſhall draw much more copiouſly from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, the arts, and the funds of Europe, than they will draw from thoſe of the united ſtates.</p>
               <p>There exiſts in the united ſtates one deſcription of private diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and incumbrances, which muſt engage the ſolicitude of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feeling mind, which, by an examination into the detail and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior of our affairs, has been led to obſerve them. The caſes allud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to are thoſe of the citizens of two or three of the ſtates, who are burdened with heavy debts or claims, which originated before the revolution. Whatever they may be finally adjudged to pay, the ſum muſt be ſo great, and due from ſo many perſons, as to give it the reſemblance of a public debt: and as in one of thoſe ſtates i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>as already occaſioned ſome ſacrifices of their principal landed eſtates, very far below their value, ſo it will probably operate in the others, unleſs ſome extenſive means, abundantly adequate to the occaſion, can be brought to operate, before or at leaſt at the time of executing the judgments of courts, which may be obtained. No reſource, competent to the purpoſe, appears at all likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent itſelf, unleſs it be the funded debt or ſtock of the united ſtates and of the ſeveral ſtates. The method by which this deſcription of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024230_0032_0FC57E7041081190"/>property can be rendered moſt immediately and effectually ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the intereſting purpoſe of preventing the deſtruction of many families, would ſeem to be the fixture of it at a ſtable unfluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating rate, adequate to its proper value, under the exiſting circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the united ſtates. It is manifeſt, that in ſuch a ſtate of the market, the dealers in the debt and others would ſell out, and would not buy in again, and that they would ſeek objects for their money in the trade, the manufactures, the buildings, and the lands of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which might promiſe them more advantage. A tenth part of the value of the public debts, applied to the lands of the united ſtates, would raiſe them every where to their real value, ſo that the debtor who might be under a neceſſity to ſell an eſtate, could diſpoſe of his property not only without a ruinous ſacrifice, but probably to uncommon advantage. The proprietors of lands and buildings which might be under this probability of ſale, would ſuſtain no riſque or injury in ſelling their eſtates for the public ſtock.</p>
               <p>It may be alleged, that the holders of the debt will not go into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cenes ſo remote to make inveſtments: but there are facts, which appear to warrant a different opinion. The funds of New-England have been brought into Pennſylvania, for inveſtment in lands of ſeveral kinds—the money of Pennſylvania and Delaware has been inveſted in mills and lands in Virginia—the greater part of the iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works of Maryland (the moſt coſtly eſtates in our country,) were bought and worked by the capitals of reſidents in Great Britain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the revolution. The ſame fact exiſted in one great inſtance in New Jerſey. The greateſt cedar ſwamp, on the waters of the Delaware, that ſupplies the Philadelphia market, is owned in New England; and people and veſſels from that quarter, are annually ſent to perform the buſineſs of it. The American public creditors, citizens of the unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Netherlands, have recently purchaſed eight hundred tracts of land in a part of Pennſylvania, further from Philadelphia than the banks of James's River, York, or Rappahannock. In ſhort, if the hiſtory of this country were examined, as it regards this ſubject, it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that the landed property of it has been conſtantly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the application of the monies of diſtant capitaliſts.</p>

                  <hi>NUMBER V.</hi> Concerning the foreign debts of the united ſtates.</head>
               <p>AT the commencement of the preſent government in 1789, the united ſtates were indebted to France, Holland and Spain, and to the foreign officers of the late army, in a ſum amounting to near twelve millions of dollars. Near a million and two thirds of this ſum, was due for arrears of intereſt, inattention to which, would have been too diſgraceful to have admitted of a hope of public credit, until meaſures were taken for its diſcharge. Above a million and one third of the principal ſum had become due, and the time of other inſtallments was coming round. The reſources of the country had been examined and conſidered, but not tried. The claims of theſe foreign creditors, were, originally, the moſt delicate in themſelves; and in the caſe of France, the ſtate of her revolution in the ſummer of 1790, placed her demand in a ſituation peculiarly intereſting. It was perceived that the adoption of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral conſtitution and the meaſures taken to reſtore public credit, had made ſtrong and favourable impreſſions on the European money lenders: and it was not doubted, that the arrears of intereſt and the principal due, might be diſcharged by loans, upon terms which would produce very little loſs. The requiſite authorities were given by the legiſlature, which reſulted in the borrowing of a ſum equal to the diſcharge of all the exigible debt. But as the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the French were likely to be emergent, and there was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conſide, that a firm and ſteady purſuit of the financial ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, which had by that time been adopted, and an adherence to the upright ſpirit of the conſtitution, would rapidly meliorate the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the united ſtates, it was deemed expedient to extend the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities to borrow, to a ſum equal to the whole of the foreign debt, provided the inſtallments not due could be diſcharged by means of loans advantageous to the united ſtates. The intereſt of above ſeven millions of the foreign debt, being at the rate of five per cent per annum, it was not doubted, that the money might be obtained ſo as to render the diſcharge of the part, not exigible, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally advantageous. It has accordingly happened, that a ſum adequate to the principal and intereſt due, has been borrowed within the terms of the law, ſo as to ſupport the credit and good faith of the united ſtates, and critically to accommodate the people of France. The further expectations of congreſs have alſo been fulfilled; a conſiderable loan at four and on half, and two loans at four per cent, having been effected, ſo as to realize an advantage in the diſcharge of a large part of the principal, which was at an intereſt of five per cent. The united ſtates having thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted their foreign debt, further than is due, with honour, and, on a medium of the whole, with advantage, are relieved by theſe operations from any poſſibility of preſſure to perform the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their European engagements. The friends of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic credit, of our national ſafety and reſpectability, and of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024230_0034_0FC57E7539FEB1E8"/>of France, among the citizens of the united ſtates, will reflect upon this actual courſe of events with cordial ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The concluſion: being miſcellaneous thoughts on the government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people of the united ſtates enjoy a peculiar felicity in the poſſeſſion of principles of government and of civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liberty, more ſound, more accurately defined, and more extenſively reduced to practice, than any preceding republicans. There is not one iota of delegating or delegated power, which is not poſſeſſed, or may not be acquired by every citizen. It is true, that there are in practice, ſeveral deviations in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of powers to the various ſubdiviſions of the country, and to the proprietors of certain deſcriptions of property; but theſe are acknowledged departures from principle, and are known to have ariſen out of the antecedent ſtate of things. They could not be immediately corrected without violent ſtruggles and diſorders, and without injury to the property of deſcriptions of citizens, too great for the country at any former period to compenſate. Mild remedies are, however, daily applied to theſe partial diſeaſes; and it is manifeſt, that the courſe of time is diminiſhing, and will finally remove them. The right of legiſlative interpoſition, on the part of the chief magiſtrate, which, in the practice of another country, has been commuted for an unlawful and inju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ous influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is here wrought into the eſſence of the conſtitution, and is not only exerciſed in the independent and uncontrouled conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every reſolution and bill, but by the practical application of the negative.</p>
               <p>The execution of the office of the chief magiſtrate has been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended through a term of almoſt four years with a circumſtance, which to this nation and to the ſurrounding world requires no commentary—<hi>a native citizen of the united ſtates, elevated from private life to that ſtation, has not, during ſo long a term, appointed a ſingle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to any office of honour or emolument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſenatorial branch of the government has been created and continued in a mode preferable to that which is purſued in any other nation.</p>
               <p>The repreſentative branch is equally well conſtituted.</p>
               <p>The military code, for the government of ſuch troops as are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally raiſed and employed, is well calculated to produce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and efficiency, when time is allowed for the purpoſe, and conſequently to render the united ſtates reſpectable in the eyes of foreign nations.</p>
               <p>All chriſtian churches are ſo truly upon an equal footing, as well in practice as in theory, that there are and have been in the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, executive, and judicial branches of the general government, perſons of the following denominations—epiſcopalian, preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, independent or congregational, quaker, Lutheran, reformed, Roman, and probably others, which do not occur. There have been, and indeed yet are, a few eccleſiaſtical diſtinctions in the ſtate governments, which reaſon and time are rapidly deſtroying. It is eaſy to perceive, that religious liberty, ſupported by the national conſtitution, and a great majority of the ſtate conſtitutions, cannot but attain, in a very ſhort time, the ſame theoretical and practical perfection in the remainder, which it has acquired in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:024230_0035_0FC57E76E7E31710"/>
The independency of the judiciary, as well in the tenure of their ſtations as in the permanency of their compenſations under the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitution, and moſt of thoſe of the ſtates, is an advantage over the ancient republics and the generality of modern governments, of ineſtimable value in regard to liberty and property.</p>
               <p>The united ſtates, being without tranſmarine or ſeparated domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, are exempted from two inconveniencies, which have reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them. An immenſe naval force has been found neceſſary to defend ſuch territories, and protect the trade with them in time of war, and the difficulty of deviſing for them a free legiſlation, has hitherto proved inſurmountable. The Britiſh nation declared, that they had a right to legiſlate for their colonies and dominions in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, Aſia, and Africa, in all caſes whatſoever, and the revolution of the united ſtates, turned upon that cardinal point. When we obſerve, that the French nation, devoted as they are to the purſuit of liberty, have not yet been able to deviſe any ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their colonies without a <hi>dernier reſort</hi> to the legiſlature of France, it will be a ſource of comfortable reflexion to the friends of free and efficient government in theſe ſtates, that we are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed by the neceſſity of ſo delicate, important, and difficult an operation.</p>
               <p>It has been unfortunate for moſt nations, as well ancient as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, that they have had no ſettled pre-exiſting mode of altering, amending, or renovating their political ſyſtem, to which they could reſort without a deviation from the legal courſe of things, hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public tranquillity, and often freedom itſelf.—It is equally happy for the people of the united ſtates, that in their federal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and in moſt of thoſe of the ſtates, there exiſts a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by which thoſe neceſſary and deſirable ends may be obtained, with whatever zeal, without recurring to irregularity or violence. Fundamental principles being already ſettled by common conſent, and being duly recorded in the conſtituions, the people cannot long miſtake the nature of a meaſure, a law, or a political maxim, which is really oppoſed to them; and when their judgment is decided upon any one or more derelictions of thoſe principles, of magnitude ſufficient to induce an effort for reform, their will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſucceſsfully reſiſted. The conſequence of this ſtate of things will be, that the maſs of error will not eaſily accumulate ſo as to become inſupportable, being kept down by theſe orderly natural exertions of the community to relieve themſelves at an earlier ſtage of inconvenience. Too great a facility to change would, however, be likely to produce fluctuations, injurious to order, peace, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and induſtry, if not to liberty itſelf: but as the mode of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the amendatory or alterative operations is ſlow, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deliberate, light or dangerous changes would be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to accompliſh. In this view there appears to be very little probability, that changes from free or repreſentative government, will take place, or that any modification of hereditary power will be introduced into the governments either of the ſtates or of the union. The people will never deliberately conſent to the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe clauſes in the ſeveral conſtitutions, which explicitly provide both in general terms, and in particular detail, for free or republican government: nor does it ſeem eaſy, conſidering the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024230_0036_0FC57E7923E846A8"/>of perfection we have obtained and the conſtant and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate operations of the amendatory clauſes, to accumulate ſufficient public evil or grievance to produce one of thoſe convulſions, which the ambitous are wont to ſeize as the moment to introduce by force, a deſpotic government. Even local circumſtances conſpire to favour the permanency of liberty in theſe ſtates. Being too remote from any foreign nation, to render a war, requiring a great army, at all neceſſary, that inſtrument, ſo often uſed by ambitious leaders, is not likely to be placed within the reach of the enemies of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>while the union remains entire.</hi> It is worthy of the moſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular obſervation and remembrance, that a diſſolution of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would immediately open a door to this danger, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtates or little confederacies, would each deem it prudent to maintain a larger army than is now requiſite for the whole. The hiſtory of Greece will inſtruct us that by this, more than by any other poſſible meaſure, we ſhould be prepared for the military do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ſome modern PHILIP, or ſome new ALEXANDER. <hi>A ſtrong union</hi> and <hi>a tranquil liberty</hi> would be miſerably exchanged for ſuch a ſtate of things</p>
               <p>It is an evident truth that the penal laws of theſe ſtates, have been gradually mitigated ſince the epocha of their independence; and it is no leſs true, that the number of crimes does not bear ſo great a proportion to the population, as was formerly the caſe, though an univerſal relaxation of the police took place in the late war. It is, perhaps, an ill ſymptom of the ſtate of things, in a ſociety, when <hi>mild laws, ſtrictly executed,</hi> are incompetent to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of order and public happineſs. Our penal codes are, upon the whole, among the leaſt ſanguinary; and it is believed, they are not cruel, even in thoſe unhappy caſes, which impel the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to extremities. The conſtitution of the united ſtates has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted all the gall from the puniſhment of offences againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſafety, by correcting the power of legiſlating concerning them with a mildneſs unknown to the ſyſtems of moſt countries. It is honourable to the humanity and magnanimity of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can people, that this proceeding flowed from them, almoſt unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, four years after the revolution war. Future ages will do juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to a nation capable of ſuch an effort at a moment ſo particular.</p>
               <p>Taking the united ſtates at large, there are few or no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in which, at this time, the juſt demands of private creditors can be obtained by a more certain, a more expeditions, or a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> expenſive courſe of legal proceſs. There are ſome local, and a very few general defects yet exiſting; but they are vaniſhing before the ſpirit of the general and moſt of the ſtate conſtitutions. There is no part of the public conduct of this country more ſtriking than the firmneſs with which they have applied the cauſtic to ſome inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate cancers, which had been derived to their pecuniary ſyſtem, principally from adventitious cauſes. It proves the exiſtence of that virtue and fortitude, which qualify a nation for republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. There are ſome exceptionable circumſtances, yet to be done away; but the ſucceſsful efforts, which have been made, juſtify a confident expectation, that they will yield ere long to the powers and influences which have eradicated much greater evils of the ſame kind.</p>
