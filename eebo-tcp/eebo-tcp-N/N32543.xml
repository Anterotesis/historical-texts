            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is only the <hi>elegant ſpeaker,</hi> who can at <hi>once</hi> regale the <hi>eye</hi> with the view of its moſt amiable object, the human form in all its glory; the <hi>ear,</hi> with the original of all muſic; the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> with its proper and natural <hi>food,</hi> the knowledge of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truth; and the <hi>imagination,</hi> with all that is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in nature and art—For the orator's <hi>field</hi> is the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,</hi> and his ſubjects are all that is known of <hi>God</hi> and his works; of ſuperior natures, good and evil, and their works; and of inferior natures, and their's.—In a conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſpeaker, whatever there is of corporal dignity or beauty, the majeſty of the human <hi>face divine,</hi> the grace of <hi>action,</hi> the piercing <hi>glance,</hi> or gentle languiſh, or fiery <hi>flaſh</hi> of the eye; whatever of lively paſſion, or ſtriking <hi>emotion</hi> of mind; whatever of fine imagination, of wiſe reflection, of irreſiſtible <hi>reaſoning</hi>; whatever excellent of human nature; all that the hand of the <hi>Creator</hi> has impreſſed of his own <hi>image,</hi> upon the nobleſt creatures we are acquainted with; all this appears in the <hi>conſummate ſpeaker</hi> to the higheſt <hi>advantage.</hi> And whoever is proof againſt ſuch a diſplay of all that is noble in human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, muſt have neither <hi>eye,</hi> nor <hi>ear,</hi> nor <hi>paſſion,</hi> nor <hi>imagination,</hi> nor <hi>taſte,</hi> nor <hi>underſtanding.</hi>

THOUGH it may be alledged, that a great deal of <hi>geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> or <hi>action</hi> at the bar, or in the pulpit, eſpecially in the latter, is not wanted, nor is quite in character; yet moſt certain it is, that there is no part of a man that has not its proper <hi>attitude.</hi> The <hi>eyes</hi> are not to be rolled along the cieling, as if the ſpeaker were taking care how the flies behave themſelves. Nor are they to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>antly caſt down upon the ground, as if he were before his judge, receiving ſentence of <hi>death.</hi> Nor are they to be fixed upon <hi>one point,</hi> as if he ſaw a <hi>ghoſt.</hi>—The <hi>arms</hi> of a preacher are not to be needleſsly thrown out, as if he were drowning in the pulpit; or brandiſhed after the manner of the ancient boxers, when they fought with their own ſhadows, to prepare themſelves for the olimpic conteſts. Nor on the contrary are his <hi>hands</hi> to be <hi>pocketed up,</hi> nor his <hi>arms</hi> to hang by his ſides, as if they were both <hi>withered.</hi> The <hi>head</hi> is not to ſtand fixed, as if the preacher had a crick in his neck; nor is it to nod at every third word, as if he were acting Jupiter.</p>
            <p>A JUDICIOUS ſpeaker is maſter of ſuch a <hi>variety</hi> of decent and natural <hi>motions,</hi> and has ſuch a command of attitude, that he will not be long enough in any <hi>one poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to offend the eye of the ſpectator. The matter he has to pronounce, will eaſily ſuggeſt to him the propriety of changing his <hi>look,</hi> his <hi>poſture,</hi> his <hi>motion</hi> and tone of voice, which if they were to continue too long, would become diſagreeable to the beholders. But yet, he is not to be every moment changing poſture like a harle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin, nor throwing his hands about, as if he were ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing legerdemain tricks. And above all things, the public ſpeaker is never to forget the great rule, ARS EST CELARE ARTEM. It would be infinitely more pleaſing, to ſee him deliver himſelf with as little motion as an Egyptian <hi>mummy,</hi> than diſtorting himſelf into all the violations of 
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:042813_0004_101C95C8CE506208"/>
               <hi>decorum,</hi> which affectation produces; for art, ſeen through, is <hi>execrable.</hi> Modeſty ought ever to be conſpicuous in the behaviour of all, who exhibit themſelves before the <hi>public.</hi> Whatever of geſture or exertion of voice ſuch perſons uſe, they ought apparently to be <hi>drawn</hi> into them, by the <hi>importance,</hi> ſpirit or humour of the matter. For if the ſpeaker uſes any arts of delivery which appear plainly to be ſtudied, and unnatural, the effect will be, that his aukward and vain attempt to work upon the paſſions of his hearers by means, of which he is not <hi>maſter,</hi> will render him odious and contemptible to them.—With what <hi>ſtiff</hi> and <hi>pedantic ſolemnity</hi> do ſome public ſpeakers utter thoughts ſo trifling, as to be hardly worth uttering at all? And what unnatural and unſuitable tones of voice and geſtures do others apply, in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what, by their manner of delivering, one would be apt to queſtion, not only whether it is their own compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but whether they underſtand it?—Nor is it to be expected, that <hi>decorum</hi> of <hi>manner</hi> in preaching can ever be carried to any great perfection, while <hi>reading</hi> is thought to be <hi>preaching</hi>

orators had <hi>read</hi> their ſermons, the effect would have been pretty much the ſame, as that which the <hi>reading</hi> of ſermons produces among us. The hearers might have, many of them, <hi>dropped aſleep.</hi> In ſome foreign countries, preachers are ſo much aware of the great diſadvantage of <hi>reading,</hi> that ſuch as have weak memories have a prompter behind in the pulpit, out of ſight.—However, it muſt be owned, that if preachers would take ſuitable pains in committing to <hi>memory</hi> the ſubſtance of their diſcourſes, ſo as not to be <hi>ſlaves</hi> to written <hi>notes,</hi> and endeavour to gain a tolerable readineſs at extemporary <hi>amplification,</hi> their diſcourſes might have effect, though the <hi>eye</hi> ſhould now and then be caſt upon the notes, if not in a clumſy manner, and with <hi>heſitation.</hi>—To hear a judicious and <hi>elegant</hi> diſcourſe from the pulpit, which in <hi>print</hi> would make a noble figure, murdered by him who had learning and taſte enough to <hi>compoſe</hi> it, but having neglected the important part of his education, knows not how to deliver it otherwiſe than with a dull tone, between <hi>ſinging</hi> and <hi>ſaying,</hi> or with a <hi>nod of his head,</hi> to enforce, as with a hammer, every <hi>emphatical</hi> word, or with the ſame unanimated <hi>monotony</hi>

Yet, what is more common? Were the educators of youth intended for the miniſtry, of the opinion of the prince of orators, viz. that <hi>delivery</hi> is the <hi>firſt, ſecond</hi> and <hi>third</hi> part of <hi>oratory,</hi> they would <hi>ſpare</hi> ſome time from the <hi>many leſs neceſſary</hi> parts of ſchool learning, to apply it to <hi>one</hi> ſo very eſſential; without which, the weight of the moſt <hi>ſacred ſubject,</hi> the greateſt depth of critical diſquiſition, the moſt unexceptionable reaſoning, the moſt accurate <hi>arrangement</hi> of <hi>matter,</hi> and the moſt ſtriking <hi>energy</hi> of <hi>ſtyle,</hi> are all loſt upon an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

who ſit <hi>unaffected,</hi> and depart <hi>unimproved.</hi> From hence it is, that while places of divine and public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip are almoſt <hi>empty,</hi> theatres are <hi>crowded.</hi> Yet in the former the moſt <hi>intereſting ſubjects</hi> are treated of, and in the latter <hi>all is fiction.</hi> But it will not be otherwiſe, ſo long as the ſpeakers, in places of divine worſhip, take no more pains to enforce their public inſtructions, and the moſt <hi>important truths,</hi> than if they delivered <hi>fictions</hi>; while the ſpeakers in theatres beſtow <hi>ſo much pains,</hi> to make their <hi>fictions ſeem to be true.</hi>—It may be ſaid that this obſervation has been made before. The more is the <hi>pity.</hi> And it ought to be often made again and again, until the fault be mended.—Did preachers labour to acquire a <hi>maſterly delivery,</hi> places of <hi>public inſtruction</hi> would be as crowded as places of public diverſion. <hi>Rakes</hi> and <hi>infidels,</hi> merely to ſhew their <hi>taſte,</hi> would frequent them. Could <hi>all</hi> frequent them, and <hi>none</hi> profit? It is common to hear complaints from our clergy, of the <hi>inattention</hi> of their hearers, even to dozing, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times profound ſleep. But where does this complaint fall at laſt? Even upon the preachers themſelves, who addreſs their hearers with ſo much coolneſs and infiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as leaves them nothing to do but <hi>to go to ſleep.</hi> Let the preacher be but ſuitably animated, and exert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he may deſy his hearers to ſleep, or withdraw their attention for a moment.</p>
            <p>THE clergy are likewiſe full of their complaints, of the little effect their labours produce.—Infidelity and vice, they ſay, prevail more than ever. But what is the plain Engliſh of this complaint? Why are churches ſo poorly filled? Why is it that thoſe who attend, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps do it only for faſhion's ſake, and are not much better than their neighbours? Why, truly, the clergy
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:042813_0007_101C95D09D92B1A8"/>
find people loath to go to places of public inſtruction, to be diſguſted, or lulled to ſleep. And when they have them there, they cannot perſuade them to quit their vices and follies, by lolling thirty or forty, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps but twenty minutes, upon a <hi>velvet cuſhion</hi>; and only <hi>reading</hi> to them a learned diſcourſe.—They cannot <hi>warm</hi> them to the love of virtue, by a <hi>cold, ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>read pulpit harangue.</hi> They cannot win their <hi>affections,</hi> while they neglect all the natural means for working upon the <hi>human paſſions.</hi> They cannot kindle in them that burning zeal, which is neceſſary for the moſt important of all intereſts, by talking or rather reading only, with the coolneſs of a ſett of <hi>ſtoic philoſophers,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the terrors of the Lord,</hi> of <hi>the worm that dies not,</hi> of future glory, honour and immortality, of everlaſting kingdoms, and heavenly thrones.—It is common for preachers to plead their modeſty, and fear of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of affectation, in excuſe of the <hi>dulneſs</hi> and the <hi>coldneſs</hi> of their manner of addreſſing their hearers. But are thoſe any hinderance to the elocution of the <hi>actors,</hi> or even the actreſſes, who by ſtudy and practice get the better of fear, and attain an <hi>elegant</hi> and correct utterance, and are indeed almoſt the only ſpeakers we have without appearance of <hi>affectation</hi>? But do our preachers in general beſtow any thought, or uſe any means of any kind, for improving themſelves in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? The younger part of the players rehearſe and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe over and over many times, and are long under the tuition of the principal actors, before they appear in public. But there are perhaps no other public ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers among us, who take ſuch pains; though they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow great pains in improving themſelves in learning; and yet of the two <hi>learning</hi> is leſs neceſſary to a preacher, than ſkill in <hi>perſuading.</hi> Let the reader only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,

that a mechanic is under a maſter <hi>ſeven years</hi> at leaſt, before he ſets up for himſelf. But the preacher goes into the pulpit <hi>at once,</hi> without ever having had <hi>one leſſon</hi> of inſtruction in that part of his art which is the chief and moſt neceſſary, and without which all his other accompliſhments are worth nothing, toward gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great end of preaching.—It may be alledged, and it often has been alledged, by the clergy, that they cannot be expected to be great orators for fifty or an hundred pounds a year. The anſwer is ready, are there not many players who do not get more than the lower clergy? and yet they ſtudy <hi>hard,</hi> and take great pains, for no greater gain or encouragement, and do actually acquire ſuch ſkill in ſpeaking and performing, that for my part, if I deſired to have a compoſition of mine <hi>well ſpoken,</hi> I would put it into the hands even of a ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtage-player, rather than of almoſt any preacher I ever heard.—What could be imagined more <hi>elegant,</hi> if entertainment alone were ſought? What more <hi>uſeful,</hi> if the <hi>everlaſting good of mankind</hi> were the object, than the ſacred office of <hi>preaching properly performed?</hi> Were the moſt <hi>intereſting</hi> of ſubjects treated with proper <hi>perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity,</hi> and adequate <hi>judgment,</hi> and <hi>well-compoſed diſcourſes</hi> delivered to the liſtening crowds, with that <hi>dignity</hi> which becomes a teacher of <hi>divine truth,</hi> and with that <hi>energy</hi> and <hi>pathos,</hi> which would ſhew that the preacher ſpoke from his <hi>own heart,</hi> and really meant to ſpeak to the <hi>hearts</hi> of his hearers, ſhould we not ſoon ſee the good effects of ſuch preaching? For mankind are not wood or ſtone. They may be <hi>drawn.</hi> They may be <hi>allured.</hi> They may be <hi>rouſed</hi> and <hi>ſtartled.</hi> The voice of an able and well-accompliſhed preacher, thundering out the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine threatnings</hi> againſt <hi>vice,</hi> would be in the ear of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender as if he heard the ſound of the <hi>laſt trumpet,</hi> ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:042813_0009_101C95DB90EAF690"/>
the dead to judgement. And <hi>the gentle call of mercy,</hi> encouraging the terrified and almoſt deſpairing <hi>penitent</hi> to look up to his offended heavenly <hi>father,</hi> would be as <hi>the ſong of angels.</hi>—A whole multitude might as it were be lifted to the <hi>ſkies,</hi> and the world of <hi>ſpirits</hi> be opened to the eyes of their minds.—The <hi>terrors</hi> of that puniſhment which awaits <hi>vice</hi>; the <hi>glories</hi> of that ſtate to which virtue and true piety, through <hi>divine grace,</hi> will raiſe the pious, might be, by a powerful preacher, rendered preſent to their underſtandings, with ſuch conviction, as would make indelible impreſſions upon the hearts of the hearers, and work a ſubſtantial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in their lives. The convincing and irrefragable <hi>proof,</hi> that real and important effects might he produced by preachers, by a proper uſe of <hi>oratory,</hi> to the good purpoſes of inſtructing and amending mankind, is, that <hi>oratory,</hi> in all times, has been known actually to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great alterations in mens ways of thinking and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And there is no denying plain facts. No one can imagine that <hi>oratory</hi> could have been ſo laboriouſly cultivated by <hi>ſtateſmen,</hi> in all free and flouriſhing govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had they not found it uſeful to the ſtate. But if any one ſhould alledge that there is nothing in the power of <hi>preachers</hi> by means of <hi>oratory,</hi> I would aſk, does it not then follow, that the whole office of preaching may as well be laid aſide? For if <hi>good ſpeaking</hi> will have no effect, ſurely <hi>bad</hi> will have none. A <hi>Perecles,</hi> or a <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> could <hi>ſhake</hi> all Greece, when they warned their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen againſt an <hi>invaſion,</hi> or alarmed them about the danger of their liberties, whilſt our preachers can hardly keep their hearers <hi>awake,</hi> when they ſtand forth in the <hi>name of God,</hi> to warn them againſt the conſequences of <hi>vice,</hi> ſo ruinous to individuals, ſo ruinous to nations; the cauſe not only of the ſubverſion of ſtates and kingdoms, when luxury and corruption ſpread their fatal contagion, 
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:042813_0010_101C95DD18229E90"/>
and leave a people the unthinking prey of <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> but of utter and irretrievable deſtruction, from the preſence of the Lord, and the glory of his power, when the trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed, and he ſhall ſit upon the throne of judgment, from whoſe face heaven and earth ſhall flee away.</p>
            <p>IT may perhaps be objected, that <hi>ſacred truth</hi> needs no <hi>ornament</hi> to ſet it off, nor <hi>art</hi> to enforce it: That the <hi>apoſtles were artleſs and illiterate men,</hi> and yet they gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great end of their miſſion, the conviction of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, and the eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity: And that therefore there is no neceſſity of ſuch attention to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, in order to qualify the preacher for his ſacred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or to render his labours ſucceſsful.—To all this an anſwer it ready.—The apoſtles were not <hi>all</hi> artleſs and illiterate men. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the greateſt and moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral propagator of Chriſtianity, is an eminent exception. He could be no mean orator who confounded the Jews at Damaſcus; made a <hi>Prince,</hi> before whom he ſtood to be judged, confeſs that he had almoſt perſuaded him to become a convert to a religion every where ſpoken againſt; threw another into a fit of trembling, as he ſat upon his judgment ſeat; made ſuch a defence before the learned court of <hi>Areopagus,</hi> as gained him for a convert, who was a member of the court itſelf; ſtruck a whole people with ſuch admiration, that they took him for <hi>the God of eloquence</hi>; and gained him a place in <hi>Longinus</hi>'s liſt of <hi>famous orators.</hi> Would <hi>the cold mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> of our Engliſh <hi>ſermon-readers</hi> have produced ſuch effects as theſe? Surely it would not.</p>
            <p>BUT farther it may be added, the apoſtles might very well ſpare human accompliſhments, having what was worth 
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:042813_0011_101C95DEC8D53718"/>
them all, the divine gift of working <hi>miracles,</hi> which if our preachers had, we ſhould not have much to ſay about their qualifying themſelves in <hi>elocution.</hi> But, as it is, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic inſtruction is the preacher's <hi>weapon,</hi> with which he is to combat <hi>infidelity</hi> and <hi>vice.</hi> But what avails a weapon without <hi>ſkill</hi> to weild it? Therefore the preacher ought, above all other public ſpeakers, to labour to enrich and adorn, in the <hi>moſt</hi> maſterly manner, his addreſſes to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, his views, if as they ought to be, being the moſt important.</p>
            <p>WHAT grand point has the <hi>player</hi> to gain? Why, to draw an audience to the <hi>theatre.</hi> The pleader at the bar, if he lays before the judges and jury the true ſtate of the caſe, ſo as they may be moſt likely to ſee where the right of it lies, has done his duty. The ſpeaker in either houſe of Parliament has only to conſider that the good of his country may in a great meaſure depend upon his tongue. But the infinitely important ſubject of preaching is <hi>the reformation of mankind,</hi> upon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends their happineſs in this world, and throughout the whole of their being. Of how great importance is it then, that the art of preaching be carried to ſuch perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all may be drawn to places of public inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that thoſe who attend them may receive bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit! And if almoſt the whole of preaching, to any good effect, depends upon delivery, how neceſſary is the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of delivery! That a good and lively delivery is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably the moſt important part of public inſtruction, is plainly manifeſt from this, <hi>that very indifferent matter, well delivered,</hi> will make a conſiderable <hi>impreſſion.</hi> But <hi>bad utterance</hi> will defeat the whole <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>the nobleſt</hi> compoſition that ever was produced. While exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant appetite and unruly paſſion <hi>within,</hi> while evil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:042813_0012_101C95E877E3C8F8"/>
with alluring ſollicitation, without, invite and enſnare the frail and thoughtleſs into guilt; ſhall <hi>virtue and religion,</hi> preached from the pulpit, hold forth <hi>no charms</hi> to engage votaries? <hi>Pleaſure</hi> decks herſelf out with <hi>rich attire,</hi> and muſt <hi>Religion</hi> preſent herſelf with every diſadvantage, and muſt ſhe appear quite unadorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? What chance can ſhe then have, in competition with an enemy ſo much <hi>better furniſhed</hi> with every neceſſary <hi>invitation</hi> and <hi>allurement?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET it be conſidered that our preachers do not addreſs <hi>innocents in Paradiſe,</hi> but thoughtleſs and <hi>habituated ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Mere <hi>cold reading</hi> will have but little effect upon ſuch. For weak is the hold which <hi>reaſon</hi> has on moſt men. <hi>Few</hi> of mankind have <hi>able heads. All</hi> have <hi>hearts</hi>; and all <hi>hearts</hi> may be <hi>touched,</hi> if the ſpeaker is but <hi>maſter</hi> of his art. The buſineſs of the preacher is not ſo much to <hi>inform</hi> the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> as to <hi>warm</hi> the <hi>heart.</hi> For there are few who do not <hi>know</hi> their duty; to allure them to the <hi>doing it,</hi> is the difficulty. Nor is this to be effected by <hi>cold reaſoning.</hi> Accordingly the <hi>ſcripture ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> are none of them <hi>cold.</hi> They ſpake <hi>in demonſtration of the ſpirit, and with power,</hi> as having <hi>authority,</hi> and not as the cold Scribes. Their addreſſes are ſuch as hardly any man can utter without <hi>warmth.</hi> It is true, the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is carefully to avoid <hi>oſtentation</hi>; he is not to preach <hi>himſelf,</hi> but Chriſt. But, at the ſame time, he is to ſtir up every gift that is in him; to <hi>cry aloud,</hi> and not to ſpare; to lift up his voice like a trumpet; to reprove, correct and inſtruct; to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon; to become, innocently, all things to all men, and conſequently <hi>to become and orator,</hi> if his hearers are not to be affected by ſimple and unadorned truth, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>weighty.</hi> What can people think about <hi>the ſincerity,</hi> 
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:042813_0013_101C95EA02E91E00"/>
or rather about <hi>the inſincerity</hi> of the preacher, who is <hi>cold,</hi> languid, and wholly unanimated in his public inſtructions; but is as warm as other men, in the defence of an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of his <hi>eſtate</hi>? Would he ſpeak as calmly, as unconcernedly for his <hi>life,</hi> as he does in the cauſe of <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>religion?</hi>—If it ſhould be ſaid by preachers, "the people will be as much offended with us, if we <hi>over-act</hi> our part, as they are now indifferent about at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending our miniſtry; ſo that it will avail nothing to ſtudy and practiſe <hi>a more lively delivery:</hi>" To this it may be anſwered, that a manner of preaching may be uſed, which ſhall have ten times more <hi>life</hi> and <hi>vivacity</hi> in it than the <hi>preſent,</hi> and yet, if it be not incorrect, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, be very ſafe from all danger of exceeding due bounds, as to <hi>vivacity</hi> and <hi>force.</hi> And in fact we do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that no preacher is <hi>admired,</hi> I do not mean by the mob, but by people of education, whoſe <hi>delivery is dull and unanimated.</hi>—The great Doctor <hi>Delany,</hi> among other hints proper for a young preacher, ſaid, that "when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went up into a pulpit, he deſired to look upon it as the laſt time he ſhould ever preach, or the laſt time that the people ſhould ever hear him." If all preachers, however dignified, went always up into their reſpective pulpits thus impreſſed; they would then preach, as <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi> once ſaid he painted, <hi>for eternity.</hi> They would then act the part of <hi>true goſpel Chriſtian orators,</hi> and not only calmly and coolly inform the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> but by <hi>perſuaſive and pathetic addreſs</hi> endeavour to <hi>move the affections, and warm the heart.</hi> To act otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks a ſad ignorance of human nature, and ſuch an inexcuſable indolence and indifference in the preacher, as muſt conſtrain his hearers to ſuſpect that the preacher, let him be who he will, <hi>only deals in the falſe commerce of

unfelt truth.</hi> The late pious and learned Doctor <hi>Iſaac Watts,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>words without ſpirit,</hi> and of preaching by written notes, ſaid, <q>that paper, with the moſt <hi>pathetic</hi> lines written upon it, has no <hi>fear</hi> nor <hi>hope,</hi> no <hi>zeal</hi> or <hi>compaſſion</hi>; it is conſcious of no <hi>deſign,</hi> nor has any <hi>ſollicitude</hi> for the <hi>ſucceſs</hi>: And a mere <hi>reader,</hi> who <hi>coldly tells</hi> the people what his <hi>paper ſays,</hi> ſeems to be as void of all theſe neceſſary qualifications, as his paper is.</q>
