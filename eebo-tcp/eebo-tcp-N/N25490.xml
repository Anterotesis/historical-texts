            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AT the commencement of an Eſſay upon a ſubject in which the Lymphatic Veſſels are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concerned, it may not be improper to give a general view of that ſyſtem; this I ſhall do in as conciſe a manner as poſſible.</p>

                  <hi>CHAPTER I.</hi> Of the Absorbent System.</head>
               <p>THAT proceſs in the Animal Body which is called Abſorption, is performed by a ſet of veſſels peculiarly appropriated to the purpoſe, and not as the ancients ſuppoſed by the veins: the veſſels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this function, are at preſent known by two names; thoſe ſituated in the abdomen, and paſſing immediately from the inteſtines, have, from their
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033831_0004_0FF978F2D3C946F0"/>carrying the fluid called chyle, which ſomewhat reſembles milk, been called lacteals. Thoſe abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents which originate from the external ſurface, and other parts of the body, have been denominated Lymphatics; although theſe veſſels have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by different names, they are the ſame in their ſtructure and functions.</p>
               <p>The lymphatics equal the arteries in their minute and univerſal diſtribution; there is no part of the animal body, be it ever ſo ſmall or ever ſo remotely ſituated, without the power of abſorption. We may apply a fluid to any part of the external ſurface, and it will be abſorbed; the innumerable examples afforded us by the abſorption of the water of dropſy, of matter from internal ulcers and cavities, and alſo of the moſt ſolid parts, in every ſituation, proves not only the univerſal diſtribution, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the great power of this function in the animal oeconomy. There is, we may ſafely ſay, no power in the animal machine more neceſſary to its exiſtence than abſorption: it is commonly ſaid that we cannot exiſt without the circulation, or the nervous influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence exerted on the body; we may with the ſame propriety ſay that an animal cannot exiſt without the power of abſorption; for if the performance of this function was wanting, circulation would ſoon ceaſe, and without the action of the heart and arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the powers of the brain would immediately be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>The lymphatic veſſels are in general ſo ſmall, that their mouths opening on the different ſurfaces cannot
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033831_0005_0FF97902B83C3D80"/>be ſeen by the naked eye; this minute ſize has prevented their ſtructure from being ſo much unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled as that of the arteries and veins; it is however certain that they reſemble them in ſome reſpects.</p>
               <p>Several experiments and obſervations have been made in proof of the muſcularity of the abſorbent veſſels. Nuck and Cruikſhank have both ſeen and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated fibres in the thoracic duct of horſes; the latter of theſe gentlemen obſerves, that he has ſeen fibres in a human thoracic duct. Theſe obſervations prove that the great lymphatic duct, and perhaps ſome of the larger branches of theſe veſſels have fibres, but every ſubſtance that is fibrous cannot with propriety be ſaid to be muſcular. The beſt teſt we have of muſcularity, ſays Mr. Cruikſhank, "is the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in a part to contract on the application of ſtimuli;" this our author found to be the caſe with the abſorbents, and it generally has been concluded, from theſe and other obſervations, that lymphatics are muſcular.</p>
               <p>That lymphatics have conſiderable ſtrength, even in the dead body, appears from their ſupporting no ſmall weight when injected with mercury; I have ſeen a large number of veſſels ſituated on the leg and thigh ſuſpended by a few branches when all were injected with that fluid.</p>
               <p>With regard to the ſenſibility and vaſcularity of lymphatics little doubt remains; analogical reaſoning would lead us to conclude that they poſſeſs both nerves and blood veſſels, and in addition to this,
<pb n="6"
                      facs="unknown:033831_0006_0FF97909D0ECB7C8"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>experiment and accidental occurrences prove the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>The ſenſibility of lymphatics is ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by their taking on a preternatural action upon the application of a ſtrong ſtimulus. Abſorbents have not unfrequently been ſeen in a ſtate of inflammation, after ſome active poiſon has been circulating in them; from our preſent knowledge and theory of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, we conclude that it cannot take place where there are no veſſels, this then I truſt may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a ſufficient teſt of the vaſcularity of lymphatics.</p>
               <p>Abſorbent veſſels, like veins, are furniſhed with valves, which in ſome parts are ſo numerous, that half a dozen may be met with in a portion of the veſſel not more than an inch in length; theſe valves are ſo formed and ſituated that they admirably prevent a retrograde direction of the fluid paſſing in their reſpective veſſels; their figure is ſemilunar, they are placed in pairs, one oppoſite the other, with their convex edges attached to the veſſel, and they play like moveable partitions; when the fluid paſſes in a natural direction they lay cloſe againſt the ſides of the veſſel; on the contrary, when the fluid is forced in a retrograde courſe, their looſe edges leave the ſides of the veſſel, meet each other in the middle, and thus prevent any further progreſs of it. Valves, ſuch as have been deſcribed, are uniformly ſituated at the entrance of the abſorbent veſſels into the thoracic duct, and where this great reſervoir of the lymphatic fluid joins the left ſubclavian vein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7"

The manner in which the abſorbents take up fluids from the ſurfaces of the body remains as yet undetermined by Phyſiologiſts; on this difficult queſtion I ſhall not preſume to decide, but leave it for abler minds than mine to determine. After the fluid has entered the veſſel a ſhort diſtance, its motion depends upon cauſes ſimilar to thoſe of the motion of the blood in the veins, viz. partly upon the preſſure received from the contracted muſcles and pulſating arteries, and partly upon the action of the lymyhatic veſſels themſelves. Here the great uſe of the valves in theſe veſſels is made evident; when the veſſel is preſſed by the ſwelling of the adjacent muſcles in a ſtate of contraction, if it were not for theſe valves, the fluid would as readily take on a retrograde, as a forward direction, but with this proviſion it muſt purſue a natural courſe.</p>
               <p>Abſorbents, like veins, run from the circumference towards the centre; they originate from every part of the body, paſs in every direction, frequently anaſtomoſing and forming net-works, and laſtly, are collected in one great trunk called the thoracic duct; this enters into the left ſubclavian vein; ſometimes theſe are two ducts, one entering into the left, the other into the right ſubclavian.</p>
               <p>The lymphatic glands are numerous, and variouſly diſtributed: we find them moſt abundant, in the groins, axillae, the meſentary, and about the root of the lungs. After a long inveſtigation of the ſtructure and nature of theſe glands, by many different anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, little more of their uſe is known now than at
<pb n="8"
                      facs="unknown:033831_0008_0FF9793E707ED350"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>their firſt diſcovery; although we know ſo little of their functions, there can be no doubt but that they are a neceſſary appendage to the lymphatic ſyſtem, and the diſcovery of their uſe in the animal oeconomy may one day or other throw great light on ſome diſcoveries, with which we are at preſent but little acquainted.</p>
               <p>After having thus briefly conſidered the ſtructure, diſtribution, and courſe of the lymphatic veſſels, I am led to make a few obſervations on their uſe in ſupporting animal life.</p>
               <p>The food of animals, after it is received into the ſtomach and inteſtines, is ſubjected to the proceſs of digeſtion, and the nutritive parts thereof are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into chyle. It is the office of the abſorbents of the inteſtines or lacteals to convey the chyle thus formed into the general circulation. But this is not the only office of the lymphatics; in caſe no aliment is taken into the ſtomach, or when food taken in is not digeſted, in ſhort, where no chyle is formed in the alimentary canal, be it from whatever cauſe, they can ſupport life for ſome time by abſorbing from the atmoſphere, from the adipoſe membrane, or from any part where they meet a fluid proper for entering the general circulation. Hybernating animals afford a ſtriking example of the laſt mentioned power of the abſorbents. The bear when he enters his cave in the autumn, is loaded with adeps, he ceaſes to eat, no more chyle is formed in his alimentary canal, the lymphatics now begin to devour the fat which had been ſtored up during the ſummer; in this manner
<pb n="9"
                      facs="unknown:033831_0009_0FF9795321894038"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>he lives as it were upon his own fleſh during the whole winter.</p>
               <p>The lymphatic veſſels are not equally diſtributed through every part of the body, ſome parts are endowed with a number far greater than others. The ſmall inteſtines from their being the natural organs of nouriſhment, have perhaps a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of abſorbents ſcattered on their ſurface, than any other equal part of the body. The large inteſtines are not without the power of abſorption, as will appear not only from the caſe preſently to be related, but alſo from the reports of anatomiſts. For example: In Fleming's Phyſiology, p. 249, we find the following diſſection quoted from Dr. Swenke: "A ſoldier was killed by a muſket ſhot ſoon after eating a plentiful meal, the bullet deſtroyed the clavicle with the veſſels under it, whereby the thoracic duct, near its inſertion into the left ſubclavian was compreſſed, and the paſſage of chyle through it ſtopped. Upon opening the dead body, innumerable lacteals appeared through the whole extent of the colon, to its termination in the pelvis;" from this he very properly inferred the utility of nutritive enemata.</p>
               <p>The deſcriptions of the lymphatics of the large inteſtines which are to be found in the works of thoſe accurate inveſtigators, Maſcagni and Cruikſhank, confirm this account of Dr. Swenke.</p>

               <p>FROM the anatomical ſtructure of the large inteſtines, we might conclude that they poſſeſſed great powers of abſorption, but the following facts are directly in proof of it, and ſhow the great advantages to be derived from nutritive injections into theſe inteſtines, in caſes of ſtarvation from whatever cauſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt caſe to be related is one that came under my immediate inſpection.</p>
               <p>John Fiſher, aged 21 years, was admitted a patient in the Alms-Houſe, with a protracted inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory fever, for which he took powders of nitre and calomel; in a few days his mouth was affected by the mercury, and in conſequence of a ſudden application of cold, his parotid glands, neck, and face, became ſo much ſwelled, that he was unable to take in any ſolid food; in this ſituation he lived two days upon tea and molaſſes and water, but by the end of two days his mouth and throat were ſo completely

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>cloſed that he was unable to ſwallow any fluid. The poor man had in this time become ſo much debilitated, from the want of nouriſhment and the long continuance of his diſeaſe, that he could not ſit up in bed. At this critical moment, when every perſon about him expected he would breath his laſt in a few hours, nutritive clyſters were directed to be given, and about half a pint of ſtrong beef tea with a few drops of laudanum was injected every four or five hours. In twenty four hours after the firſt enema a great alteration was evident, his pulſe roſe, and he appeared to have gained ſtrength, being able now to raiſe himſelf up in bed. By a repetition of the injections, three or four times in the day and nearly as often during the night, he was ſupported during nine days without receiving into his ſtomach a ſingle ounce of ſolid or fluid nouriſhment, a ſmall quantity of tea on the ninth day excepted; on the tenth day he ſwallowed a quantity ſufficient to ſupport himſelf by means of the ſtomach. Both the mind and body of this poor patient were improved during theſe nine days, and by proper treatment after the omiſſion of the enemata he perfectly recovered his health.</p>
               <p>In the third volume of the London Medical Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, page 245, John Silveſter relates a caſe of which the following is a ſhort extract. A girl under the effects of mercury got out of bed when very warm, and took a hearty drink of red wine, this immediately ſtopped the ſalivation, and produced an uneaſineſs in the ſtomach; in a week after a vomiting came on, which in a few days became inceſſant, ſo that ſhe threw up whatever was taken the moment
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033831_0012_0FF979902678A200"/>it reached the ſtomach. In this ſituation ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued two months, before application was made to the hoſpital; at this late period of her diſeaſe admittance as a patient was granted her. She was once bled, vomits, cordials, ſtomachics, &amp;c. were all adminiſtered without the leaſt alteration of diſeaſe. She was now, from debility, ſcarcely able to walk or ſtand: at this critical moment it was thought adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by her phyſicians to direct nutritive enemata, and to prohibit her from taking any thing whatever into her ſtomach; an injection of a pint of ſtrong mutton broth with the yolk of an egg diſſolved in it, was given twice a-day. The effects of theſe clyſters, and abſtinence from eating, were, that ſhe immediately ceaſed to vomit, and in a few days, her ſpirits grew better, her ſtrength increaſed, and her fleſh grew firmer. After the injections had been continued for a fortnight, during which time ſhe neither eat nor vomited, permiſſion was granted her to take a ſpoonful of broth, this ſoon convinced the unfortunate patient that ſhe remained in the ſame unhappy ſituation; the enemata were therefore continued, (I am ſorry our author does not mention for how long a time) and ſome medicines were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe adminiſtered by way of clyſter, but all without the leaſt mitigation of the complaint, for it was at laſt removed by reproducing a ſalivation. During the whole of her diſeaſe, not excepting the time when the injections were given, ſhe had no diſcharge downwards from the alimentary canal.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond volume of the Edinburgh Medical Eſſays, page 382, we find a very remarkable caſe

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>recorded by James Eccles, of which I take the liberty to draw up the following abridgment. A young woman about ſixteen had her menſtrual diſcharge obſtructed; this was attended with epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptic fits, occurring every month at the time when the menſes ought to have made their appearance. With a view to remove theſe affections, ſhe was bled and vomited; ſoon after the operation of the ſecond vomit ſhe was ſeized with a difficulty of ſwallowing, which in two or three days increaſed ſo much in violence, that ſhe was unable to ſwallow, but on every attempt, fell into a fit, attended with prodigious tremblings and alternate diſtentions of the thorax and abdomen, which ſometimes continued half an hour, and always ended in a rigidity of the whole body. She continued without eating or drinking from the middle of May to the fifteenth of June, a period of thirty-four days, when ſhe again at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſwallow, but with the ſame bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. Antiſpaſmodic and nervous medicines were now applied externally to the neck but without effect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> probang was next reſorted to, and was with difficulty forced into the ſtomach; but the operation gave temporary relief, for ſhe was able without much difficulty to ſwallow for three weeks. By the middle of July the ſpaſm had returned with ſo much violence that the poor girl was again unable to ſwallow, and ſhe continued fifty-four days longer without eating or drinking. During the firſt courſe of faſting, and the firſt thirty days of the ſecond courſe, ſhe was nouriſhed by Enemata of broth, ſherry wine, and the yolk of eggs. Our author obſerves that this unfortunate patient declared ſhe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033831_0014_0FF979BD4818BD18"/>ſuffered neither hunger nor thirſt during all the time of her faſting, that ſhe had loſt but little of her fleſh, and that her pulſe was full, ſtrong, and equal.</p>
               <p>The fourth caſe that I ſhall lay before the reader, is one that my worthy preceptor, Dr. Wiſtar, favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with; I ſhall relate it in his own words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The patient was upwards of ſixty years of age, and very ſedentary in her habits. The diſeaſe appeared to be ſimple dyſpepſia, but was aggravated inſtead of being relieved, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary remedies for that complaint, and finally it increaſed to ſuch a degree, that ſhe vomited every thing ſhe ſwallowed, and was affected with an inceſſant nauſea; debility increaſed in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theſe ſymptoms ſo much that ſhe was unable to ſit up. Enemata with a dram of tinct. thebaic. in each, were injected to relieve the nauſea, and they produced this effect, but did not enable the ſtomach to retain what was ſwallowed. To compenſate for the want of aliment in the ſtomach, the enemata were compoſed of about eight ounces of mutton or beef broth added to the tinct. thebaic. and they were retained a long time. As the diſeaſe continued, the enemata, thus compoſed, were injected daily. The bowels being extremely inactive, an injection ſlightly ſtimulating was previouſly adminiſtered, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally produced the diſcharge of a ſmall quantity of black coloured liquid foeces; an hour after theſe came away the anodyne nutritive injection
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033831_0015_0FF979C9661999E0"/>was exhibited, and was generally retained until the ſtimulating injection was uſed next day, which was about twenty-two hours afterwards. While the injection was retained ſhe lay quiet, and was not much affected with nauſea, unleſs ſhe attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eat or drink, but immediately after ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, vomiting came on, and it was computed by her attendants that ſhe always vomited much more than ſhe ſwallowed; the matter diſcharged appeared to be the aliment recently taken, mixed with the gaſtric fluids and mucus. In this ſtate, vomiting more than ſhe ſwallowed, ſhe continued upwards of ſix weeks, when the nauſea went off gradually, and her appetite and power of retaining food returned; with this alſo returned her ſtrength, which increaſed to a degree greater than uſual, and continued ſeveral years, when ſimilar complaints returned, while ſhe was in the country, where the enemata could not be adminiſtered; ſhe died after a lingering illneſs, during which ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expreſſed her wiſhes for her former remedy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I am ſorry that my experience as a ſtudent has not afforded me more facts of a ſimilar nature, but I flatter myſelf that the preceding caſes, though few in number, are ſufficient to convince-any mind of the great power of abſorption in the colon, and of the great utility of nutritive enemata in caſes of diſeaſe in the digeſtive organs, or in the organs of deglutition.</p>
               <p>

In every caſe where a ſufficient quantity of food cannot be received into the ſtomach without the aggravation of diſeaſe, when the patient is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unable to ſwallow, or in caſes where food received into the ſtomach is not digeſted, or is immediately thrown up; we ought never to neglect giving our patient the opportunity of recovering by theſe means. Though we cannot always cure the diſeaſe, yet we may revive and ſupport our patient until the remedies proper for the cure of his complaint can be employed with advantage. Of the three patients mentioned that were cured, I will venture to ſay there is not one who would not have died before the remedies, employed to cure the different diſeaſes, could have been effectually adminiſtered; it is had not been for the great aſſiſtance they derived from the nutritive enemata.</p>
               <p>The laſt of the four caſes is doubly intereſting, Firſt, for the length of time the patient was ſupported by the injection; and, ſecondly, for the perfect cure performed by the reſt afforded the ſtomach. This leads me again to recommend the uſe of nutritive clyſters to the practitioner of medicine, under certain circumſtances, and in certain diſeaſes; particularly in violent dyſpepſia, which ſo often baffles the efforts of phyſicians.</p>

                  <hi>CHAPTER III.</hi> Of the Sympathetic Connections of the Great Intestines.</head>
               <p>HITHERTO I have been conſidering the power of abſorption; my intention now is to offer a few obſervations, on another important quality of the animal body, by which medicines act on the whole ſyſtem although applied locally, I mean ſympathy. By this term we underſtand the diſpoſition in one part, to be affected by an application, to another, perhaps remotely ſituated from it; for example, an irritation excited in the noſe will throw the diaphragm into violent contractions; irritation at the neck of the bladder, by a ſtone, produces pain at the glans penis.</p>
               <p>Upon what principle, or by what means, this wonderful conſent of parts exiſts, has hitherto been inexplicable, and will remain ſo until we are better acquainted with the brain and nervous ſyſtem. The ſtrongeſt example of ſympathy or nervous connection afforded us, exiſts between the ſtomach; and the whole
<pb n="18"
                      facs="unknown:033831_0018_0FF978BC3B1142F8"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>body; the connection here is ſo ſtrong, that a draught of cold water, on a hot ſummers day, has deſtroyed life in a few minutes, a blow on the pit of the ſtomach has induced ſyncope and even death. It is by means of this great ſympathy that many medicines act on the general ſyſtem when received into the ſtomach, particularly thoſe of the narcotic and ſtimulating kind.</p>
               <p>That the large inteſtines reſemble the ſtomach in their ſympathetic connection is evident from the ſimilarity of effects, produced by the operation of the ſame medicines in the ſtomach and rectum. It has long been known that bark, injected into the rectum, will cure an intermittent, and the daily uſe of opium, in this way, attended with the ſame effects as when taken into the ſtomach, goes far to demonſtrate the ſympathy that exiſts between the rectum and general ſyſtem. The relation of an experiment made on myſelf, will convince the reader of the powerful effects of opium when received by enema.</p>
               <p>At a quarter before 10 o'clock, P. M. pulſe beating 52 <note n="*" place="bottom">My pulſe in health beats 52.</note> ſtrokes in a minute, I took an injection of 180 drops of laudanum diluted with two ounces of water; in 15 minutes my pulſe was the ſame with regard to frequency, but rather fuller; in 25 minutes it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the ſame with a ſlight giddineſs of the head; in 35 minutes it raiſed to 56, but was ſmaller and harder; in 45 minutes, pulſe 56, the affection of the

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>head reſembled that ſenſation which is felt at the approach of intoxication; 60 minutes, pulſe 56, the affection of the head continued; 70 minutes, pulſe 72, ſmall but tenſe, eyes ſomewhat turgid, more languor, and much inclined to a recumbent poſture: in the next ten minutes my pulſe fell from 72 to 60 ſtrokes in a minute, langour much increaſed. I now reſolved to go to bed; previous to doing this, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged what I ſuppoſed to be the whole of the injection without any foeces.</p>
               <p>At half paſt eleven o'clock, A. M. I injected ſeven drams of wine into the rectum of a ſmall dog; at 12 o'clock, no ſenſible effects being produced, nor the firſt injection diſcharged, I adminiſtered ſeven drams more; in five minutes after the laſt injection, he began to move his hind legs with difficulty, and great uncertainty, when attempting to jump he was ſure to fall; in a few minutes more he was ſcarcely able to walk, falling frequently and running againſt every thing that came in his way. In fifteen minutes after the laſt injection, he had a large diſcharge from the rectum, immediately after which the effects began gradually to diſappear.</p>
               <p>In this manner I intoxicated the ſame dog a number of different times.</p>
               <p>At ſeveral different times I had ſmall quantities of wine injected into my rectum. While under one of theſe experiments, and the only one at which I examined my pulſe, I found it to be raiſed ſeveral ſtrokes in a minute; but the quantity that I could
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033831_0020_0FF97A2849BC1890"/>retain was too ſmall to produce any very obvious effect while my body and mind were in perfect health; but I am fully convinced that wine may be injected into the rectum with advantage in caſes of great debility. I will here take the liberty of mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in as few words as poſſible, a caſe delivered by Dr. Wiſtar in his courſe of Lectures on Anatomy, which in a remarkable manner points out the ſimilarity of effects produced in the ſtomach and rectum by ſpiritous liquors. The ſubject of this caſe was a man much addicted to the uſe of ſtrong drink, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably from this cauſe was tempted to cut his throat, which he one day effected; while he laboured under the wound, it was with great difficulty that any thing could be ſwallowed. His phyſician, the late Dr. Way of this city, whoſe death is ever to be lamented, directed nutritive enemata, and theſe anſwered the purpoſe of aliment; but the poor patient ſoon found that he ſuffered materially from the want of the diffuſible ſtimulus, and one day, when his wife was about giving him an injection, he deſired her to add ſome ardent ſpirits to the nutritive matter; the effect ſoon convinced him that he derived every benefit from the ſpirit in this way, that he was accuſtomed to do when he drank it; and after this diſcovery, he did not let a ſingle day paſs without taking ſeveral doſes.</p>
               <p>Theſe experiments, in conjunction with daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, can leave no doubt of the great advantages to be derived on certain occaſions from the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of medicines, particularly thoſe of a narcotic ſtimulating quality, by enemata.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:033831_0021_0FF97A434A4E1790"/>
I cannot ſay from experiment, but I think analogy warrants me in ſo doing, that every medicine, the effects of which are communicated to the general ſyſtem by the ſympathetic connection of the ſtomach, will have a ſimilar effect when thrown up the rectum provided the doſe is proportionably large.</p>
               <p>The relative doſe for the rectum, has by ſome been computed to be two thirds larger than that for the ſtomach, but from experiment I am led to believe that it does not require ſo much. On comparing the effects of ſixty drops of tinct. thebaic. in the ſtomach, with thoſe produced by one hundred and eighty drops in the rectum, I found that the effects of the latter were ſomething ſtronger than thoſe of the former. This I think juſtifies me in concluding, that the relative doſe for the rectum does not require to be two thirds larger, but that little more than a double doſe will anſwer the ſame intentions in the inteſtines.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſatisfied myſelf of the ſympathetic connection between the rectum and general ſyſtem; I was induced to try whether any particular ſympathy exiſted between the ſtomach and large inteſtines: the mode that ſtruck me as beſt calculated to aſcertain this point, was the injection of emetic medicines; I made a number of experiments with tart. emetic, and ſeveral with ipecac. a few of which I ſhall now proceed to relate.</p>
               <p>After having uſed as much as eight grains of the emetic tart. by enema, without the leaſt affection of
<pb n="22"
                      facs="unknown:033831_0022_0FF97A4E77150360"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>the ſtomach, I was induced to think that a ſtill larger quantity might produce ſome effect, and I ventured on taking thirteen grains; this was injected at half paſt eleven o'clock, A. M. diſſolved in two ounces of water, immediately after I had perfectly evacuated my rectum. This on being firſt thrown up produced ſome irritation, but it did not continue longer than five minutes. Not the ſlighteſt affection of the ſtomach was obſervable, from the time it was injected, until it was diſcharged, which was at ten o'clock, P. M. of the ſame day. In the act of evacuating, I had ſome teneſmus, and a little ſoreneſs at the verge of the anus, but of this I felt nothing ten minutes after. So inactive was the tart. emetic upon this part, that it did not even excite a diſcharge of foeces, nor produce the leaſt effect on the general ſyſtem that was obſervable.</p>
               <p>From the great irritation produced in the rectum by injections of ipecac, I did not venture to increaſe the doſe beyond half a dram; this quantity was adminiſtered one afternoon at half paſt four o'clock, mixed with two ounces of warm water, and was not diſcharged until nine o'clock, A. M. the next day. In the intermediate time, no effects of any kind were obſervable either on the ſtomach or general ſyſtem, but at four in the afternoon I had another very ſmall diſcharge, which was attended with conſiderable ſtraining, and from this time I had almoſt a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued deſire to evacuate from the rectum; in two or three hours went to ſtool three or four times, and theſe diſcharges, though very ſmall, were all attended
<pb n="23"
                      facs="unknown:033831_0023_0FF97A69247FA890"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>with teneſmus; between theſe evacuations I was not free from uneaſineſs, but felt a conſiderable throbbing about the verge of the anus, ſimilar to that experienced in a phlegmon. Would not an injection of this kind ſerve to bring on the haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoidal flux?</p>
               <p>From the two laſt mentioned experiments, and ſeveral others of a ſimilar nature not related; I conclude that there is no ſpecific connection between the ſtomach and rectum, and that little can be expected from enemata in exciting the action of the ſtomach, without it is in conſequence of their effect upon the general ſyſtem.</p>

                  <hi>CHAPTER IV.</hi> On the Application of Medicines to the External Surface.</head>
               <p>THE utility to be derived from the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of medicines to different parts of the body, muſt forcibly ſtrike every mind, upon conſidering how often we are prevented from applying them with effect through the medium of the alimentary canal by its many diſeaſes; and the great diſpoſition there is in the different parts of the animal body to become habituated to the action of medicines applied imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to them. It is a fact well known, that when one part has become accuſtomed to the action of a medicine, we may apply it to another with every advantage; for inſtance, when the ſtomach, from a long continued uſe, has become as it were paralytic to the powers of opium, the rectum will receive its impreſſions as forcibly as though it never had been applied to any part of the body. This fact is further corroborated by a very ſimple experiment. Any perſon in the habit of uſing tobacco, and who has always been accuſtomed to hold the chew on one

               <p>In the preceding pages I have conſidered the rectum as an advantageous part for the application of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and medicine, when the ſtomach, mouth, or oeſophagus are diſeaſed. In caſes where we wiſh further to aſſiſt the operation of medicines in the ſtomach and rectum, or where both theſe organs are diſeaſed; a good opportunity is afforded us by the external ſurface of the body.</p>
               <p>Medicines applied to the ſkin act on the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſpoken of, namely, abſorption and nervous ſympathy. That the firſt of theſe powers is ſeated in the ſkin, is evident, by eſſential oils having been taſted in the mouth, a ſhort time after they were rubbed on ſome part of the ſkin; by the external uſe of terebinthinates, by the daily introduction of mercury into the ſyſtem in this way, and by the abſorption of many poiſons from the external ſurface; the bark, bath, and jacket have alſo been found of ſervice in intermittents, and theſe probably act as much through the medium of the nerves as of the obſorbents.</p>
               <p>In the memoirs of the medical ſociety of London, we find a letter from Mr. Sherwen to Dr. Lettſom on the external abſorption of tartar emetic. In this communication the author obſerves, nauſea, great perſpiration, gentle purging, an increaſed flow of
<pb n="26"
                      facs="unknown:033831_0026_0FF97A9A3A247DB0"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>urine, and in one caſe an eruption with an itching of the ſkin, as the effects of from five to ten grains (which is the largeſt doſe he there mentions having uſed) of tart. emet. when abſorbed by rubbing it on the hands, and in one inſtance, on the ſide and region of the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>It might be thought preſumption in me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict ſo reſpectable an author as Mr. Sherwen; this I will avoid doing, but ſhall relate ſome expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments ſimilar to Mr. Sherwen's, with their reſults, and leave the unprejudiced reader to judge for himſelf.</p>
               <p>At ſeveral different times, I rubbed 12 grains of tart. emet. moiſtened with a ſmall quantity of water into the palms of my hands; this was done in the evening a ſhort time before going to bed. I ſlept ſound as uſual all night, without experiencing the leaſt nauſea, perſpiration, or purgative effects, either during the night or next day, but roſe and eat my breakfaſt with my accuſtomed good appetite. At my deſire, a fellow-graduate repeated the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment juſt related, without experiencing any ſenſible effects from the medicine.</p>
               <p>The following experiment was made by a fellow ſtudent. At 8 o'clock, P. M. he rubbed 12 grains of tart. emet. with the addition of two drams of water, into the palms of his hands; in half an hour after, the firſt 12 grains having produced no effects, 12 grains more were adminiſtered in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. No effects were obſervable in three hours

About ſix o'clock next morning a moiſture of the ſkin was obſervable; this the gentleman was inclined to attribute more to his having ſlept under an unuſual quantity of bed clothes, than to the medicine. No nauſea, purging, or eruption followed.</p>
               <p>Two ſcruples of tart. emet. made into a paſte with a little water, and kept applied to the pit of the ſtomach for 12 hours, produced no diſcoverable operation.</p>
               <p>Peter V—, afflicted with chronic rheumatiſm, rubbed a table ſpoonful of a ſaturated ſolution of tart. emet. in water into his knee and thigh; this he continued to do every night, for a week, without its once nauſeating, or ſweating him. He thought the medicine purged him ſlightly the ſecond morning after he commenced the uſe of it; this effect was not obſerved at any other time during the whole courſe. The complaint of this patient was not relieved by this remedy.</p>

               <p>Molly C—, ſubject to a chronic head-ache and ſome uneaſineſs at her ſtomach, rubbed a table-ſpoonful of the ſame ſolution over her abdomen every evening for five or ſix days, without obſerving any of the effects aſcribed to this medicine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sherwen inculcates the above as a good mode of adminiſtering antimonials, when we wiſh them to act on the general ſyſtem, and not particularly on the alimentary canal. That a long and continued uſe of tart. emet. in this way would materially affect the ſyſtem, I have no manner of doubt; but of operations produced by a ſingle or ſeveral doſes, the reader will judge from the above experiments.</p>
               <p>In caſes of abſtinence from aliment and drink, where great thirſt occurs, relief may be afforded almoſt immediately by immerſing the patient in warm water. Sailors frequently experience the happieſt effects from bathing, when they are in want of water. It is on the principle of abſorption from the ſkin, that the inoculation of the ſmall-pox is founded; this diſcovery has afforded more happineſs to mankind than any made ſince the time of Harvey, and is alone

               <p>The nervous conſent exiſting between the ſkin and general ſyſtem, is by no means ſmall, as is obſervable from the action of ſome ſubſtances when applied to this part. I have ſeen a leaf of tobacco applied to the cheek of a perſon not accuſtomed to the uſe of this plant, produce violent vomiting, and purging, and general effects ſo powerful as nearly to induce ſyncope.</p>
               <p>Opiates may be employed with evident benefit in this way, as I have frequently obſerved where opium made into a plaſter with a little conſerve of roſes has been applied to the pit of the ſtomach, in ſpaſms of that organ, cholera infantum, and vomitings; it relieves the uneaſineſs at the ſtomach, and has a tendency to cheek the diarrhoea.</p>
               <p>One dram of finely powdered opium made into a paſte with liquid laudanum, and applied to the pit of the ſtomach of an adult, produced effects ſo ſtrong, that the ſubject, a woman of a habit rather delicate, was unable to keep out of bed.</p>
               <p>Volat alkali applied to the temples and internal membrane of the noſe in ſyncope, furniſhes another proof of the ſudden and powerful operations that may be produced on the ſyſtem, by the application
