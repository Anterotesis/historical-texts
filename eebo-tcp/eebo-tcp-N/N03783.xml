            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>A Letter from the Rev. Mr.</hi> Whitefield, <hi>to a Friend in</hi> London, <hi>ſhewing the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Error of a Book, entituled,</hi> The Whole Duty of Man.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE it has pleaſed God to give me a true Knowledge of the Doctrines of Grace, I have frequently thought, that next to the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away of the Clergy from the Principles of the Reformation, the Books which are in our Church founded on the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme, have been the chief Cauſe why ſo many of our own Communion in particular, have built their Hopes of Salvation on a falſe Bottom. The Authors not only led the People Captive in their own Life Time, but alſo after their Death, like <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> for a long Seaſon have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched the People with their Sorceries; I mean their ſeemingly devout, but at the Bottom Anti-Chriſtian, Compoſitions.</p>
            <p>The only Way therefore, to open People's Eyes, I think is this: To ſhew them that the Writings which for ſome Years paſt, have been ſo much admired, are directly contrary to the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for this Reaſon, I thought it my Duty, to bear a publick Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Writings of Archbiſhop <hi>Tillotſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004642_0003_100DB606B29806C0"/>
And upon the ſame Account, think it my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to point out the Fundamental Error of an Author as much admired and read by the more common, as the Archbiſhop by the more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and polite, ſort of People.</p>
            <p>I know you are impatient to hear, who this can be: If you will promiſe me not to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, I'll tell you; it is that much admir'd Book called the WHOLE DUTY OF MAN. Methinks, I ſee you ſurprized at the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of it. But remember, I deſir'd you not to be angry; and if you will throw aſide Prejudice, and are ſincerely deſirons to know and do the divine Will, I am perſuaded we ſhall be both of one Mind concerning this Book, are you lay this Letter down out of your Hand.</p>
            <p>But before I ſhew you its Error, to convince you of my Impartiality, I confeſs, that the Devotions of that Book, were once of Service to me: And I believe have been uſeful to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. The Book in general, is calculated to <hi>civilize,</hi> but I am perſuaded it never was a Means of <hi>converting</hi> one ſingle Soul. I have juſt been looking over the Index and general Titles at the End of it, and cannot find the Word <hi>Regeneration</hi> ſo much as once mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and indeed the whole Treatiſe is built on ſuch a falſe Foundation, as not only proves the Author to be no real Chriſtian at Heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004642_0004_100DB608EF07CF68"/>
alſo, that he had not ſo much as a Head-Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> To prove this, I need only refer you to part of the Preface, <hi>Of the Neceſſity of caring for the Soul,</hi> (17th Paragraph) wherein the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor talking of the ſecond Covenant, ſpeaks thus: <hi>This ſecond Covenant,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was made with</hi> Adam <hi>and us in him, preſently after his Fall, and is briefly contain'd in thoſe Words, Gen. 3d, 15th, where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpent's Head; and this was made up as the Firſt was, of ſome Mercies to be afforded by God, and ſome Duties to be performed by us.</hi> Who, that is any Way enlighten'd, cannot ſee the falſe Divinity and Fundamental Errors of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage? For how can it be proved, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant was made with <hi>Adam</hi>; or that God ever entered into any Covenant at all, with Man after he had broken the Firſt? It is true, he did enter into a Covenant, (and that from all Eternity,) with the ſecond <hi>Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the God-Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> in our Stead. But it cannot be proved that he made any ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant at all with <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, or any of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. But ſays our Author;
<q>He did make a ſecond Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> and us in him, preſently after his Fall, and it is briefly contained in theſe Words, <hi>Gen. 3d.</hi> &amp; 15th,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004642_0005_100DB60AA99DDAB8"/>
where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpent's Head.</q>
But I would ask, where any Covenant is contained in theſe Words? And, how it is made up as the firſt was, of ſome Mercies to be afforded by God, and ſome Duties to be performed by us? Here is a <hi>free Gift</hi> and Promiſe of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to <hi>Adam,</hi> but no Covenant, not a Word of any Condition mentioned. No, it was the free Gift of God in <hi>Chriſt. Adam</hi> was now in a State of Condemnation, he was ſo far from being deſirous of entring into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with, that he fled from, God, and was not ſo much as truly convicted of his Sin; as will evidently appear from the Context. For, both he and his Wife laid the Fault not upon <hi>themſelves,</hi> but one <hi>another</hi> and the <hi>Serpent. The Woman which thou gaveſt me,</hi> (therein tacitly reflecting upon God, for giving him that Woman,) <hi>ſhe gave me,</hi> ſays Adam, <hi>and I did eat.</hi> Here appears no true Senſe of Sin at all: and to ſhew they had no Notion of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, we are told they ſewed Fig Leaves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, inſtead of applying to God, to cover their Nakedneſs; and afterwards fled from God, when they heard the Voice of the Lord God walking among the Trees in the Garden. Here then opens the Myſtery of Godlineſs, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the Fleſh. Notwithſtanding our firſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004642_0006_100DB60E6A2F4D18"/>
Parents had broken the Covenant, and had their Hearts hardened; yet, out of the Riches of his <hi>free Grace,</hi> God had provided a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from all Eternity, and now reveals it in Time. <hi>The Seed of this Woman,</hi> i. e. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (who in all Probability was ſpiritually conceived that Inſtant in the Heart of <hi>Eve</hi>) <hi>ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head, i. e.</hi> by his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Death, ſhall ſatisfy divine Juſtice, fulfill the moral Law in Man's Stead, and thereby deliver him from the Power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Here are no <hi>Terms</hi> mentioned, on Man's Part at all. And ſuppoſing there had been a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with Man, <hi>'And it had been made up as the firſt was, of ſome Mercies to be afforded by God, and ſome Duties to be performed by us:</hi> Alas, we are of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the moſt miſerable; for then we are not under <hi>Grace,</hi> but under the <hi>Law.</hi> And if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> could not keep the <hi>firſt</hi> Covenant, tho' in perfect Innocence; how can we, who hate God by Nature, and whoſe Thoughts are only evil continually, keep a <hi>ſecond</hi> like unto it? Is not this putting Man into a moſt unhappy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and making his poor imperfect Obedience the <hi>Cauſe</hi> why <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is merciful unto him? and if ſo, how is boaſting excluded in the great Work of our Redemption, as the Scriptures every where affirm? And how can Eternal
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004642_0007_100ECA10DBC2C408"/>
Life be the free <hi>Gift</hi> of God, thro' <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord? But this is agreeable enough to the Divinity of this Author, who in the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-firſt Paragraph of his Preface ſays; <hi>The Third Thing that</hi> Chriſt <hi>was to do for us, was, to enable us, or give us Strength, to do what God requires of us. This he doth, firſt by taking off from the Hardneſs of the Law given to</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>,which was, never to commit the leaſt Sin upon Pain of Damnation, and requiring of us only an holy and hearty Endeavour to do what we are able, and where we fail ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of ſincere Repentance.</hi> Now, I would fain know, where God has taken off from the Hardneſs of the Law given unto <hi>Adam</hi>? And required of us only an holy and hearty Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do what we are able? And, when we fail, accepting of ſincere Repentance? This is all as falſe, as God is true; the whole Law is as much, in Force againſt <hi>us,</hi> as it was againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> before we are found in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> God has been ſo far from taking off from the Hardneſs of the Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> declares, that he came not to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> but to <hi>fulfil</hi> it. And, until convinc'd of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we lie under to obey the whole moral Law, in Thought, Word, and Deed, how can we ſee the Neceſſity of the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> God's Law was honourable, <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004642_0008_100ECA069AD06528"/>
Chriſt</hi> fulfilled it in our Stead, and upon Account of that Righteouſneſs <hi>imputed</hi> to us, and not on our hearty Endeavours or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, are we accepted by him. What is there in our hearty Endeavour or Repentance, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend us to the Favour of God, or render them worthy or being <hi>joined</hi> with the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as tho' <hi>that</hi> was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in <hi>itſelf</hi>? Our beſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> are but <hi>Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dida peccata, glittering Sins. I cannot pray,</hi> ſays the pious Biſhop <hi>Beveridge, but I Sin; I cannot hear or preach a Sermon, but I Sin; I cannot give an Alms, or receive the Sacrament, but I Sin; Nay, I cannot confeſs my Sins, but my very Confeſſions are ſtill Aggravations to them: my Repentings need to be repented of; my Tears want waſhing, and the very waſhing of my Tears, need ſtill to be waſhed over again with the Blood of my Redeemer,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, The Lord is our <hi>whole</hi> Righteouſneſs, we are to go to him as poor Sinners. Beg Salvation of him as his <hi>free Gift,</hi> and entreat him to give us a living Faith, whereby that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be applied to our Hearts; and then that Faith, if true, will work by Love. This, the Author of the WHOLE DUTY OF MAN, was wholly ignorant of, otherwiſe he would not have laid ſuch a Foundation: and if the Foundation be ſo bad, judge you how wretchedly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004642_0009_100ECA0899080520"/>
weak, the Surperſtructure muſt be. It would take more Time than I can at preſent ſpare, to point out all the Miſtakes of the whole Book: I will only refer you to what this Author ſays about Recreations, Sunday, 19th, Sec. 7th wherein he ſeems not only to allow of Gaming, by ſaying, <hi>if we play at any Game,</hi> but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us when we do it, to let <hi>the End of our doing it be meerly to recreate ourſelves.</hi> I thought the Glory of God, and not <hi>ſelf-pleaſing,</hi> had been the Principle from which all Chriſtians ought to act. I ſuppoſe from this Paſſage, a Man whom I reproved lately on the Road, for Gaming in the <hi>Chriſtmas Holy-Days,</hi> grounded <hi>his</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for ſo doing: He told me, <hi>the Whole Duty of Man</hi> ſaid, he might do ſo And indeed I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is not the firſt by thouſands, who have been miſerably deceived, by this much applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Book: And therefore I thought myſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to write this Letter. You may make what Uſe you will of it. I care not if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are publiſhed upon the Houſe Top. Nay, I think it your Duty, if convinced yourſelf, to endeavour to convince others; for there's no Hopes of bringing People to a right Knowledge of the Goſpel, till their Favourite, tho' erroneous, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are diſcountenanc'd and laid aſide. Before I ſee <hi>England,</hi> I hope I ſhall hear that my dear Friends in the Miniſtry, both in preaching and

Their Declarations will ſtand as Records that God did not leave himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Witneſs, even in the Worſt of times. Other Goſpel Miniſters will be much encourag'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and thouſands, nay, ten thouſands prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Infection, which other <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

However, whether they ſecond me or not, by the Help of my God, both abroad and at Home, (if it be the Divine Will I ſhould ſee <hi>England</hi> again) I will perſevere in bearing a more explicite and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Teſtimony againſt the falſe Writings of our admired <hi>Rabbies.</hi> Do you and my other Friends watch over me; reprove me ſharply whenever you perceive my Spirit embitter'd.
