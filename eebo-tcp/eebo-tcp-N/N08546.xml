            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL thoſe in whom is the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, are, in an influential manner ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that the true proſperity of ſtates and kingdoms (under God) depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good qualifications of rulers and counſellors. Of this, king David was fully ſenſible; wherefore he determined to look well to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of thoſe whom he choſe to ſtand around him.</p>
            <p>The words now read, and the pſalm in which they are contained, were compoſed by David, between the times of God's promiſing him the kingdom, and his actual and plenary poſſeſſion of it; which appears from the ſecond verſe, where he thus addreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, O, when wilt thou come unto me? q. d. when wilt thou fulfil thy gracious promiſe, and give me to ſit upon the throne of Iſrael? He expreſſes a ſettled determination that no one ſhould be admitted into his houſe, as a domeſtic ſervant, or into his court as a counſellor, unleſs free from a vicious character—
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010930_0003_0F852A5A33E21AC0"/>
free from an aſſuming, corrupt and deceitful mind and conduct. Mine eyes, ſays he, ſhall be upon the faithful of the land (in conformity to my glorious antitype) upon thoſe who are governed by a ſpirit of wiſdom, integrity and goodneſs, for in them is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable preſence of God. The real and enduring proſperity of the people are the moſt likely to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. No ſtate or community on earth can flouriſh, or ſubſiſt, unleſs God is preſent to counſel its counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and ſucceed their endeavours. Now, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his favourable preſence and aſſiſtance, is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly to them that fear him, and walk, in his perfect way: Such therefore, were the perſons upon whom holy David had his eyes, to ſearch them out, to favour and advance them, from among the people, to fears of government. He well knew, that as the throne is eſtabliſhed by righteousſneſs,<note n="a" place="bottom">Prov. xvi.13.</note> thoſse who ſurround it, muſt walk in a perfect way. This was ſo rivetted in his mind, that he repeatedly expreſſes his ſettled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, to make himſelf a pattern, by ordering his conduct according to God's will, and entertain none in his court but ſuch as walked by the ſame rule. It was not, with him, a ſufficient recommendation for high advancement, to be forward and warm in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of it. To be of quick apprehenſion, of polite addreſs, or learned in politics. Though the latter of theſe are good, yet the king after God's own heart, did not confine his views wholly here; he extended them farther in queſt of qualifications more divine and God-like. As God inveſted him with a right to promote to honor and government, he eſteemed it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in order to be free from abuſing and forfeiting
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010930_0003_0F852A5A33E21AC0"/>
this privilege, to ſee well to the real worth, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent accompliſhments of thoſe he called to public ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the ſtate. This is highly worthy of our ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attention. Since God, in his good providence, has ſeen fit to indulge us in this colony with this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, of electing our rulers, and this day calls us to the ſervice, we are bound, with impartiality and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as in the preſence of God, and accountable to him, to improve this privilege which was, and ſtill is in many places, the ſole prerogative of kings. Every abuſe of this moſt valuable liberty, is a forfeiture—and a forfeiture may ſoon be followed with total loſs. But we may farther meditate upon this general ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from the words, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That it is a duty incumbent on us, and on all who have a right to, and are active in advancing men to places of public truſt and eminence, carefully to have our eyes upon, and give our ſuffrages for thoſe who are well qulified, and are faithful.</q> Here we may conſider,</p>
            <p>Who we are to view, and act for, as well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for public truſt. Then,</p>
            <p>Shew the duty and neceſſity of giving our ſuffrages for ſuch, and conſider ſome arguments for it.</p>
            <p>Now, by the faithful and well qualified, we are not to underſtand thoſe only who are of our own particular taſte, ſentiments or party. 'Tis poſſible a man may think and act in conformity to, and in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with us, and ſtill be unfaithful to his God, his country, and his king. A perſon may greedily adopt, and drink in our ſcheme of religion and politicks, and yet be eſſentially unqualified for a public ruler.</p>
            <p>Neither are we to confine this important character to thoſe who are peculiarly obſequious to us. To
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010930_0004_0F852A62827568E8"/>
thoſe who we imagine in all controverſies in which we may be concerned will be ever ready to eſpouſe our cauſe, (whatever it is) and be ſervent and active in promoting us; our private intereſts, or friends. This would favor too ſtrongly of ſelf and party.</p>
            <p>'Tis with much diſapprobation St. Jude<note n="b" place="bottom">V. 16. of his Epiſt.</note> mentions ſome, who thus have men's perſons in admiration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of advantage. So, we are not to underſtand by this, ſuch only as are wiſe and faithful in their own matters, awake to their own perſonal intereſts, and neglectful of the publick. But,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. We are to underſtand by the well qualified, men of approved varacity. I truſt there is none of you my friends, but what think it worthy of your care, to elect thoſe to repreſent and govern you, on whoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity you may ſafely rely: you would be fearful of repoſing even the leaſt confidence in any you eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed defective in this point. Our public affairs, and particular circumſtances; call for a juſt repreſentation: and ſuch a repreſentation we can never be aſſured of, either at home or abroad, unleſs our public concerns are committed into the hands of men poſſeſſed of this virtue. We ſhall not be likely to have our real wants ſupplied, or grievances redreſſed, unleſs made known to ſuch, as have the power of redreſſing them in the light of truth. Thoſe who preſide in the republick or kingdom, muſt be informed of the true ſtate of the people, before they can miniſter to them according to their needs. Doubtleſs, for want of due information, given to the heads of government, communities and ſtates have often long groaned under calamities from which they might ſoon have had relief, if matters of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010930_0004_0F852A62827568E8"/>
fact had been juſtly related. We always need the help and ſupports of truth. So Jethro counſelled Moſes,<note n="c" place="bottom">Exod. xviii.21.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt provide out of all the people, men of truth.</hi> Holy David ſays,<note n="d" place="bottom">v. 7 cont.</note> 
               <hi>He that worketh deceit, ſhall not dwell within my houſe.</hi> This was a virtue Solomon had found very chearing and valuable in ambaſſadors; he ſays,<note n="e" place="bottom">Prov. xiii.17.</note> 
               <hi>A faithful ambaſſador is health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, they muſt be men of impartiality and juſtice. God, the ſupreme head of the univerſe, is a God of truth, and without iniquity,<note n="f" place="bottom">Deut. xxxii.4</note> ſo he delights in theſe virtues, and would have all the children of men poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them—in an eſpecial manner thoſe who govern under him. He would have all under his government, partake the benefits of equity and juſtice: wherefore he ſays,<note n="g" place="bottom">2 Sam, xxiii.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>He that ruleth over men, muſt be juſt.</hi> As every perſon has an unalienable right to equity and juſtice, rulers muſt be ſuch as will admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter theſe, faithfully and impartially, and hear the ſmall, and do them juſtice as well as the great. If there is no proper regard to theſe in rulers, our eſtates, our moſt valuable privileges, yea, our lives, will have but a very ſlender ſecurity. We are bound to give our voices for ſuch as we, with greateſt probability judge, will never deſert the path of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, or the common ſafety, from the tear of frowns, the hope of rewards, or the adulations of the inſincere and deſigning. The prophet Iſaiah<note n="h" place="bottom">xxxiii, 15, 16.</note> points out who is worthy, and ſhall be owned of God. <hi>He that walketh righteouſly—that deſpiſeth the gain of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that ſhaketh his hands from holding of bribes—he ſhall dwell on high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where there is a partial adminiſtration, you may
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010930_0005_0F852A6333236E40"/>
expect that the wicked will be promoted and juſtified, and the righteous be overthrown in judgment. That the offending and vexatious will appear in high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when the innocent, and his juſt cauſe, ſhall be neglected or turned aſide. We can't rationally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that rulers who are partial, tempered in the heat of party, will properly concern themſelves for the good of the whole political body. Their peculiar friends and party intereſts, will very much terminate their purſuits, whilſt the general welfare is trampled upon. Not that they are to be regardleſs of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, for they are to rule for the particular good of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, which will encompaſs the whole; wherefore 'tis incumbent on us, to afford a promoting hand to ſuch as are moſt likely to conduct with due reference to theſe, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

There is a very rare compoſition requiſite to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the character of a well-accompliſhed and faithful ruler; but it is a compoſition moſt worthy of our cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſearch: 'tis a compoſition which (bleſſed be God) may be found on earth.

There is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe of this apoſtolic complaint, "all ſeek their own, &amp;c." tho' this may not be univerſal. Now the civil magiſtrate would be very deficient, if deſtitute of a publick ſpirit, and true greatneſs of ſoul: without this patriotic virtue, all our boaſted privileges would be likely tamely to be given up, even upon the ſlighteſt attack. There is a ſpirit of fear, which God has not given, from which rulers ſhould be free; and a ſpirit of power, or fortitude &amp; of a ſound mind, which he has given, and which they ſhould poſſeſs.<note n="l" place="bottom">2 Tim. i.2.</note>

God, whoſe dominion is univerſal, demands the firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal regard of all; wherefore, we can't ſuppoſe he who is negligent and regardleſs of his duty to him, will conſcientiouſly diſcharge his duty to his fellow men.</p>

Now we can not ſuppoſe that thoſe who are regardleſs of his laws, will regard man's. A ſteady and uniform attendance to the duties which he owes to God, will recommend to publick confidence.</p>
            <p>To add yet farther, we ſhall do well to take a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the paſt transactions and conduct of thoſe we endeavour to promote to dignified ſtations. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably a good recommendation for advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where any have been faithful in the places which they have filled heretofore, or fill now, and in the truſts which have been repoſed in them. Such we may with a good degree of ſafety continue to confide in. We may farther truſt him, who has given ſufficient proof of his good abilities, and fidelity. But ſhould we not be ſuſpicious of him, who had betrayed a truſt, and eſteem him unworthy of future confidence? you would not readily truſt to a bow, which had proved deceitful, or boldly tread where your feet had well nigh ſlipt.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have evidenced a ſerious concern for the publick good, and done all in their power to promote and ſecure it; (if otherwiſe qualified) bid the faireſt to anſwer the great ends of government.

We obſerve, in the hiſtory of the Jews, that when their chief rulers were really men of God, and ruled in his fear, they generally flouriſhed in ſucceſs and proſperity, both in things ſpiritual and temporal. Bleſſed art thou, O land! bleſſed art thou, O Zion, and people of God, when ſuch are exalted! Is this the caſe with us? then our hopes for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our moſt dear, ſpiritual enjoyments, and their being perpetuated, may triumph over our diſquieting fears of the irreparable loſs of them. When rulers, inſtead of being examples of chriſtian faith and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are examples of renouncing and ſlighting the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar doctrines of grace, and the fundamental arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the chriſtian religion—when they are in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, examples of impiety, we may expect that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing evils will enſue—that error and wickedneſs will be prevalent, and the cauſe of the dear Redeemer be clad in mourning.</p>
            <p>Mankind are greatly inclined to imitation; in an eſpecial manner, to imitate thoſe in places of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and high life. Senſible of this, holy David reſolved to behave himſelf wifely, in a perfect way.<note n="r" place="bottom">2. v. context.</note> If their examples are bad, we may expect that the <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will walk on every ſide,</hi> and that immorality will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail like the ſpreading leproſy. When the rulers among the people of the Jews were idolatrous, oppreſſive or any ways notoriouſly impious, impiety and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, even at once, in general deluged them. The real faults and imperfections of thoſe in diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeats of government, and of the polite world, are, in the view of many of lower characters, and of thoſe who emulate them, even crowned with a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010930_0009_0F852A679531B090"/>
ſanction, and imitated as really enobling: from whence the accurſed thing which God hates, and which brings final ruin, loſes it's malignity, and when thus faſhionable, ſacreligiouſly puts on the pretended appearance of honor, and indicates a great and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventrous ſoul. When this is the caſe with any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what cauſe of lamentation and grief! <hi>O Term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora, O Mores!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The impiety of princes and rulers, has often proved the corruption and calamity of the ſtate: this hiſtory both ſacred and human, puts beyond diſpute.</p>
            <p>We may now proceed to confider the duty of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſuffrages for ſuch as are thus well qualified for public truſt, together with a few arguments (in addition to what have been noticed) exciting to it.</p>
            <p>Now, we are bound to this, as it is the will of God, that thoſe who bear his name, ſhould reſemble his moral character. Rulers are called Gods,<note n="s" place="bottom">Exod. xxii.38.</note> from that faint reſemblance they bear to him, the ſupreme Ruler. They are called thus, on account of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice they are appointed to under him, to enact laws, to govern, to protect, and to adminiſter juſtice; and it is his pleaſure that they ſhould conduct worthy of this moſt exalted and honorary title—that they ſhould poſſeſs and honor all the moral perfections which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the name. We may not only confider King David ſpeaking in the text, but Chriſt, the bleſſed and only potentate, of whom he was eminently a type, and to whom his throne was promiſed. It is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, that thoſe who are to rule for him, ſhould be faithful, and walk in a perfect way. Yea, that all his ſubjects ſhould, as far as poſſible poſſeſs, and exhibit
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010930_0009_0F852A679531B090"/>
all his moſt glorious moral excellencies. In an eſpecial manner, rulers as his miniſters, muſt like him be no reſpecters of perſons, but imitate his moſt amiable character, by doing juſtly, loving mercy, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humbly with their God.</p>
            <p>Again, we ſhould be animated to this, becauſe 'tis our duty and wiſdom, wiſely to improve our privileges. It is a privilege truly great, for a people to have the free election of thoſe that have the immediate rule over them; and it has ever been accounted and prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo, by thoſe who have had this power, and duly improved it. That people whoſe rulers are appointed by thoſe whoſe diſtance neceſſarily keeps them in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree unacquainted with their particular circumſtances, (without any hurtful deſign in thoſe that appoint them) are doubly liable to have ſuch ſet over them, as care more for abſolute dominion, and increaſe of wealth, than for juſtice and equity, or the real proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the community; perhaps for inſtances of this kind, we need not look into diſtant climes, or ancient records. Are not ſuch more likely to bind heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens upon mens ſhoulders, than thoſe choſen by the people out of their own tribes, members incorporated in the ſame body?</p>
            <p>But in the good providence of God, and clemency of our rightful King, we in this colony live in the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of a kingdom, the beſt conſtituted of any of the kingdoms of the earth. Wherefore we are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to improve this liberty, and endeavour by all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable meaſures to have it perpetuated. Every a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of it is impious, and expoſes to a total, irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable deprivation. And if this is loſt by our miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, or abuſe of it, the evil conſequences will juſtly return upon our own heads.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:010930_0010_0F852A68559F9560"/>
But to proceed, we do well to conſider that our moſt important intereſts (under God) are put into their hands—yea, the higheſt intereſts of every one of us. Rulers are not merely for the benefit of any particular perſon or party, but for the whole commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Every member of it (as ſuch) has an equal right in them; ſo that if we ſtrive to raiſe thoſe into place, whom we imagine will be partial in favour of us, and of thoſe that think with us, to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of others, we act unrighteouſly, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to prevent others from their unalienable right. Now ſince every individual, and ſo the whole body is to be cared for, if we act from partial views, for favourers of a party, we counteract this plain direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others.</hi> We are bound by all legal meaſure, to promote our own, and others good and happineſs. Surely, you would not be willing to commit your moſt valuable effects, or thoſe of your friends, to the cuſtody of one who was unfaithful, and would embezzel and deſtroy them—to one weak and unable to defend them, or to one who would attend to ill advice and deſert them. We learn that by weakneſs and ill advice, Rehoboam took meaſures which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the revolt of ten of the tribes of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>So farther, you may conſider that the bleſſing of God is moſt likely to come to a people in, and attend the adminiſtrations of good and faithful rulers. As he loves righteouſneſs and hates iniquity, ſo he loves thoſe that work righteouſneſs, and in this ſervice he will eſtabliſh their ways. Such as are wiſe and holy, have a peculiar promiſe of his favourable preſence, and he will inſtruct them. David ſays, <hi>the ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will teach
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010930_0010_0F852A68559F9560"/>
them.</hi> So we find that God would not hide from faithful Abraham, the thing he was about to do to Sodom.<note n="w" place="bottom">Gen. xviii.19.</note> The holy records inform us, that he has ſignally bleſſed his people, when their rulers were juſt, ruling in his fear, he is with them in the judgment. When this is at any time the caſe with us, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Lord of hoſts will be for a crown of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for a diadem of beauty unto us; and for a ſpirit of judgment to him that ſitteth in judgment.<note n="x" place="bottom">Iſa. xxviii.5, 6</note>
            </p>
            <p>This likewiſe ſhould be a moving conſideration to the preſent duty, that as rulers are to rule for God, we have bound ourſelves by free &amp; ſolemn oath, to help him by giving our votes as in our conſcience we judge moſt for the good of this government, without reſpect of perſons, or favour of any man. Now is ſuch an oath binding? if it is, we are guilty of a moſt aggravated crime in counteracting it:—a crime of too deep a ſtain to be eaſily effaced. Is it not to be feared this is often much too little regarded, and that favourite men and ſchemes unreaſonably biaſs our minds, and bear us away from the path of duty?</p>
            <p>To add yet farther, we do well to conſider, in the elections of this day, that we are to be ſubject unto thoſe who are by us advanced to ſeats of rule. God commands us to be ſubject to principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to obey magiſtrates; ſince this ſubjection and obedience is required of us, it highly concerns us to endeavour to promote thoſe, to whom we may chearfully ſubmit, and to whom we may do ſervice as unto the Lord.—Not that we owe paſſive and blind obedience to all their commands, without any quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication—where their commands are contray to God's we are bound in conſcience to refrain from them. When Saul told Jonathan that he ſhould ſurely die,
<pb n="20"
                   facs="unknown:010930_0011_0F852A691525B628"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
it being unjuſt, the people ſaid, <hi>As the Lord liveth, there ſhall not an hair of his head fall.</hi> It is their juſt and righteous commands which we are bound by, and if they are not ſuch, then we muſt ſee that we obey God rather than men.</p>
            <p>But finally.—We ſhould bear it upon our minds that we muſt account with God for this day's tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This ſhould be a powerful incentive to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious attendance to the ſervices of it—that God, who at one view pervades the univerſe, who ſearches the hearts, who knows all our ways, all our moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſprings of action, will ſoon call us before his aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tribunal. Let this moſt ſolemn thought, excite us to a wiſe improvement of all our advantages—to an uniform, and ſteady attendence to all the parts of our duty, and engage us now and ever to conduct in the fear of God, in the uprightneſs and integrity of our ſouls, For happy—forever happy and bleſſed will thoſe ſervants be, whom their Lord when he cometh <hi>ſhall find ſo doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now conclude with a few inferences from what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">Firſt. We from hence learn, that we ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obtain a juſt knowledge of the good accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of thoſe we elect to repreſent, and rule over us. Moſes commanded the people <hi>to take men for ſervice in the commonwealth, who were known among their tribes &amp;c.</hi> whoſe good qualifications they were well aſſured of. We act in the dark, and at too great a riſk, if ignorant of thoſe we give our voices for. If ſuch a knowledge cannot readily be obtained, 'tis worthy of labour in purſuing after it, as we can't act according to the character of moral agents in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair without a degree of it.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>But as you are unable, univerſally, to have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of perſonal acquantaince, with ſuch as you call to publick ſervice in the ſtate, you will be ready to enquire how you may attain to ſuch a knowledge? to this I reply; Not from thoſe who are leading and hot in a party; it would be even a prodigy, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a juſt and impartial character from ſuch; for we find it frequently (not to ſay univerſally) true, that of whatever party they are, they are prone to give us partial information—You may predetermine, that men to their liking will be warmly recommended to yours; and thoſe foreign from their taſte will if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, be ſowered to the taſte of every body elſe. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this is ſo frequently diſcoverable among us, we need be cautious upon whoſe recommendation we rely. There is occaſion almoſt univerſally, where parties run high, to make more or leſs abatements, as we ſee the parties characterized, prejudiced for, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe whom they characterize. It is an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which will generally bear, that in all warm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, you will find truth growing in greateſt plenty in the happy medium.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Are rulers God's miniſters, bearing his name? then we ſhould not raſhly ſpeak evil of them. We ought in regard to them, and to him who ſent them, to ſpeak of, and conduct towards them, with due reſpect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

of Moſes, that he could not practiſe it, even againſt the common adverſary. The apoſtle Jude, paints the guilt of thoſe who ſpeak evil of dignities in a crimſon dye. It is not from hence to be underſtood, that we are obliged to refrain from opening our mouths in diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving them, in order to obtain relief, ſuppoſing they are really hurtful and oppreſſive. There is a way open for us to ſeek for, and obtain deliverance, from oppreſſive and wicked rulers; the law is above the higheſt of them. But if we have occaſion at any time to proteſt againſt their meaſures, it ſhould be in the temper of meekneſs; not with haughty arrogance and clamorous bitterneſs: to pretend to judge and condemn them as evil, with our private deciſion, would be conducting, as tho' we partook of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine prerogative to pour contempt upon princes; <hi>to lead counſellors away Spoiled, and to make the judges fools.</hi> By ſpeaking reproachfully of rulers, as being weak, unfaithful or wicked, we reproach the body of the people by whom they are elected; yea, we even reproach ourſelves, being members of this body. If they conduct unjuſtly, contrary to the fundamental rules of government, they are not above the law; but in a legal method are to be pointed to the path, and rouſed to a ſenſe of duty, in that temper of charity which the goſpel is full of.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. Hence, (if the things mentioned render a perſon well accompliſhed for a ruler) 'tis evident that no particular place of abode in the community can diſqualify him. If any particular ſpot of ground can qualify for publick ſervice, then thoſe who have a laudable ambition for this ſervice, muſt with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied application ſearch for it; yea, they muſt even ſell all that they have to purchaſe it. This is too trifling a matter for the leaſt contention. Tho' a

principal ruler in the eaſtern, or weſtern part of the government, may perhaps, honor thoſe more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his preſence and breath, who dwell near his qualifing place of abode, yet of how much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance is it to all who belong to the community to be honoured, and bleſſed with his juſt and equitable adminiſtrations?</p>
            <p n="4">4th. Since every member of our corporation has an equal right with others in public rulers, we counteract equity &amp; juſtice, if in our elections we are governed by ſelf or any particular party. 'Tis manifeſt that party contentions and prejudices in any ſociety or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, are of moſt diſquieting, &amp; hurtful conſequences, and a ſmall acquaintance with our public affairs, will convince that the preſent times are not free from them—can a kingdom or houſe divided againſt itſelf ſtand? Now when apprehenſive of a fatal diſeaſe, an antidote may preſerve health and life. When the natural body is in pain; and convulſed, there is need of ſome ſpecific; ſo there is much incumbent on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, to promote the health and quietude of the political body. In theſe days of foreign &amp; domeſtic diſputes, we ſhould all (if from nothing elſe) from the principle of ſelf preſervation, be moved to throw by all party ſpirit—to caſt out this old man with his deeds, &amp; unite all our vigorous endeavovrs for the publick ſafety. The times are ſuch that we verily want the wiſeſt heads and the uprighteſt hearts; and if we and all the reſt of the freemen in this colony, could in this, be of one heart, and do nothing thro' ſtrife or partiality, we might reaſonably hope, that our peace would be as a river, and our proſperity like that of the field which the Lord hath bleſſed. <hi>But if ye bite and devour one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, take heed that ye be not conſumed one of another.</hi>

Laſtly. Let the elections of this day, raiſe your minds above the rulers of this world, to him who is the prince of the kings of the earth, and to that peaceable kingdom of his, which can never be mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; where, (if ſincerely ſubjected to him) we ſhall all be made kings and prieſts unto God, in a more glorious manner, than any whilſt here. May what has been ſaid of obedience to civil rulers, remind us of our duty in yielding conſtant obedience unto God, whoſe requirements are all without exception, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt and holy.</p>
            <p>We may make choice of ſuch to rule over us in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil matters, as may be inſtrumental in maintaining peace, and adminiſtring juſtice. But would we be juſtified before God? would we enjoy peace with God? we muſt make choice of Chriſt who is our lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and commander, and ſubmit to him as ſuch. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral rulers, may protect from temporal evils, but Chriſt, the mighty God, can ſave us from thoſe which are eternal. Rulers may likewiſe promote our preſent intereſts, but he whoſe kingdom ruleth over all, can beſtow upon us, riches eternally enduring, and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly more excellent. He is Lord over all, and all who ſubmit to him as their protector, their ſaviour, and guide, ſhall be rewarded with diſtinguiſhing and everlaſting favours.</p>
            <p>It becomes us not only to exert ouſelves for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the kingdoms of this world; but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally for the advancement of the kingdom, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the dear Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Let us all watch unto faithfulneſs, and walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God uprightly, and fulfil the duties of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective places and characters unto death, and then we ſhall receive a crown of life, which will God of his great mercy grant, in Jeſus Chriſt,</p>
