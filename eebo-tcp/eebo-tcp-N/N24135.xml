            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is with pleaſure I reflect, that the deſign of your preſent aſſociation ſo happily correſponds with the exhortation here urged by an apoſtle of Chriſt. "Does any perſon find his circumſtances eaſy and proſperous, and his mind enlivened with joy? Let him vent the grateful and joyous emotions of his heart in ſongs of praiſe." The vivacity of eaſtern nations, is ſtrongly marked in this recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, as muſic has been, and ſtill is, more practiſed among them, than thoſe of the weſt. Muſic, amongſt that ſprightly people, holds a principal place in all their feſtivals, common or religious, and never fails to attend their public proceſſions, or private excurſions for amuſement and pleaſure. Its ſoothing influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031912_0003_0FEF4D79941A7C00"/>
is equally reliſhed in the palace of the prince, and the tent of the wandering ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd. It may not be improper to remark, that the paſſage principally reſpects the muſic itſelf; this will appear from a plain tranſlation: "Is any chearful? Let him make melody." So that the precept, has more for its object, the muſic which accompanies a ſacred ſong, than the ſong itſelf.</p>
            <p>Here, then, is a divine warrant for the part you are to act on this occaſion; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to congratulate you on the propriety of your conduct in recognizing a law of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, rather than the corrupt maxims of the gay and inconſiderate part of mankind: while others haunt the theatre of folly, and aſſociate for criminal feſtivity and mirth, you nobly chuſe the more rational, but unfaſhionable, mode of expreſſing cheerfulneſs, by a courſe of harmonious praiſe to the King of Saints. While the unthinking exult at the ſound of proſtituted melody, and tread the unhallowed maze of a guilty revel, you, animated by a nobler ambition, aſpire to the pure and eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling pleaſures of ſacred harmony; and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain too high a ſenſe of the dignity of thoſe powers with which heaven has endued you, to degrade them in the ſervice of vice, however popular. Such at leaſt is the language of your preſent meeting; and happy, very happy, I may ſafely call you, if it be alſo the language of your hearts.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:031912_0004_0FEF4D17CEBA6E78"/>The obſervations I have to offer on this ſubject, may appear under the following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions:
<list>
                  <item>1. To illuſtrate the origin and nature of muſic;</item>
                  <item>2. To explain its moral obligation as a divine ordinance;</item>
                  <item>3. To enquire into its moral tendency or effects.</item>

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Muſic has its foundation in the nature of man. He is formed with powers and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities equally ſuited to invent, and perform it: to underſtand, and reliſh the eloquent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions it carries to the heart. Muſic ſeems to be a kind of univerſal language, breathing to the ear intimations clear and intelligible, addreſſing the heart with reſiſtleſs eloquence, and putting into motion all the finer ſprings of human nature. The charms of a good piece of muſic, will excite the ſame delightful ſenſations among all nations on the globe, however diverſified as to language or manners. Many curious and even fabulous things have been ſaid concerning its origin. Dr. Brown, with others, is of opinion, that man was led to the practice of vocal muſic in imitation of the birds, as they ſung their ſoft and melting ſtrains in the foreſts around him. Kircher thinks with Diadorus, that the firſt idea of this art was obtained from the noiſe of the wind

                  <p>Lucretius ſeems to unite both theſe opinions in the following lines:

               </note> Some, unſatisfied with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving it from either of theſe ſources, and unable to give a more probable account of its origin, have had recourſe to a divine interpoſition; while others profeſs themſelves wholly at a loſs to ſay how it originated. To me it ſeems the leaſt exceptionable opinion, which places the origin of muſic in the emotions of the human mind, when much rouſed and agitated by the contemplation of grand and affecting objects. Struck with the beauties and wonders of nature, man would ſpontaneouſly vent the glowing enraptured affections of his mind in poetry and ſong. When the imagination was fired, and the mind ſtrongly moved by extraordinary ſcenes, or intereſting events; when the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoul became too big for common utterance; they burſt into ſong, and overflowed in ſtrains of correſponding melody. This is
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031912_0006_0FEF4D195F11A0E8"/>
the true ſource of poetry and muſic: they were both prompted by the ſame cauſe, generated by the ſame impulſe, and blended in the ſame character. The hiſtory of theſe two arts will tell you that they began their career together, and were never ſeparated, until civilization and national improvement had made conſiderable progreſs. Hence it is, we ſee ſo ſtriking a reſemblance in the nature and effects of theſe arts; and ſuch a likeneſs, or even ſameneſs, in the terms by which they are known and deſcribed.</p>
            <p>The deſcription Milton gives of the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the firſt pair, when they awoke from ſleep, and opened their eyes on the beauties of Eden, is, I think, very natural:
<q>
                  <l>Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began</l>
                  <l>Their oriſons, each morning duly paid</l>
                  <l>in fit ſtrains pronounced or ſung</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Unmeditated,</hi> ſuch prompt eloquence</l>
                  <l>Flow'd from their lips,</l>
                  <l>More tunable than needed lute or harp</l>
                  <l>To add more ſweetneſs.</l>
               </q>
The poet ſtruck upon the true ſource of muſic, a mind ſwelled to rapture and enthuſiaſm, by the contemplation of the works of God, and unburdening itſelf in prompt, unmeditated me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody. There ſeems to be a very perceivable analogy between muſical ſounds and the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind; and a ſtriking relation in all the tones of muſic, and the various modu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the voice amongſt men in amicable
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031912_0007_0FEF4D2E352316A0"/>
intercourſe. Beauty or grandeur, in a piece of muſic, ariſes from this, that the ſounds in combination expreſs the beautiful or grand in minds, and perhaps, what is called expreſſion in this art, is ſolely owing to the relation of ſounds to mental affection.</p>
            <p>"In harmony, the very names of concord and diſcord are metaphorical, and ſuppoſe ſome analogy between the relations of ſound, to which they are figuratively applied, and the relations of minds and affections which they originally and properly ſignify. To me it ſeems, that every ſtrain in melody that is agreeable, is an imitation of the tones of the human voice in the expreſſion of ſome ſentiment or paſſion."<note n="*" place="bottom">Reid.</note> If this be accurate, it ſerves to ſhew, that muſic has its origin from mind, and alſo, that it is an art truly noble, which can only expreſs what is ſublime and lovely in the mind of man.</p>
            <p>It is proper alſo to remark the exact cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and intimate connection, ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the various paſſions of the heart, and the ſeveral airs in muſic. The diverſities of ſound, correſpond with admirable preciſion, to all the varieties of mental affection. There are the joyful, the animating, the melting, the penſive ſtrains of muſic, anſwering to the joy, the courage, the tenderneſs, and the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly of mind. But why are the different tones
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031912_0008_0FEF4CF2F3161060"/>
of muſic, and the movements of the mind, in ſuch delightful uniſon? Doubtleſs becauſe the one is the genuine offspring of the other.</p>
            <p>Again, fact proves the account I have given of the riſe of muſic to be true. In the moſt rude, untutored nations, where the agricultural and mechanic arts are almoſt unknown, it is found to be cultivated to a degree of perfection, truly aſtoniſhing. It is ſaid of the inhabitants of the Sandwich Iſlands, a people in the loweſt ſtate of ſavage barbarity, that they had attained to ſuch ſkill in the practice of muſic, as to perform in the parts with tolerable eaſe and propriety<note n="*" place="bottom">Cook's Voyages, vol. 2. p. 311. 312.</note>. However that may be, it is certain, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and manner of performing were by no means contemptible. Nor do I recollect a ſingle nation, whoſe hiſtory has reached me, ſo rude as to have had no knowledge of muſic. All have their war ſongs, dirges and hymns in praiſe of the deities they adore. And I may add too, that theſe ſongs among the Arabs, and other nations, are often the effuſions of the moment, dictated by ſuch objects, as immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately intereſt the attention. It would ſeem, that extemporary ſongs were frequent among the Children of Iſrael; of this kind appear to have been, thoſe of the daughter of Jephtha with her chorus of Virgins, celebrating her father's victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and of the Iſraelitiſh women, who went out to meet Saul and David on occaſion of a ſignal
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031912_0009_0FEF4D07D40D6858"/>
triumph over the Philiſtines, ſinging alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately:
<q>
                  <l>"Saul has ſlain his thouſands:</l>
                  <l>"And David his ten thouſands."</l>
               </q>
Upon what principle then can we account for this univerſal taſte and practice of muſic but that man was invincibly led to it, from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal make of his nature, and the circumſtances of his ſituation? It is the language of paſſion and is derivable from no other ſource.</p>
            <p>There can be no error in placing the date of muſic as coeval with the exiſtence of man, if I have been correct in ſtating its true origin. Very early in the hiſtory of human kind, we find Jubal honored, as the father of ſuch as han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the harp and organ; and there can be no doubt, that inſtrumental muſic was poſterior to that of the voice, by a conſiderable length of time. Sublime, and almoſt celeſtial we may well conceive, were the anthems of innocent beings, when creation glowed before them in the unſullied luſtre of its charms. Strains a-kin to thoſe of Seraphs, echoed through the bowers of Paradiſe, when man wore the image of his God, and nature had not languiſhed at the ſight of ſin! The lapſe of human nature, we may ſuppoſe, introduced ſome change into the muſic of mortals. 'Till then, harmony had not ſhaped itſelf to the modulations of ſorrow, nor learned to waft the ſigh of the wretched. That which once breathed the ſweet language
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031912_0010_0FEF4CFF9FE74068"/>
of holy joy and exultation, has, ſince that mournful event, poured ſorth the melting ſtrains of pity and grief. Muſic, being no longer the ſole companion of devotion and rapture, wept at the tomb of departed friends, rouſed the courage of the hero, animated the ſufferer to patience, cheered the tent of the ſhepherd, and ſoothed the ſolitude of the languiſhing ſwain. And I wiſh, for the honor of humanity, I could ſay, it had not been forced to ſpeak the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of guilty paſſion, and ſerve at the altar of impure love. Happy ſhould I be, to draw a veil over the baſe proſtitution, or blot the page that reveals the ſhame of our nature, but impartiality bids me ſay, that muſic has been degraded to the vile purpoſes of folly, luxury, and vice. And it is remarkable, that when devoted in this way, it aſſumes new appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and effects, taking the caſt of the criminal paſſions whence it ſprung, and adding redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled violence to vicious deſires and habits. We are not told how early this corruption took place, nor to what extent it was diffuſed, in the firſt ſtages of ſociety. I am willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it had not ſpread very generally, nor put on its moſt dangerous forms until nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came wealthy, powerful, and luxurious. The earlieſt annals of mankind aſſure us, that muſic was for a long ſeries of time, limited to ſacred worſhip, or other ſerious purpoſes; and the moſt ancient ſongs, to which we have acceſs, were either addreſſes to the Deity, or grave compoſitions on war, national deliverances, or
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031912_0011_0FEF4CE6E57B42B8"/>
cataſtrophies, and the various viciſſitudes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic life. According to theſe accounts, the laws, moral inſtructions, the memoirs of illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious characters, the theology, and hiſtory of nations, were in the firſt ages, ſung by their bards to the ſound of the lyre. It is ſaid of the ancient Pythagoreans, that they made mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic a ſpecial part of ſtudy, and availed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of its powerful influence to inflame the mind with the love of virtue, and rouſe it to the atchievement of noble and virtuous actions. The ſublime notion entertained by theſe phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers concerning muſic, was that the ſoul was originally formed to harmony, and that the moſt direct way to reſtore intellectual or ſpiritual harmony to the ſoul, was to have recourſe to the harmony of ſound.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rouſſeau Dictionaire de Muſique. Art. Muſique.</note> The Iſraelites were long in the habit of uſing muſic, on grave and ſolemn occaſions. When ſucceſs attended their arms, or ſome long wiſhed-for deliverance occurred; when they approached God in the ſanctuary, or obſerved a ſolemn feſtival; when they afflicted themſelves for public or private loſſes; when their prophets gave leſſons on moral ſubjects, or foretold fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture events; they never failed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

For inſtances you have only to recur to a book with which I hope you are daily converſant. There you will ſee the triumphal ſongs of Moſes, Deborah, Hannah, and others; the tender elegy of David over Saul and Jonathan; and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031912_0012_0FEF4CDD91A282D8"/>
the numerous devotional odes conſtantly ſung in the Tabernacle. There you will ſee their prophets delivering ſacred inſtructions, and uttering predictions, with the accompanyment of a tabret or pipe. That beautiful preceptive ſong, recorded Deut. 32, ſeems to have been ſung before a convention of all Iſrael, by Moſes and Hoſhea the ſon of Nun. Mention is made, 1 Sam. 10.5, of a college of prophets, who "propheſied with a pſaltery and a tabret, and a pipe;" and, while a minſtrel played before Eliſha, at his own requeſt, the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy came upon him, and he predicted, to the kings who waited on him, a ſpeedy and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhower of rain, and a remarkable victory over their enemies. And that melody frequently ſerved as a vehicle for conveying leſſons of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom, farther appears from the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Pſalmiſt: "I will incline mine ear to a parable; I will open my dark ſpeech upon a harp." I will only add, that muſic ſet to ſacred ſubjects, was very probably ſung and played by that people in their journeys to and from Jeruſalem,<note n="*" place="bottom">"Some have ſuppoſed thoſe fifteen pſalms, which are each intitled, "A Song of Degrees," relate to the aſcent of Iſrael out of the Babyloniſh captivity; may they not rather be thus marked to denote they were wont to be ſung in the journies of Iſrael up to Jeruſalem from time to time?

And it ought not to be omitted, that muſic was uſed on more private occaſions; ſuch as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic rejoicings, the parting of friends, and watching of flocks. Jer. 33.10, 11; Gen. 31.27; 1 Sam. 16.16—19; Pſal. 137. But it does not ſtrike me, that it deſerted the cauſe of virtue and religion amongſt that people, till elated with wealth and intoxicated with power. And among unpoliſhed nations, it was chiefly confined to their temples, or other intereſting ſcenes, with which their peculiar ſuperſtitions intermixed. It is not however to be concealed, that it was often practiſed in the celebration of impure rites, and ſhocking devotions, that took their complexion from the idol or deity that was worſhipped: but ſtill, it was not profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſeparated to the aid of criminal pleaſures.

            <p>The Jewiſh nation ſeems to hold the pre-eminence in the hiſtory of muſic. If their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical compoſitions bore any reſemblance to thoſe in poetry, as is juſt to ſuppoſe, we may infer much to their merit: they muſt have been bold, ſimple, and empaſſioned to a high degree. It muſt be granted, that the Hebrew poetry, for richneſs of imagery, boldneſs of colouring, dignity of ſentiment, ſimplicity, and energy of diction, ſtands unrivalled by the productions of other nations; and I muſt conclude that the ſame ſpirit which dictated thoſe inimitable odes, was capable of producing ſtrains of harmony equally excellent. As far back as the time of Moſes, we find the matrons of Iſrael, led by the propheteſs Miriam, ſing a very animated ode in the reſponſory, joining the ſound of their timbrels to the melody of their voices: and in the illuſtrious reign of David himſelf (the beſt poet and muſician of his day), not leſs than 4000 Levites were appointed to ſing hymns, &amp; exhibit on inſtruments in the ſervice of the tabernacle. From the form of the Hebrew verſe, and what is ſaid, Ezra, 3.11, of ſinging "by courſe," it is plain the manner of ſinging was reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, the ſeveral choirs anſwering alternately to each other; and I am induced to think it probable, from the diſtribution of the bands of ſingers, 1 Chron. 15. 19—23, that more than
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031912_0015_0FEF4D24973A74F8"/>
one part was wont to be ſung.<note n="*" place="bottom">There we read of one choir of ſingers appointed to ſound with cymbals of braſs, another with pſalteries on ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth, and a third with harps on the ſheminith; though it is not eaſy to ſay what is to be underſtood by the words alamoth and ſheminith; yet the moſt likely opinion is, that they both relate to the different parts of the harmony practiſed in thoſe times. In the margin of Canne's Bible, the former is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>treble.</hi> Bytaner thinks it may mean an acute manner of ſinging; and Robertſon, in his Theſaurus, ſuppoſes it refers to a part in harmony: and as to the latter, ſome authors explain it of a grave part of muſic, ſimilar to our baſs. See Bythner Proph. Ly. Pſal. 46. Robertſon's Theſ. Liag. Sanct. on the words.</note> The harmony of the Hebrews, however, was leſs complex than ours; its combinations were more ſimple and artleſs; and its expreſſion more lively, forcible, and paſſionate. Theirs was the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of nature; ours is that of art. The dignity of the eaſtern muſic, abhorred ſuch paltry refinements, as characterize the artificial and almoſt Gothic compoſitions of later times. It was the burſt of ſacred paſſion, and perhaps I might ſay, of inſpiration; for on what other principle can we account for the ſublime genius and peculiar ſtructure of the Hebrew poetry and muſic; and the purity, ſplendour, and majeſty of that worſhip they were uſed to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate, which I do not heſitate to ſay form an illuſtrious exception to all the monuments of antiquity.</p>
            <p>Some ingenious writers have inferred, that the muſic of the Hebrews could not have been very good, becauſe the preſent muſic of the eaſt is ſorry and contemptible; but I think it is not fair to determine the character of their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031912_0016_0FEF4D1C05D842F8"/>
muſic from the rude airs of a Perſian or Arab peaſant; nor yet from the more courtly ones which give entertainment to a Sultan or Baſhaw. Will any one venture to ſay there never was any good muſic in Greece, becauſe the preſent inhabitants of that country ſing and play mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably, when every perſon, acquainted with the hiſtory of the fine arts, knows the muſic of that nation to have been fine beyond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription?</p>
            <p>It has been much agitated by writers on this ſubject, whether harmony was known to the ancients. I have already ſuppoſed the Iſraelites acquainted with it, and when I find the rude Iſlander ſinging a different part, or at leaſt performing a kind of baſs with his bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boo, and when I hear the untaught African among ourſelves, attempting the ſame by ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a graver tone and beating his calabaſh in company with another performer; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive the poliſhed Greeks and Romans to have been ignorant of harmony. They whoſe muſic produced ſuch aſtoniſhing effects, muſt have underſtood its ſweeteſt energies and moſt pathetic combinations. To aſcertain what was the nature of Grecian harmony, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt a deſideratum in the hiſtory of muſic, and were it done, might produce the happieſt effects in correcting the falſe notions and worſe taſte which have long been entertained on that ſubject. "An enquiry into the nature and merit of the ancient muſic, and a compariſon thereof with modern compoſition, by a perſon

of poetic genius, and an admirer of harmony, who is free from the ſhackles of practice, and prejudices of the mode, aided by the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a few men of elevated and true taſte, would probably lay the preſent half gothic mode in ruins, like thoſe towers, of whoſe little laboured ornaments it is an exact picture, and reſtore the Grecian taſte of paſſionate harmony once more, to the delight and wonder of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind."<note n="*" place="bottom">Uſher.</note> Whatever was its ſtructure, we muſt ſuppoſe it to have been ſimple, pathetic and deſcriptive to an aſtoniſhing degree. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of modern compoſitions, have led ſome men of taſte to deny the propriety of harmony altogether; but for this I cannot ſee ſo much as the ſhadow of reaſon; for if it be conſidered, that man, of all this lower creation, alone poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes powers capable of harmony, and that the original differences of the human voice, are ſuch as to intimate, that men were never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſing the ſame part, the varieties of pitch in male and female voices, being in that exact proportion which is requiſite for making good harmony, there can be no ground for queſtioning its propriety.</p>
            <p>To underſtand the nature of muſic more perfectly, we muſt advert particularly to its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Such is the frame of our nature, that the different tones of muſic excite emotions congenial with themſelves. Deep and grave airs, fill the mind with awe and reverence; the elevated and ſprightly, generate joy and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;

            <p>Nor is it at all ſtrange that muſic, which is the echo of the paſſions, and ſeems to poſſeſs the power of deſcription, ſhould thus powerfully and variouſly impreſs the heart, when every lively repreſentation of human affections, in oratory, painting, or poetry, will awaken thoſe very ſenſations imaged by it. There ſeems to be ſomething like muſical painting or deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. "The moſt elevated ſenſation of muſic, ſays Uſher, ariſes from a confuſed perception of ideal or viſionary beauty, and rapture, which is ſufficiently perceivable to fire the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not clear enough to become an object of knowledge. This ſhadowy beauty of the mind attempts, with languiſhing curioſity, to collect into a diſtinct object of view and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; but ſinks and eſcapes like the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving ideas of a delightful dream, that are neither within the reach of memory, nor yet totally fled." What this elegant author attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes chiefly to the ſenſations produced in mind by muſic, would, with more accuracy, apply to thoſe confuſed viſions or ſhadowy repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of paſſions or things it ſeems capable of giving.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:031912_0019_0FEF4CECD5C70708"/>But it is to be obſerved, though muſic has the power of exciting all human affections, by the pictures it preſents to the mind, yet it never inſpires any that are not of the virtuous and ennobling caſt, if not perverted from its original purity. It is friendly to every paſſion which forms the dignity and happineſs of human kind. It ſweetens the temper, refines and ennobles the mind, and elevates the powers of the ſoul to the contemplation and love of moral beauty. Even when the emotions produced by it are gay and pleaſant, they are not dangerous to virtue: and it is the ſingular property of this art, to infuſe a certain ſweetneſs with every ſpecies of ſenſation it produces. To the pangs of ſympathetic woe, it adds a ſecret delight, and makes even the glooms of melancholy pleaſing: its pains, its ſorrows, its rage, have ſomething gentle and charming in their nature.</p>

            <p>Thus this delightful art tends directly to promote the glory of man, and diffuſe joy and happineſs around. Polybius ſays, that muſic was neceſſary to ſweeten the manners of the Arcadians, a people famed in ſong, on account that the air of their country was cold and gloomy; and remarks, that the inhabitants of Cynaetha, who neglected to cultivate muſic, were notorious for their cruelty and vices, above all other Greeks. And Plato ſuppoſed the power of ſound to be ſo great, that either the virtues or vices of the ſoul might be created by it; and

            </p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs to obſerve ſome things concerning the indirect influence of muſic to promote our happineſs. It not only baniſhes or mitigates the cares and diſquietudes of life, but poſſeſſes a ſurpriſing power over that black groupe of depraved paſſions that agitate the breaſt of man: Malice, envy, rage, anger, and a thirſt of revenge, thoſe demons that ravage the empire of the heart, and aim at deſolating the globe, die away before the ſacred magic of ſound. Of its influence over melancholy, you have a fine inſtance in ſacred hiſtory, where it is ſaid, the evil ſpirit which troubled Saul, gave way to the charms of David's lyre. Seneca and others, mention of Mecenas, that having drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out three ſleepleſs years, through care and anxiety of mind, he was at laſt reſtored to health and tranquility by muſic, performed at a diſtance.<note n="†" place="bottom">Campbell's Diſq. de Muſ. effec.</note> And the records of pathology, give many inſtances of ancient and modern times, wherein muſic has been ſucceſsful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving melancholy, madneſs, and even the moſt obſtinate diſeaſes of the body.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That muſic is to make a part of man's adoration to the Supreme Being, will appear from a few conſiderations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:031912_0021_0FEF4CDA86C47BA0"/>If it be a common ſentiment among men, that the Deity ſhould be praiſed with audible harmony; if the foundation of muſic be deep laid in the nature of man; if it be the exalted exerciſe of heavenly intelligences, and if there be expreſs ſcripture authority for it; then the concluſion forces itſelf upon us, that it is of divine appointment, and our obligations to obſerve it become indubitable.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen already, that muſic makes a part of the religious worſhip of all nations, and that it was originally limited to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: I would then aſk, why this deep-rooted and univerſally prevalent ſentiment, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to muſic's being a proper inſtrument of praiſe to the Deity? From one of theſe cauſes doubtleſs; either man was prompted to it from ſome inſtinctive impreſſion made upon his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or reaſon and the light of nature, clearly enunciated as to its propriety, or an expreſs declaration from heaven, enjoined it; either of which ſuppoſitions infers obligation</p>
            <p>Again, has muſic its origin in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our nature? Has God given us powers capable of performing it in honour of himſelf, and receiving the moſt refined pleaſure and improvement from it, and all this in vain?— Then we poſſeſs powers, and peculiarities of nature, which may not be employed in the ſervice of our Creator, or they are beſtowed upon us for mockery and inſult! But who does not ſhudder at ſuch an inference!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:031912_0022_0FEF4CE391ACB050"/>But does not muſic make a part of celeſtial worſhip? Yes, with crowns of everlaſting joy upon their heads, and pſalms of triumph in their hands, the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, ſhout forth the exulting anthem, "Salvation to our God, who ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb," while adoring Seraphs, anſwer in rapturous acclamation, "Bleſſing and glory, and wiſdom, and thankſgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever." Rev. 7.9—13. "And I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, ſaying, Alleluia; ſalvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:—And I heard the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, ſaying, Alleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth," &amp;c. Rev. 19.1—10. In this remarkable paſſage, we have not only a repreſentation of the church triumphant, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating the praiſe of her Redeemer, but alſo of the church on earth, taking up the joyful theme, and imitating her jubilant ſtrains; ſo that it is impoſſible for us to miſtake our duty when we have ſuch illuſtrious models, and ſo plain an example for our imitation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, our obligation to uſe muſic in praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, ariſes out of direct ſcripture authority: "Praiſe ye the Lord, for it is good to ſing praiſes unto our God; for it is pleaſant, and praiſe is comely—Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſdom, teaching and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing one another in pſalms and hymns

and ſpiritual ſongs—And a voice came out from the throne, ſaying, praiſe our God, all ye his ſervants, and ye that fear him, both ſmall and great." Add to this, the concurring example of all the worthies, whoſe lives are ſketched in ſcripture, and eſpecially the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our bleſſed Lord, whom we revere as our pattern and our judge: "And when they had ſung an hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives."</p>
            <p n="3">III. I now come to ſpeak of the moral tendency or effects of muſic.</p>
            <p>And firſt, permit me to obſerve, that a very important effect appears to be informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conviction. By the proper union of poetry and muſic, truth muſt be borne with almoſt reſiſtleſs energy to the underſtanding and heart. The law of our nature is ſuch, that unleſs the underſtanding be enlightened by truth, no conviction or impreſſion can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Sacred harmony, like every other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, being adapted to the laws of human nature, addreſſes man as a rational creature, by enlightening the mind, while it rouſes and intereſts the feelings of the heart.— Hence we ſee the force of the Apoſtle's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, "I will ſing with the ſpirit, and I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo:" He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood human nature too well, to ſuppoſe any valuable or permanent effect would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by pſalmody, unleſs the mind had a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct perception of truth. To teach, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031912_0024_0FEF4CFA02C59458"/>
in pſalms, hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, alſo implies, that a principal deſign of pſalmody is, to enlighten and convince. When a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſong, or hymn, embracing the truths of Chriſtianity in their purity, is attended by the pathetic expreſſion of correſponding ſounds, it is preſumed, the happy reſult will be a deep and penetrating conviction, or belief of their reality and importance. Is it poſſible, the ſublime, the moving, the animating doctrines of the croſs, which repreſent the glories of the divine character and government, the wonders of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming love, the native guilt and miſery of man, the dignity and felicity to which he is advanced by grace, with all the auguſt ſcenes of a future ſtate, can be addreſſed to the heart, by the eloquence of ſound, without effect? It is not probable—So far as a natural mean can influence, the ſinner muſt tremble; the ſaint muſt rejoice! And if conviction be not gained, nothing is done to purpoſe; without this a thoughtleſs world will ſleep ſecure; without this the pious will want comfort and edification. I wiſh not to be miſtaken here; when I ſpeak of information and conviction being effectuated by pſalmody, I mean nothing more than that it becomes ſo, under a ſuperior agency. It is the bleſſed comforter alone who can convince of ſin, righteouſneſs, and judgment; but ſtill, it muſt be allowed, he does ſo by co-operating with the means of his own appointment. If then pſalmody be a divine ordinance, and if it be a forcible method of conveying truth to the mind, I think it unqueſtionable that ſuch will
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031912_0025_0FEF4CE20588DAD8"/>
be its tendency.<note n="*" place="bottom">Inſtances are known to the Author, of perſons who date their firſt ſerious impreſſions from having heard others ſing a hymn or pſalm; and he has been witneſs to very happy effects which followed the introduction of harmony and evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical pſalmody, in ſeveral congregations. The ſame can be atteſted, it is believed, by others who have been careful to make obſervations on the effects of ſacred harmony in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others.</note> Were I to attribute the ſame effects to pulpit oratory, no perſon would think it exceptionable. To me it ſeems clear and deciſive, that pſalmody in the primitive church, was a kind of muſical oratory uttered extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore, for the expreſs purpoſe of inſtruction.— A very accurate obſerver<note n="†" place="bottom">Harmer.</note> on ſcripture, thinks the apoſtle refers to extemporary devotional ſongs in 1 Cor. 14. 26—"Every one of you hath a pſalm;" and adds, "the pſalms, the hymns, and the odes, mentioned by Saint Paul, in his epiſtle to the Coloſſians (ch. 3.16), were ſuppoſed to be of the ſame extemporary kind, for they were to be the vehicles of appropriate inſtruction and admonition." And I am of opinion, the ſame is implied, Eph. 5.19— "Speaking to yourſelves in pſalms, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs; ſinging and making me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody in your hearts to the Lord;" where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like an inſtructive recitative is probably meant.<note n="‡" place="bottom">The hymn ſung by our Lord and his diſciples after the ſupper, the ſongs of Zecharias, Mary and Elizabeth, the ſong which attended Chriſt's triumphal entrance into Jeruſalem, and the one ſung by the apoſtles and the whole church, Acts 4.24—31, were alſo, I apprehend, of the extempore kind, and very probably ſung in the manner above deſcribed.</note> And if I recollect right, it is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral opinion of commentators, that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive hymns and odes were commonly prompt
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031912_0026_0FEF4CF6E51F3450"/>
extemporaneous effuſions, under the afflatus of the Holy Spirit, muſically pronounced or ſung for mutual inſtruction; and if ſo, the object of pſalmody, as well as oratory, is to inſtruct and perſuade.</p>
            <p>Again, it is the tendency of pſalmody to promote purity of heart, and the comforts of piety. Whatever carries divine truth to the heart, muſt be allowed to have ſuch a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: "And ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free—Sanctify them thro' thy truth; thy word is truth—We are choſen through ſanctification of the ſpirit and belief of the truth—Whatſoever was written, afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, was written for our inſtruction, that we through patience and comfort of the ſcriptures might have hope." Theſe ſcriptures teach us, that holineſs and comfort come through a knowledge of ſacred truth. How happy and powerful a method then muſt that be, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing theſe effects, which carries the truths of revelation to the mind by the perſuaſive ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of harmonious ſound. It has been already ſaid, that muſic alone has power to excite all the various affections of the mind, and to ſoften and humanize the diſpoſition; is it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore allowable to ſuppoſe the moſt forcible and vivid impreſſions will be made, and the moral improvement of our nature beſt anſwered, when it becomes the vehicle of divine truth? There is perhaps no holy affection, which may not, with the concurrence of a divine influence, be
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031912_0027_0FEF4D13C103EB10"/>
excited, enlarged, improved, or refined, by the aid of harmony. By this the ſoul is elevated to tranſport and exultation, when the goodneſs and faithfulneſs of God, the glories of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, the fullneſs and ſtability of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or the future rewards of virtue, is the theme; by this it melts in grateful ſorrows for its numerous ſins and follies, and ſinks in loweſt proſtration before its God; by this it rouſes to indignation againſt ſin: and burns with gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ardour in the ſpiritual warfare; yes, by this divineſt conſolations are inſpired, and the heart moulded into the ſweetneſs of piety. The Prophet connects the joy and melody of Zion in the ſame deſcription: "Joy and gladneſs ſhall be found therein, thankſgiving and the voice of melody."—Iſa. 51.3. The ſoothing influence of divine muſic, in the dark hour of affliction, was well underſtood by him who ſaid, "In the night his ſong ſhall be with me; —thy ſtatutes have been my ſongs in the houſe of my pilgrimage," Pſal. 42.8—119.54; and Paul and Silas, at midnight, forgot their pains, and relieved the horrors of confinement, by chanting forth the praiſes of God. "Sacred muſic, under proper regulations, removes the hindrances of our devotion, cures the diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our thoughts, and baniſhes wearineſs from our minds. It adds ſolemnity to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſervice, raiſes all the devout paſſions in the ſoul, and cauſes our duty to become our delight. "Of the pleaſures of heaven," ſays the eloquent and elegant Biſhop Atterbury, "nothing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is revealed to us, than that they conſiſt in
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031912_0028_0FEF4D012FAFD320"/>
the practice of Holy Muſic, and Holy Love; the joint enjoyment of which, we are told, is to be the happy lot of all pious ſouls, to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ages."<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Horne.</note> In ſhort, it is the tendency of this exalted part of worſhip, to ſoothe, gladden, and animate the pious in this valley of weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to ſoften and mitigate the cares and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of life; to raiſe the mind above the world, and fill it with the contemplation of divine and eternal objects; and to move all the ſublimer paſſions of devotion, and give us a foretaſte of the bleſſedneſs of heaven, "Praiſe is our moſt excellent work; a work common to the church triumphant and militant, and which lifts us up into communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Angels. The matter about which it is converſant, is always the perfections of God's nature; and the act itſelf is the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ours."<note n="†" place="bottom">Atterbury.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It may be proper, before I retire from the ſubject, to make a few reflections, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſuggeſt themſelves upon a review of what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>The firſt obſervation I ſhall make is, that church muſic ſhould be ſimple and adapted to the matter of the pſalm or hymn to which it is ſung. If muſic want ſimplicity, it may gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the ear, or agreeably agitate the fancy; but will never reach the heart, or make deep and pungent impreſſions. It is only the ſtrong and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031912_0029_0FEF4D0C149FC518"/>
manly tones which accord to nature itſelf, that have ſufficient energy and pathos to do this.— Nor is ſimplicity at all incompatible with that variety of modulation and expreſſion, which is neceſſary to move the ſeveral paſſions; ſo far from this, that it conſtitutes the very eſſence of the ſublime and affecting in muſic. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent taſte, which admires nothing ſo much as complex, elaborate, and fantaſtic productions, is certainly falſe, and vitiated in a high degree. We can ſcarcely hear a piece of muſic in the modern ſtyle, without obſerving all the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of language, and all the charms and graces of poetry, horribly mangled and disfigured: no attention is paid to emphaſis, cadence, or pronunciation; the ear is cloyed with endleſs repetition, or confuſed by a crowd of different words or ſentences, aſſailing it at once.<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader will find ſome excellent obſervations on modern muſic made by Dr. Franklin in a letter to his brother. Columbian Magazine, vol. 2, p. 97.</note> When a particle or ſome unemphatic word, perhaps an unaccented ſyllable, is drawled to a ſynco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of ſeveral bars, or mouthed into many ſyllables through a long ſlur; and when the ſame words, ſentence, or piece of a ſentence, is bandied about in quick ſucceſſion, through a great part of the tune, accented by one part and not by the others, or pronounced by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts at different times; that man's taſte muſt be ſtrangely depraved, who can reliſh the performance.<note n="†" place="bottom">The greater part of what is called <hi>fugueing</hi> tunes, are notorious for the defects above mentioned, and are therefore unworthy of being admired or practiſed; not only becauſe they want ſimplicity, and are difficult to be performed, but chiefly becauſe they do not anſwer the deſign of pſalmody, which is to inform and impreſs the mind. There is ſo much confuſion in the management of theſe pieces, that a hearer cannot underſtand what is ſung, and the ſingers themſelves muſt have their attention very much divided. Though I would diſcountenance the <hi>fugue,</hi> yet obſervation convinces me that <hi>ſolos</hi> may have a fine effect. Tartini gives an account of prodigious effects that took place not only among the muſicians themſelves, but among all the ſpectators, from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

conform to the poetry in its genius and ſpirit, modern compoſers ſeem to ſtudy ſound only, without regard to the ſacrifice they make of ſenſe, and the beauties of poetic compoſition. What has been ſaid of ſtyle, may be ſaid of muſic with equal propriety:
<q>
                  <l>"'Tis not enough no harſhneſs give offence,</l>
                  <l>"The ſound ſhould be an echo to the ſenſe."</l>
                  <bibl>POPE.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Muſical ſounds ſhould breathe the ſame paſſionate language with the poetry, paint the ſame ſcenes and paſſions, and in ſhort, echo its very ſpirit to the ſoul; but this will never be done by the ſpruce fopperies, and laboured conceits, of the faſhionable muſic. Nothing can be more improper, than the introduction of ſuch compoſitions into the harmony of the church. Plato would not tolerate muſic in his republic, and I cheerfully give my vote for baniſhing this kind of it from the Chriſtian republic. Were this a mere matter of taſte, I ſhould think it unneceſſary to trouble you with ſuch obſervations; but when I conſider the connexion of muſic with practical religion. I
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031912_0031_0FEF4D1F07995000"/>
cannot let ſo far an opportunity paſs, without remarking upon the injurious tendency of the reigning taſte in muſic. The leaſt obſervation will teach you, that the muſic which is now moſt in eſteem, is not calculated to produce, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to counteract, the effects I have attributed to pſalmody. Where there is ſuch needleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, ſuch violation of emphaſis and pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,<note n="*" place="bottom">Were it poſſible to make the muſical emphaſis movable, ſo that it could be varied at pleaſure to ſuit the pronunciation of the poetry, or could it be omitted when it fell on an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper word, it would be a great improvement in ſinging; but as this cannot be done by ſingers in general, compoſers ought to avoid as much as in their power ſlurs, ſyncopations, and printed notes, in tunes that are to be ſung to more than one ſet of verſes.</note> ſuch confuſion in the words ſung, and ſuch groſſneſs,<note n="†" place="bottom">The harmony of the tunes commonly printed and taught is too clumſy: it deſtroys the expreſſion and drowns the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody of the ſong-part altogether; and indeed many of them have nothing like melody in any part. There ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways one part tuneful, and the others ſhould be ſo conſtructed as to give force to the melody. Doctor Madan's pieces have ſingular merit in this reſpect; in them the melody ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominates, and is promoted by the harmony of the other parts but they are too refined and difficult to be generally uſeful.</note> (I know not better how to expreſs myſelf), in the harmony, there can be nothing like inſtruction or edification. Beſides, the grandeur and intereſting nature of divine ſubjects, by no means comport with over-nice and complicated ſtrains. Here let me correct a ſentiment, which though popular and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by ſome venerable names, is nevertheleſs wrong: "That we ſhould take the Devil's tunes and convert them to a religious uſe." Is it not of all things the moſt prepoſterous, to apply
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031912_0032_0FEF4D21D6F7CE78"/>
the frivolous unmeaning airs of the opera or the army, to the ſublime and awfully auguſt doctrines of our holy religion? Can tunes, which are the mere froth of criminal paſſions, and only ſerve to inflame impure deſire, ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo far regenerated, as to be inſtrumental in lighting up a flame of ſacred paſſions in the ſoul? And is it not the direct way to depreciate divine truths, and leſſen their influence upon the mind, to introduce them into the ſanctuary?<note n="*" place="bottom">A rage for muſic of this deſcription, has given birth to a variety of hymns of the ſame complexion, which to me are extremely diſguſting. In many printed collections, we ſee a number of worthleſs compoſitions on ſacred ſubjects, to <hi>God ſave the King, Gentle murmur, Cupid God of ſoft perſuaſion,</hi> and other tunes of the ſame ſtamp. To ſing a low paltry hymn to a light trifling tune, ſo far from educating a devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſpirit, does neceſſarily diſſipate the mind, and baniſh from it every thing of a ſerious nature. The remarks I have taken the liberty to make, are not intended to ſuggeſt, that all the muſic which is out of the church, is neceſſarily unchaſte: I admire the ſimplicity and ſprightlineſs of many of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and ballad tunes; but though they may have their uſe, I cannot ſuppoſe they ever can be ſo baptized as to be perfectly Chriſtian, or ſuitable to the majeſty of divine ſubjects.</note> I do not mean, however, to paſs an indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate cenſure upon all the muſical productions of our own or paſt times, which may have reached us; there are a ſufficient number of them free from the exceptions I have made, and from their ſimplicity and pathos are juſtly entitled to the Poet's deſcription:
<q>
                  <l>"Untwiſting all the chains that tie</l>
                  <l>"The hidden ſoul of harmony."</l>
                  <bibl>MILTON.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But tunes may be truly excellent, and yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly applied: to ſing a briſk animating air,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031912_0033_0FEF4D27DEA809A8"/>
to a mournful theme, or a plaintive one to a joyful ſubject, is very unnatural, and tends very much to deſtroy the influence of both the muſic and the poetry. Thoſe who conduct this part of worſhip, ſhould be careful to ſelect tunes that are adapted to the nature of the ſubject about to be ſung.</p>
            <p>Again, I infer the neceſſity of acquiring ſo much knowledge of muſic, as to be able to practiſe it with eaſe and propriety. It is not wonderful, that the moral effects of muſic are ſo inconſiderable, when we conſider the poor, pitiful manner, in which it is performed. I mean not to reflect upon pious, well-thinking people, who have never had an opportunity for improvement in ſinging; but when none but a ſingle part is ſung, and that in a drowſy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilful manner; when a few hackneyed tunes, are droned out in diſmal accents to all ſubjects indiſcriminately; and when the whole ſervice is interrupted till the chief muſician reads, or rather dolefully cants, out the line; what edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication can be expected? How baſe and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal is ſuch negligence! All muſt grant that God has endued us with powers to reliſh and execute harmony; I would then enquire for what purpoſes were they beſtowed? Was it that they might be abandoned, to the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wanton themes, or at beſt, to the uſe of idle amuſements? Or was it that they ſhould be ſacred and appropriate to the ſervice of their great author? Every honeſt heart knows the anſwer! The truth is, God has given theſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031912_0034_0FEF4D12304160D8"/>
in truſt, and commanded us to occupy till he come; if we then ſuffer them to lie unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, when we enjoy means for their culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or wickedly pervert them to an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uſe, we may expect, as "wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants, to be caſt into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs," no more to hear the gladdening voice of harmony, but the dire diſcord of "weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth" forever.— "Curſed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth and ſacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing." Mal. 1.14. Hear it and tremble, ye that neglect to cultivate your powers of harmony; hear it and tremble, ye that impiouſly dare to profane muſic, at a guilty revel, or the midnight debauch! "Wo unto them that riſe up early in the morning, that they may follow ſtrong drink, that continue until night, till wine inflame them. And the harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe, and wine are in their feaſts: but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither conſider the operation of his hands. Therefore hell hath enlarged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and opened her mouth without meaſure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, ſhall deſcend into it." Iſai. 5.11—15.</p>
            <p>I further obſerve, that the Chriſtian's amuſement ought to conſiſt in ſacred muſic.— This may perhaps appear ſtrange and novel to the gay part of my audience, but it is many centuries ſince the doctrine was taught: it is as
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031912_0035_0FEF4D2625291790"/>
old as the apoſtolic age; "Is any merry? Let him ſing pſalms." I know the maxim is not likely to be popular, but I ſhall not bluſh to eſpouſe or practiſe it, while I find it in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred volume. Much has been ſaid in praiſe of various kinds of recreation, but I have never ſeen any thing to convince me, that thoſe gay ſcenes called amuſements, are either profitable or ſafe for the Chriſtian; and ſhould he indulge in them, he will find he treads unhallowed ground, and breathes an air that chills the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors of his piety. What amuſement can ſo ſweetly unbend a pious mind, when fatigued by the cares and buſtle of life, or qualify it for the returns of buſineſs, as the pleaſant exerciſe of chanting a ſong of Zion, in concert with a well-choſen inſtrument? What can make the intervals of active life ſo delightfully entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cauſe our vacant hours to glide ſo ſoftly away, as the raviſhing drains of ſacred harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? Duty, pleaſure and recreation, would then unite; a union very rare in moſt other amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! Did Chriſtians thus relieve the fatigues of labour and buſineſs, we would ſoon ſee the happieſt conſequences reſulting from it: the practical knowledge of muſic would abound; a ſweet favor of piety and ſolid joy, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven the domeſtic circle; and beauty, order, and harmony, become conſpicuous in our churches. "The pious Mr. Nicholas exhibited, in the laſt century, an inſtance of a Proteſtant family, in which a conſtant courſe of pſalmody was appointed, and ſo ſtrictly kept up, that, through the whole four and twenty hours of
