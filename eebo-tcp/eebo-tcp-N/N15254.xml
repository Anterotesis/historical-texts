            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE deſign of this Third Part of the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Inſtitute of the Engliſh Language, is to furniſh common Engliſh Schools with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of exerciſes for reading and ſpeaking, at a ſmall expence. Colleges and Academies are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſupplied with many excellent collections for this purpoſe; among which, the <hi>Art of Speaking, Enfield's Speaker, Enfield's Exerciſes, the Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the Young Gentleman and Lady's Monitor,</hi> are uſed with great reputation. But theſe are too large and expenſive for the body of the people to purchaſe, who cannot afford a ſchool for their children but a few months in a year. The want of ſome ſmall books of this kind, has confined moſt of our ſchools to the uſe of the Bible, the ſize of which and the ſmallneſs of the type, has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned diſtinct portions of it, particularly the Pſalms and the New Teſtament, to be printed ſeparately on a larger type. But to the common and ſole uſe of the Bible or any part of it in ſchools, there are two capital objections.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, the ſtyle is ſo uniform and ſo different from that of the preſent age, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who are confined to it, never acquire a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete knowledge of words, and of the modern manne, of writing, to read other books with tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable propriety.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, it has often been obſerved by men of piety, that ſuch a common uſe of the Bible, is a kind of proſtitution of divine truth to ſecular purpoſes—that children are inſenſibly led, by a habit of familiarity, to conſider that ſacred work, or at leſt to treat it as a book of no more
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019364_0003_0FAB4B1E97B82C90"/>
importance than any human perſormance; and that, being accuſtomed in early life to repeat it often, and many times with the utmoſt reluctance, they imbibe a diſguſt for it, which their ſubſequent conviction of its importance, is ſeldom able to conquer. If therefore the Bible were read two or three times in a week, with that ſeriouſneſs it deſerves, and its precepts explained by the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, merely with a view to impreſs, upon young minds, moral and religious truths, there is no doubt but ſuch a uſe would have a more perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent effect upon the principles and conduct of poſterity, and the awful ſolemnities of inſpiration would eſcape profanation, from the levity and wickedneſs of ſchool-boys.<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſubit it theſe ideas to the feelings of every perſon. For my part I freely own that I have often ſhuddered at the ſight of thoughtleſs boys, laughing while they mention the name of Jehovah, and repeating the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations of divine mercy and the denunciations of infinite wrath, with the ſame indifference as they would rehearſe an unimportant paragraph of a news paper.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the following work, I have endeavoured to make ſuch a collection of eſſays as ſhould form the morals as well as improve the knowledge of youth.</p>
            <p>Of the pieces here ſelected, ſome are borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Britiſh writers of eminence—ſome are fugitive American publications—ſome are taken from the manuſcripts of my friends—and a few are my own compoſition. Whenever I have been indebted to Engliſh books I have invariably given credit to the author or compiler.</p>
            <p>It is found by experience that Dialogues, as bearing a near reſemblance to the common talk
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019364_0004_0FAB4B1F59326C98"/>
of children, are the beſt calculated to prevent or break ill habits of reading, and to teach them an eaſy unaffected pronunciation. This will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the number admitted into this collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In the choice of pieces, I have not been inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the political intereſts of America. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of thoſe maſterly addreſſes of Congreſs, written at the commencement of the late revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, contain ſuch noble, juſt and independent ſentiments of liberty and patriotiſm, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help wiſhing to transfuſe them into the breaſts of the riſing generation.</p>
            <p>This part completes the ſyſtem I had propoſed to publiſh for the uſe of ſchools. To refine and eſtabliſh our language, to facilitate the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grammatical knowledge, and diffuſe the principles of virtue and patriotiſm, is the taſk I have laboured to perform; and whether the ſucceſs ſhould equal my wiſhes or not, I ſhall ſtill have the ſatisfaction of reflecting that I have made a laudable effort to advance the happineſs of my country.</p>

               <head>RULE I. Let your articulation be clear and diſtinct.</head>
               <p>A GOOD articulation conſiſts in giving every letter and ſyllable, its proper proportion of ſound.</p>
               <p>Let each ſyllable and the letters which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, be pronounced with a clear voice, without whining, drawling, liſping, ſtammering, mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in the throat or ſpeaking through the noſe. Avoid equally a dull, drawling habit and too much rapidity of pronunciation; for each of theſe faults deſtroys a diſtinct articulation.</p>

               <head>RULE II. Obſerve the ſtops and make the proper pauſes, but make no pauſe where the ſenſe requires none.</head>
               <p>The characters we uſe as ſtops are extremely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and do not-always mark a ſuſpenſion of the voice. On the contrary, they are often employed to ſeparate the ſeveral members of a period, and ſhow the grammatical conſtruction. Nor when they are deſigned to mark pauſes, do they always determine the length of thoſe pauſes; for this depends much on the ſenſe and the nature of the ſubject. A ſemicolon, for example, requires a longer pauſe in a grave diſcourſe, than in a lively and ſpirited declamation. However, as children

            </div>
            <div n="3" type="rule">
               <head>RULE III. Pay the ſtricteſt attention to accent, emphaſis and cadence.</head>
               <p>Let the accented ſyllables be pronounced with a proper ſtreſs of voice; the unaccented, with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtreſs of voice, but diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>The important words of a ſentence, which I call naturally emphatical, have a claim to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable force of voice; but particles, ſuch as, <hi>of, to, as, and,</hi> &amp;c. require no force of utterance, unleſs they happen to be emphatical, which is rarely the caſe. No perſon can read or ſpeak well, unleſs he underſtands what he reads; and the ſenſe will always determine what words are emphatical. It is a matter of the higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence therefore, that a ſpeaker ſhould clearly comprehend the meaning of what he delivers, that he may know where to lay the emphaſis. This may be illuſtrated by a ſingle example. This ſhort queſtion, <hi>Will you ride to town to day?</hi> is capable of four different meanings, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019364_0007_0FAB4B305FFD06A0"/>
quently of four different anſwers, according to the placing of the emphaſis. If the emphaſis is laid upon <hi>you,</hi> the queſtion is, whether <hi>you</hi> will ride to town or <hi>another perſon.</hi> If the emphaſis is laid on <hi>ride,</hi> the queſtion is, whether you will <hi>ride</hi> or go on <hi>foot.</hi> If the emphaſis is laid on <hi>town,</hi> the queſtion is, whether you will ride to <hi>town</hi> or to <hi>another place.</hi> If the emphaſis is laid on <hi>to day,</hi> the queſtion is, whether you will ride <hi>to day</hi> or ſome <hi>other day.</hi> Thus the whole mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a phraſe often depends on the emphaſis; and it is abſolutely neceſſary that it ſhould be laid on the proper words.</p>

               <p>But in interrogative ſentences, the ſenſe often requires the cloſing word or ſyllable to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with an elevated voice. This, however, is only when the laſt word is emphatical; as in this queſtion, "Betraveſt thou the ſon of man with a kiſs?"

               <p>The moſt natural pitch of voice is that in which we ſpeak in ordinary converſation. Whenever the voice is raiſed above this key, pronunciation is difficult and fatiguing.

                  <hi>Geſtures</hi> are the various motions of the hands or body which correſpond to the ſeveral ſentiments and paſſions which the ſpeaker deſigns to expreſs.</p>
               <p>All theſe ſhould be perfectly natural. They ſhould be the ſame which we uſe in common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. A ſpeaker ſhould endeavour to feel what he ſpeaks; for the perfection of reading and ſpeaking is, to pronounce the words as if the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents were our own.</p>

But if he utters the ſentiments of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and kindneſs, his countenance ſhould put on a ſmile, his eye-lids ſhould be drawn nearer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether than uſual, and his voice ſhould be ſoft and inviting: An example of the firſt we have in theſe words, "Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his Angels." An example of the latter, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,—"Come, Ye bleſſed of my father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world." And the perſon, who pronounces theſe two ſentences with the ſame voice, looks and geſtures, muſt be a total ſtranger to the rules of reading and oratory.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe with words all the various paſſions that affect us; they can be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only from obſerving perſons under the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them.</p>
               <p>All good ſpeaking muſt ariſe from feeling; and when we would utter with propriety the words of another perſon, we ſhould endeavour as much as poſſible to put ourſelves in his place and make his ſentiments our own.

               <p>THE latter part of a wiſe man's life is taken up in curing the follies, prejudices, and falſe opinions he had contracted in the former.</p>
               <p>Cenſure is the tax a man pays to the public for being eminent.</p>
               <p>Very few men, properly ſpeaking, live at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but are providing to live another time.</p>
               <p>Party is the madneſs of many, for the gain of a few.</p>
               <p>To endeavour to work upon the vulgar with fine ſenſe, is like attempting to hew blocks of marble with a razor.</p>
               <p>Superſtition is the ſpleen of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>He who tells a lie is not ſenſible how great a taſk he undertakes; for he muſt be forced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent twenty more to maintain that one.</p>
               <p>Some people will never learn any thing, for this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>aſon, becauſe they underſtand every thing too ſoon.</p>
               <p>There is nothing wanted to make all rational and diſintereſted people in the world of one reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but that they ſhould talk together every day.</p>
               <p>Men are grateful, in the ſame degree that they are reſentful.</p>
               <p>Young men are ſubtle arguers; the cloak of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019364_0020_0FAB4B532494CEA0"/>
honour covers all their faults, as that of paſſion all their follies.</p>
               <p>Economy is no diſgrace; it is better living on a little, than out-living a great deal.</p>
               <p>Next to the ſatisfaction I receive in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of an honeſt man, I am beſt pleaſed with the confuſion of a raſcal.</p>
               <p>What is often termed ſhyneſs, is nothing more than refined ſenſe, and an indifference to common obſervations.</p>
               <p>Every perſon inſenſibly fixes upon ſome degree of refinement in his diſcourſe, ſome meaſure of thought which he thinks worth exhibiting. It is wiſe to fix this pretty high, although it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions one to talk the leſs.</p>
               <p>To endeavour all one's days to fortify our minds with learning and philoſophy, is to ſpend ſo much in armour, that one has nothing left to defend.</p>
               <p>Deference often ſhrinks and withers as much upon the approach of intimacy, as the ſenſitive plant does upon the touch of one's finger.</p>
               <p>Men are ſometimes accuſed of pride, merely becauſe their accuſers would be proud themſeves if they were in their places.</p>

               <p>Modeſty makes large amends for the pain it gives the perſons who labour under it, by the prejudice it affords every worthy perſon in their favour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The difference there is betwixt honour and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019364_0021_0FAB4B53E15F0F70"/>
honeſty ſeems to be chiefly in the motive. The honeſt man does that from duty, which the man of honour does for the ſake of character.</p>
               <p>A liar begins with making falshood appear like truth, and ends with making truth itſelf appear like falshood.</p>
               <p>Virtue ſhould be conſidered as a part of taſte; and we ſhould as much avoid deceit, or ſiniſter meanings in diſcourſe, as we would puns, bad language, or falſe grammar.</p>
               <p>The higher character a perſon ſupports, the more he ſhould regard his minuteſt actions.</p>

               <p>DEFERENCE is the moſt complicate, the moſt indirect, and the moſt elegant of all compliments.</p>
               <p>He that lies in bed all a ſummer's morning, loſes the pleaſure of the day: he that gives up his youth to indolence, undergoes a loſs of the ſame kind.</p>
               <p>Shining characters are not always the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ones. The mild radiance of an eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, is by no means leſs pleaſing than the glare of the ruby.</p>
               <p>To be at once a rake, and to glory in the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, diſcovers at the ſame time a bad diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a bad taſte.</p>
               <p>How is it poſſible to expect that mankind will take advice, when they will not ſo much as take warning.</p>
               <p>Although men are accuſed for not knowing

their own weakneſs, yet perhaps as few know their own ſtrength. It is in men as in ſoils, where ſometimes there is a vein of gold which the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er knows not of.</p>
               <p>Fine ſenſe and exalted ſenſe are not half ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable as common ſenſe. There are forty men of wit for one man of ſenſe; and he that will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nothing about him but gold, will be every day at a loſs for want of ready change.</p>
               <p>Learning is like mercury, one of the moſt powerful and excellent things in the world in ſkilful hands; in unſkilful, moſt miſchievous.</p>
               <p>A man ſhould never be aſhamed to own he has been in the wrong; which is but ſaying, in other words, that he is wiſer to-day than he was yeſterday,</p>
               <p>Wherever I find a great deal of gratitude in a poor man, I take it ſor granted there would be as much generoſity if he were a rich man.</p>
               <p>Flowers of rhetoric in ſermons or ſerious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, are like the blue and red flowers in corn, pleaſing to thoſe who come only for amuſement, but prejudicial to him who would reap the profit.</p>
               <p>It often happens that thoſe are the beſt people, whoſe characters have been moſt injured by ſlanderers; as we uſually find that to be the ſweeteſt fruit, which the birds have been pecking at.</p>
               <p>The eye of a critic is often like a microſcope, made ſo very fine and nice, that it diſcovers the atoms, grains, and minuteſt articles, without ever comprehending the whole, comparing the parts, or ſeeing all at once the harmony.</p>
               <p>

Men's zeal for religion is much of the ſame kind as that which they ſhew for a foot-ball: whenever it is conteſted for, every one is ready to venture their lives and limbs in the diſpute; but when that is once at an end, it is no more thought on, but ſleeps in oblivion, buried in rubbiſh, which no one thinks it worth his pains to rake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, much leſs to remove.</p>
               <p>Honour is but a fictious kind of honeſty; a mean, but a neceſſary ſubſtitute for it, in ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which have none: it is a ſort of paper-credit, with which men are obliged to trade, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in the ſterling caſh of true morality and religion.</p>
               <p>Perſons of great delicacy ſhould know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the following truth: there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of caſes which occaſion ſuſpenſe, in which whatever they determine they will repent of their determination; and this through a propenſity of human nature to fancy happineſs in thoſe ſchemes which it does not purſue.</p>
               <p>The chief advantage that ancient writers can boaſt over modern ones ſeems owing to ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Every noble truth and ſentiment was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the former in a natural manner, in word and phraſe ſimple, perſpicuous, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of improvement.

               <p>Such is the conditon of life that ſomething is always wanted, to happineſs. In youth we have warm hopes, which are ſoon blaſted by raſhness and negligence, and great deſigns, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019364_0029_0FAB4B5E5BB36E40"/>
by inexperience. In age we have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and prudence, without ſpirit to exert, or motives to prompt them. We are able to plan ſchemes and regulate meaſures, but have not time remaining to bring them to completion.</p>
               <p>A varice is always poor, but poor by her own fault.</p>
               <p>The maxim which Periander of Corinth, one of the ſeven ſages of Greece, left as a memorial of his knowledge and benevolence, was, "Be maſter of your anger." He conſidered anger as the great diſturber of human life; the chief ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my both of public happineſs and private tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, and thought he could not lay on poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a ſtronger obligation to reverence his memory, than by leaving them a falutary caution againſt this outrageous paſſion.</p>
               <p>Pride is undoubtedly the origin of anger; but pride, like every other paſſion, if it breaks looſe from reaſon, counteracts its own purpoſes. A paſſionate man, upon the review of his day, will have very few gratifications to offer to his pride, when he has conſidered how his outrages were cauſed; why they were borne, and in what they are likely to end at laſt.</p>
               <p>Whilſt an author is yet living, we eſtimate his powers by the worſt performance. When he is dead, we rate them by his beſt.</p>
               <p>It requires but little acquaintance with the heart, to know that woman's firſt wiſh is to be handſome; and that conſequently the readieſt method of obtaining her kindneſs is to praiſe her beauty.</p>

The univerſal axiom in which all complaiſance is included, and from which flow all the formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which cuſtom has eſtabliſhed in civilized na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is,—"That no man ſhould give any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to himſelf,"—a rule ſo comprehenſive and certain, that perhaps it is not eaſy for the mind to imagine an incivility without ſuppoſing it to be broken.</p>
               <p>Charity would loſe its name were it influenced by ſo mean a motive as human praiſe.</p>
               <p>That charity is beſt of which the conſequences are moſt extenſive.</p>

               <p>There is a kind of anxious cleanlineſs, which is always the characteriſtic of a ſlattern; it is the ſuperfluous ſcrupuloſity of guilt, dreading diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and ſhunning ſuſpicion.—It is the violence of an effort againſt habit, which being impelled by external motives, cannot ſtop at the middle point.</p>
               <p>The foundation of content muſt ſpring up in a man's own mind; and he who has ſo little knowledge of human nature as to ſeek happineſs by changing any thing but his own diſpoſition, will waſte his life in fruitleſs efforts, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the griefs which he purpoſes to remove.</p>

               <p>It is remarkable that death increaſes our vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the good, and extenuates our hatred of the bad.</p>

It is true, that no diligence can aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſucceſs; death may intercept the ſwifteſt career, but he who is cut off in the execution of an honeſt undertaking, has at left the honour of falling in his rank and has fought the battle, though he miſſed the victory.</p>

               <p>Deceit and falshood, whatever conveniences they may for a time promiſe or produce, are, in the ſum of life, obſtacles to happineſs. Thoſe who profit by the cheat diſtruſt the deceiver, and the act by which kindneſs was ſought puts an end to confidence.</p>

               <p>We then find the abſurdity of ſtretching out our arms inceſſantly to graſp that which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep, and wearing out our lives in endeavours to add new turrets to the fabrick of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the foundation itſelf is ſhaking, and the ground on which it ſtands is mouldering away.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of wit and ſolid ſenſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathocles, whoſe age very little exceeded her's, was well made, brave and prudent. He had the good fortune to be introduced to Caliſta's: where his looks, wandering indifferently over a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous circle, ſoon diſtinguiſhed and fixed upon her.</p>
               <p>But recovering from the ſhort extacy occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the firſt ſight, he immediately reproached himſelf, as being guilty of rudeneſs to the reſt of the company; a fault which he had endeavoured to correct, by looking round on other objects. Vain attempts! they were attracted by a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful charm, and turned again towards Caliſta. He bluſhed as well as ſhe, while a ſweet emotion, till then unſelt, produced a kind of fluttering in his heart, and confuſion in his countenance.</p>
               <p>They both became at the ſame time, more ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid, and more curious. He was pleaſed with gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Caliſta; which he could not do without trembling: whilſt Caliſta, ſecretly ſatiſfied with this flattering preference, caſt her eyes on him by ſtealth. They were both under an apprehenſion, but eſpecially Caliſta, of being caught by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the fact; and yet caught they were almoſt every moment.</p>
               <p>The hour of ſeparation came, which to them appeared too ſudden: melancholy were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections they made on the rapidity of of time. Imagination, however, did not permit, them to be
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:019364_0044_0FAB4B7DD82751B0"/>
entirely abſent from each other: for the image of Caliſta was deeply engraved on the mind of Agathocles: and his features were as ſtrongly impreſſed on that of Caliſta. They both appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leſs cheerful, the reſt of the day. A lively ſentiment, which they did not well comprehend themſelves, entirely employed their minds, in ſpite of every attempt to divert themſelves.</p>
               <p>Two days paſſed without ſeeing one another again: and, tho' this interval of time had been filled up either by buſineſs or recreations; yet they both, notwithſtanding, experienced a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs and diſſatisfaction in their minds, for which they could no way account. But the moment, which brought them together again, explained it to them: the perfect contentment they felt in each other's company, made them ſenſible of the real ſource of their melancholy.</p>
               <p>Agathocles took more courage that day: he addreſſed Caliſta in a moſt obliging manner, and had the happineſs to converſe with her for the firſt time. As yet he had ſeen only her outward charms; but now he diſcovered the beauty of her mind, the integrity of her heart, the dignity of her ſentiments, and the delicacy of her wit; but what charmed him the moſt, was the opinion he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that ſhe did not judge him unworthy of her eſteem.</p>
               <p>From this time he made her frequent viſits, in every one of which he diſcovered ſome new per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the fair Caliſta. This is the character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of true merit; it gains by being expoſed to the eye of a judicious perſon. A man of ſenſe
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:019364_0045_0FAB4B7EB7700FF8"/>
will ſoon diſlike a coquette, a fool, or a giddy woman: but if he falls in love with a woman of merit, time, far from weakening, will only ſtrengthen and augment his paſſion.</p>
               <p>The fixed inclination of Agathocles convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him now that what he felt for Caliſta, was love, and that of the moſt tender nature. This he knew; but Caliſta did not as yet know it, or at leſt had not learnt it from his lips. Love is ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and diffident. A bold ſuitor is not the real lover of the lady whom he addreſſes: he ſeeks for nothing but pleaſure. Agathocles at laſt reſolved to open his heart to Caliſta; but he did not do it in the affected language of a roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic paſſion. "Lovely Caliſta, ſaid he ingenuouſly, it is not mere eſteem that binds me to you, but a moſt paſſionate and tender love. I feel that I cannot live without you: can you without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to your inclinations, conſent to make me happy? I may love you without offence; 'tis a tribute due to your merit: but may I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the hopes of ſome ſmall return?"</p>
               <p>A coquette would have affected to be diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſuch a declaration. But Caliſta not only liſtened to her lover without interrupting him, but anſwered him without ill-nature, and gave him leave to hope. Nor did ſhe put his conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to a tedious trial: the happineſs for which he ſighed was no longer delayed than was neceſſary to prepare the ceremony. The marriage ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were eaſily regulated betwixt the parties: for intereſt was out of the queſtion: the chief ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle conſiſted in the mutual exchange of hearts; which was already fulfilled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:019364_0046_0FAB4B7F62AEEBE8"/>
What will be the lot of this new-married cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? The happieſt, I may venture to foretel, that mortals can enjoy upon earth. No pleaſures are compareable to thoſe that affect the heart; and there are none, as I have obſerved before, that affect it with ſuch exquiſite delight, as loving and being beloved. To this tender union we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver apply the words of Democratus, that <hi>the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of love is but a ſhort epilepſy.</hi> He meant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, that mere ſenſual pleaſure, which has ſo little in it of the nature of love, that a man may enjoy it without loving, and love without ever enjoying it.</p>
               <p>They will be conſtant in their love. This I dare alſo to predict; and I know the reaſon. Their affection is not founded on the dazzling charms of beauty: they are both the friends of virtue; they love each other on this account; they will, therefore, continue to love, as long as they are virtuous; and their union itſelf is a pledge of their perſeverance: for nothing ſo much fecures our continuance in the paths of virtue, as to have perpetually before our eyes the example of a perſon whom we love.</p>
               <p>Nothing is capable to diſturb their happineſs, but thoſe diſaſters and misfortunes, from which their love cannot ſhelter them. But, ſuppoſing ſuch a reverſe of fortune, would not their fate in this regard be common with that of the reſt of mankind? Thoſe who have never taſted the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of love, are not exempt from the like caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and the lover is, at leſt, a gainer in regard to thoſe pleaſures, which conſtitute no ſmall part of the happineſs of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:019364_0047_0FAB4B822498AAE8"/>
Beſides, even love itſelf will greatly diminiſh the ſenſe of their misfortunes. For love has the peculiar property of alleviating the ſufferings of two fond hearts, and of rendering their pleaſures more exquiſite. By this communication of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, they ſeem to divide its weight: and, on the contrary, by participation their ſatisfaction is doubled. As a ſquadron of horſe is with greater difficulty broke thro' by the enemy, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its cloſeneſs: ſo the happy pair reſiſts the attacks of adverſity with ſo much the more ſtrength and ſucceſs, as they are more cloſely unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

               <p n="5">5. On a ſhock-bed, at one end, lay the old man whom he came to viſit; at the foot of it ſat his daughter. She was dreſſed in a clean white bed-gown; her dark locks hung looſely over it as ſhe bent forward, watching the languid looks of her father. The philoſopher and his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper had ſtood ſome moments in the room without the young lady's being ſenſible of their entering it.</p>

8. The ſcruples of the ſtranger, who could look ſcruples, tho' he could not ſpeak them, were overcome, and the baſhful reluctance of his daughter gave way to her belief of its uſe to her father. The ſick man was wrapt in blankets and carried acroſs the ſtreet to the Engliſh gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's. The old woman helped the daughter to nurſe him there.

               <p n="9">9. By that time his hoſt had learned the name and character of his gueſt. He was a proteſtant and clergyman of Switzerland, called <hi>La Roche,</hi> a widower, who had lately buried his wife, after a long and lingering illneſs, for which travelling had been preſcribed; and was now returning home, after an ineffectual journey, with his only child, the daughter we have mentioned.</p>
               <p n="10">10. He was a devout man, as became his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.

"There is a pride in human knowledge, my child," ſaid her father, "which often blinds men to the ſublime truths of revelation; hence there are oppoſers of chriſtianity amongmen of virtuous lives, as well as among thoſe of diſſipated and licentious characters, Nay, ſometimes I have known the latter more eaſily converted to the true faith than the former, becauſe the fume of paſſion is more eaſily diſſipated than the miſt of falſe theory and deluſive ſpeculation." "But this philoſopher" <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="13">13. She was interrupted by the arrival of their landlord—He took her hand with an air of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—She drew it away from him in ſilence; threw down her eyes to the ground and left the room. "I have been thanking God," ſaid the good <hi>La Roche,</hi> "for my recovery." "That is right," replied his landlord. "I ſhould not wiſh," continued the old man, heſitatingly, "to think-otherwiſe; did I not look up with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to that Being, I ſhould barely be ſatisfied with my recovery, as a continuation of life which, it may be, is not a real good. Alas! I may live to wiſh I had died, that you had left me to die, Sir, inſtead of kindly relieving me (he claſped the philoſopher's hand); but when I look on this renovated being as the gift of the Almighty, I feel a far different ſentiment—my heart dilates

with gratitude and love to him; it is prepared for doing his will, not as a duty, but as a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and regards every breach of it, not with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation, but with horror."</p>
               <p n="14">14. "You ſay right, my dear Sir," replied the Philoſopher; "but you are not yet re-eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed enough to talk much—you muſt take care of your health, and neither ſtudy nor preach for ſome time. I have been thinking over a ſcheme that ſtruck me to day, when you mentioned your intended departure. I was never is Switzerland; I have a great mind to accompany your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and you into that country. I will help to take care of you by the road; for, as I was your firſt phyſician, I hold myſelf reſponſible for your cure."</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>La Roche'</hi>s eyes gliſtened at the propoſal; his daughter was called and told of it. She was equally pleaſed with her father; for they really loved their landlord—not perhaps the leſs for his infidelity; at leſt that circumſtance mixed a ſort of pity with their regard for him—their ſouls were not of a mould for harſher feelings—hatred never dwelt with them.</p>
               <p n="16">16. They travelled by ſhort ſtages; for the philoſopher was as good as his word, in taking care that the old man ſhould not be fatigued. The party had time to be well acquainted with one another, and their friendſhip was encreaſed by acquaintance. <hi>La Roche</hi> found a degree of ſimplicity and gentleneſs in his companion, which is not always annexed to the character of a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or a wiſe man.</p>

She found in him nothing of that ſelf-importance which ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior parts, or great cultivation of them is apt to confer. He talked of every thing but philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and religion; he ſeemed to enjoy every plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and amuſement of ordinary life, and to be intereſted in the moſt common topics of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; when his knowledge or learning at any time appeared, it was delivered with the utmoſt plainneſs and without the leſt ſhow of dogma<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

which appeared the ſpire of <hi>La Roche'</hi>s church, riſing above a clump of beeches.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The philoſopher enjoyed the beauty of the ſcene; but to his companions it recalled the memory of a wife and parent they had loſt. The old man's ſorrow was ſilent; his daughter ſobb'd and wept. Her father took her hand, kiſſed it twice, preſſed it to his boſom, threw up his eyes to heaven; and having wiped off a tear that was juſt about to drop from each, began to point out to his gueſt ſome of the moſt ſtriking objects which the proſpect afforded. The philoſopher interpreted all this; and he could but ſlightly cenſure the creed from which it aroſe.</p>
               <p n="21">21. They had not been long arrived, when a number of <hi>La Roche'</hi>s pariſhioners, who had heard of his return, came to the houſe to ſee and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. The honeſt folks were awkward, but ſincere, in their profeſſions of friendſhip. They made ſome attempts at condolence; it was too delicate for their handling; but <hi>La Roche</hi> took it in good part. "It had pleaſed God;" ſaid he and they ſaw he had ſettled the matter with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Philoſohpy could not have done ſo much with a thouſand words.</p>
               <p n="22">22. It was now evening, and the good peaſants were about to depart, when a clock was heard to ſtrike ſeven, and the hour was followed by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular chime. The country folks, who came to welcome their paſtor, turned their looks towards him at the ſound; he explained their meaning to his gueſt. "That is the ſignal," ſaid he, "for our evening exerciſe; this is one of the nights of

               <p n="23">23. "By no means," anſwered the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher; "I will attend Madamoiſelle at her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions." "She is our organiſt," ſaid <hi>La Roche;</hi> "our neighbourhood is the country of muſical mechaniſm, and I have a ſmall organ, fitted up for the purpoſe of aſſiſting our ſinging." "'Tis an additional inducement," replied the other, and they walked into the room together.</p>
               <p n="24">24. At the end ſtood the organ mentioned by <hi>La Roche;</hi> before it was a curtain, which his daughter drew aſide, and placing herſelf on a ſeat within, and drawing the curtain cloſe, ſo as to ſave her the awkwardneſs of an exhibition, began a voluntary, ſolemn and beautiful in the higheſt degree. The philoſopher was no muſician, but he was not altogether inſenſible to muſic; this faſtened on his mind more ſtrongly, from its beauty being unexpected.</p>
               <p n="25">25. The ſolemn prelude introduced a hymn, in which ſuch of the audience as could ſing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately joined; the words were moſtly taken from holy writ; it ſpoke the praiſes of God and his care of good men. Something was ſaid of the death of the juſt; of ſuch as die in the Lord. The organ was touched with a hand, leſs firm;—it pauſed;—it ceaſed;—and the ſobbing of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle was heard in its ſtead.</p>

He was diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at firſt and his voice faltered as he ſpoke; but his heart was in his words, and its warmth overcame his embarraſſment. He addreſſed a Being whom he loved, and he ſpoke for thoſe he loved. His pariſhioners catched the ardour of the good old man; even the philoſopher felt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moved, and forgat, for a moment, to think why he ſhould not.</p>
               <p n="27">27. <hi>La Roche'</hi>s religion was that of ſentiment, not theory, and his gueſt was averſe from diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; their diſcourſe did not therefore lead to queſtions concerning the belief of either; yet would the old man ſometimes ſpeak of his, from the feelings of a heart impreſſed with its force and wiſhing to ſpread the pleaſure he enjoyed in it. The ideas of his God, and his Saviour were ſo congenial to his mind, that every emotion of it naturally awakened them. A philoſopher might have called him an enthuſiaſt; but if he poſſeſſed the fervour of enthuſiaſts, he was guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of their bigotry. "Our Father who art in heaven!" might the good old man ſay—for he felt it—and all mankind were his brethren.</p>
               <p n="28">28. "You regret, my friend," ſaid he to the philoſopher, "when my daughter and I talk of the exquiſite pleaſure derived from muſic; you regret your want of muſical powers and muſical feelings; it is a department of ſoul, you ſay, which nature has almoſt denied you, which, from the effects you ſee it have on others, you are ſure muſt be highly delightful. Why ſhould not the

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:019364_0059_0FAB4BA1194D5350"/>
conveyed along with the recollection, for his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing failed to write to either of them for ſeveral months paſt. The truth was, that indolence was the habit moſt natural to him, from which he was not eaſily rouſed by the claims of correſpondence, either of his friends or his enemies; when the latter drew their pens in controverſy, they were often anſwered as well as the former.</p>
               <p n="36">36. While he was heſitating about a visit to <hi>La Roche,</hi> which he wiſhed to make, but found the effort rather too much for him, he received a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the old man, which had been forwarded to him from Paris, where he had then fixed his reſidence. It contained a gentle complaint of the Philoſopher's want of punctuality, but an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of continued gratitude for his former good offices, and, as a friend whom the writer conſidered intereſted in his family, it informed him of the approaching nuptials of Mademoiſelle <hi>La Roche,</hi> with a young man, a relation of her own and formerly a pupil of her father's, of the moſt noble diſpoſitions and reſpectable character.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Attached from their earlieſt years, they had been ſeparated by his joining one of the ſubſidiary regiments of the Canton, then in the ſervice of a foreign power.

The term of his ſervice was now expired and they expected him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in a few weeks, when the old man hoped, as he expreſſed it in his letter, to join their hands and ſee them happy before he died.</p>

38. Our philoſopher felt himſelf intereſted in this event; but he was not, perhaps, altogether ſo happy in the tidings of Mademoiſelle <hi>La Roche's</hi> marriage, as her father ſuppoſed him. Not that he ever was a lover of the Lady; but he thought her one of the moſt amiable women he had ſeen, and there was ſomething in the idea of her being another's for ever, that ſtruck him, he knew not why, like a diſappointment. After ſome little ſpeculation on the matter, however, he could look on it as a thing fitting, if not quite agreeable, and determined on his viſit to ſee his old friend and his daughter happy.</p>
               <p n="39">39. On the laſt day of his journey, different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents had retarded his progreſs; he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted before he reached the quarter in which <hi>La Roche</hi> reſided. His guide however, was well acquainted with the road and he found himſelf in view of the lake, which I have before deſcribed, in the neighbourhood of <hi>La Roche's</hi> dwelling. A light gleamed on the water, that ſeemed to proceed from the houſe; it moved ſlowly along as he proceeded up the ſide of the lake and at laſt he ſaw it glimmering through the trees and ſtop at ſome diſtance from the place where he then was.</p>
               <p n="40">40. He ſuppoſed it ſome piece of bridal merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and puſhed on his horſe that he might be a ſpectator of the ſcene; but he was a good deal ſhocked, on approaching the ſpot, to find it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the torch of a perſon clothed in the dreſs of an attendant on a funeral, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by ſeveral others, who like him, ſeemed to

               <p n="41">41. On the philoſopher's making enquiry who was the perſon they had been burying? one of them, with an accent more mournful than is common to their profeſſion, anſwered, "Then you knew not Mademoiſelle, Sir! you never beheld a lovlier." <hi>La Roche!"</hi> exclaimed he in reply"—"Alas it was ſhe indeed!" The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of grief and ſurpriſe which his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance aſſumed, attracted the notice of the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with whom he talked.</p>
               <p n="42">42.

Where is her father." "She died, Sir, of heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, I believe; the young gentleman to whom ſhe was ſoon to be married, was killed, in a duel by a French Officer, his intimate companion, and to whom, before their quarrel, he had often done the greateſt favours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</p>

Follow me, Sir, and you ſhall hear him." He followed the man without anſwering.</p>
               <p n="44">44. The Church was dimly lighted, except near the pulpit, where the venerable <hi>La Roche</hi> was ſeated.

The other was equally affected; they went together in ſilence into the parlour, where the evening ſervice was wont to be performed.</p>
               <p n="51">51. The curtains of the organ were open; <hi>La Roche</hi> ſtarted back at the ſight.—"Oh my friend," ſaid he and his tears burſt forth again. The philoſopher had now recollected himſelf; he ſtept forward and drew the curtain cloſe—the old man wiped off his tears and taking his friend by the hand, "You ſee my weakneſs," and he, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to form, we ſhall probably be ſurpriſed to find how little there is in it, either of natural feeling or real ſatisfaction. Many a faſhionable volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, who has not totally blunted his taſte or his judgement, will own, in the intervals of recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, how often he has ſuffered from the inſipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity or the pain of his enjoyments; and that, if it were not for the fear of being laughed at, it would ſometimes be worth while, even on the ſcore of pleaſure, to be virtuous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> to whom I had the pleaſure of being introduced at Florence, was a character much beyond that which diſtinguiſhes the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Engliſh travellers of fortune.</p>
               <p>His ſtory was known to ſome of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who then reſided in Italy; from one of whom, who could now and then talk of ſomething beſides pictures and operas, I had a particular recital of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He had been abroad at an early period of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:019364_0066_0FAB4BB349510668"/>
life, ſoon after the death of his father had left him maſter of a very large eſtate, which he had the good fortune to inherit, and all the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on natural to youth to enjoy. Though always ſumptuous, however, and ſometimes profuſe, he was obſerved never to be ridiculous in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes; and though he was now and then talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of as a man of pleaſure and diſſipation, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways left behind him more inſtances of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, than of irregularity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For that reſpect and eſteem in which his character, amidſt all his little errors, was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held, he was ſuppoſed a good deal indebted to the ſociety of a gentleman who had been his companion at the univerſity, and now attended him rather as a friend than a tutor. This gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was unfortunately ſeized at Marſeilles with a lingering diſorder, for which he was under the neceſſity of taking a ſea-voyage, leaving Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> to proſecute the remaining part of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended tour alone.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Deſcending into one of their valleys of Piedmont, where notwithſtanding the ruggedneſs of the road, Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> with a prejudice natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to his country, preferred the conveyance of an Engliſh hunter to that of an Italian mule, his horſe unluckily made of falſe ſtep and fell with his rider to the ground, from which Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was lifted by his ſervants with ſcarce any ſigns of life. They conveyed him on a litter to the neareſt houſe, which happened to be the dwelling of a peaſant rather above the common rank, before whoſe door ſome of his neighbours were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:019364_0067_0FAB4BBB11743748"/>
at a ſcene of rural merriment, when the train of Sir <hi>Edward</hi> brought up their maſter in the condition I have deſcribed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The compaſſion, natural to his ſituation, was excited in all; but the owner of the manſion, whoſe name was <hi>Venoni,</hi> was particularly moved with it. He applied himſelf immediately to the care of the ſtranger, and with the aſſiſtance of his daughter, who had left the dance ſhe was engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, with great marks of agitation, ſoon reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sir <hi>Edward</hi> to ſenſe and life.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Venoni</hi> poſſeſſed ſome little ſkill in ſurgery and his daughter produced a book of receipts in medicine. Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> after being blooded, was put to bed and tended with every poſſible care by his hoſt and his family. A conſiderable degree of fever was the conſequence of his acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but after ſome days it abated: and in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than a week, he was able to join in the ſociety of <hi>Venoni</hi> and his daughter.</p>
               <p n="8">8. He could not help expreſſing ſome ſurpriſe at the appearance of refinement in the converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the latter, much beyond what her ſituation ſeemed likely to confer. Her father accounted for it. She had received her education in the houſe of a Lady, who happened to paſs through the valley, and to take ſhelter in <hi>Venoni'</hi>s cottage (for his houſe was but a better ſort of cottage) the night after her birth.</p>
               <p n="9">9. "When her mother died," ſaid he, "the Signora, whoſe name, at her deſire, we had given the child, took her home to her own houſe; there ſhe was taught many things of which there is no

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or life."</p>
               <p n="10">10. But Sir <hi>Edward</hi> had now an opportunity of knowing <hi>Louiſa</hi> better than from the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her father. Muſic and painting, in both which arts ſhe was a tolerable proficient, Sir <hi>Edward</hi> had ſtudied with ſucceſs. <hi>Louiſa</hi> felt a ſort of pleaſure from her drawings, which they had never given her before, when they were praiſed by Sir <hi>Edward;</hi> and the family concerts of <hi>Venoni</hi> were very different from what they had formerly been, when once his gueſt was ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered as to be able to join in them. The flute of <hi>Venoni</hi> excelled all the other muſic of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley; his daughter's lute was much beyond it; Sir <hi>Edward'</hi>s violin was finer than either.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But his converſation with <hi>Louiſa</hi>—It was that of a ſuperior order of beings! ſcience, taſte, ſentiment! it was long ſince <hi>Louiſa</hi> had heard theſe ſounds; amidſt the ignorance of the valley, it was luxury to hear them; from Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> who was one of the moſt engaging figures I ever ſaw, they were doubly delightful. In his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance there was always an expreſſion animated and intereſting; his ſickneſs had overcome ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the firſt, but greatly added to the power of the latter.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Louiſa'</hi>s was no leſs captivating and Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> had not beheld it ſo long without emotion. During his illneſs, he thought this emotion but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and when it firſt grew warmer, he checked
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:019364_0069_0FAB4BBC2E951450"/>
it, from the thought of her ſituation and of the debt he owed her. But the ſtruggle was too ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to overcome, and of conſequence increaſed, his paſſion.</p>
               <p n="13">13. There was but one way in which the pride of Sir <hi>Edward</hi> allowed of its being gratified. He ſometimes thought of this as baſe and unworthy; but he was the fool of words which he had often deſpiſed, the ſlave of manners which he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten condemned. He at laſt compromiſed mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with himſelf; he reſolved, it he could, to think no more of <hi>Louiſa:</hi> at any rate, to think no more of the ties of gratitude or the reſtraints of virtue.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Louiſa,</hi> who truſted to both, now commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to Sir E<hi>dward</hi> an important ſecret. It was at the cloſe of a piece of muſic, which they had been playing in the abſence of her father. She took up her lute and touched a little wild melancholy air, which ſhe had compoſed to the memory of her mother. "That," ſaid ſhe, "no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body ever heard except my father; I play it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when I am alone and in low ſpirits. I know not how I came to think of it now; yet I have ſome reaſon to be ſad."</p>
               <p n="15">15. Sir <hi>Edward</hi> preſſed to know the cauſe; after ſome heſitation ſhe told it all. Her father had fixed on the ſon of a neighbour, rich in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, but rude in manners, for her huſband. Againſt this match ſhe had always proteſted as ſtrongly, as a ſenſe of duty and the mildneſs of her nature would allow; but <hi>Venoni</hi> was obſtinately bent on the match, and ſhe was wretched from the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:019364_0070_0FAB4BBCE21B6E18"/>
thoughts of it. "To marry where one cannot love,—to marry ſuch a man, Sir <hi>Edward!"</hi> It was an opportunity beyond his power of reſiſtance. Sir <hi>Edward</hi> preſſed her hand; ſaid it would be profanation to think of ſuch a marriage; praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her beauty, extolled her virtues; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by ſwearing that he adored her.</p>
               <p n="16">16. She heard him with unſuſpecting pleaſure, which her bluſhes could ill conceal. Sir <hi>Edward</hi> improved the favourable moment; talked of the ardency of his paſſion, the inſignificancy of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and forms, the inefficacy of legal engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the eternal duration of thoſe dictated by love; and in fine, urged her going off with him, to crown both their days with happineſs. <hi>Louiſa</hi> ſtarted at the propoſal. She would have reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, but her heart was not made for it; ſhe could only weep.</p>
               <p n="17">17. They were interrupted by the arrival of her father with his intended ſon-in-law. He was juſt ſuch a man as <hi>Louiſa</hi> had repreſented him, coarſe, vulgar and ignorant. But <hi>Venoni,</hi> tho' much above their neighbour in every thing but riches, looked on him as poorer men often look on the wealthy, and diſcovered none of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. He took his daughter aſide, told her he had brought her future huſband, and that he intended they ſhould be married in a week at fartheſt.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Next morning <hi>Louiſa</hi> was indiſpoſed, and kept her chamber. Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recovered. He was engaged to go out with <hi>Venoni;</hi> but before his departure, he took
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:019364_0071_0FAB4BBDD705B128"/>
up his violin and touched a few plaintive notes on it. They were heard by <hi>Louiſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. In the evening ſhe wandered forth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge her ſorrows alone. She had reached a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered ſpot, where ſome poplars formed a thicket, on the banks of a little ſtream that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the valley. A nightingale was perched on one of them and had already begun its accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſong. <hi>Louiſa</hi> ſat down on a withered ſtump, leaning her cheek upon her hand.</p>
               <p n="20">20. After a little while, the bird was ſcared from its perch, and flitted from the thicket. <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa</hi> roſe from the ground and burſt into tears! She turned, and beheld Sir <hi>Edward.</hi> His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance had much of its former langour; and when he took her hand, he caſt on the earth a melancholy look and ſeemed unable to ſpeak his feelings.</p>
               <p n="21">21. "Are you not well Sir <hi>Edward?"</hi> ſaid <hi>Louiſa,</hi> with a voice faint and broken. "I am ill indeed" ſaid he, "but my illneſs is of the mind. <hi>Louiſa</hi> cannot cure me of that. I am wretched; but I deſerve to be ſo. I have broken every law of hoſpitality and every obligation of gratitude. I have dared to wiſh for happineſs and to ſpeak what I wiſhed, though it wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heart of my deareſt benefactor—but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> will make a ſevere expiation."</p>
               <p n="22">22. "This moment I leave you, <hi>Louiſa!</hi> I go to be wretched; but you may be happy; happy in your duty to a father, happy, it may be, in the arms of a huſband, whom the poſſeſſion of ſuch a wiſe may teach refinement and ſenſibility. I
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:019364_0072_0FAB4BBE559FDF98"/>
go to my native country, to hurry through ſcenes of irkſome buſineſs or taſteleſs amuſements; that I may, if poſſible, procure a ſort of half-oblivion of that happineſs which I left behind, a liſtleſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance of that life which I once dreamed might be made delightful with <hi>Louiſa."</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. Tearſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were the only anſwer ſhe could give. Sir <hi>Edward'</hi>s ſervants appeared, with a carriage, ready for his departure. He took from his pocket two pictures; one he had drawn of <hi>Louiſa,</hi> he faſtened it round his neck, and kiſſing it with rapture, hid it in his boſom. The other he held out in a heſitating manner. "This," ſaid he, "if <hi>Louiſa</hi> will accept of it, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put her in mind of him who once offended, who can never ceaſe to adore her. She may look on it perhaps after the original is no more; when this heart ſhall have forgot to love and ceaſed to be wretched."</p>
               <p n="24">24. <hi>Louiſa</hi> was at laſt overcome. Her face was firſt pale as death; then ſuddenly, it was croſſed with a crimſon bluſh. "Oh! Sir <hi>Edward!"</hi> ſaid ſhe, "what—what would you have me do!" He eagerly ſeized her hand and led her, reluctant, to the carriage. They entered it and driving off with furious ſpeed, were ſoon out of ſight of thoſe hills which paſtured the flocks of the unfortunate <hi>Venoni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. The virtue of <hi>Louiſa</hi> was vanquiſhed; but her sense of virtue was not overcome. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vows of eternal fidelity of her ſeducer, nor the conſtant and reſpectful attention, which he paid her, during a hurried, journey to England, could
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:019364_0073_0FAB4BBF1CF8D308"/>
allay that anguiſh which ſhe ſuffered at the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of her paſt, and the thoughts of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation. Sir <hi>Edward</hi> felt ſtrongly the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of her beauty and of her grief. His heart was not made for that part which, it is probable, he thought it could have performed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it was ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to remorſe, to compaſſion and to love.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Theſe emotions perhaps, he might ſoon have overcome, had they been met by vulgar vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence or reproaches; but the quiet and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding ſorrows of <hi>Louiſa</hi> nouriſhed thoſe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of tenderneſs and attachment. She never mentioned her wrongs in words; ſometimes a few ſtarting tears would ſpeak them; and when time had given her a little more compoſure, her lute diſcourſed melancholy muſic.</p>
               <p n="27">27. On their arrival in England, Sir <hi>Edward</hi> carried <hi>Louiſa</hi> to his ſeat in the country. There ſhe was treated with all the obſervance of a wife; and, had ſhe choſen it, might have commanded more than the ordinary ſplendor of one. But ſhe would not allow the indulgence of Sir <hi>Edward</hi> to blazen with equipage, and ſhow that ſtate which ſhe wiſhed always to hide, and, if poſſible, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get. Her books and her muſic were her only pleaſure; if pleaſure they could be called, that ſerved but to alleviate miſery, and, to blunt, for a while, the pangs of contrition.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Theſe were deeply aggravated by the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of her father; a father left in his age to feel his own misfortunes and his daughter's diſgrace. Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was too generous not to think of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for <hi>Venoni.</hi> He meant to make ſome atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:019364_0074_0FAB4BBFD493FD78"/>
for the injury he had done him, by that cruel bounty which is reparation only to the baſe, but to the honeſt, is inſult. He had not, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, an opportunity of accompliſhing his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p n="29">29. He learned that <hi>Venoni,</hi> ſoon after his daughter's elopement, removed from his former place of reſidence, and as his neighbours had reported, had died in one of the village of Savoy. His daughter felt this with anguiſh the moſt poignant, and her affliction, for a while, refuſed conſolation. Sir <hi>Edward'</hi>s whole tenderneſs and attention were called forth to mitigate her grief; and after its firſt tranſports had ſubſided, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her to London in hopes that objects new to her and commonly attractive to all, might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to remove it.</p>
               <p n="30">30. With a man poſſeſſed of feelings like Sir <hi>Edward'</hi>s, the affliction of <hi>Louiſa</hi> gave a certain reſpect to his attentions. He hired her a houſe ſeparate from his own, and treated her with all the delicacy of the pureſt attachment. But his ſolicitude to comfort and amuſe her was not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſucceſs. She felt all the horrors of that guilt which ſhe now conſidered, as not only the ruin of herſelf, but the murderer of her father.</p>
               <p n="31">31. In London Sir <hi>Edward</hi> found his ſiſter, who had married a man of great fortune and high faſhion. He had married her, becauſe ſhe was a fine woman, and admired by fine men; ſhe had married him, becauſe he was the wealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of her ſuitors. They lived, as is common to
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:019364_0075_0FAB4BC5D4B33D78"/>
people in ſuch a ſituation, neceſſitous with a princely revenue, and very wretched amidſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual gaiety.</p>
               <p n="32">32. This ſcene was ſo foreign from the idea Sir <hi>Edward</hi> had formed of the reception which his country and his friends were to afford him, that he found a conſtant ſource of diſguſt in the ſociety of his equals. In their converſation fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtic, not refined, their ideas were frivolous and their knowledge, ſhallow; and with all the pride of birth and inſolence of ſtation, their principles were mean and their minds ignoble. In their pretended attachments, he diſcovered only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of ſelfiſhneſs; and their pleaſures, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, were as fallacious as their friendſhips.</p>
               <p n="33">33. In the ſociety of <hi>Louiſa</hi> he found ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and truth; hers was the only heart that ſeemed intereſted in his welfare: ſhe ſaw the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of virtue in Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> and felt the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which he ſhewed her. Sometimes, when ſhe perceived him ſorrowful, her lute would leave its melancholy for more lively airs, and her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance aſſumed a gaiety it was not formed to wear. But her heart was breaking with that anguiſh which her generoſity endeavoured to conceal from him; her frame, too delicate for the ſtruggle of her feelings, ſeemed to yield to their force; the colour faded in her cheek, the lustre of her eyes grew dim.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Sir <hi>Edward</hi> ſaw theſe ſymptoms of decay with the deepeſt remorſe. Often did he curſe thoſe falſe ideas of pleaſure, which had led him to conſider the ruin of an artleſs girl, who loved
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:019364_0076_0FAB4BC69BB47FB0"/>
and truſted him, as an object which it was luxury to attain. Often did he wiſh to blot out from his life a few guilty months, to be again reſtored to an opportunity of giving happineſs to that family, whoſe unſuſpecting kindneſs he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid with the treachery of a robber, and the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of an aſſaſſin.</p>
               <p n="35">35. One evening, while he ſat in a little parlour with <hi>Louiſa,</hi> his mind alternately agitated and ſoftened with this impreſſion, a <hi>hand-organ</hi> of a remarkable ſweet tone, was heard in the ſtreet; <hi>Louiſa</hi> laid aſide her lute and liſtened: the airs it played were thoſe of her native country, and a few tears which ſhe endeavoured to hide, ſtole from her on hearing them. Sir <hi>Edward</hi> ordered a ſervant to fetch the organiſt into the room: he was brought in accordingly and ſeated at the door of the apartment.</p>
               <p n="36">36. He played one or two ſprightly tunes, to which <hi>Louiſa</hi> had often danced in her infancy: ſhe gave herſelf up to the recollection, and her tears flowed without control. Suddenly the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician changing the ſtop, introduced a little me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy air of a wild and plaintive kind. <hi>Louiſa</hi> ſtarted from her ſeat and ruſhed up to the ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.—He threw off a tattered and black patch. It was her father! ſhe would have ſprung to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him; he turned aſide for a few moments and would not receive her into his arms. But nature at laſt overcame his reſentment; he burſt into tears and preſſed to his boſom his long-loſt daughter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. EMILIUS, or Domeſtic Happineſs.</head>
               <p>THE government of a family depends on ſuch various and oppoſite principles, that it is a matter of extreme delicacy. Perhaps there is no ſituation in life in which it is ſo difficult to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have with propriety, as in the conteſt between <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental authority</hi> and <hi>parental love.</hi> This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the reaſon why we ſee ſo few happy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. Few parents are both loved and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe moſt of them are either the dupes or the tyrants of their children.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some parents, either from a natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, or an exceſs of fondneſs, permit and even encourage their children in a thouſand little familiarities, which render them ridiculous and by diminiſhing the reſpect which is due to their age and ſtation, deſtroy all their authority. Others, ruled by a partial and blind affection,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:019364_0079_0FAB4BCCC16C97F0"/>
which can deny nothing to its object, indulge their children in all their romantic wiſhes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever trifling and fooliſh; however degrading to their dignity or injurious to their welfare. Others, ſoured by misfortunes, or grown peeviſh and jealous by the loſs of youthful pleaſures, and an acquainta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce with the deceit and the folly of the world, attempt to reſtrain the ideas and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of youth by the rigid maxims of age.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The children of the firſt claſs often offend by ſilly manners and a kind of good-natured diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect. Thoſe of the ſecond, are generally proud, whimſical and vitious. Thoſe of the third, if they are ſubdued, when young, by the rigour of parental diſcipline, forever remain moroſe illibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and unſociable; or if, as it commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, they find means to eſcape from reſtraint, they abandon themſelves to every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſpecies of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs. To parents of theſe deſcriptions may be added another claſs, whoſe fondneſs blinds their eyes to the moſt glaring vices of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; or invents ſuch palliations as to prevent the moſt ſalutary corrections.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The taſte for amuſements in young people is, of all others, the moſt difficult to regulate by the maxims of prudence. In this article, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are apt to err, either by extreme indulgence on one hand or immoderate rigour on the other. Recollecting the feelings of their youth, they give unbounded licence to the inclinations of their children; or having loſt all reliſh for amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they refuſe to gratify their moſt moderate deſires.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:019364_0080_0FAB4BCD9BC5C1A8"/>
5. It is a maxim which univerſally holds true, that the beſt method of guarding youth from <hi>criminal</hi> pleaſures, is to indulge them freely in thoſe that are <hi>innocent.</hi> A perſon who has free acceſs to reputeable ſociety, will have little incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to frequent that which is vitious. But thoſe, who are kept under conſtant reſtraint, who are ſeldom indulged in amuſements, who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually awed by the frowns of a parent, or ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a diſappointment of their moſt harmleſs wiſhes, will at times break over all bounds to gratify their taſte for pleaſure, and will not be anxious to diſcriminate between the innocent and the criminal.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nothing contributes more to keep youth within the limits of decorum, than to have their ſuperiors mingle in their company, at proper times, and participate of their amuſements. This condeſcenſion flatters their pride; at the ſame time, that reſpect for age, which no familiarities can wholly efface, naturally checks the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant ſallies of mirth, and the indelicate rudeneſſes which young people are apt to indulge in their jovial hours.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That awful diſtance at which ſome parents keep their children, and their abhorrence of all juvenile diverſions, which compel youth to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice their moſt innocent deſires, or veil the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of them with the moſt anxious ſecrecy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:019364_0081_0FAB4BCE2ADBD510"/>
as it would be folly to wiſh to clothe a child with grey hairs, or to ſtamp the fading <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                  </gap> autumn on the bloom of May. Nature has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to every age ſome peculiar paſſions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites; to moderate and refine theſe, not to ſtifle and deſtroy, is the buſineſs of common pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and parental care.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I was led into this train of reflections by an acquaintance with the family of Emilius, which is a rare inſtance of domeſtic felicity. Parents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent to their children, hoſpitable to their friends and univerſally reſpected; their ſons equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generous, modeſt and manly; Emilia, an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daughter, the pride of her parents, poſſeſſed of every accompliſhment that can honour herſelf, or endear her to her friends; an eaſy fortune and a diſpoſition to enjoy and improve it to the purpoſes of humanity; perfect harmony in domeſtic life and unaffected ſatisfaction in the pleaſures of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: Such is the family of Emilius.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Such a family is a little paradiſe on earth; to envy their happineſs is almoſt a virtue. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal reſpect, parental tenderneſs, filial obedience and brotherly kindneſs are ſo ſeldom united, in a family, that when I am honoured with the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of ſuch, I am equally ambitious to participate their happineſs and profit by the example.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Emilia's ſituation muſt be peculiarly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable. Her parents delight to gratify her in every amuſement; and contented with this, ſhe knows no wiſh beyond the ſacred bounds of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. While, by their indulgence, ſhe enjoys e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very rational pleaſure, ſhe rewards their generous
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:019364_0082_0FAB4BCEE3B92FF8"/>
care, by a dutiful behaviour and unblemiſhed manners.</p>
               <p n="11">11. By thus diſcharging the reciprocal duties of their reſpective ſtations, the happineſs of each is ſecured. The ſolicitude of the parent and the obedience of the child, equally contribute to the bliſs of the little ſociety; the one calling forth every act of tenderneſs, and the other diſplayed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll the filial virtues.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Few families are deſtined to be ſo happy as that of Emilius. Were I to chooſe the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where I could paſs my life with moſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, it would be in this domeſtic circle. My houſe would then be the reſidence of delight, unmingled with the anxieties of ambition or the regret of diſappiontment. Every act would be dictated by love and reſpect; every countenance would wear the ſmile of complacence; and the little unavoidable troubles, incident to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <div n="16" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XVI. EMILIA, or the Happineſs of Retirement.</head>
               <p>AS I was converſing with Emilia, a few days paſt, I aſked her whether ſhe was content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live ſo remote from the reſort of company. She anſwered in the affirmative, and remarked further, that her ſituation enabled her to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between <hi>real</hi> friends and <hi>complimentary;</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:019364_0083_0FAB4BCF9F9BE758"/>
for if ſhe lived in a more public place, ſhe might be viſited by crouds of people, who were civil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but had no motive for calling on them, but to ſpend an idle hour and gaze at the buſy multitude.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I was pleaſed with the remark, and was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally led to conſider ſuch a retired ſituation as a fortunate circumſtance for a young Lady of delicacy. Not only the happineſs of a family, but the character of young women, both in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſocial view, depends on a choice of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per company. But this is not all. The frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of company, eſpecially if it furniſhes a variety of new objects, has a pernicious effect on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of female minds.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Women are deſtined by nature to preſide over domeſtic affairs. Whatever parade they may make abroad, their <hi>real</hi> merit and <hi>real</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters are known only at home. The behaviour of ſervants, the neatneſs of furniture, the order of a table and the regularity of domeſtic buſineſs, are the deciſive evidences of female worth. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſweetneſs of temper does not contribute more to the happineſs of their partners and their families, than a proper attention to theſe articles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For this reaſon, whatever has a tendency to divert the mind from theſe concerns and give them a turn for empty ſhow, endleſs noiſe, and taſteleſs amuſements, ought to be carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by young Ladies, who wiſh for reſpect beyond the preſent moment. Miſſes, who are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſurrounded with idle company, or even live in ſight of it, though they may be fortunate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to preſerve their innocence, are ſtill in
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:019364_0084_0FAB4BD06D4D2718"/>
hazard of contracting ſuch a fondneſs for diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and folly, as to unfit them for the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of a family.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Such women, if they ever marry, muſt be unhappy themſelves, or render their families ſo. To indulge their former taſte for pleaſure, they muſt neceſſarily neglect the duties of their ſtation, and leave their families without a miſtreſs; or if they attempt to diſcharge thoſe duties, it muſt be at the expenſe of their prevailing deſires—a ſacrifice that muſt produce at leſt a temporary diſquietude in their own minds.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another danger to which young women, poſſeſſed of perſonal charms, are expoſed in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic places, is the flattery and admiration of men. The good opinion of a fop will hardly flatter a woman of diſcernment; much leſs their ordinary compliments which are commonly without mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But the heart is often ſo diſguiſed, that it is difficult at firſt to diſtinguiſh between a cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb and man of worth; or if it is eaſy for an accurate obſerver, yet there is great danger that vanity and inexperience will make young Ladies overlook the diſtinction.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Few minds are effectually ſecured againſt the attacks of flattery. It is a poiſon the more fatal, as it ſeizes human nature in its weakeſt part. In youth, when the paſſions are in full vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and the judgement feeble, female minds are peculiarly liable to be corrupted by the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious influence of pretty civilities and affected ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
               <p n="8">8. With whatever ſcruples they may at firſt
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:019364_0085_0FAB4BDDCD654688"/>
liſten to the praiſes that are beſtowed on their real or pretended charms, a conſtant ſtrain of flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing addreſſes, accompanied with obſequious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, ſeldom fails of giving them too high an opinion of themſelves. They are inſenſibly led to believe that they are poſſeſſed of virtues to which they are really ſtrangers. This belief ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies them without attempting any further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and makes them to depend, for repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in life, on good qualities, the fancied ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of which begins and ends with the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of cuſtomary compliments.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Such Ladies, before marriage, are uſually vain, pert, affected and ſilly; and after marriage, haughty diſappointed and peeviſh. The moſt perfect beauty muſt fade, and ceaſe to command admiration; but in moſt inſtances, the nuptial hour puts a period to that exceſs of flattering at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which is the happineſs of giddy females. The longeſt term of admiration muſt be ſhort; that which depends ſolely on perſonal attractions, is often momentary.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The more flattery is beſtowed upon young Ladies, the leſs, in general, are they ſolicitous to acquire virtues which ſhall enſure reſpect when admiration ſhall ceaſe. The more they are praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in youth, the more they expect it in advanced life, when they have leſs charms to command it. Thus the exceſſive complaiſance of admirers, which is extremely pleaſing at <hi>ſixteen,</hi> proves at <hi>forty,</hi> a ſource of mortification and diſcontent.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I would by no means inſinuate that young Ladies ought to be kept total ſtrangers to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:019364_0086_0FAB4BDDDB981258"/>
and to rational profeſſions of eſteem. It is in company only that they can acquaint themſeves with mankind, acquire an eaſy addreſs, and learn numberleſs little decor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ms which are eſſential and cannot be taught by precept. Without theſe, a woman will ſometimes deviate from that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and propriety of conduct, which, in any ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation will ſecure the good-will of her friends, and prevent the bluſhes of her huſband.</p>
               <p n="12">12. A fondneſs for company and amuſement is blameable only when it is indulged to exceſs, and permitted to abſorb more important concerns. Nor is ſome degree of flattery always dangerous or uſeleſs. The good opinion of mankind we are all deſirous to obtain; and to know that we poſſeſs it, often makes us ambitious to deſerve it.</p>
               <p>No paſſion is given to us in vain; the beſt ends are ſometimes effected by the worſt means; and even female vanity, properly managed, may prompt to the moſt meritorious actions.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I ſhould pay Emilia but a very ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to aſcribe her virtues to her local ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for no perſon can claim as a virtue what ſhe has been in no danger of loſing. But there is no retirement beyond the reach of temptation, and the whole tenor of her conduct proves that her unblemiſhed morals and uniform delicacy proceed from better principles than neceſſity or accident.</p>
               <p n="14">14. She is loved and flattered, but ſhe is not vain; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>JULIANA is one of thoſe rare women whoſe perſonal attractions have no rivals, but the ſweetneſs of her temper and the delicacy of her ſentiments. An elegant perſon, regular features, a fine complexion, a lively expreſſive counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, an eaſy addreſs, and thoſe bluſhes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty that ſoften the ſoul of the beholder; theſe are her native beauties, which render her the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of univerſal admiration. But when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with her, and hear the melting expreſſions of unaffected ſenſibility and virtue that flow from her tongue, her perſonal charms receive new luſtre, and irreſiſtibly engage the affections of her acquaintances.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Senſible that the great ſource of all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is purity of morals and an eaſy conſcience, Juliana pays conſtant and ſincere attention to the duties of religion. She abhors the infamous, but faſhionable vice of deriding the ſacred inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of religion. She conſiders a Lady without virtue as a monſter on earth; and every accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment.

without morals, as polite deception. She is neither a hypocrite nor an enthuſiaſt; on the contrary, ſhe mingles ſuch cheerfulneſs with the religious duties of life, that even her piety carries with it a charm, which inſenſibly allures the profligate from the arms of vice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not only the general tenor of her life, but in particular her behaviour at church, evinces the reality of her religion. She eſteems it not only criminal in a high degree, but extremely unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, to behave with levity in a place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the ſolemn purpoſes of devotion. She cannot believe that any perſon, who is ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to treat all mankind with civility, can laugh in the temple of Jehovah and treat her great benefactor with heedleſs neglect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In polite life, the manners of Juliana are peculiarly engaging. To her ſuperiors, ſhe ſhows the utmoſt defference and reſpect; to her equals, the moſt modeſt complaiſance and civility; while her in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>iors of every rank, experience her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affability. By this conduct ſhe ſecures the love and friendſhip of all degrees. No per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can deſpiſe her, for ſhe does nothing that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; ſhe cannot be hated, for ſhe does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to none; and even the malevolent whiſpers of envy are ſilenced by her modeſt deportment and generous condeſcenſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Her converſation is lively and ſentimental; free from falſe wit, frivolous minuteneſs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of learning. Although her diſcourſe is always under the direction of prudence, yet it appears unſtudied; for her good ſenſe always
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:019364_0089_0FAB4BE014C352A8"/>
furniſhes her with thoughts ſuited to the ſubject, and the purity of her mind renders any caution in expreſſing them almoſt unneceſſary. She will not lead the converſation; much leſs can ſhe ſtun the ears of company with perpetual chat or interrupt the diſcourſe of others. But when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offers, ſhe acquits herſelf with eaſe and grace; without the airs of pertneſs or the confuſion of baſhfulneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But if the converſation happens to turn upon the foibles of either ſex, Juliana diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers her goodneſs by her ſilence or by inventing palliations. She deteſts every ſpecies of ſlander. She is ſenſible that to publiſh and aggravate human errors, is not the way to correct them; and ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormation, rather than infamy, is the wiſh and the ſtudy of her life. Her own amiable example is the ſevereſt of all ſatires upon the faults and the follies of her ſex, and goes farther in diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing both, than all the cenſures of malicious detraction.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Altho' Juliana poſſeſſes every accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can command eſteem and admiration; yet ſhe has neither vanity nor oſtentation. Her merit is eaſily diſcovered without ſhow and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade. She conſiders, that haughtineſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of others, always proceed from meanneſs; that true greatneſs is ever acceſſible; and that ſelf recommendation and bluſtering pretenſions, are but the glittering decorations of empty heads and trifling hearts.</p>
               <p n="8">8. However ſtrong may be her deſire of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful information or however lively her curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:019364_0090_0FAB4BE0D6C331B8"/>
yet ſhe reſtrains theſe paſſions within the bounds of prudence and good breeding. She deems it impertinent to the higheſt degree, to be prying into the concerns of other people; much more impertinent and criminal does ſhe deem it, to indulge an officious inquiſitiveneſs, for the ſake of gratifying private ſpleen in the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of unfavourable truths. So exceedingly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate is ſhe in her treatment of her fellow creatures, that ſhe will not read a paper or hear a whiſper, which a perſon does not wiſh to have known, even when ſhe is in no danger of detection.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The ſame delicate attention to the feelings of others regulates her conduct in company. She would not, for the price of her reputation, be found laughing or whiſpering with one in the company. All nods, grimaces, fly looks and half ſpeeches, the cauſe of which is not known, are carefully avoided by her and reprobated as the height of ill breeding and the groſſeſt inſult to the company. Whenever this happens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two perſons, the reſt of the company have a juſt right to conſider themſelves the object of their ridicule. But it is a maxim of Juliana, that ſuch conduct is a breach of politeneſs, which, no oddities or miſtakes that happen in public com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, can excuſe or palliate.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It is very common for perſons, who are deſtitute of certain accompliſhments which they admire in other people, to endeavour to imitate them. This is the ſource of affectation, a fault that infallibly expoſes a perſon to ridicule. But
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:019364_0091_0FAB4BEFCE575F18"/>
the ornaments of the heart, the dreſs and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Juliana, are equally eaſy and natural. She needs not to aſſume the <hi>appearance</hi> of good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which ſhe poſſeſſes in <hi>reality;</hi> nature has given too many beauties to her perſon, to require the ſtudied embelliſhments of faſhion; and ſuch are the eaſe and gracefulneſs of her behaviour, that any attempt to improve them would leſſen the dignity of her manners.</p>
               <p n="11">11. She is equally a ſtranger to that ſuperci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious importance which affects to deſpiſe the ſmall, but neceſſary concerns of life; and that ſqueamiſh falſe delicacy which is wounded with every trifle. She will not neglect a ſervant in ſickneſs becauſe of the meanneſs of his employment; ſhe will not abuſe an animal for her own pleaſure and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor will ſhe go into fits at the diſtreſs of a favourite cat.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Her gentle ſoul is never diſturbed with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, envy or reſentment; thoſe turbulent paſſions which ſo often deſtroy the peace of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety as well as of individuals.</p>
               <p>The native firmneſs and ſerenity of her mind for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the intruſion of violent emotions; at the ſame time he heart, ſuſceptible and kind, is the ſoft reſidence of every virtuous affection. She ſuſtains the unavoidable ſhocks of adverſity, with a calmneſs that indicates the ſuperiority of her ſoul; and with the ſmile of joy or the tear of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe participates the pleaſures or the ſorrows of a friend.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But the diſcretion and generoſity of Julia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, are particularly diſtinguiſhed by the number
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:019364_0092_0FAB4BFC592921B0"/>
and ſincerity of her attachments. Her friendſhips are few, but they are all founded on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of benevolence and fidelity. Such confidence do her ſincerity, her conſtancy and her faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs inſpire, that her friends commit to her breaſt, their moſt private concerns, without reſerve and without ſuſpicion. It is her favourite maxim, that a neceſſity of exacting promiſes of ſecrecy, is a burleſque upon every pretenſion to friendſhip. Such is the character of the young, the amiable Juliana. If it is poſſible for her to find a man who knows her worth and has a diſpoſition and virtues to reward it, the union of their hearts muſt ſecure that unmingled felicity in life, which is reſerved for genuine love, a paſſion inſpired by ſenſibility and improved by a perpetual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of kind offices.</p>

                     <p>Sir Harry, I ſhould conſider the offer of a kingdom an inſult, if it were to be purchaſed by the violation of my word: Beſides, though my daughter ſhall never go a beggar to the arms of her huſband, I would rather ſee her happy than rich; and if ſhe has enough to provide handſomely for a young family, and ſomething to ſpare for the exigencies of a worthy friend, I ſhall think her as affluent as if ſhe were miſtreſs of Mexico.</p>

               <p>In almoſt every age, in repeated conflicts, and long and bloody wars, as well civil as foreign, againſt many and powerful nations, againſt the open aſſaults of enemies, and the more dangerous treachery of friends, have the inhabitants of your iſland, your great and glorious anceſtors, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their independence and tranſmitted the rights of men and the bleſſings of liberty to you their poſterity.</p>
               <p>Be not ſurprized therefore, that we, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the ſame common anceſtors, that we, whoſe forefathers participated in all the rights, the liberties and the conſtitution you ſo juſtly boaſt, and who have carefully conveyed the ſame fair inheritance to us, guarantied by the plighted faith of government, and the moſt ſolemn compacts with Britiſh Sovereigns, ſhould refuſe to ſurrender them to men, who found their claims on no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of reaſon, and who proſecute them with a deſign that by having <hi>our</hi> lives and property in ther power, they may with the greater facility enſlave <hi>you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The cauſe of America is now the object of univerſal attention: It is at length become very ſerious. This unhappy country has not only
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:019364_0153_0FAB4A0EDA3C33A8"/>
been oppreſſed, but abuſed and miſrepreſented; and the duty we owe to ourſelves and poſterity, to your intereſt, and the general welfare of the Britiſh empire, leads us to addreſs you on this very important ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Know then,</hi> THAT we conſider ourſelves, and do inſiſt that we are and ought to be, as free as our fellow ſubjects in Britain, and that no power on earth has a right to take our property from us without our conſent.</p>
               <p>That we claim all the benefits ſecured to the ſubject by the Engliſh conſtitution, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that ineſtimable one of trial by jury.</p>
               <p>That we hold it eſſential to Engliſh liberty, that no man be condemned unheard, or puniſhed for ſuppoſed offences, without having an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be heard in his defence.</p>
               <p>That we think the legiſlature of Great-Britain is not authoriſed by the conſtitution to eſtabliſh a religion, fraught with ſanguinary and impious tenets, or, to erect an arbitrary form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any quarter of the globe. Theſe rights, we, as well as you, deem ſacred. And yet, ſacred as they are, they have, with many others been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly and flagrantly violated.</p>
               <p>Are not the proprietors of the ſoil of Great-Britain lords of their own property? Can it be taken from them without their conſent? Will they yield it to the arbitrary diſpoſal of any man, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men whatever?—You know they will not.</p>
               <p>Why then are the proprietors of the ſoil of America, leſs lords of their property than you are of your's? or why ſhould they ſubmit it to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:019364_0154_0FAB4A1185CCB9D8"/>
of your parliament, or any other parliament or council in the world, not of their election? Can the intervention of the ſea that divides us, cauſe diſparity in rights, or can any reaſon be given, why Engliſh ſubjects who live three thouſand miles from the royal palace, ſhould enjoy leſs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty than thoſe who are three hundred miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from it?</p>
               <p>Reaſon looks with indignation on ſuch diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and freemen can never perceive their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. And yet however chimerical and unjuſt ſuch diſcriminations are, the parliament aſſert that they have a right to bind us in all caſes without exception, whether we conſent or not; that they may take end uſe our property when and in what manner they pleaſe; that we are penſioners on their bounty for all that we poſſeſs, and can hold it no longer than they vouchſafe to permit. Such declarations we conſider as heriſies in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh politics, and which can no more operate to deprive us of our property, than the interdicts of the Pope can diveſt Kings of ſceptres, which the laws of the land and the voice of the people have placed in their hands.</p>

<pb n="157" facs="unknown:019364_0155_0FAB4A12176359B8"/>
plan for enſlaving your fellow ſubjects in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca was concerted, and has ever ſince been pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly carrying into execution.</p>
               <p>Prior to this aera, you were content with draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from us the wealth produced by our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. You reſtrained our trade in every way that could conduce to your emolument. You exerciſed unbounded ſovereignty over the ſea. You named the ports and nations to which alone our merchandize ſhould be carried, and with whom alone we ſhould trade; and though ſome of theſe reſtrictions were grievous, we nevertheleſs did not complain; we looked up to you as to our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate, to which we were bound by the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est ties; and were happy in being inſtrumental to your proſperity and your grandeur.</p>
               <p>We call upon you yourſelves, to witneſs our loyalty and attachment to the common intereſt of the whole empire: Did we not, in the laſt war, add all the ſtrength of this vaſt continent to the force which repelled our common enemy? Did we not leave our native ſhores, and meet diſeaſe and death, to promote the ſucceſs of the Britiſh arms in foreign climes? Did you not thank us for our zeal, and even re-imburſe us large ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which, you confeſſed, we had advanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our proportion, and far beyond our abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? You did.</p>
               <p>To what cauſes then, are we to attribute the ſudden change of treatment, and that ſyſtem of ſlavery which was prepared for us at the reſtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of peace?</p>

which ever attend war, an attempt was made to drain this country of all its money, by the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſtamp-act. Paint, Glaſs, and other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, which you would not permit us to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of other nations, were taxed; nay, altho' no wine is made in any country, ſubject to the Britiſh ſtate, you prohibited our procuring it of foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, without paying a tax, impoſed by your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, on all we imported. Theſe and many other impoſitions were laid upon us moſt unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unconſtitutionally, for the expreſs purpoſe of raiſing a revenue.—In order to ſilence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, it was, indeed, provided, that this revenue ſhould be expended in America for its protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and defence.—The exactions, however, can receive no juſtification from a pretended neceſſity of protecting and defending us. They are laviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſquandered on court favourites, and miniſterial dependants generally avowed enemies to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and employing themſelves, by partial repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, to traduce and embroil the colonies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For the neceſſary ſupport of government here, we ever were and ever ſhall be ready to provide. And whenever the exigencies of the ſtate may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, we ſhall, as we have heretofore done, cheerfully contribute our full proportion of men and money. To enforce this unconſtitutional and unjuſt ſcheme of taxation, every fence that the wiſdom of our Britiſh anceſtors had carefully erected againſt arbitrary power, has been violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrown down in America, and the ineſtimable right of trial by jury taken away, in caſes that touch both life and property—It was ordained,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:019364_0157_0FAB4A13AB1C7020"/>
that whenever offences ſhould be committed in the colonies againſt particular acts impoſing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious duties and reſtrictions upon trade, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor might bring his action for the penalties in the Courts of Admiralty; by which means the ſubject loſt the advantage of being tried by an honeſt uninfluenced jury of the vicinage, and was ſubjected to the ſad neceſſity of being judged by a ſingle man, a creature of the Crown, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the courſe of a law, which exempts the proſecutor from the trouble of proving his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, and obliges the defendant either to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his innocence or to ſuffer. To give this new Judicatory the greater importance, and as, if with deſign to protect falſe accuſors, it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provided, that the Judge's certificate of their having been probable cauſes of ſeizure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, ſhall protect the proſecutor from acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at common law, for recovery of damages.</p>
               <p>By the courſe of our law, offences committed in ſuch of the Britiſh dominions in which courts are eſtabliſhed and juſtice duly and regularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered, ſhall be there tried by jury of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinage. There the offenders and the witneſſes are known, and the degree of credibility to be given to their teſtimony, can be aſcertained.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Let juſtice and humanity ceaſe to be the boaſt of your nation! Conſult your hiſtory, examine your records of former tranſactions; nay, turn to the annals of the many arbitrary ſtates and kingdoms that ſorround you, and ſhew us a ſingle inſtance of men being condemned to ſuffer for imputed crimes unheard, unqueſtioned, and

If it is difficult to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile theſe proceedings to the genius and temper of your laws and conſtitution, the taſk will become more arduous when we call upon our miniſterial enemies to juſtify, not only condemning men untried and by hearſay, but involving the innocent in one common puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the guilty, and for an act of thirty or forty, to bring poverty, diſtreſs and calamity on thirty thouſand ſouls, and thoſe not your enemies, but your friends, brethren and fellow-ſubjects.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It would be ſome conſolation to us, if the catalogue of American oppreſſions ended here. It gives us pain to be reduced to the neceſſity of reminding you, that under the confidence repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the faith of government, pledged in a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al charter from a Britiſh Sovereign, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers of the preſent inhabitants of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay, left their former habitations, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed that great, flouriſhing, and loyal colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Without incurring or being charged with a forfeiture of their rights, without being heard, without being tried, without law, and without juſtice, by an act of Parliament, their charter is deſtroyed, their liberties violated, their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and form of government changed: And all this upon no better pretence, than becauſe in one of their towns a treſpaſs was committed on ſome merchandize, ſaid to belong to one of the

               <p>Nor are theſe the only capital grievances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we labour. We might tell of diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, weak, and wicked Governors having been fet over us: of legiſlatures being ſuſpended for aſſerting the rights of Britiſh ſubjects—of needy and ignorant dependants on great men, advanced to the ſeats of juſtice, and to other places of truſt and importance; of hard reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on commerce, and a great variety of leſs evils, the recollection of which is almoſt loſt under the weight and preſſure of greater and more poignant calamities.</p>

from our intereſts, by civil as well as religious prejudices, that by their numbers daily ſwelling with catholic emigrants from Europe, and by their devotion to adminiſtration, ſo friendly to their religion, they might become formidable to us, and on occaſion be fit inſtruments in the hands of power, to reduce the ancient free Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant colonies to the ſame ſtate of ſlavery with themſelves.</p>
               <p>This was evidently the object of the act:—And in this view, being extremely dangerous to our liberty and quiet, we cannot forbear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of it, as hoſtile to Britiſh America—Super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Do not treat this as chimerical—Know that in leſs than half a century, the quit-rents reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the crown, from the numberleſs grants of this vaſt continent, will pour large ſtreams of wealth into the royal coffers, and if to this be added the power of taxing America at pleaſure, the crown will be rendered independent on you for ſupplies, and will poſſeſs more treaſure than may be neceſſary to purchaſe the <hi>remains</hi> of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in your iſland—In a word, take care you do not fall into the pit that is preparing for us.</p>

Be aſſured that theſe are not facts but calumnies.—Permit us to be free as yourſelves, and we ſhall ever eſteem an union with you to be our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt glory and our greateſt happineſs; we ever ſhall be ready to contribute all in our power to the wealſare of the empire—we ſhall conſider your enemies as our enemies, and your intereſt as our own.</p>
               <p>But if you are determined that your miniſters ſhall wantonly ſport with the rights of mankind,—If neither the conſtitution, or the ſuggeſtions of humanity can reſtrain your hands from ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding human blood in ſuch an impious cauſe, we muſt then tell you, that we never will ſubmit to be hewers of wood and drawers of water for any miniſtry or nation in the world.</p>
               <p>Place us in the ſame ſituation that we were at the cloſe of the laſt war, and our former harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will be reſtored.</p>

               <p>When the fortune of war, after a gallant and glorious reſiſtance, had incorporated you with the body of Engliſh ſubjects, we rejoiced in the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valuable addition, both on our own and your account; expecting, as courage and generoſity are naturally united, our brave enemies would become our hearty friends, and that the Divine Being would bleſs to you the diſpenſations of his over-ruling providence, by ſecuring to you and your lateſt poſterity the ineſtimable advantages of a free Engliſh conſtitution of government, which it is the privilege of all Engliſh ſubjects to enjoy.</p>
               <p>Theſe hopes were confirmed by the King's proclamation iſſued in the year 1763, plighting the public faith for your full enjoyment of thoſe advantages.</p>
               <p>Little did we imagine that any ſucceeding Miniſters would ſo audaciouſly and cruelly abuſe the royal authority, as to withold from you the fruition of the irrevocable rights to which you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But ſince we have lived to ſee the unexpected time, when miniſters of this flagitious temper have dared to violate the moſt ſacred compacts and obligations, and as you were educated under another form of government, have artfully been kept from diſcovering the unſpeakable worth of that form you are now undoubtedly entitl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, we eſteem it our duty, for the weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons herein after mentioned, to explain to you ſome of its moſt important branches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. "In every human ſociety," ſays the celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Marquis Beccaria, "there is an effort conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually tending to confer on one part the height of power and happineſs, and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakneſs and miſery. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of good laws is to oppoſe this effort, and to diffuſe their influence univerſally and equally."</p>
               <p>Rulers, ſtimulated by this pernicious "effort," and ſubjects, animated by the juſt "intent of oppoſing good laws againſt it," have occaſioned that vaſt variety of events, that fill the hiſtories of ſo many nations. All theſe hiſtories demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the truth of this ſimple poſition, that to live by the will of one man, or ſet or men, is the production of miſery to all men.</p>
               <p>On the ſolid foundation of this principle, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen reared up the fabric of their conſtitution with ſuch a ſtrength, as for ages to defy time, tyranny, treachery, internal and foreign wars: and, as an illuſtrious author<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eſquieu.</hi>
                  </note> of your nation, hereafter mentioned, obſerves, "They gave the
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:019364_0166_0FAB4A1F9FEE4548"/>
people of their colonies the form of their own government, and this government carrying proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity along with it, they have grown great nations in the foreſts they were ſent to inhabit."</p>
               <p>In this form the firſt grand right is, that of the people having a ſhare in their own govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by their repreſentatives, choſen by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in conſequence of being ruled by laws which they themſelves approve, not by edicts of men over whom they have no controul This is a bulwark ſurrounding and defending their property, which by their honeſt cares and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours they have acquired, ſo that no portion of it can be legally taken from them, but with their own full and free conſent, when they in their judgement deem it juſt and neceſſary to give them for public ſervices, and preciſely direct the eaſieſt, cheapeſt, and moſt equal methods in which they ſhall be collected.</p>
               <p>The influence of this right extends ſtill farther. If money is wanted by rulers, who have in any manner oppreſſed the people, they may retain it, until their grievances are redreſſed; and thus peaceably procure relief, without truſting to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed petitions, or diſturbing the public tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next great right is that of trial by jury. This provides, that neither life, liberty nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty can be taken from the poſſeſſor, until twelve of his unexceptionable countrymen and peers of his vicinage, who from that neigbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his character, and the character of the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:019364_0167_0FAB4A205B15C6E0"/>
witneſſes, upon a fair trial, and full enquiry face to face in open court, before us many people as chooſe to attend, ſhall paſs their ſentence upon oath againſt him; an oath that cannot injure him, without injuring their own reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and probably their intereſt alſo; as the queſtion may turn on points that, in ſome degree, concern the general welfare; and if it does not, their verdict may form a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that on a ſimilar trial of their own, may militate againſt them.</p>
               <p>Another right relates merely to the liberty of the perſon. If a ſubject is ſeized and impriſoned, though by order of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he may, by virtue of this right, immediately obtain a writ, termed a Habeas Corpus, from a Judge, whoſe ſworn duty is to grant it, and thereupon to procure any illegal reſtraint to be quickly enquired into and redreſſed.</p>
               <p>A fourth right is, that by holding lands by the tenure of eaſy rents, and not by rigorous and oppreſſive ſervices, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently forcing the poſſeſſors from their families and their buſineſs, to perform what ought to be done, in all well regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtates, by men hired for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The laſt right we ſhall mention regards the freedom of the preſs. The importance of this conſiſts, beſides the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of truth, ſcience, morality, and arts in general, in its diffuſion, of liberal ſentiments on the adminiſtration of Government, its ready communication of thoughts between ſubjects, and its conſequential promotion of union among them, whereby oppreſſive officers are ſhamed or intimidated into more honourable and juſt modes of conducting affairs.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the invaluable rights, that form a conſiderable part of our mild ſyſtem of government; that, ſending its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable energy through all ranks and claſſes of men, defends the poor from the rich, the weak from the powerful, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious from the rapacious, the peaceable from the violent, the tenants from the lords, and all from their ſuperiors.</p>
               <p n="4">4. These are the rights, without which a people cannot be free and happy, and under the protecting and encouraging in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of which, theſe Colonies have hitherto ſo amazingly flouriſhed and increaſed. Theſe are the rights a profligate Miniſtry are now ſtriving, by force of arms, to raviſh from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe are the rights <hi>you</hi> are entitled to, and ought at this

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſtipulated for your enjoyment of it. If laws, divine and human, could ſecure it againſt the deſpotic caprices of wicked men, it was ſecured before. Are the French laws in <hi>civil</hi> caſes reſtored? <hi>It ſeems ſo.</hi> But obſerve the cautious kindneſs of the Miniſters, who pretend to be your benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The words of the ſtatute are—that thoſe "laws ſhall be the rule, until they ſhall be <hi>varied</hi> or <hi>altered</hi> by any ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Governor and Council." Is the "certainty and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the <hi>criminal</hi> law of England, and its benefits and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages," commended in the ſaid ſtatute, and ſaid to "have been ſenſibly felt by you," ſecured to you and your deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants! No. They too are ſubjected to arbitrary <hi>"alterations"</hi> by the Governor and Council; and a power is expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of appointing "ſuch Courts of <hi>criminal, civil</hi> and <hi>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi> juriſdiction, as ſhall be thought proper."</p>
               <p>Such is the precarious tenure of mere <hi>will,</hi> by which you hold your lives and religion. The crown and its Miniſters are impowered, as far as they could be by Parliament, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh even the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> itſelf among you. Have you an Aſſembly compoſed of worthy men, elected by yourſelves, and in whom you can conſide, to make laws for you, to watch over your welfare, and to direct in what quantity, and in what manner, your money ſhall be taken from you? No. The power of making laws for you is lodged in the Governor and Council, all of them dependant upon, and removeable at the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of a miniſter.

               </head>
               <p>WHEN we take a ſurvey of mankind, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help curſing the wretch, who, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable miſfortunes of nature ſhall wilfully add the calamities of war. One would think there were evils enough in the world without ſtudying to encreaſe them, and that life is ſufficiently ſhort without ſhaking the ſand that meaſures it. The hiſtories of Alexander, and Charles of Sweden, are the hiſtories of human devils; a good man cannot think of their actions without abhorrence nor of their deaths without rejoicing. To ſee the bounties of heaven deſtroyed, the beautiful face of nature laid waſts, and the choiceſt works of creation and art tumbled into ruin, would fetch a curſe from the ſoul of piety itſelf. But in this country the aggravation is lengthened by a new combination of affecting circumſtances. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was young, and compared with other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:019364_0174_0FAB4A2729035420"/>
was virtuous. None but a Herod of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common malice would have made war upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy and innocence; and none but a people of the moſt finiſhed fortitude dared, under thoſe circumſtances, have reſiſted the tyranny. The natives, or their anceſtors, had fled from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer oppreſſions of England and with the induſtry of bees had changed a wilderneſs into a habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world. To Britain they were indebted for nothing. The country was the gift of Heaven, and God alone is their Lord and Sovereign.</p>
               <p>The time, Sir, will come when you, in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy hour, ſhall reckon up your miſeries by your murders in America. Life, with you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to wear a clouded aſpect. The viſion of pleaſurable deluſion is wearing away, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the barren wild of age and ſorrow. The poor reflection of having ſerved your king will yield you no conſolation in your parting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He will crumble to the ſame undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed aſhes with yourſelf, and have ſins enough of his own to anſwer for. It is not the farcical benedictions of a Biſhop, nor the cringing hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy of a court of chaplains, nor the formality of an act of Parliament, that can change guilt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to innocence, or make the puniſhment <hi>one</hi> pang the leſs. You may, perhaps be unwilling to be ſerious, but this deſtruction of the goods of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, this havoc of the human race, and this ſowing the world with miſchief, muſt be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for to him who made and governs it.

               <head>FRAGMENT of an original Letter on the ſlavery of the Negroes; written in the year 1776, by THOMAS DAY, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (Lately publiſhed in London.)</head>
               <p>I am extremely fearful of expreſſing myſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely upon ſo abſtract a ſubject, and muſt therefore, though with the hazard of prolixity, attempt to place it in a different light.—If you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any number of the human ſpecies aſſembled in ſome particular part of the globe, without any form of government eſtabliſhed among them, it is evident, that theſe individuals may either live together in ſuch a manner as to produce mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual comfort and aſſiſtance, or may be the cauſe of continual miſery to each other. No pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the mathematics can be inveſtigated with more preciſion than the methods of conduct which have theſe contrary tendencies. Every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which inclines one man to aſſiſt another, or to avoid giving him offence, or doing him an injury, muſt neceſſarily contribute to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welfare; which would be perfect, were theſe diſpoſitions cultivated in the greateſt poſſible degree. On the contrary, every diſpoſition which, either by fraud or violence, tends to interrupt the perſonal ſecurity of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:019364_0176_0FAB4A28CCBBDB70"/>
or deprive them of thoſe things which they have acquired by their induſtry, is detrimental to the ſum of happineſs, and would, if carried to the greateſt poſſible degree, entirely deſtroy that part of the ſpecies.—In this view of things, morality ariſes from neceſſity, and comprehends "certain rules of conduct founded upon the relations which beings endowed with particular faculties bear to each other; which rules, when properly obſerved, produce happineſs to ſociety; but when violated or neglected, as neceſſarily occaſion miſery, as fire or pointed ſubſtances excite pain, when they act too forcibly upon the nerves."</p>
               <p>I hardly think that the greateſt ſkeptic will deny theſe diſtinctions, founded upon facts as certain as the impreſſion of any material ſubſtance upon our ſenſes. If we now proceed a little farther, we ſhall find that the diſpoſitions, which produce theſe different kinds of conduct, are, by the moraliſts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by different names, and enforced by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent motives, according to their ſeveral ſystems; while natural religion adds its ſanctions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines us to believe that the Deity himſelf, who has diſplayed ſo great an attention to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and preſervation of his creatures here, may extend his benevolence to another ſtage of exiſtence and compenſate the evil ſometimes unmeritedly ſuffered below. But if we admit the evidence of revealed religion, the ſcheme of human things is perfect as it is auguſt; the clouds which overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed our horizon are diſſipated, and the gradual progreſs of triumphant virtue, through dangers and difficulties, to eternal happineſs, is diſplayed and aſcertained.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="179" facs="unknown:019364_0177_0FAB4A2958912B58"/>
2. Having laid down theſe principles, it is eaſy to apply them to the particular caſe in queſtion. Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is the abſolute dependance of one man upon another; and is, therefore, as inconſiſtent with all ideas of juſtice as deſpotiſm is with the rights of nature. It is a crime ſo monſtrous againſt the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies, that all thoſe that practiſe it deſerve to be extirpated from the earth. It is no little, indirect attack upon the ſafety and happineſs of our fellow creatures, but one that boldly ſtrikes at the foundation of all humanity and juſtice. Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers invade the property, and murderers, the life of human beings; but he that holds another man in bondage, ſubjects the whole ſum of his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to oppreſſion, bereaves him of every hope, and is, therefore, more deteſtable than a robber and aſſaſſin combined. But if no one who has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon feeling will commit the outrage, no one who has common ſenſe will attempt to juſtify it by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; ſince it would involve him in the groſſeſt and moſt inextricable contradictions. He muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that every man has, by nature, a right to live, yet that every other man has a right to rob him of it; that every man has an equal right to ſubſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet that every other may deprive him of all the means; and that while every individual is juſtified by nature and the Deity, in purſuing his own happineſs by all innocent methods, every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther individual is equally juſtified in making him miſerable. In ſhort, it is reducing every thing to the ſtate before deſcribed, from which right and juſtice are equally excluded.</p>
               <p>Of you, ſir, who ſay you have ſeveral ſlaves, I beg leave to aſk what are the rights you claim
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:019364_0178_0FAB4A2A164216F0"/>
over them? Is your power circumſcribed by no bounds, and are there particular beings who bring into the world all the rights which you yourſelf can pretend to, but have ſo entirely loſt them by being tranſported into another country, as to be beyond the protection both of nature and nature's God?</p>
               <p>Surely, ſir, unleſs I am deceived in you, you are a man both of honour and humanity. You ſtart at the idea of wanton and unprovoked barbarity. You would not murder a ſlave to ſhew your dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, nor maim him to prove your ſtrength; you would not daſh an inſant upon the ground to ſeed your dogs, even tho' he were black; nor would you rip up the belly of his mother while ſhe was ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, to improve your ſkill in anatomy. You neither would, nor <hi>dare</hi> you commit actions like theſe; you feel that you have no right to do them; or, if you have, that every other man has an equal and ſuperior right to deſtroy you like a beaſt of prey. What then are your rights? I anticipate your anſwer: You will feed and clothe your Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, you will treat them with humanity and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and then you have a right to a moderate advantage from their labours. All this, ſir, is well; and could I conceive you had ever acted in another manner, I ſhould never have troubled you with this tedious letter. While your negroes chooſe to ſtay with you upon theſe terms, this is a fair and equitable compact. But what if they ſhould chooſe to leave you, will you let them go? if you do, you are a man of honor, ſenſe, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; but I fear no Weſt-Indian.</p>
               <p>Are there no whips, no gibbets, no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more dreadful than death itſelf for contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:019364_0179_0FAB4A2ADBD23140"/>
ſlaves? And what is this but claiming the deteſtable power I have mentioned above, that of making other beings miſerable, for your intereſt or amuſement? Who, Sir, gave you a title to their labours, or a right to confine them to loathſome drudgery? and if you have no right to this, what are the puniſhments you pretend to inflict, but ſo many additional outrages? Has a robber a claim upon your life becauſe you withhold your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; or a raviſher to a woman's blood, becauſe ſhe defends her chaſtity! Either then prove your right to their labours, or acknowledge that the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments inſlicted upon fugitive ſlaves are a flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſult upon juſtice, humanity &amp; common ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Permit me, here, to examine for a moment the nature of the title by which you claim an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable property in the labours of your fellow creatures.—A wretch, devoid of compaſſion and underſtanding, who calls himſelf a king of ſome part of Africa, which ſuffers the calamity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequented by the Europeans, ſeizes his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſubjects or engages in an unneceſſary war to furniſh himſelf with priſoners; theſe are load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with chains, torn from all their comforts and connections, and driven (like beaſts to the ſlaughter houſe) down to the ſea ſhore, where the mild ſubjects of a Chriſtian government and a religious king are waiting to agree for the purchaſe, and to tranſport them to America. They are then thruſt by hundreds into an infectious hold of a ſhip, in which the greateſt part frequently periſh by diſeaſe, while the reſt are reſerved to experience the candour and humanity of American patriots—If you have never yet conſidered it, pauſe here for

a moment, and endeavour to impreſs upon your minds the feelings of a being full as ſenſible, and perhaps more innocent than you or I, which is thus torn in an inſtant from every thing that makes life agreeable; from country, friends and parents; from the intercourſe of mutual affection with miſtreſs, lover or child; which, poſſeſt of feelings more exquiſite than European hearts can conceive, is ſeparated forever from all it loves; that reduced to a depth of miſery, which even in the midſt of freedom and affluence, would be ſufficient to overwhelm the moſt hardened diſpoſition, inſtead of friends and comforters, and obſequions attendants, fees itſelf ſurrounded with unrelenting perſecutors and unpitying ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; wretches who by long intercourſe with miſery, are grown callous to its agonies; who anſwer tears with taunts, and complaints with torture!

                  </gap> duties, affections, and feelings of the human heart, are violated and inſulted; and thus you dare to call yourſelves the maſters of wretches whom you have acquired by fraud, and retain by violence! While I am tracing this practice, which you and every man who has been in the iſlands or the ſouthern colonies of America, know to be true, my aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment exceeds even my horror, to find it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that any one man ſhould ſeriouſly doubt whether an equitable title to hold human beings in bondage can be thus acquired.</p>
               <p>With what face, Sir, can he who has never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the rights of nature in another, pretend to claim them in his own favour? How dare the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the ſouthern colonies ſpeak of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and juſtice? Is money of ſo much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance than life? Or have the Americans ſhared the diſpenſing power of St. Peter's ſucceſſors, to excuſe their own obſervance of thoſe rules which they impoſe upon others? If there is an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot, ſigning reſolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other, brandiſhing a whip over his affrighted ſlaves.</p>

                  </gap>feiture.—Is it the antiquity, or the virtues, or the great qualities of the Engliſh Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, which conſtitutes the difference, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles them to rights from which they totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude more than a fourth part of the ſpecies?—Or do you chooſe to make uſe of that argument, which the great Monteſquieu has thrown out as the ſevereſt ridicule, that they are black and you white; that you have lank, long hair, while theirs is ſhort and woolly?</p>
               <p>The more attentively you conſider this ſubject, the more clearly you will perceive, that every plea, which can be advanced upon it, is the plea of intereſt and tyranny combating humanity and truth. You cannot hide from your ſelf, that every title you can alledge muſt be a title founded upon fraud or violence, and ſupported by open and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed injuſtice, that a man who is born free can never forfeit his inheritance by ſuffering op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and that it is a contradiction to urge a purchaſe of what no one has a right to ſell? Nor does it make any difference whether the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate victims paſs from one to another, or from one to a thouſand maſters, any more than whether a nation be enſlaved by a firſt, or by hundredth ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. There can be no preſcription againſt truth and juſtice; and the continuance of the evil is ſo far from juſtifying, that it is an exaggeration of the crime. What would you ſay to a man in private life, who ſhould pretend to be no thief, becauſe he
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:019364_0183_0FAB4A2E97D3CEC8"/>
only bought ſtolen goods; or that he was no vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, becauſe he did not forge a deed himſelf, but only paid another to do it, and enjoyed the eſtate by that honourable ſecurity? Yet this is literally the title which the Americans plead to the unfortunate inhabitants of Africa. You do not go to Africa to buy or ſteal your Negroes; perhaps, becauſe you are too lazy and luxurious: but you encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage an infamous pitileſs, race of men to do it for you, and conſcientiouſly receive the fruits of their crimes. You do not, merciful men, reduce your fellow creatures to ſervitude! No, men of your independent ſpirits, that have taken up arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the government that had protected and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed them, rather than pay a tax of three-pence; that have laid the axe to the root of all human au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and inſtead of drinking the bitter waters of civil abuſes and preſcriptive obedience, have aſcended to the living fountains of truth, juſtice and nature, would never make flagitious attempts upon the liberties and happineſs of their brethren! Yes, gentlemen, men of liberal minds like yours, acknowledge all mankind to be their equals.—Leave hereditary tyrants and their flatterers to make diſtinctions unknown to nature, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade one part of the ſpecies to brutes, while they equal the other with gods!—You know that this is the greateſt of all corruptions, and as ſuch you deteſt it.—What! are not all men naturally equal? And are not all civil diſtinctions, when legitimate, the permission of the people, and conſequently ſubordinate to their power and controul? Did you not carry the rights of men into the uncultivated deſert and the howling wilderneſs? Not of
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:019364_0184_0FAB4A2F789ABCE8"/>
Frenchmen, nor of Germans, nor of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but of men;—men, the firſt and ſupreme diſtinction, who, created for freedom and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tranſport to every ſoil the inherent preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of their nature.</p>
               <p>Yes, gentlemen, as you are no longer Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I hope you will pleaſe to be men; and, as ſuch, admit the whole human ſpecies to a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your unalienable rights. You will not, therefore, drag a trembling wretch from his cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and his family; you will not tear the child from the arms of his frantic mother, that they may drag on a loathſome exiſtence in miſery and chains; you will not make depredations upon your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offending neighbours, and after having ſpread de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation over a fertile country, reduce the innocent inhabitants to ſervitude. To do this, you muſt be monſters, worſe, I fear, than a majority of the Houſe of Commons and the Engliſh Miniſtry.—But you are men tremblingly alive to all the rights and feelings of the kind, and I believe ſome of you at leſt are Chriſtians. Your worſt actions therefore, the greateſt crimes which even your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies can object, are only that you are the voluntary cauſes of thoſe miſchiefs?—You en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Engliſh pirate to violate the laws of faith and hoſpitality, and ſtimulate him to new exceſſes by purchaſing the fruits of his rapine—Your avarice is the torch of treachery and civil war, which deſolates the ſhores of Africa and ſhakes deſtruction on half the majeſtic ſpecies of man.</p>
