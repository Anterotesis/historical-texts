            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Honourable Judge SEWALL.</head>
            <p>THE ESSAY now before you, was made, becauſe you have been Exerciſed with ſome Funerals in your Family; and eſpecially One of a <hi>Daughter,</hi> falling Suddenly into the Arms of <hi>Death,</hi> a few Days after ſhe had comforted you with the <hi>Birth</hi> of her Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Infant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auſtin</hi> makes it his comfortable Obſervation, That when Good Men are <hi>in Mourning,</hi> or under any Calamity, they have Good Men at hand with Conſolations. <hi>Ad ſunt Boni Homines, qui flere cum flentibus norunt;</hi> and ſo, <hi>Leniuntur Aſpera, relevantur Gravia, et Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perantur Adverſa.</hi> T'wil be a Favour to me, if I may be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe <hi>Boni Homines,</hi> who do the part of your Friends on ſuch occaſions. I ſhall, if a moſt hearty Affection to you and yours, and <hi>Weeping with you and them,</hi> can declare me ſo.</p>
            <p>It was notably Propoſed by <hi>Tully</hi> to his <hi>Atticus; Conſolationum multae ſunt viae; ſed illa rectiſſima, Impetret</hi> Ratio <hi>quod</hi> Dies <hi>impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura eſt.</hi> This his Propoſal, That <hi>Reaſon,</hi> without an <hi>Higher Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> ſhould <hi>Immediately</hi> do that in a way of <hi>Conſolation,</hi> which <hi>Length of Time</hi> uſes to do, with a longer &amp; more tedious Procedure, is, <hi>To waſh an Ethiopian.</hi> And it is related by <hi>Plutarch</hi> accordingly, concerning this Pretender to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> That when his Daughter <hi>Tulliola</hi> died, <hi>Mortem indigniſſime tulit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are furniſhed with the <hi>Higher Principle</hi> of RELIGION; and you are acquainted with the <hi>Great Conſolations of GOD,</hi> which you know how to apply on the proper occaſions. <hi>Theſe will do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> tell us, That <hi>Nature</hi> by <hi>Length of Time</hi> changes one Metal into another; but their Skill and Boaſt is to Accelerate the Endeavours of <hi>Nature,</hi> and Haſten <hi>at Once</hi> the Effect, which elſe
<pb facs="unknown:001467_0003_0FB34ABCEC972170"/>
would have been a very long while producing. Thus, <hi>Religion</hi> will with much more certainty <hi>at Once</hi> bring about that Victory over Sorrow, and fix the Mind in that <hi>Golden Temper,</hi> which elſe would not be ſo ſoon accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>For your Aſſiſtence in that <hi>Work of Chriſtianity,</hi> You have called for a Copy of my Eſſay; which now wears a Name, that may ſignify, <hi>The Conſolations of GOD;</hi> and it was my Duty to let it wait upon you.</p>
            <p>I Remember Two Paſſages in an <hi>Epiſtle Conſolatory,</hi> of the Great <hi>Grotius</hi> unto the Baron <hi>Maurier,</hi> on the Death of a Relative, which I thought not unworthy to be Remembred, and now Repeted.</p>
            <p>The One is; <hi>Confer now with the Dead, and Peruſe BOOKS with greater Diligence than ever. BOOKS will not only give you a Safe Retreat from the Fury of your Enemy, but will arm you alſo againſt the Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Other is, <hi>I am aſſured, there can be no better Remedy applied unto Sorrow, than that which the Great Phyſician of Souls, among the infinite Treaſures of Saving Wiſdom, has brought down from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold, a Little <hi>Book,</hi> which preſents you with theſe beſt of <hi>Remedies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the Cuſtom of my Memorable Grand-father COTTON, to Read Something of his moſt valuable &amp; venerable CALVIN, in his Evening Studies; for which he would ſay, <hi>I love to ſweeten my Mouth, with a piece of</hi> CALVIN, <hi>before I go to Sleep.</hi> I know, you love your Incomparable CALVIN, as much as the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians,</hi> and <hi>High fliers,</hi> do Hate him; and you are a Great Reader of him. To ſuch a <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> it will not be Ungrateful for me, (who am one too) to recite theſe two Paſſages, from a Sermon of his, upon that Paragraph in <hi>Job,</hi> from whence the <hi>Text</hi> of mine is taken.</p>
            <p>The firſt, this. <hi>Sedulo notemus, nobis Perplexis et Anxijs nihil Supereſſe, quo Tranquillitatem Conſequamur, niſi ut Deus nos Pacatos, et Contentos reddat; quod Beneficium, Pluris facere quam caetera omnia, debemus. Deus Seſe modo oſtendat, et ſtatim Turbae omnes diſcutientur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond, this. <hi>Hoc autem in Praxi magis quam in verbis conſiſtit; Nam qui ad Deum confugiunt, norunt quanti ſint Conſolationes, et quantum ad nos Pacandos valeant.</hi> With this Piece of CALVIN, I take leave; and Subſcribe,</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>JOB XV. 11.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Are the Conſolations of <hi>GOD,</hi> Small with thee?</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is a Smart Queſtion! And it is a Matter of <hi>no Small</hi> Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>no Small</hi> Horror, that we generally afford ſo <hi>Great</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to be rebuked with ſuch a Queſtion. The Rebuke may be more juſtly given to <hi>us,</hi> than it was to <hi>Job,</hi> the Upright and Patient Servant of the Lord. A man enough to have made any <hi>Arabia</hi> the <hi>Happy,</hi> by his Illuminating of it; and yet a Man greatly Miſconſtrued, Cenſured, Reproached. We have the Story of him in a <hi>Poem,</hi> which had an <hi>Hiſtorical Foundation;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the <hi>Poem</hi> or no, for the comfort of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, while he was yet among the <hi>Midianites,</hi> cannot be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. It may, that <hi>Senault</hi> ſayes true, <hi>No Book in the World, is nobler in Expreſſions, richer in Deſcriptions, more generous in Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or more natural in Compariſons.</hi> The Friends of this rare man, too Angry &amp; Froward ones! had been counſelling of him, to Turn from the <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> whereof they would needs, upon cauſe little enough, ſuſpect him to be Guilty. They had been comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him alſo with Hopes to find Favour with God upon his Turn. He endeavours his own <hi>Vindication</hi> from the Suſpicion of his
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001467_0005_0FB34ABFA56355B8"/>
Friends: His juſt <hi>Vindication,</hi> does but add unto the <hi>Irritation.</hi> So tis, when men Reſolve, that nothing ſhall ſatisfy them! They miſinterpret him, as if he had Rejected the <hi>Encouragements</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to GOD, which they had ſet before him. The <hi>Expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on this occaſion (made, as <hi>Mercer</hi> thinks, with State enough!) is this; <hi>Are the Conſolations of God Small with thee?</hi> The Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, is well expreſſed by the Incomparable <hi>Calvin; Si quid tale aliquis committerit, merito haberetur ſuperbus, et Dei Gratiae contemptor non ferendus.</hi> In ſhort, Intolerable the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> of doing ſo. Whatever miſtake there might be in their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the cenſured Servant of God, I will ſee, that there ſhall be no miſtake in my Application of the Words, unto the purpoſe of the DOCTRINE, which I am going to take into my Hands.</p>
            <p>Tis this,
<q>Very Great are the Provocations of Men unto <hi>GOD,</hi> when the Conſolations of <hi>GOD</hi> are but Small unto them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Conſolations of</hi> GOD appear <hi>Little</hi> to us, our <hi>Indiſcretion</hi> is more than a <hi>Little;</hi> our <hi>Iniquity</hi> more than a <hi>Little.</hi> When the <hi>Conſolations of</hi> GOD are of <hi>Small</hi> Account with men, or make <hi>Little Impreſſion</hi> on them, have <hi>Little Efficacy</hi> on them, tis a <hi>Sign</hi> and a <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>no Small Evil</hi> in them; of more than a Little <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Three Aſſertions</hi> to be advanced and maintained. When we have Eſtabliſhed our <hi>Three Aſſertions,</hi> we ſhall be ready to bring on a very <hi>forcible Expoſtulation,</hi> with ſome <hi>Right words,</hi> wherein it will be well, if we don't find our ſelves all concerned.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> There are <hi>Conſolations of</hi> GOD, belonging unto all the People of God; offered unto all the Children of Men. <hi>Comfortable things</hi> are to be Enjoy'd by all <hi>Good Men;</hi> The Enjoyment of thoſe <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Things</hi> is tendered unto <hi>all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will preſently tell you <hi>What</hi> theſe <hi>Conſolations</hi> are. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well come to thee until we firſt of all take Notice <hi>Whoſe</hi> they are.</p>
            <p>Take Notice then, in the firſt Place, That all <hi>True Conſolations</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:001467_0006_0FB34AC1C7FC24C8"/>
are the <hi>Conſolations of</hi> GOD. We read, 2 Cor. I. 3. <hi>He is the God of all Comfort.</hi> There are <hi>Comfortable Creatures; Comforts</hi> in <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> But they are no further ſo, than GOD ſhall pleaſe to make them ſo. All <hi>Creatures</hi> otherwiſe at the beſt, are but <hi>Miſerable Comforters.</hi> The Great GOD has more Sublime, Celeſtial, Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous <hi>Conſolations</hi> for us, than any of this World; <hi>Conſolations</hi> of a Finer Compoſition, than any this World can afford <hi>Matter</hi> for. Indeed ſome Interpreters as old as the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> thus carry the Senſe of the clauſe, I am now Preaching upon; q. d. <hi>Is it not an eaſy thing with God to Comfort thee?</hi> And if we do find any <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations</hi> in any Entertainments, which this World may afford unto us, they ſtill are <hi>Gifts</hi> of GOD; <hi>the Things which</hi> GOD <hi>has graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly given to His Servant!</hi> They are <hi>Conſolations,</hi> which GOD has provided; and they would not have the leaſt Reliſh of <hi>Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in them, if GOD ſhould not enable us to reliſh them. We read, Job XXXIV. 29. <hi>When He gives Quietneſs, who then can make Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? And when He hides His Face, who then can behold Him?</hi> I will ſay, If GOD withold Conſolations, who is there that can Pretend to <hi>Comfort?</hi> Indeed the Beſt Things in the World, without GOD, are but as <hi>Luther</hi> Elegantly called them, <hi>Conſolatiunculae creaturulae:</hi> Very Diminutive Conſolations! Abundance of <hi>Duty,</hi> will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ariſe unto us from this Acknowledgment.</p>
            <p>Would we be made Partakers of any <hi>Conſolations?</hi> Go to GOD for them. Truſt in GOD for them. Keep in Good Terms with GOD. O all you, who Deſire <hi>Comfort;</hi> Do not <hi>Offend</hi> GOD, if you would have Him to <hi>Comfort</hi> you. All <hi>Comfort</hi> is loſt and gone and Confiſcated, when we ly under the <hi>Anger</hi> of GOD. Are we made Partakers of any Conſolations? O <hi>Comforted</hi> Ones; Own them to be the Conſolations of GOD. Give GOD the Glory of them; Glorify GOD, as the Author and Giver of them.</p>
            <p>I am now ready to Proceed on my Eſſay, to declare, <hi>What</hi> are the Conſolations of GOD?</p>
            <p>Inexpreſſible <hi>Conſolations!</hi> All that we can <hi>Expreſs</hi> of them, is only in ſome General Heads, whereof we have been adviſed from the <hi>Lively Oracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001467_0007_0FB34AC2A34330F0"/>Firſt; There are <hi>Conſolations of</hi> GOD, in the PROMISES, which the <hi>Covenant</hi> of GOD, has made unto the Godly. The Lord gave that order of old; <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my People, ſaith your God; Speak ye comfortably to them!</hi> Ah, Lord, Thou haſt thy ſelf in thy Word, moſt graciouſly, and marvellouſly done ſo! The <hi>Covenant</hi> of GOD &amp; of Grace, is made up of Conſolations. The Words of GOD in this <hi>Covenant,</hi> are thoſe whereof we may ſay, as in Zech. I. 13. <hi>They are good Words, and comfortable Words.</hi> It is in the Sacred Scriptures, that we have this <hi>comfortable Covenant;</hi> and we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, Rom. XV. 4. Of, <hi>The comfort of the Scriptures.</hi> There are <hi>Very Great and Precious Promiſes</hi> in the Word of GOD. The <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> gives a Man, a claim to theſe <hi>Promiſes; Promiſes</hi> both for the <hi>Life that now is,</hi> and for the <hi>Life that is to come.</hi> Theſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> are ſo many <hi>Breaſts of Conſolation.</hi> Can it be any other than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, to underſtand, That we have an Alſufficient CHRIST, for our Healer, and Helper and Refuge? This Conſolation <hi>of</hi> GOD is given unto them that have the <hi>Fear of</hi> GOD. We read, Mal. IV. 2. <hi>Unto you that fear my Name ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with Healing in His Wings.</hi> What a Conſolation muſt it be to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, That the ANGELS of Heaven, ſhall alwayes be Watching and Working for our Good? The Fear of God will Entitle us to this Conſolation of GOD. We read; Pſal. XXXIV. 7. <hi>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord Encampeth round about them that fear Him, to deliver them.</hi> Is it not a Conſolation, to underſtand, That we ſhall want no Good Thing? They that Fear God have this Conſolation of GOD. We read; Pſal. XXXIV. 9, 10. <hi>O Fear the Lord, Ye His Saints, for there is no want to them that fear Him. — They that Seek the Lord, ſhall not want any Good Thing.</hi> — But, what ſhall we ſay? The <hi>Promiſes</hi> of GOD, are Big with all the Conſolations Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; with Conſolations beyond all Imagination. They that are the <hi>Heirs of the Promiſes,</hi> Verily, they are the <hi>Heirs of Conſolations.</hi> Take the <hi>Sum</hi> of the Conſolations; the <hi>Sum</hi> of all Conſolations; Pſal. LXXXIV. 11. <hi>The Lord God is a Sun and a Shield; the Lord will give Grace &amp; Glory; no Good thing will He withold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> O COVENANT of GOD! What an Inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mine of Conſolations art thou!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001467_0008_0FB34AC42EA2E378"/>Secondly. There are <hi>Conſolations of</hi> GOD, in the PLEASURES of PIETY; the <hi>Comforts</hi> which naturally reſult from a <hi>Pious Life.</hi> We read concerning the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi> Prov. III. 17. <hi>Her wayes are wayes of Pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi> It is moſt certain; The wayes of <hi>Piety,</hi> are ways of <hi>Pleaſancy.</hi> Ah, my Young People; when you have thought, that the ways of <hi>Religion,</hi> were Severe, Auſtere, Moroſe, and <hi>Melancholy</hi> wayes; That you muſt never See a <hi>cheerful Minute</hi> more, after you become <hi>Seriouſly Religious;</hi> It was a <hi>Lying Devil</hi> which told you ſo: <hi>Believe him not;</hi> His lyes are full of <hi>Abominations.</hi> True PIETY, I tell you truly, tis attended with the moſt Enviable <hi>Conſolations!</hi> We read; Pſal. CXXXVIII. 5. <hi>They ſhall Sing in the wayes of the Lord.</hi> If we might envy the Conſolations of any man Living, it ſhould be the man who <hi>Exerciſes himſelf to keep a Conſcience void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards Man.</hi> There is a <hi>Continual Feaſt</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Conſcience.</hi> No wicked man ever knows any Delights comparable to thoſe, wherein that man is continually bathing himſelf, who daily <hi>Delights himſelf in God. Innocency</hi> is accompanied with <hi>Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Sirs, would you arrive to matchleſs <hi>Conſolations?</hi> Hate all Sin; Shun all Sin; Mourn for it, when overtaken with it; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with GOD; Be full of Zeal to improve in the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God, and the <hi>Image</hi> of God; and be alwayes <hi>at Work</hi> for God. Be fill'd with Benevolence, and Beneficence towards MEN: Have compaſſion on all the Afflicted; Scatter your <hi>Alms</hi> like the Showres of Heaven; Be Serviceable to every one on all occaſions; with unſpeakable Raptures of Goodneſs, watch for all occaſions. This <hi>Walk with God,</hi> will be a <hi>Pleaſant Walk;</hi> No <hi>Eden</hi> has any that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals it. There is a certain <hi>Symphony</hi> and <hi>Harmony</hi> with <hi>Heaven</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Walk.</hi> The Conſolations of it, are <hi>Wonderful! Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!</hi> They that keep cloſe to the ways of God, are <hi>Children of Light.</hi> There is a <hi>Light of God</hi> ſhining upon their ways, and into their Minds. No words can paint out the <hi>Conſolations</hi> of this <hi>Light!</hi> Blind Sinner, I cannot make thee apprehend this <hi>Light.</hi> Oh! That thou wouldeſt <hi>Come and See!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001467_0009_0FB34AC674876340"/>Thirdly. There are <hi>Conſolations of</hi> GOD, in the ASSURAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CES, with which the <hi>Sealed Souls</hi> of Believers are ſometimes <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted of God.</hi> I know, this will be derided as <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> with the Sons of <hi>Profaneneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But it is very ſure; The SPIRIT of GOD is the COMFORTER of them who belong unto Him. There is upon the Hearts of the Faithful a Work of that Holy Spirit, which is called, <hi>A Sealing Work.</hi> Of that work we read; Eph. IV. 30. <hi>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are Sealed unto the Day of Redemption.</hi> Oh! the Refined <hi>Conſolations</hi> of a Soul <hi>Sealed</hi> by the Holy Spirit of God! The Spirit of God firſt imprints upon the Mind of a Chriſtian, the infallible <hi>Marks,</hi> of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi> and of an Heirſhip to a <hi>Crown of Life.</hi> He then gives the Believer a <hi>Sight</hi> of theſe <hi>Marks;</hi> and fills him with the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which belong to a <hi>Regenerate</hi> and <hi>Reconciled</hi> State; fills him with <hi>Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi> No Tongue is able to utter the <hi>Conſolations</hi> of a Mind, whom the Holy Spirit of GOD <hi>Irradiates</hi> with a Perſwaſion and Aſſurance, of an Intereſt in the Special Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God. The Holy SPIRIT of God, often aſſures the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinner of His Mercy to him; and ſayes, as in Math. IX. 2. <hi>Child, Be of Good cheer, thy Sins be forgiven thee.</hi> Oh! the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of a <hi>Pardoned Penitent!</hi> The <hi>Electing,</hi> the <hi>Redeeming,</hi> the <hi>Pardoning Love</hi> of God, is often Powerfully brought home, unto thoſe who are Watchful, Fruitful, <hi>Holy in all manner of Converſation.</hi> The Holy SPIRIT, with a Powerful Satisfaction tells him, <hi>Thou art a Child of God! God has loved thee with an Everlaſting love; and as a Token of it, He has enkindled in thy Heart a vehement Flame of Love to Him.</hi> He tells him; <hi>Thou haſt made choice of God for thy Portion; But God firſt choſe thee for One of His People.</hi> He tells him; <hi>Thou haſt given thy ſelf unto thy Redeemer; But God the Father firſt gave thee unto Him.</hi> He tells him; <hi>Thy Sins are all become lotheſome to thee; The Death of thy Sins, is to thy Soul, a Bleſſing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Life it ſelf. Tis a Token from God, that thy Sins are all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee.</hi> Can any <hi>Conſolations</hi> be equal unto theſe? Methinks, one ſo Comforted of God, cannot but fall into <hi>Extaſies!</hi> The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of God,</hi> will make him to ſing; Iſa. XII. 1. <hi>O Lord, I will
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001467_0010_0FB34ACA979D1AE0"/>
Praiſe thee; Tho' thou waſt Angry with me, thine Anger is turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and thou doſt comfort me.</hi> One over-powered, and even over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with ſuch <hi>Conſolations,</hi> muſt be diſſolved into Tears of Joy, and cry out, <q>Oh! What will my Glorious Father Pleaſe to do with me! Lord, I am Thine! Lord, Thou art Mine! My Father will never leave off to do me Good: He will guide me by Counſil, and bring me to Glory. Oh! my Father, and my Saviour; what ſhall I render to thee?</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is one Remark to be made on the <hi>Special Seaſon</hi> in which there uſes to be a Grant of ſuch Conſolations. The Sovereign Lord of all, diſpenſes the Conſolations when He Pleaſes. But yet; Are we Raiſed unto ſome <hi>Exerciſe of Grace,</hi> in an uncommon Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? A <hi>Victory</hi> over Hideous <hi>Temptations?</hi> A <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> unto cruel <hi>Enemies?</hi> A <hi>Reſignation</hi> to the will of God in <hi>Grievous Events?</hi> Are we <hi>Patient</hi> under heavy <hi>Trials?</hi> Are we <hi>Pleaſed</hi> with <hi>Sufferings</hi> for the Cauſe, the Word, the Day of God? Are we Glad, Glad of any <hi>Conformity</hi> to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> tho' in the moſt Abaſing Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? NOW is a <hi>Special Seaſon;</hi> for the SPIRIT of the Holy One, to come in upon His Faithful Servants, with more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Conſolations. Now, <hi>Rejoyce &amp; be Exceeding Glad,</hi> ſayes our Saviour. This has been in all Ages, the Experience of the Faithful; 2 Cor. I. 5. <hi>As the Sufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our Conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt.</hi> Hence, <hi>The Conſolations of the Martyrs,</hi> theſe are become a <hi>Proverb in Iſrael!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it poſſible to aſcend any Higher, in the Conſolations of GOD? Yes; From an <hi>Earneſt</hi> and <hi>Foretaſte</hi> of Heaven, we may aſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and Laſtly; There are <hi>Conſolations of</hi> GOD, moſt Bleſſed Conſolations, reſerved for us in the Heavenly BLESSED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS. HEAVEN, tis Conſolation in the Conſummation of it. The Departed <hi>Spirit</hi> of a Good Man, is tranſported into the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> of GOD. When he is in that Paradiſe, we read; Luk. 16.25. <hi>He is Comforted.</hi> Ere long the Dead <hi>Children of God,</hi> arrive to a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the Dead. The <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was, in the ancient Language of the Orient, called, <hi>The Conſolation.</hi> In the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001467_0011_0FB34ACBAA2CF388"/>
we are furniſhed with Conſolations; we are adviſed; 1. Theſ. IV. 18. <hi>Comfort one another with theſe Words.</hi> But, Oh! what Conſolations of God ſhall we receive, when we Enter into the <hi>Holy City,</hi> the <hi>Heaven of Heavens!</hi> In that City, there is <hi>Fulneſs of Joy.</hi> The <hi>Joy</hi> of a full <hi>Harveſt,</hi> of all our Tears, all our Devotions, all our Bounties, and all our Troubles! The Conſolations of having a <hi>Sight</hi> of GOD in His CHRIST, and of being <hi>made like unto Him!</hi> The Conſolations of a <hi>Society,</hi> with the <hi>Innumerable Company of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits of Juſt men made Perfect!</hi> The Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that CITY! I remember what we read, 1. Cor. II. 9. <hi>It hath not Gone up, [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] in the Heart of man to conceive.</hi> The word is Emphatical; to intimate, that they who have the moſt <hi>Lofty Conceptions,</hi> the moſt <hi>Raiſed Affections,</hi> yet cannot comprehend in their Thoughts, their Wiſhes, their Deſires, the Conſolations which <hi>God has prepared for them that Love Him!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are provided ſuch Conſolations to Encourage us in the Service of God.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> The Conſolations of the Great GOD, Really are <hi>no Small Conſolations.</hi> No; as we read; Pſal. XXXI. 19. <hi>O how Great is thy Goodneſs, which thou haſt laid up for them that fear thee!</hi> So we may ſay; <hi>O how Great</hi> are the Conſolations, which the Great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God has laid up, to Invite and Reward our <hi>Fear</hi> of His Name! They muſt be <hi>Great Conſolations,</hi> that ſuch a <hi>Great</hi> GOD, has to beſtow upon thoſe whom He will have to be <hi>Comforted. None teaches like Him;</hi> and none <hi>Comforts</hi> like Him! Indeed, the Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Name of GOD upon them, (as upon <hi>Men,</hi> upon <hi>Trees,</hi> upon <hi>Hills,</hi> and the like, in the Scripture often,) may do the part of an <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> to ſignify the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt. The <hi>Conſolations of</hi> GOD are GREAT for the NUMBER of them. Truly, in the Conſolations of God, we have a <hi>Remedy</hi> for every <hi>Malady.</hi> We read, Pſal. XCIV. 19 <hi>In the multitude of my Thoughts within me, thy Comforts delight my Soul.</hi> Tho' we have a <hi>Multitude</hi> of <hi>Griefs,</hi> a <hi>Multitude</hi> of <hi>Cares,</hi> a <hi>Multitude</hi> of <hi>Wants;</hi> God hath ſuited them all, with a <hi>Multitude of Conſolations;</hi> Adapted Conſolations for every One of them all. There are the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001467_0012_0FB34ACD2399FBB0"/>
Conſolations of God agreeable to all our Conditions; Conſolations in Temporals, and Conſolations in Spirituals; Conſolations from the Dew of Heaven, and Conſolations from the Fat of the Earth. I muſt ſay, as the Apoſtle in another caſe, <hi>The Time would fail me to mention them.</hi> I call to mind, how <hi>Jerom</hi> of old Eſſay'd the Sum of them; <hi>Paupertatem times; ſed Bonos Pauperes Chriſtus appellat. Labore terreris; Nemo Athleta ſine ſudoribus coronatur. De cibo cogitas; ſed Fides Famem non timet. Deus ipſe omnium Rector ac Dominus, cum omni Angelorum militia certamen tuum expectat; Tibi contra Diabolum dimicanti parat aeternitatis coronam.</hi> — Say, That Chriſt <hi>Calls the Poor happy;</hi> Say, That all our <hi>Labours</hi> will have <hi>Rewards</hi> agreeable; Say, That <hi>Faith, fears no Famine?</hi> Say, That the Angels of God are our <hi>Guardians;</hi> and that our Warfare is their pleaſant Spectacle; and our <hi>Conflict</hi> will iſſue in a <hi>Crown of Glory.</hi> Still, The <hi>One half has not been told</hi> unto us. <q>How Precious are thy Conſolations, O God; How Great is the Sum of them, if I ſhould count them, they are more in Number than the Sand.</q> At laſt, the Conſolation amounts unto that Computation; Rev. XXI. 7. <hi>He that over-cometh, ſhall Inherit all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will now deal with my Hearers, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was dealt withal; Gen. XV. 5. <hi>And He brought him forth abroad, and ſaid, Look now toward Heaven, and tell the Stars, if thou be Able to Number them. And He ſaid, ſo ſhall thy Seed be.</hi> [I will not ſtand now to Enquire, how far this Paſſage might contribute unto the ancient and famous Tradition which the Pagans had, of our Patriarchs being an <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer;</hi> but,] I will ſay, even ſo; O Child of God; canſt thou <hi>tell the Number of the Stars?</hi> The <hi>Stars</hi> viſible to the unaſſiſted Eye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we may tell the <hi>Number</hi> of them; No man ever yet ſaw with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Glaſſes Two Thouſand of them; The lateſt &amp; largeſt Globes have but Nineteen Hundred. There are many, many more, which are not commonly ſeen; The <hi>Number</hi> of them was never yet known to men upon Earth. It ſhall not be ſaid, <hi>So ſhall thy Conſolations be!</hi> No, but greater, ſtill greater, much greater, is the <hi>Number</hi> of thy Conſolations: <hi>Innumerable Conſolations!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. The <hi>Conſolations of God</hi> are GREAT for the NATURE
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001467_0013_0FB38C2231632870"/>
of them. <hi>Conſolations,</hi> the <hi>Quality</hi> whereof is Excellent, &amp; Exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; the Excellency Invaluable, Incomprehenſible. We have a Notable Term for them; Heb. VI. 18. <hi>Strong Conſolations.</hi> The Conſolations of the Faithful, they have ſometimes been ſuch, that they have been too <hi>Strong</hi> for them; they have not been able to bear them; they have been forced to cry out; <hi>Lord, ſtay thy Hand; thy frail Servant can bear no more.</hi> Yea, the Conſolations of the Faithful, what are they leſs than <hi>Infinite?</hi> It is the Infinite GOD Himſelf, in whom they have their Conſolations. They are <hi>Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of GOD,</hi> and they are Conſolations IN God. The Infinite GOD, ſaid unto the Father of the Faithful; Gen. XV. 1. <hi>I am thy Exceeding Great Reward.</hi> The ſame GOD, the ſame Infinite and Almighty GOD, ſayes unto all the Faithful; <hi>I am thy Exceeding Great Comfort.</hi> Great, <hi>Great muſt it indeed be, if</hi> THOU, <hi>O Lord, art It!</hi> The Great GOD Himſelf, is the <hi>Joy</hi> of His People; How can it be any other than a very <hi>Great</hi> JOY; we read, Pſal. XLIII. 4. <hi>I will go unto</hi> GOD, <hi>my Exceeding Joy.</hi> The Conſolations of the Faithful, are of no lower a ſtrain than this; <q>The Great GOD is my God, and He will ſurely do me Good: He will never leave me nor forſake me. The Power of God will ever ſupply my wants; the Wiſdom of God will ever Direct my ways; the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God will open the Treaſures of Mercy for me. God the Father is my Father; God the Son is my Saviour; God the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is my Leader.</q> O Peerleſs <hi>Conſolations!</hi> Boundleſs <hi>Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions!</hi> Immortal Soul, what canſt thou in thy moſt Extended and Inſatiable Appetites, deſire beyond theſe Conſolations!</p>
            <p>I now wonder no longer, at the words of that Renowned (and then Retired) States-man, Count <hi>Oxiſtern,</hi> to the Excellent Lord <hi>Whitlock. I do aſſure you I have found more comfort in my Retreat, than in all my Greatneſs. I recommend unto you, the Holy Scripture without you, and the Holy Spirit within you; which will be ſure to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain you with the moſt Solid Conſolations, and bring you an Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Felicity.</hi> I wonder not at the words of that Illuſtrious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <hi>Charles</hi> V. after his Abdication of the Empire; <hi>True Piety has thoſe admirable Conſolations, which the Courts of Princes are Strangers to!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001467_0014_0FB34ACEA6A708E8"/>Thirdly. The <hi>Conſolations of God</hi> are GREAT for the DURATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON of them. <hi>Eternal Conſolations,</hi> and, <hi>Pleaſures for evermore.</hi> The Conſolations profered by <hi>Satan</hi> to us, as they can be all ſhown in a <hi>Moment of Time,</hi> they were ſo to our Saviour; ſo they will hold but a <hi>Moment of Time.</hi> O <hi>Sin,</hi> what are thy Conſolations? They are <hi>Pleaſures but for a Seaſon;</hi> and a very, very ſhort Seaſon too. They are but as the <hi>Crackling of Thorns under a Pot;</hi> A <hi>ſhort</hi> Noiſe, a <hi>ſhort</hi> Blaze, and they are Gone. But now, the <hi>Conſolations of God,</hi> theſe are <hi>Durable Riches.</hi> We read, 2 Theſ. II. 16. <hi>God hath given us Everlaſting Conſolation.</hi> The Conſolations of God, they will <hi>Stay</hi> with us; They are a <hi>Joy that none can take from us;</hi> They are an <hi>Eternal Glory.</hi> The <hi>Heavens</hi> as well as the <hi>Earth,</hi> ſhall <hi>Periſh;</hi> But, O <hi>Heavenly Conſolations;</hi> You ſhall <hi>Endure.</hi> They ſhall <hi>wax old like a Garment, and they ſhall be changed;</hi> But you are <hi>the ſame,</hi> and your <hi>Years will have no End! Endleſs Conſolations;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no <hi>Little Conſolations!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III</hi> Every one will now grant me a Third Aſſertion. <hi>The Great Conſolations of</hi> GOD, if they are SMALL with us, <hi>Great</hi> is our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, <hi>Great</hi> is our Corruption; we are <hi>Greatly to be blamed for it.</hi> It cannot but be a <hi>Great</hi> Error, a <hi>Great</hi> Evil, in men, to ſet but a <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Eſteem,</hi> on the <hi>Great Conſolations</hi> of GOD.</p>
            <p>This is now ſo plain, it calls for no further Demonſtration. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will do well to Enquire, <hi>When may it be ſaid of a Man, That the Conſolations of God are Small unto him?</hi> The Enquiry, ſhall be anſwered at once. The <hi>Conſolations of God, are Small</hi> with a Man, when the man who has <hi>no Title</hi> to them, can do well Enough without it, or does not think it worth his while to Look after it. And, The <hi>Conſolations of God are Small</hi> with a man, when a man, who has a <hi>Title</hi> to them, is not Contented with it, or thinks it not Enough to yield Contentment unto him.</p>
            <p>I am now fairly arrived unto the <hi>Expoſtulation,</hi> in which theſe Aſſertions are to terminate.</p>
            <p>But how many, how many, are to be now addreſs'd with a moſt Pungent <hi>Expoſtulation!</hi> Certainly, There are very many among us, of whom it may be fear'd, <hi>The Conſolations of God are Small unto
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001467_0015_0FB34AD0210C5B90"/>
them. Their Tranſgreſſion ſayes within my Heart,</hi> that the <hi>Conſolations of God</hi> are but Little in their Eyes. To be more particular.</p>
            <p>Firſt. How SMALL are the <hi>Conſolations of God,</hi> with ſuch as are the Deſpiſers of a Glorious CHRIST, who is, <hi>The Conſolation of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el!</hi> The Name of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> of old, was, <hi>The Conſolation.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> did not yet appear to Save His People; there were thoſe <hi>Lamentations;</hi> Lam. I. 16. <hi>Mine Eye runs down with Tears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Comforter that ſhould Relieve my Soul, is far from me.</hi> The Jewiſh <hi>Rabbi's,</hi> putting that Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall be the Name of the Meſſiah?</hi> do cite this very Text, for to prove, that His Name ſhall be, <hi>Menachem,</hi> or, <hi>The Comforter.</hi> But are there no <hi>Chriſtleſs</hi> ones, of whom it may be ſaid; <hi>The Comforter that ſhould Relieve their Souls, is far from them;</hi> The Saviour, &amp; His Great Salvation, is <hi>far from the wicked</hi> ones; They have no <hi>Acquaintance</hi> with a Glorious CHRIST, no <hi>Union</hi> with Him, no <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> with Him; And yet their <hi>Eye</hi> never dropt ſo much as one <hi>Tear,</hi> on this deplorable occaſion! Ah, <hi>Chriſtleſs</hi> Unbeliever! The Conſolations of God are Small with thee. If there be any Conſolations, they are ſuch as an Intereſt in a Glorious CHRIST is accompanied withal. We read, Phil. II. 1. Of, <hi>Conſolation in Chriſt.</hi> Our CHRIST, our CHRIST is the true <hi>Noah,</hi> of whom we may ſay, <hi>This ſame ſhall comfort us.</hi> O under-valuer of the moſt Glorious Comforter, If thou haſt any Regard unto the <hi>Greateſt</hi> of Conſolations, come to the CHRIST, who calls thee to come unto Him. Come, and put thy ſelf into His Hands; caſt thy ſelf upon His Mediation; Sit down <hi>under the ſhadow</hi> of the <hi>Tree of Life with Delight.</hi> It is <hi>Good Tidings of Great Joy,</hi> That we may have a Glorious CHRIST for our Saviour: What would it be, if He ſhould ſay, <hi>I will be thy Saviour!</hi> If once the CHRIST of GOD become thy CHRIST, thou ſhalt find <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> laid up in Him for thee. Oh! The Conſolations to be found in ſuch Benefits of ſuch a Saviour, and a Great One! How Comfortable, how Comfortable, muſt it be, to think; <q>My Sin is all Pardoned thro' the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, which cleanſes from all Sin! I ſtand before God in a Righteouſneſs better &amp; brighter, than what the brighteſt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001467_0016_0FB34AD1A1D0C0E8"/>
Angels in Heaven could have help'd me to! My JESUS is my Advocate, and Pleads continually that I may not miſs of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs! He will moſt certainly ſhew me the Path of Life; He will moſt certainly Save me from every Path of the Deſtroyer: He will moſt certainly beſtow upon me an Eternal Manſion in His Fathers Houſe.</q> His Father is my Father; His God is my God. O <hi>Conſolations</hi> that Surpaſs all <hi>Contemplations!</hi> My Friend, All theſe Conſolations will be thine, upon thy falling down before a Glorious CHRIST, and ſincerely ſaying; <hi>Lord, I am Thine, Save me!</hi> Conſent, Comply, Be willing to be the Lords. <hi>Then</hi> thou haſt all His <hi>Conſolations.</hi> Why, why are the <hi>Conſolations of God ſo Small</hi> with thee, that a Glorious CHRIST with His <hi>Conſolations,</hi> it ſeems, are not worth <hi>Acceptance</hi> with thee? O Sinner, <hi>Fooliſh &amp; Unwiſe!</hi> Thy madneſs is not <hi>Small;</hi> elſe theſe <hi>Conſolations of God,</hi> would not be ſo <hi>Small.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. How SMALL are the <hi>Conſolations of God,</hi> with ſuch as Delay their CONVERSION to God, and will not be moved by all the Conſolations, which will undoubtedly follow upon <hi>Obedience</hi> to Him? Upon <hi>Converſion</hi> to GOD, the Sinner comes to vaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations. We are ſo called upon; Act. III. 19. <hi>Repent and be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that ſo the Times of Refreſhing may come.</hi> Indeed, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word, <hi>Nacham,</hi> the Root of our word here for, <hi>Conſolations;</hi> it ſignifies, firſt of all to <hi>Repent,</hi> and then to <hi>Comfort;</hi> Becauſe to the <hi>Penitent</hi> there belongs <hi>Conſolation.</hi> But then, how ſurpriſingly muſt the Conſolations go on, and <hi>Increaſe &amp; Multiply!</hi> Oh! the <hi>Bleſſedneſſes</hi> and the <hi>Conſolations</hi> of the man, whoſe <hi>Tranſgreſſion is Forgiven!</hi> The man who is become an <hi>Heir of God,</hi> and a <hi>Joint-Heir</hi> with the Son of God! The man, whom the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, makes a <hi>Temple</hi> of God, and chuſes to <hi>Dwell</hi> there for ever as a <hi>Comforter!</hi> No <hi>Boethius</hi> is Maſter of a Pen, that can Soar high enough, to deſcribe the <hi>Conſolations.</hi> We are told, There is <hi>Joy in Heaven,</hi> it gives a Conſolation unto the Angels in Heaven, when a <hi>Sinner is brought unto Repentance.</hi> O <hi>Repenting Sinner,</hi> certainly then thy Soul, has a claim to a moſt <hi>Heavenly Conſolation!</hi> As it was of old ſaid, <hi>Seemeth it a light matter unto you, to be the Son in Law of a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001467_0017_0FB34AD323BA06D0"/>
King!</hi> I will ſay, O Sinner loth to turn unto God; <hi>Seemeth it a light matter</hi> unto thee, to become a <hi>Child of God!</hi> A <hi>Light matter,</hi> to be a <hi>Favourite</hi> of Heaven! A <hi>Light matter,</hi> to be a Candidate of a <hi>Crown that Fadeth not away!</hi> What? Such Conſolations of God, are they ſo <hi>Small</hi> with thee, that the filthy and fulſome Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> are to be preferred before them! Has the <hi>Devil</hi> more Deſireable Things for thee, than theſe <hi>Conſolations of God?</hi> This, This indeed is the curſed Language of thy continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in thy Sins. Oh! <hi>Talk no more</hi> ſo exceeding Vainly, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Vilely; and let ſuch Blaſphemy be <hi>no more uttered</hi> in thy Unconverted Procraſtinations. With a Subdued Soul, <hi>from this Time,</hi> Oh! Fall down before the Lord, and ſay, <hi>O Great GOD, Thou ſhalt be my Father, and the Guide of my Life!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. Sinner, <hi>Deſpairing</hi> of Mercy &amp; Pardon, Thy DESPAIR does declare, That the <hi>Conſolations of God</hi> are too SMALL with thee, to conquer it. There are Sinners who <hi>See</hi> themſelves, and perhaps have cauſe to <hi>own</hi> themſelves, <hi>The chief of Sinners.</hi> The ſight of their Sins exceedingly Terrifies them. And indeed they are a very Terrible ſight! But yet, Oh, <hi>Deſpair</hi> not. Before the Awakened Sinner, I will now ſet the <hi>Conſolations of God.</hi> Ah, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged Soul, Be thy Sins never ſo Many, never ſo Heinous, there is a <hi>Pardon</hi> to be had! I bring to the moſt criminal among you all, that Advice from Heaven: Iſa. LV. 7. <hi>Let him return unto the Lord, and He will have Mercy upon him; and unto our God, for He will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly Pardon.</hi> I bring you that Advice; Matth. XII. 31. <hi>All manner of Sin ſhall be Forgiven unto men.</hi> I bring you that Advice; 1. Joh. I. 7. <hi>The Blood of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>the Son of God, cleanſes from all Sin.</hi> O Lively Conſolations! O Wondrous Conſolations! O Conſolations of God! The <hi>Day of Grace</hi> is not yet over with you. Behold, O Sinners, willing to Confeſs and Bewayl and Abhor all your Sins; O Sinners, willing to have all your Sins Forgiven and your Luſts Mortified, thro' the Sacrifice of the moſt Holy JESUS; The Servants of God have a Commiſſion to ſtand among you, and make this Proclamation; <hi>A Pardon! A Pardon!</hi> O Periſhing Souls, <hi>A Pardon</hi> is Ready for you. Do but Humble your ſelves before
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001467_0018_0FB34AD7A2F90890"/>
the Glorious GOD, and humbly plead the Blood of your Saviour, that God may <hi>Forgive your Sins, and cleanſe you from all Unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and you ſhall find Him, <hi>Ready to Pardon.</hi> Let Rebels, let the moſt monſtrous <hi>Giants</hi> in Rebellion, know, That a Sin-Pardoning Lord, even <hi>Waits to be Gracious</hi> unto them. To <hi>You,</hi> even to <hi>You,</hi> there is now made, the aſtoniſhing offer of a <hi>Pardon</hi> after all. To them that have been the Greateſt Monſters of Sin, there is now Proclamed this <hi>Conſolation of God!</hi> What an Heart-melting word is that? Mic. VII. 19. <hi>He will Subdue our Iniquities.</hi> Man, There ſtands a mighty <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Iniquities</hi> in the way of thy Happineſs. How muſt thy Heart fail thee, when the Holy God <hi>Sets them in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> before thine Eyes! But now, Be ſorry for thy <hi>Iniquities;</hi> with Remorſe lay down the Arms of thy Rebellion; lay Hold on the Tenders, and Merits of thy Saviour: Then the Pardoning Mercy of God, will <hi>Subdue</hi> this mighty <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Iniquities.</hi> None of them ſhall hinder His Favour to thee; They ſhall be <hi>Caſt into the depths of the Sea;</hi> the Red-Sea of thy Saviours Blood ſhall drown this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> The <hi>Number</hi> or the <hi>Blackneſs</hi> of thy Sins muſt not be thy Diſcouragement. There is a <hi>Fountain Set Open</hi> for the moſt <hi>Unclean Sinner</hi> among us all to repair unto! And upon thy <hi>Waſhing</hi> in that <hi>Fountain,</hi> O Sinner, All thy Sin will be, as if it had never been at all. Thy paſt <hi>Scarlet</hi> and <hi>Crimſon</hi> Abominations will not hinder a bright Complexion of <hi>Snow</hi> and <hi>Wooll</hi> from Succeeding in thy Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Soul. Is any of you diſtreſſed with an Apprehenſion of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Sinned Unpardonably;</hi> of having fallen into the <hi>Unpardonable Sin?</hi> To that Soul, I muſt bring this <hi>Conſolation of God;</hi> Soul, Thy Diſtreſſing <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>that,</hi> is a Proof that there is no <hi>Cauſe</hi> to <hi>Fear</hi> it. I will add; Art thou Deſirous of a <hi>Pardon?</hi> Would a <hi>Pardon</hi> be to thee a <hi>Pearl of Great Price?</hi> Haſt thou any value for the <hi>Blood</hi> of thy Saviour, which is the <hi>Price</hi> of thy <hi>Pardon?</hi> Tis very certain, Thou haſt never yet fallen into the <hi>Sin that cannot be Pardoned.</hi> Oh! Let this Conſolation of God mightily Quicken you, to <hi>Repent,</hi> and <hi>Believe,</hi> and make ſure of the <hi>Attainable Pardon!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly. And, I Pray, What are the <hi>Conſolations of God;</hi> How SMALL! unto them who are unconcerned about Preparing for,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001467_0019_0FB34AD9241EC3E0"/>
and Approaching to, the SPECIAL ORDINANCES, where thoſe <hi>Conſolations</hi> are to be met withal? Concerning the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the Goſpel, we read, Iſa. XII. 3. <hi>With Joy ſhall ye Draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation.</hi> Of one who had been <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> we read, <hi>He went on his way Rejoycing.</hi> By Reflecting on, and Improving of our <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> we may come to the <hi>Still Waters,</hi> where we ſhall find <hi>Rivers of Conſolation.</hi> Alas, what a Rarity is this in the <hi>Chriſtian World!</hi> How do we <hi>Forget</hi> our <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Remember it as waters that paſs away!</hi> We read again, that there was <hi>Great Joy in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> of old, at the celebration of the <hi>Paſsover.</hi> Oh! the <hi>Great Joy,</hi> of the Conſolation, which we might find in celebrating the <hi>Goſpel-Paſsover</hi> at the Table of the Lord! Yet, alas, how do the <hi>Ways of Zion Mourn,</hi> becauſe there is no more careful walking in them! In the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of our Saviour, we may look for the <hi>Conſolations of God.</hi> They are the <hi>Statutes of the Lord,</hi> which <hi>Rejoyce the Heart.</hi> I ſhall be ſorry, if none of my Hearers are able to teſtify ſo much, from what they have this very Day met withal. But more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in <hi>Special Ordinances.</hi> What leſs to be look'd for, in the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> at the <hi>Gate of Heaven!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! why no more Sollicitous to come with Ready Souls, unto the moſt <hi>Comfortable Ordinances</hi> of the Lord! Ah, Slothful Soul! Tis a Sad thing, that the Conſolations of God are ſo <hi>Small</hi> with thee! What ſome have done thro' <hi>Pettiſhneſs,</hi> may be ſaid to be done by thoſe thro' <hi>Slothfulneſs;</hi> Pſal. LXXVII. 2. <hi>My Soul refuſed to be comforted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly. Methinks, The <hi>Conſolations of God</hi> are too SMALL unto the People of God themſelves, when under their AFFLICTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS, they take not up with thoſe <hi>Conſolations,</hi> but their <hi>Souls Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be Comforted.</hi> There are ſome, who have a part in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of God; And yet, when they are <hi>Afflicted,</hi> when in their <hi>Afflictions</hi> they are bereaved of ſome <hi>Earthly Conſolations,</hi> they are like her, of whom we read, Mat. II. 18. <hi>She would not be Comforted. Length of Time,</hi> alas, is the <hi>only Solace</hi> known by many Afflicted People, who would yet be Eſteemed the People of God. When they are Afflicted, nothing will compoſe them; They will continue
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001467_0020_0FB34ADAA1908F50"/>
to <hi>Rage,</hi> or to <hi>Pine,</hi> until — <hi>Longa Dies ſedavit Vulnera mentis.</hi> But, O <hi>Diſconſolate</hi> People of God, Hearken a little to me. What a vaſt Bundle of <hi>Conſolations</hi> have you, in that One word! Rom. VIII. 28. <hi>We know, all things work together for Good, unto them that Love God.</hi> Oh! Let it not be <hi>Small</hi> with you! One thing more: You loſe <hi>Earth,</hi> but you have <hi>Heaven</hi> left you. And is this a <hi>Small</hi> thing in your Eyes?</p>
            <p>I will firſt Speak a very awful Word. It is this; If the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of God are ſo <hi>Small</hi> with you, that they will <hi>do nothing</hi> to Quiet you, When you meet with Loſſes and Croſſes in an Evil World, it may be queſtion'd, Whether you have a part in thoſe <hi>Conſolations.</hi> I will add this; You will anon find, That <hi>nothing elſe will do</hi> to Quiet you; you will find a Wretched <hi>Vanity</hi> &amp; <hi>Vexation,</hi> in all other Conſolations: The Conſolations of <hi>This World</hi> will fail your Expectations, and be <hi>Phyſicians of no value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a Sweet Paſſage of the Poet;
<q>
                  <l>Taedia quem mundi teneant, reperire Quietem</l>
                  <l>Si velit, in Solo Numine quaerat eam.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt Engliſh it.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Soul, whom the Worlds Fatigues do make to groan,</l>
               <l>Seek all thy Comfort in thy GOD alone.</l>
            </q>
            <p>You ſhall allow me to Propoſe one thing more, in Purſuance of the Deſign I am going upon. It was an Excellent Propoſal made in the Church of God Eleven Hundred years ago; <hi>Facilius erit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatio, ſi inter Flagella quae Patimur, quae fecimus ad memoriam De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licta revocamus.</hi> Let us in all our <hi>Afflictions,</hi> be Mindful of our <hi>Miſcarriages,</hi> be Mournful for our <hi>Iniquities;</hi> Humbly Adore the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God in all our <hi>Afflictive Caſes:</hi> We are by ſuch <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> prepared for the <hi>Conſolations of God.</hi> Now we may go on.</p>
            <p>I will now make the Experiment, what the <hi>Conſolations of God</hi> will Signify, in Two or three Caſes, that are of a frequent Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among us. The Ancient has taught me, <hi>Dolentem non Poteſt Conſolari, qui non concordat Dolori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt. There are Some who are grievouſly annoyed, fearfully diſturbed, with the FIERY DARTS which the <hi>Wicked One</hi> Shoots
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001467_0021_0FB34ADC2608C930"/>
into their Minds. They cry out of the <hi>Injections,</hi> wherewith Satan troubles them; and affrights them: Suggeſtions full of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> full of <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> full of <hi>Helliſh</hi> Malignity, are injected by Satan into their Souls. The vexation is inſupportable; it renders them even weary of their Lives. <hi>Hideous Thoughts</hi> are thrown into them, and ſuch as make them afraid the dreadful Wrath of God muſt overtake them Immediately, Irremediably. A very <hi>Pityable</hi> caſe! But can there be any <hi>Conſolations of God</hi> for One ſo horribly Tempted of the Devil? Yes; And very <hi>Great</hi> Ones. There is that Conſolation; 1 Cor. X. 13. <hi>There has no Temptation taken you, but ſuch as is Common to Man;</hi> Yea, Common to Good Men. Tis rather a Good, than a Bad, Sign to be thus Buffeted by the Devil. O Soul <hi>Mourning becauſe of the Oppreſſion of the Enemy;</hi> If the Devil did not Look upon thee, as upon one who made Conſcience of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> in thy <hi>Thoughts,</hi> it is probable, he would not chuſe to perſecute thee with ſuch <hi>Sinful Thoughts.</hi> Take this Conſolation alſo; Go on to <hi>Bewayl</hi> theſe <hi>Thoughts,</hi> to <hi>Abhor</hi> theſe <hi>Thoughts,</hi> to <hi>Renounce</hi> theſe <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and God will never lay them to thy Charge; No, they ſhall be charged upon thy <hi>Adverſary,</hi> who <hi>Provokes thee ſore;</hi> tis he that is the <hi>Father</hi> of them. And, then take likewiſe this Conſolation. By an unwearied Contradiction of theſe <hi>Thoughts,</hi> or making theſe Thoughts an Incentive as often as they recur, to raiſe <hi>Thoughts</hi> that ſhall be directly contradictory to them, and fill'd with devout Acknowledgments of God and His Chriſt; this will ſoon weary out thy Adverſary; Tis but <hi>Reſiſting the Devil</hi> thus a little while, and <hi>he will flee</hi> from thee!</p>
            <p>Secondly. Are there any STRAITS upon us? Perhaps, we are Straitned with <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Low</hi> Circumſtances; The Times grow hard; we are afraid we ſhall be hardly or but meanly provided for.</p>
            <p>In this caſe, there are ſome <hi>Great Conſolations of God</hi> which I can Lead you to. There is that Conſolation; Jam. II 5. <hi>Hath not God choſen the Poor of this World, Rich in Faith, and Heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi> There is that Conſolation; Pſal. XXXVII. 3. <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and do Good, and verily thou ſhalt be fed.</hi> My Friend, Haſt thou not a CHRIST? In Him thou haſt <hi>Unſearchable Riches.</hi> In
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001467_0022_0FB38C237841B3F0"/>
Him will thy God <hi>Supply all thy Wants from His Glorious Riches.</hi> And if HE be thine, He will help thee, to all that can be Needful for thee. Thou haſt a <hi>Father</hi> and a <hi>Feeder,</hi> that <hi>Knows all that thou Needeſt.</hi> I muſt ſay, <hi>Have ye forgotten the Conſolation, that that Speaks to you, as unto Children?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any of you meet with <hi>Impoveriſhing Diſaſters,</hi> what will you ſay to that Word? 2 Chron. XXV. 9 <hi>The Lord is able to give thee much more than this.</hi> Truly, Sir, If God gives you more <hi>Grace,</hi> than you had before; If you are made more <hi>Prayerful,</hi> more <hi>Watchful,</hi> more <hi>Weaned</hi> from this World; Or, if God have given you the <hi>Grace</hi> to bear your Impoveriſhments with <hi>Reſignation;</hi> He has <hi>given you much more</hi> than all that has been taken from you. Is there <hi>nothing</hi> in theſe <hi>Conſolations?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly. Have we our Deſirable RELATIVES taken from us? But in this caſe alſo, we have at hand, the <hi>Great Conſolations of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are the <hi>Relatives</hi> at a <hi>Diſtance</hi> from us in other Countries? Be Comforted; <hi>God Knows</hi> where they are. His Kind <hi>Eye</hi> is upon them there; His Kind <hi>Hand</hi> can reach them. If they are in <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi> yet, Jer. XXXI. 16. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Refrain thy Voice from Weeping, and thine Eyes from Tears; for thy Work ſhall be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and they ſhall come again from the Land of the Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Has DEATH taken away the <hi>Relatives?</hi> Be Comforted; <hi>God Lives.</hi> And if a CHRIST be yours, you have the <hi>Good Part that can't be taken away.</hi> Should not that <hi>Widow</hi> be Comforted, who can ſay, <hi>My Maker is my Husband?</hi> Or, that <hi>Widower;</hi> who can ſay, <hi>God has Meant all unto Good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the PARENTS who have buried their <hi>Children,</hi> have they no <hi>Conſolations of God?</hi> We read of ſuch a thing as that, at the <hi>Funerals</hi> of old; Jer. XVI. 7. <hi>The Cup of Conſolations.</hi> Tis there provided for the Funerals of <hi>Parents. Parents</hi> alſo have it provided for the Funerals of their <hi>Children.

The <hi>Conſolations of Men,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Horace</hi> offers to his Friend <hi>Valgius</hi> on the Death of his dear <hi>Myſta;</hi> and ſuch as you have in the Writings of <hi>Seneca,</hi> and the other <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,

or the reſt, are very Small Ones: very mean truly. Yea, They Themſelves upon great occaſions do confeſs them ſo. Such was that famous One, in <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> to one who had Buried his Child; <hi>Before that Child came into the World, thou hadſt no Grief about it. Why ſhouldeſt thou grieve, now tis gone out of the World?</hi> Have we no Higher Notes? Yes; If the <hi>Parents</hi> are themſelves the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> then they have a <hi>Name far better than that of Sons and of Daughters.</hi> If the <hi>Son of God</hi> be theirs, then they have One, who ſhould be <hi>Better to them than Ten Sons or Daughters.</hi>

            <p>It may be, the Children had <hi>Comfortable Symptoms</hi> upon them, in their Sober, Modeſt, Vertuous Behaviour. To hope, that it is well with them, is an unſpeakable <hi>Conſolation.</hi> Then, as it was ſaid unto the Ruler, on the Death of his Daughter; <hi>She is not Dead, but Sleepeth.</hi> Even the Pagan could give it as a Direction; <hi>Be not Sorrowful for the Dead; ſince there is a Neceſſity of dying; But ſpend thy Sorrow, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Luther,</hi> when his Daughter <hi>Magdalene</hi> was Expiring, he read unto her, from the XXVI. Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> and concluded thus; <hi>My Daughter, Enter thou into thy Chamber, with Peace, I ſhall ere long be with thee.</hi> On this, he wept Plentifully; but in Publick attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Horſe without a Tear.</p>
            <p>Diverſe of the old Poets obſerved, That if <hi>Tears</hi> would <hi>fetch back the Dead, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. We would gladly change Gold for Tears; Tears would be better than Gold.</hi> But ſince <hi>Tears</hi> are of ſo little uſe, we need go no further, in filling our <hi>Lacrymato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> for our <hi>Dead Children.</hi> We are in the midſt of the <hi>Conſolations</hi> which may be moſt Reaſonable <hi>Spunges</hi> to the <hi>Eyes</hi> that are a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Tears.

            <p>It may be, they were <hi>Children</hi> who have left <hi>Children,</hi> and have Enlarged the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

            <p>It may be, what is buried in <hi>One Child,</hi> may be richly made up in <hi>Another;</hi> in the more than <hi>Doubled Comfort</hi> from the hopeful Character and Carriage of <hi>Another.</hi>

            <p>There is a SPECTACLE, that is Extremely uneaſy to us; a very Mournful and Frightful Spectacle! The <hi>Spectacle</hi> of, <hi>A whole World Lying in Wickedneſs;</hi> and by the juſt wrath of GOD rendred therefore an Entire <hi>Aceldama; Wickedneſs</hi> raging and

reigning at a Strange rate; The <hi>Sons of Wickedneſs</hi> carrying all before them; Good Men Oppreſſed; and the more Good they do, the more Expoſed unto Oppreſſion; unto the <hi>Contradiction of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and all the Perſecution which the <hi>Tongue,</hi> or <hi>Pen,</hi> or <hi>Fiſt</hi> of Wickedneſs, can aſſault them withal; The VIALS of the Divine Indignation, Pouring out, under a THIRD WO begun upon a <hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Woful</hi> World; The <hi>Curſe</hi> devouring the Earth, with Numberleſs and Horrible <hi>Deſolations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But have we any <hi>Conſolations</hi> under ſo grievous a <hi>Spectacle?</hi> Yes, and very <hi>Great</hi> Ones too. Very particularly <hi>That;</hi> 2 Pet.

II. 9. <hi>The Lord knows how to deliver the Godly out of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Briefly, Another and a better State of the World, is coming on. It was a Remarkable Paſſage, which lately fell from the very Learned, and Holy, and Famous Dr. <hi>Spener:</hi> That brave Man, when he lay a dying, Ordered that when he was Dead, there ſhould not be ſo much as one Threed of <hi>Black</hi> uſed about his Coffin; for, ſaid he, <q>I have been a Sorrowful Mourner for the Afflictions and Corruptions of the Church Militant all my days; but I am now Entring into the Joy of the Church Triumphant; and therefore I will not now have the Leaſt Mark of Sorrow upon me. And Let this Deſire of Mine, be a Token to you, of my Faith, O my Friends, that our Great Saviour has Glorious Things to do ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for His Church upon that Earth, where I leave my Aſhes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I will beſtow a Little Illuſtration upon this Matter, and ſo Conclude it.</p>
            <p>There was a very Surpriſing Tradition among the ancient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, recited by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Iſis,</hi> and <hi>Oſiris.</hi> About the <hi>Origin of Evil,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there was much Enquiry among the Ancients. They conceived, that there were <hi>Two Gods;</hi> One the Original of <hi>Good;</hi> the other, of <hi>Evil.</hi> According to <hi>Zoroaſter,</hi> the Name of the former was <hi>Oromazes,</hi> the Name of the latter, <hi>Arimanius. Oromazes</hi> was reſembled unto <hi>Light, Arimanius</hi> unto
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001467_0026_0FB34AE4640469C8"/>
               <hi>Darkneſs.</hi> There is a War between <hi>Oromazes,</hi> and <hi>Arimanius Oromazes</hi> Lodg'd the World in an <hi>Egg;</hi> but <hi>Arimanius</hi> Perforated it. Hence there is every where a Perpetual Mixture of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> And from the <hi>Enmity</hi> between them, what Works are <hi>done</hi> by One, are <hi>Spoilt</hi> by the other. But a <hi>Time Decreed by Fate</hi> will come, when <hi>Arimanius</hi> muſt be totally deſtroy'd by <hi>Oromazes,</hi> Then the <hi>Earth</hi> being brought into an admirably Smooth Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, men ſhall all be Univerſally Bleſſed, and Inhabit as it were <hi>One City,</hi> and have One way of <hi>Living,</hi> and Speak <hi>One Language;</hi> and enjoy a Wonderful Happineſs <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, This was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, A very <hi>Ancient Opinion,</hi> and that it had obtained a <hi>Firm and Indelible Belief.</hi> Now, this Marvellous Tradition, contains in it, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Reliques of Glorious Truth; GOD, the Maker of the World; whoſe Name is <hi>Light;</hi> And, <hi>Satan,</hi> the Fountain of Evil; whoſe Name is, <hi>The Prince of Darkneſs.</hi> It is indeed a Broken Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our <hi>Protevangeleum,</hi> in the <hi>Third Chapter of Geneſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what I go on to Remark, is, That altho' the Sacred Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, every where Conſpire to adviſe us, of a Day at hand, in which the <hi>Creation</hi> ſhall be Delivered from the <hi>Vanity</hi> which it is now <hi>Groaning</hi> under, and an <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Peaceable</hi> Kingdom of God, ſhall take Place in the World, yet they are all but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon that <hi>Protevangelium;</hi> we have in <hi>That,</hi> the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Text,</hi> as I may call it, and a <hi>Sure Foundation</hi> for our Hopes, <hi>That the World will not always be ſo bad as now it is. Mareſius,</hi> having written a Diſputation full of Bitter Zeal againſt the <hi>Chiliaſts;</hi> the incomparable <hi>Comenius,</hi> when he was about Fourſcore years of Age, wrote a Treatiſe on that occaſion, with all the Learning, and Vigour and Style, which could have been Expected from a <hi>Literator,</hi> in the very Meridian of all his Glory. The <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of his Treatiſe runs upon this Argument. The Birth of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſm</hi> was in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> It was born to us in the <hi>Protevangelium</hi> given there. There we find foretold, a Perpetual <hi>War</hi> between the <hi>Serpent</hi> and our <hi>Saviour.</hi> There is foretold, the final <hi>Iſſue</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:001467_0027_0FB34AE526E12FA0"/>
of the War, in the Deſtruction of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and an Illuſtrious and Everlaſting Victory of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> Well; But where is the <hi>Field</hi> of theſe Tranſactions? This is Evidently the EARTH. All the World Knows and Feels, that this our <hi>Earth,</hi> is the <hi>Field</hi> of the <hi>War.</hi> We deſire then to Know, Whether after all, the Conqueror muſt <hi>Leave the Field</hi> unto his vanquiſhed Enemy? Whether the Conqueror do not always <hi>Chaſe the Enemy out of the Field,</hi> and he himſelf keep the Poſſeſſion of it. <hi>Pelli Solet Hoſtis in ultima uſque antra Sua, Captivuſque in Carcerem mitti.</hi> So then, there is a Day at hand, when <hi>Satan,</hi> with all his Power and Party muſt be Chaſed off the Face of the <hi>Earth;</hi> and the Earth be Entirely in the Poſſeſſion of our Admirable Saviour. Let this be our Concluſion; This our <hi>Conſolation.</hi> — But, <hi>How Long, O Lord, Holy and True; How Long, How Long!</hi>
