            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>YOUNG MEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ACCORDING to my promiſe, I have prepared an addreſs, to you in particular. And, as I have been induced to pay you this reſpect, from an affectionate concern for your happineſs, I may the more reaſonably hope, that you will hear me with attention, candor and ſeriouſneſs. Without this, the great object of my labor will be loſt, and my earneſt deſires painfully diſappointed. Oblige me then ſo far, as to keep your minds open to inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conviction; and then, by the bleſſing of God, I perſuade myſelf, we ſhall have reaſon to rejoice together.</p>
            <p>The words I have read contain a very important queſtion directly to my purpoſe, "Wherewithal ſhall a young man cleanſe his way?" What courſe of life ſhall he purſue, and by what rule ſhall he be guided, in order to eſcape thoſe irregularities and evils to which youth is ever expoſed?</p>
            <p>The queſtion evidently implies that his ſituation is attended with peculiar danger; and that he has neither knowledge, nor experience, nor any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over himſelf, ſufficient to ſecure his ſafety— and therefore, that he ſtands in need of ſuch a rule as is both capable of pointing out his duty, in all
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:046207_0004_1020F8B072F038E0"/>
circumſtances, and poſſeſſed of authority to reach and determine his conſcience. This rule is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately propoſed, in the anſwer to the queſtion, "By taking heed thereto according to thy word."</p>
            <p>Taking this for his guide, with a conſcientious regard to his duty, the whole of his life ſhall be virtuous, honorable and happy. From this view of the text, I propoſe to conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The principal things which young men are to attend to, in order to maintain a pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable courſe of life.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The rule which they are ever to place before them, as the ſtandard of their temper and conduct.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The principal things, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Under the firſt head, I ſhall conſider in this diſcourſe, the duty of early piety, and its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal advantages; the duty and advantages of early engaging in uſeful employment; and the neceſſity of a prudent choice of company.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt thing which claims your regard is piety or religion. By this I mean, not only thoſe acts of homage which are immediately due to God, but every part of our duty, as fixed by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, including as well the principles on which it is performed, as the outward acts.</p>
            <p>Every obligation of divine appointment, is a part of religion; and though ſome are ſuperior in dignity to others, with regard to their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate objects; yet all are equally to be regarded in practice, ſo as that no one is to be neglected, under pretence of diſcharging another. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this can never be neceſſary, becauſe the whole ſyſtem of our duties are ſo framed, as to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſiſtent with each other. If one be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:046207_0005_1020ECAB260FC258"/>
it is diſobedience to the authority on which the whole are founded; and the guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is as really a tranſgreſſor, though not in ſo high a degree, as if he had broken every individual law, "For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." I mention this the more particularly, as in all ages men have been ready to ſuppoſe, that if they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped God, it would go in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oom of their duties to mankind; and ſo while they have prayed, faſted, and paid tithes, they have "neglected juſtice, mercy and fidelity," to their neighbour. Or they have gone into the oppoſite error, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that juſtice, mercy and fidelity to men, were the whole of religion; and ſo neglected the neceſſary acts of direct homage to God. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, for the ſame reaſon that we are to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and worſhip God, as an expreſs part of our duty, we are to ſtudy the good of others and our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in that way which he hath preſcribed, as equally a matter of conſcience and obligation. It is further to be conſidered, that the principle on which any duty is performed, is as much to be regarded, as the act itſelf. Indeed there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly no religion in any act whatever, but ſo far as it is done from a right intention, that is, always with a view to the will and pleaſure of God. The act is but the form, the intention or principle is the ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>It was for this reaſon, that the tithes, alms and prayers of the Phariſees were of no account in the ſight of God; becauſe they did them "to be ſeen of men." And of the ſame quality will be every form of religion, how exact ſoever, when "the heart is not right with him."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:046207_0006_1020F8B36DDFC640"/>This diſtinction I wiſh you the more carefully to attend to, becauſe there is no miſtake more common, and none more fatal, than to reſt in a "form of godlineſs without the power." Should you fall into this miſtake, it will ruin the whole of your religion, however plauſible in appearance, and leave you at laſt, as far from God and Heaven, as they who have lived without even the form of it.</p>
            <p>You are alſo to remember, that ſince the coming of Chriſt, it is as much a duty to thoſe who enjoy the goſpel, to believe in him, to worſhip through him, and to hope for ſalvation by his merits, as to obey the firſt command, "to worſhip God, and him only to ſerve." This is ſo neceſſary, that neither our prayers, nor praiſes, nor confeſſions, nor any other ſervice will be accepted, on any other terms. And it is ſo far from being leſt to the liberty of men, to reject it if they pleaſe, as a matter referred entirely to their own option; that nothing is more expreſsly enjoined, than to believe in, and obey him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and nothing threatened with an heavier penalty, than to refuſe to acknowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him. "Jeſus came into Galilee, preaching the goſpel of the kingdom of God, and ſaying, repent ye, and believe the goſpel." "He that believeth not is condemned already." "If ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſins." This is his commandment, "that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the name of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt." The ſubſtance of the religion of the goſpel is, that we "live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil world;" "and whatſoever ye do, whether in word, or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, giving thanks unto God, even the father by him."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:046207_0007_1020F8647B2EA668"/>It is by this that your actions, words, paſſions, and thoughts, and all your views and meaſures for this and another world, are to be governed, and determined as good or bad, in the ſight of God. You cannot therefore, be too careful, to obtain a juſt knowledge of the duties it preſcribes, of the authority and ſanctions by which they are enforced, and the great and everlaſting advantages they afford. And ſo far as you diſcover your duty, or, after due examination, think that you diſcover it, whether it be in appearance, of greater or ſmaller moment, make it a matter of conſcience to do it, becauſe all obligations are equal, with reſpect to the authority of God; and if you neglect the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of conſcience in one inſtance, you will do it in another; till by degrees it will ceaſe to be the rule of your conduct; and ſo you will be "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by little and little."</p>
            <p>After this ſhort view of the religion of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, on which all your happineſs depends, you will naturally inquire at what time of life you come under its obligations. As ſoon undoubtedly, as you are capable of underſtanding them, and feeling the force of thoſe motives by which they are urged. And I ſhould ſuppoſe this to be the caſe, as ſoon as the mind is capable of being affected by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the world, and of forming ſchemes for obtaining them. This in different perſons, may happen at different times; but is much ſooner in all, than any are willing to think a proper a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for becoming reſponſible to the laws of God, and ſubmitting to the reſtraints of religion. It is a common prejudice of youth, and the ſource of almoſt all the errors of their ſucceeding life, that they are under leſs obligation to be religious, than thoſe of advanced years; that diſſipation and gaiety
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:046207_0008_1020F8B69408CCA8"/>
are more ſuitable to their eſtate of life, than the gravity, thoughtfulneſs and cares of religion, and that they are leſs in need of it, than when they will be more liable to afflictions and death, and leſs capable of enjoying the world. If this were even true, it is equally ſo, that youth is expoſed to every calamity that affects the ſucceeding ages of life; and are therefore both in need of thoſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which religion alone can give, and bound to ſecure them as early as they may be obtained. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if it be their duty to repay the care and tenderneſs of their earthly parents, with the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt expreſſions of gratitude, love and obedience they are capable of; much more certainly, the love and goodneſs of God, "in whom they live, and move and have their being." Or can it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. that at that time of life, when it is criminal to neglect or diſobey a parent, it is not ſo to neglect and diſobey the father of our ſpirits? Certainly, no. Neither can it ever be with reaſon ſuppoſed, that we do not come under obligations to regard the authority of God, till that time of life, when we ceaſe to be under that of our parents. The truth is, that the objections of youth againſt early reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are ſo far from being well founded, that they originate in a deſire of all others the moſt unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and pernicious, that of living without any reſtraint on their inclinations and purſuits, and ſo would wiſh to put that off to the laſt, which in point of importance and neceſſity is firſt.</p>
            <p>But, without reaſoning farther on the ſubject, it will appear, that ſo many advantages ariſe from it, that independent of other conſiderations, to neglect it, is to undervalue and ſlight our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to conſult which God hath made one eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of our duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:046207_0009_1020F8662BE18158"/>Advantages of early religion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The difficulties which attend the entrance on a courſe of piety, are in youth, uſually ſooner, and more eaſily ſurmounted.</p>
            <p>The conſcience is more ſuſceptive of conviction, the affections ſofter and more pliant, and more apt to be affected with the conſideration of the love and mercy of God. There are fewer bad paſſions and principles in operation, fewer engagements with the world, and fewer and leſs inveterate habits of ſin to oppoſe and reform.</p>
            <p>It is true, that the power of "God who worketh in us both to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ll and to do, of his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure," can as eaſily affect and change the heart, at one age of life, and at any poſſible degree of guilt, within the bounds of mercy, as another; yet, in this and every other caſe, we are not to conſider what is poſſible for him to do; but what he uſually doth. Agreeably to this, it appears to be matter of fact, that the greateſt number of thoſe who "have paſſed from death to life," where the goſpel has been ſtatedly diſpenſed, has been under the time of middle life. To this purpoſe Dr. Doddridge remarks, that the moſt of thoſe who were hopefully converted by his miniſtry, in the congregation where he reſided, were under the age of twenty-four.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the eighth of his ten ſermons on regeneration.</note> And though there are every where, inſtances of the triumph of the grace of God, at a much later period; yet, they are ſo few, in compariſon of thoſe which happen earlier, as to ſhew in the moſt forcible light, the importance of cheriſhing religious impreſſions, in that ſeaſon of life which is found by experience, to be the beſt adopted to retain them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:046207_0010_1020F8B81EB38328"/>2. It is very difficult to break off from habits of ſin that have been long in force.</p>
            <p>We are influenced by habit, in a manner that cannot well be exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>ed. So great is its power over us, that where its effects are moſt obvious, and prejudicial to our happineſs, we often continue in what we even wiſh and determine to relinquiſh. And it is no doubt, in a great meaſure, owing to this circumſtance, that there are ſo few inſtances of effectual reformation, after the ſeaſon of youth has elapſed. Of thoſe who attempt it, the greateſt part, after weak and irreſolute efforts, uſually go back, by degrees, till they get quite into their old habits of tranſgreſſion; and there continue, for the remainder of life, without perhaps, trying again to recover. So juſt and agreeable to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience are the words of the prophet, "Can the Ethiopian change his ſkin, or the leopard his ſpots? Then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to evil." Nor need it be wondered at, if we conſider the hardſhip and ſelf-denial it coſts even youth, to correct habits of only a few years ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and fall into new and oppoſite courſes of living. The advantages however, are ſo much on this ſide, that they ought effectually to determine you, before your hearts have become "hardened by ſin," and bad habits have acquired an incorrigible influence over you, to endeavor to ſall into thoſe which you will never have occaſion to alter; and which will gradually become eaſier and eaſier, till they will be your choice and delight. "If thou haſt run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee; how wilt thou contend with the horſes? And if in the land of peace wherein thou truſtedſt, they wearied thee; what wilt thou do in the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Jordan?"</p>

            <p n="3">3. Early religion prevents a great deal of guilt, and conſequently, of remorſe, and pain of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>While a man is in the habits of ſin, he is not only every day increaſing the meaſure of his guilt; but proportionably preparing for himſelf "tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and anguiſh" of conſcience, which ſooner or later, he will certainly endure.</p>
            <p>They who make themſelves the eaſieſt in a courſe of tranſgreſſion, have their ſeaſons of cool and impartial reflexion, when conſcience interrupts their repoſe, and fills them with inexpreſſible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, at the apprehenſion of ſuffering the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgment of God. Were it even poſſible for a ſinner to fall into ſuch a ſtate of ſtupefaction, as to go on to the end of his life, without any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able anxiety or remorſe; yet, death muſt at length break off his ſlumbers, and leave him from that moment, to the "preying of the worm that never dies." And it cannot be doubted, that his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in ſuch a ſtate, muſt be ſo much the greater, as he enjoyed longer time to increaſe and aggravate his ſins.</p>
            <p>But, ſuppoſing him by timely repentance, "to eſcape from the wrath to come;" even that will be attended with pains and agony of mind, ſufficient to deſtroy for the time, the ſenſe of all paſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and will be ſo much the ſharper and more

diſtreſſing, as it hath been longer deferred. Even they who break off the earlieſt from their ſins, endure enough to overbalance all the guilty plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, for which they bartered their peace, and by which they prepared for themſelves the whips and ſcorpions of an accuſing conſcience.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It early opens the way to the eſteem and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of mankind. Theſe are certainly deſirable, not only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they may generally be conſidered as teſtimonies of merit; but alſo, which is of greater importance, as they give the poſſeſſor the greater opportunity of being uſeful to others. In both theſe reſpect, "a good name is rather to be choſen than great riches, and loving favor than ſilver and gold."</p>
            <p>With whatever ſlight or contempt looſe and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men may affect to ſpeak of religion, and thoſe who profeſs it, I believe there are few ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the difference between virtue and vice, as not to feel a ſecret reſpect for thoſe whoſe conduct teſtifies the purity and integrity of their hearts. To which may be added, that univerſally, in the ſame degree as men appear to be influenced by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the fear of God, they will be truſted, in matters of importance, in preference to others, even by thoſe who are the furtheſt from any preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to religion. And it is particularly to our purpoſe, to obſerve, that the longer perſons are known to have lived in the habits of piety, the more they are eſteemed, and the more confidently truſted, which ought perhaps, to be conſidered, as in part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the reward of an early compliance with the firſt duty of human nature.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is peculiarly amiable in the ſight of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:046207_0013_1020F86BD2167288"/>The moſt ſhining talents, the moſt enlarged im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, and the moſt agreeable temper and diſpoſition, are of no eſtimation with him, in compariſon of piety. "He taketh not pleaſure in the legs of a man. The lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy." And, if "he loveth the righteous," however late their repentance, and return to their duty, may we not juſtly ſuppoſe, that the ſacrifice of youthful inclinations and pleaſures, for the duties of religion; and the dedication of our firſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, time, and abilities, to the father of our ſpirits, muſt be the moſt acceptable offering we can preſent to him? Joſeph reſiſting the ſolicitations of his miſtreſs, and Solomon aſking wiſdom, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to "riches, honor, and the life of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies," muſt in theſe circumſtances, have been more amiable in the ſight of God, than when arrived at the height of their worldly honors; when the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rode in the ſecond chariot of Pharoah; and the latter ſat on the throne of David.</p>
            <p>Finally, under this head—</p>
            <p>Early piety is an early and effectual proviſion againſt the afflictions of life, and the terrors and ſting of death.</p>
            <p>"Man is born to trouble as the ſparks fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;" and he is the happieſt who is beſt prepared, not only to meet it, with an humble and patient ſpirit; but to improve it, for the eſtabliſhment of his piety, and the increaſe of his comfort. Thus improved, every affliction is, in effect, a ſolid bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and the ſharper it has been, the more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it yields. But, it is true religion alone that can thus convert the natural evils of life into the moſt ſubſtantial good; and make that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways grievous to the fleſh, to "yield the peaceable
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:046207_0014_1020F86F75CEEAE8"/>
fruits of righteouſneſs to thoſe that are exerciſed thereby."</p>
            <p>Youth indeed, is apt to promiſe itſelf a long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from pain, diſeaſe, ſorrow, and all the other forms of human miſery; but, how often do they all arrive, in quick ſucceſſion, long before they were expected; and pierce the heart ſo much the deeper, as they were ſuppoſed to be more remote! Againſt all theſe evils, the comforts of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the ſpecial promiſes of the goſpel, are an effectual defence; come as early, and as unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly as they may, and in any ſhape whatever, they cannot be unſeaſonable, neither can they hurt the better part of the chriſtian.</p>
            <p>While they ſerve to correct the levities of the youthful mind, and diſcipline it into patience and humility; they alſo quicken it into early activity and zeal in the ſervice of God; and prepare it for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during with firmneſs, the trials of middle or declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life. Happy then, are they who are thus early ſitted by the grace of God, to meet his will in any of the diſtreſſes to which life is ſubject!</p>
            <p>As to death, there is nothing but piety that can effectually diſperſe its terrors, or render it ſafe. And although youth are apt to place it at a great diſtance, and ſuppoſe themſelves for many years, ſafe from its arreſt; yet, how often doth it ſeize them, in the midſt of their bloom, gaiety and hopes, and deſtroy them at once! And what is infinitely more dreadful than to be torn from life in its higheſt ſtate of enjoyment, if taken unprepared, they are undone forever. If, on the contrary, they have, by early piety, ſecured an intereſt in the merits of Chriſt, they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſafe. They have nothing to regret, leave what they will behind them; ſince they are taken
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:046207_0015_1020F873C4137500"/>
from the evil to come, and go "to he forever with the Lord." The conſideration of ſuch a ſtate of ſecurity from the power of the laſt enemy, who in theſe circumſtances, "after he hath deſtroyed the body, hath nothing more that he can do," muſt be a ſource of the moſt rational ſerenity, and prevent a multitude of diſquieting apprehenſions, againſt which there is no ſure defence, but the hope of eternal life.</p>
            <p>To have this well grounded, in the time of youth, is to be fixed on a rock, which neither time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor death can remove. Thus, by early piety, while nothing neceſſary even for your preſent good is given up: every thing important for life and death is ſecured. By this every enjoyment is improved, and every affliction converted into an occaſion of "working for you a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." This will render you honorable in yourſelves, ornaments to your friends, to ſociety, and to the church. It will fit you for acting your parts with propriety and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in whatever ſtation you are placed; will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you the ſpecial counſel and care of God, in every ſituation through life; his preſence and ſupport in death; and then fix you in immortal youth, honor and bliſs, among the "ſpirits of the juſt made perfect."</p>
            <p>Should you neglect the preſent ſeaſon, when every thing is favorable to the attainment of this bleſſedneſs, you will daily find new difficulties and diſcouragements coming in your way. Increaſing cares, new projects and deſigns for the world, and above all, habits of ſin daily ſtrengthening, will bring with them new embaraſſments.</p>
            <p>While theſe will grow upon you, by inſenſible degrees, you will gradually become leſs thoughtful,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:046207_0016_1020F871143658D0"/>
your purpoſes and reſolution will become weaker and weaker; till at laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you will probably give over all trouble and care about the matter; and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into a fatal eaſe and ſecurity of mind, in which a neglected God may ſuffer you to remain, till your caſe be beyond remedy.</p>
            <p>Your miſery will then be ſharpened, by every comfort you have enjoyed, by every affliction you have ſuffered, and by every admonition you have neglected.</p>
            <p>Or ſhould it pleaſe God, by a ſingular act of mercy, to interpoſe and reſcue you from your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in advanced life, which however no one has reaſon to hope for, after deliberately trifling and ſinning away the ſeaſon of youth, ſhould that be the caſe, what difficulties will you then have to encounter, that would now be avoided; what ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of conſcience, at the remembrance of your waſted youth, and the mercy of God ſo long ſlighted and abuſed; and how often will you be filled with gloomy doubts of your ſtate, and alarming fears of being left at laſt, by the God you ſo long neglected, "to reap the fruit of your doings!"</p>

            <p>Having premiſed the great qualification neceſſary for your acting a ſafe, uſeful and honorable part in life. I proceed to the next thing in order, and that is—</p>
            <p n="2">II. To fix early on ſome uſeful employment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:046207_0017_1020F87664E075D0"/>This is equally a matter of duty and importance, which I hope will appear to you, from the following conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Action and buſineſs are neceſſary for the health of the body, and for chearfulneſs of the mind. The body is ſo framed, as to require fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and vigorous action to keep the ſeveral parts of it, in a ſtate ſuited to perform their reſpective offices to advantage, for the good of the whole. Habitual inactivity weakens the ſprings of life, nouriſhes the ſeeds of pain and diſeaſe, and is ever accompanied with a langour and flatneſs of the ſpirits, which always render life, in a meaſure inſipid, and often tedious and burdenſome.</p>
            <p>Nor will amuſement, however active and varied, be ſufficient to preſerve the mind in a ſtate of chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and calm enjoyment. Where it is inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly purſued, as the main buſineſs of life, it ceaſeth at length, to exite any high emotions of pleaſure, and more certainly fatigues and wears out the ſpirits, than moſt of the uſual employments of life, purſued for the ſame length of time.</p>
            <p>In a ſteady application to buſineſs, ſhould it be even of the harder and more laborious ſort, while vigorous action keeps the channels of life open, and the moving powers of the body properly bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced up, firmneſs of thought and reſolution, joined to ſelf-approbation and the proſpect of advantage, ſerve to keep the mind in an habit of chearfulneſs, to which the idle and diſſipated are utter ſtrangers. It is thus that "the labouring man's ſleep is ſweet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether he eat little or much." And on theſe conſiderations it is, that no claſs of mankind ſeem in general, to have more real enjoyment of life, than they whoſe circumſtances oblige them to "earn their bread by the ſweat of their brow."</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:046207_0018_1020F8BDB72D3E80"/>2. Early employment is neceſſary, in order to make a competent proviſion againſt the evils of want and dependence.</p>
            <p>Theſe are circumſtances to which no man can patiently ſubmit, but either by an inſuperable indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or meaneſs of ſpirit; or by hard neceſſity. Beſides the hardſhips and ſufferings of the body, in a ſtate of want, the mind is ſubject to diſtreſſing anxiety; to fretfulneſs; to ſecret murmuring againſt the providence of God; and often prompted to fraud and violence towards others, as the means of relief. And therefore Agur, with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, makes it a part of his memorable prayer, that he might be kept as well from the evils of poverty, as of riches, "leſt I be poor and ſteal, and take the name of my God in vain." But ſeperate from theſe, which are the greater evils of ſuch a ſtate, the ſlights, grinding and inſults to which it is expoſed, are always painful and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to thoſe who have not loſt their ſenſibility, by the habits of ſuffering. While "the rich hath many friends," to careſs or flatter him, to the ſhame of human nature, "the poor is hated, even of his neighbors.</p>
            <p>To provide againſt theſe evils is a duty which every man owes to himſelf; and will always be the aim of thoſe who are poſſeſſed of any true greatneſs of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And conſidering how full our life is of accidents, that are calculated to diſappoint our purſuits, and how liable every employment is to be interrupted by pain, diſeaſe, infirmity, and a variety of other circumſtances, againſt which no prudence can defend us; it is neceſſary to begin early to buſineſs, and to go on with diligence, while we have the means in our hands. This is eſpecially neceſſary for thoſe
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:046207_0019_1020F878466CDA08"/>
who have nothing or little to depend on, but their own care and good management. To idle away the prime of life, in ſuch circumſtances, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a mind deſtitute of all prudence, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, and leſs attentive to its own good, than the inferior animals of the creation: who, as ſoon as they are capable, begin to do ſomething towards their own ſupport. What have ſuch to expect, but to live always in want, without any juſt claim for thoſe aids of charity, to which the helpleſs, and induſtrious poor are always entitled. 'This we commanded you, ſaith the apoſtle, to the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat." And it generally happens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that where men ſuffer, in conſequence of idleneſs and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they meet with leſs pity than others; and are more ſparingly ſupplied.</p>
            <p>Nor is early induſtry leſs a matter of prudence, and duty, for thoſe who begin the world, with the moſt favorable proſpects. Theſe are ſo liable to change, by cauſes, againſt which no human caution can provide, that he is very unwiſe, who truſts to their continuance, without endeavoring to furniſh himſelf with ſome reſource, in caſe of the worſt.</p>
            <p>But, independent of other cauſes, the beſt capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal on which a man can ſet out, muſt unavoidably waſte, without attention and care on his part, to preſerve it.</p>
            <p>Many who might always, with a little care, have lived in caſe, or affluence, by an idle and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs youth, have been obliged at laſt, either to depend on the bounty of others; or to ſet into buſineſs at a time of life, when every man would wiſh to be leaving it off.</p>
            <p>A ſituation ſo much the more painful and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to them, as they were once in a better, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:046207_0020_1020F8C15DD96350"/>
have to charge themſelves with the cauſe of their calamity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is an excellent defence againſt a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of temptations to which the idle are expoſed.</p>
            <p>It is the nature of the human mind always to require ſomething to employ it. If it have nothing uſeful to engage its attention, it will certainly find ſomething of a different nature. This is eſpecially the caſe with young men, who are more ſtrongly impelled to action, than others, and more certainly run into exceſſes of one kind or another, if their activity be not virtuouſly directed. Under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of health, lively paſſions, and the love of pleaſure, they are ever in danger, but eſpecially when unemployed. It is in this ſtate that the great foe of virtue and human happineſs, finds them moſt open to his artifice, and ready to follow his ſuggeſtions—and he knows ſo well, how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove theſe circumſtances to their ruin, that when he finds them, he ſeldom fails of his point. It is indeed, highly probable, that ſome of the greateſt evils which individuals and communities ſuffer, are the conſequences of vicious principles and habits, contracted in the idleneſs and diſſipation of early life.</p>
            <p>Habitual employment by keeping the thoughts regularly engaged, not only prevents many irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular affections, and vain, if not vicious deſigns; but the evils of wandering and diſſipation, which are generally corrupt morals.</p>
            <p>While the planter is buſied on his plantation, the merchant in his ſtore, the mechanic in his ſhop, and the ſtudent among his books, though he ſhould be deſtitute of virtuous principles; he has neither the ſame leiſure to contrive evil, nor the ſame objects to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>te it, nor opportunity of perpetrating it,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:046207_0021_1020F87DC34B3360"/>
as when he neglects his buſineſs, and is wandering from place to place.</p>
            <p>His engagements in his calling are eſpecially beneficial, as they ſerve to guard him againſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute company, which is ever fatal to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and morals of youth.</p>
            <p>In a word, though ſteady employment will not effectually ſecure you from temptation, or vice, it will certainly often ſave you from both; and the earlier you engage it, the leſs will be your danger of falling into that variety of evils to which idleneſs will ever expoſe you. And I cannot but remark before I diſmiſs this article, that the eaſier circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances a young man is in, the more neceſſary it is, for the ſafety of his virtue, to be habitually well employed, and the reaſon is plain, the more means he has of indulging to eaſe, diſſipation and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the greater temptation he is under to do it.</p>
            <p>In narrow and pinching circumſtances, though the inclinations ſhould be bad, for want of the means of gratifying them, and by the neceſſity of cloſe attention to buſineſs, men are obliged, in many inſtances to check them, and ſo eſcape a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of temptations and vices, which a better ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation would have brought them under.</p>
            <p>In a ſtate of affluence, or plenty, a young man is particularly expoſed to the evils of much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, exceſſive amuſement and diverſion, clubs, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaiments and other faſhionable ways of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, conſcience, and happineſs; and eſpecially ſo, if he intruſts the management of his affairs to others, and lives diſengaged from care and buſineſs. Next to virtue and religion, the beſt defence which the rich can have againſt the peculiar dangers of their ſituation, is uſeful and habitual employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:046207_0022_1020F8C414CE2048"/>The laſt conſideration to be now mentioned on the ſubject is,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is a duty we owe to others.</p>
            <p>We are born in ſociety; we depend on it, for the ſafety of our perſons and propety, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in need of the good will and aſſiſtance of others, for ſome of the moſt valuable enjoyments of life. We are therefore bound, in return for theſe advantages, to contribute ſuch a part to the common good, as our places in ſociety, and our abilities will enable us to do.</p>
            <p>This we are obliged to, as men, on the natural principles of benevolence and gratitude.</p>
            <p>As chriſtians, we are bound to it, by expreſs, and various precepts of the goſpel. "Look not every man on his own things; but every man alſo, on the things of others."</p>
            <p>"As we have opportunity, let us do good to all men," and above all, "thou ſhalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thyſelf." All which undoubtedly intend, that we ſhould do ſomething more than entertain benevolent intentions, and good wiſhes to the reſt of mankind: Theſe are firſt to be cheriſhed, as preparatory principles; and then to be carried into execution, in the moſt extenſive manner in our power.</p>
            <p>Our relations, friends and neighbors, the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and afflicted, and the community of which we are members, are all entitled to a ſhare in our good will, and to ſuch ſervices as we can properly render them.</p>
            <p>But how is this to be done, without ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable employment, that will yield ſomething more, than what our own neceſſities as individuals, or thoſe of our immediate connexions, may require? Should we lead indolent and diſſipated lives, we
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:046207_0023_1020F881682FB840"/>
ſhall be ſo far from being able to aſſiſt others, that we ſhall not have enough for our own neceſſities, and ſo be liable to fall on the bounty of others, or make uſe of fraud or violence, for our ſupport, which is contrary to the firſt law of the ſocial life, "to injure no one." It is therefore the duty of every one, to be engaged in ſome way of life, that will, if poſſible, enable him to fulfil his obligations to ſociety.</p>
            <p>If the time of youth, which is the proper ſeaſon for forming deſigns for future uſefulneſs, be trifled away, in idleneſs and diſſipation; it is hardly to be expected, that much will afterwards be done, either for the community, their connexions, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Should it even happen, which indeed, is but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the caſe, that he who has waſted the prime of his days, in vanity and idleneſs, recover himſelf, and become a uſeful and induſtrious citizen, yet he muſt ever lie under the reproach, of having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded ſociety, of the ſervices he ought to have rendered it, in the time that he loſt, and of having been, for the whole of that time, in ſome meaſure, a detriment and a nuiſance to it.</p>
            <p>On the whole, you ſee that early employment is both a matter of duty, and productive of the moſt important advantages; both the body and the ſoul are the better for it. And while it tends to independence and plenty, it furniſheth the means of gratifying a benevolent heart, in relieving the diſtreſſed, and contributing to the common good. To which may be added, that under the direction of piety, it is an excellent preparative for the higher, more active, and important employments of a better life.</p>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:046207_0024_1020F8C6B5290A10"/>With theſe conſiderations deeply impreſſed on your minds, I hope you will be effectually guarded againſt falling into the ways of that deſtroyer, diſſipation, by which to all appearance, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in the bloom of youth, are daily falling from their friends and their country, into immature and irrecoverable ruin.</p>
            <p>On the ſubject before us, it were eaſy to have enlarged; but flattering myſelf that what hath been ſaid, will be ſufficient to convince you of its importance, I proceed to another, no leſs intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that is</p>
            <p n="3">III. The neceſſity of a prudent choice of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>We are formed for ſociety, are early inclined to it; and from it derive ſome of the principal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures we can enjoy.</p>
            <p>But, in the ſame degree, in which, in ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, it is conducive to virtue and happineſs, in others, it is deſtructive of both. A careful and prudent choice will ſecure the former; a careleſs and imprudent one will as certainly produce the latter.</p>
            <p>You will eaſily underſtand, that I am not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that general intercourſe you muſt have with others, in the common occaſions of life; but, of thoſe particular connexions you will form, for the freedoms and intimacies of friendſhip; or for amuſment and pleaſure. In the former caſe you will have to mingle with men at large, as your particular employments, and your duties to ſociety may require. In the latter, you will act on your own inclinations and choice, and will therefore, need ſo much the more caution and reſerve. To give you as full a view of the ſubject, as my preſent
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:046207_0025_1020F88302B4DB18"/>
deſign will admit of, allow me to ſuggeſt to you the following conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We inſenſibly adopt the ſentiments and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of thoſe with whom we aſſociate, on terms of affection and eſteem. This is particularly the caſe with youth, who are fonder of pleaſing, and more flexible to imitation, than thoſe of advanced life. And from this circumſtance, they have more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to expect, from aſſociating with thoſe of virtuous ſentiments and habits; and more injury to fear from the unprincipled and diſſolute.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it will be almoſt impoſſible, to keep up an habit of intercourſe with perſons of either of the above deſcriptions, in that free and confident manner which is natural to youth, without being in ſome degree, the better or the worſe, for it.</p>
            <p>If you chooſe for your intimates, perſons of juſt ſentiments of religion, of a benevolent temper, and ſober converſation and morals, you will naturally, from the deſire of pleaſing, be induced to conform yourſelves, in a meaſure, to their way of thinking, ſpeaking, and acting. As your love and eſteem of them increaſe, your deſire of imitating them will inſenſibly increaſe alſo, till you will probably, by degrees, become the ſame ſort of perſons, and be fixed in the love and practice of the good qualities you diſcover in them.</p>
            <p>On the ſame principle, if you aſſociate freely with thoſe of bad ſentiments and courſes, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, if you enter with them into the intimacies of friendſhip; you will as naturally be influenced to imitate them—and perhaps, ſo much the more readily, as a bad example has commonly more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence than a good one.</p>
            <p>If your minds have not been early ſeaſoned with religious inſtruction, and impreſſed by the force of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:046207_0026_1020F8C947E1D280"/>
a ſerious and good example, you will ſo much the ſooner be deſtroyed by your company.</p>
            <p>But, ſuppoſing a more favorable caſe, that you have had the beſt inſtruction, and the moſt perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive example, and that, under their influence you enter the world, in love with virtue and religion, and free from the taint of corrupt principles and habits; even in this caſe, ſo inſinuating is bad example, and ſo flexible the heart to evil, that it will be as difficult for you, eſpecially under the prejudices of friendſhip, not to be leſs or more influenced by it, as to aſſociate freely with perſons under contagious diſeaſes, and not be infected. And it will be ſo much the more difficult to preſerve your innocence, in ſuch circumſtances, as you are of a more benevolent and unſuſpicious temper.</p>
            <p>This, which is generally the temper of youth, and which is always improved by religion, will diſpoſe you to compliances, for the ſake of obliging, which though not criminal in themſelves, may inſenſibly lead you on to thoſe which are ſo; till at laſt your conſcience and your peace may receive a dangerous, if not incurable wound. It is thus that many a youth of promiſing appearances hath been gradually corrupted, till all the fair bloſſoms of virtue and happineſs have decayed, and fallen fruitleſs to the ground, while the hopes of parents and friends have periſhed with them. So true and important are the obſervations, "that evil communications corrupt good manners," and that "a companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed."</p>
            <p>It is of importance to obſerve to you—</p>
            <p n="2">2. That when bad connexions are once formed, it is no eaſy matter to break off.</p>
            <p>The principal concern of youth in forming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and intimates is, to find thoſe who poſſeſs
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:046207_0027_1020F885F3662C30"/>
ſociability and gaiety of temper. The more ſolid and uſeful qualifications of knowledge, taſte and virtue, are uſually neglected. If their thoughts can be diverted, their ſpirits enlivened, and new ſcenes of pleaſure and entertainment frequently preſented, it is ſufficient for ſecuring their affection and attachment.</p>
            <p>In theſe circumſtances, blind to each others faults, and inſenſible of the danger they are in; they ſeldom think of breaking off, ſo long as their favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite object of pleaſure can be ſecured. The ſame principles which at firſt united them, will operate to continue their union; till either they meet with thoſe with whom they are better pleaſed, or by ſome means, are made ſenſible of the evil of their ſituation. But, if it be difficult to ſee this, amidſt the careſſes and blandiſhments of friendſhip, it is as much more ſo, to eſcape from it, when diſcovered, as it is eaſier in general to ſee the way of duty, than to purſue it; and as the pleaſures of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and gaiety have more influence on the heart, than the princples of virtue and religion.</p>
            <p>To relinquiſh the company of thoſe who have often entertained us, diverted anxious thoughts, been the confidants of our free and unreſerved ſentiments, and our aſſociates in various ſcenes of amuſement and pleaſure, requires more reſolution than uſually falls to the ſhare of youth, or even of age. An unwillingneſs to offend thoſe who appear to eſteem us, and wiſh to make us happy, increaſes the difficulty, eſpecially with perſons of delicate ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and generoſity of temper.</p>
            <p>And there is another circumſtance which too often occurs, of fatal influence, in keeping young men faſt in the chains of vicious and deſtructive company, which is this—that unprincipled and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:046207_0028_1020F8CC097BA490"/>
diſſolute men are generally fond of increaſing the number of their aſſociates, in order to countenance their vices, and exert the more influence to bring virtue and religion into diſcredit. With this moſt criminal view, they practiſe a variety of arts, to keep in their poſſeſſion thoſe whom they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in their ſociety. Arguments againſt the truth of the goſpel, and the obligations of religion, ridicule of gravity and ſobriety in youth, jeſting on ſerious and religious characters, and inſinuations againſt the ſincerity of all who make a profeſſion of religion, even where it is moſt exactly ſupported, are all employed to their diabolical purpoſe. And theſe arts are the more ſucceſsful, as they unhappily fall in with that fatal depravity of the mind which diſpoſes it gladly to embrace any thing, however falſe and unreaſonable, that gives encouragement to vicious inclination, and ſerves to looſen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of conſcience.</p>
            <p>Should it ever be your unhappineſs to be drawn into the ſociety of ſuch men, conſider them as "enemies of all righteouſneſs;" who, to encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age themſelves in a courſe of tranſgreſſion, would deſtroy in your minds, the only principles that can preſerve the good order, and exiſtence of ſociety, and ſave you from falling into eternal miſery. From theſe conſiderations, it frequently happens, that when young men have formed bad connexions, they gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually loſe all reliſh for better and all juſt ſenſe of their duty and intereſt or even when ſenſible of their danger, find themſelves under ſo many engagements, that they have not reſolution to break through them. "Enter not then, into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid it, paſs not by it, turn from it and paſs away."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:046207_0029_1020F888F9995898"/>As another argument for a prudent and careful choice of company, I mention to you</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is common to judge of men by the characters of thoſe with whom they aſſociate, and it is a juſt and reaſonable way of judging.</p>
            <p>In the common employments of life, men are often unavoidably connected, whoſe principles and habits are in many reſpects, not only very different, but quite oppoſite. Yet even in this caſe where no particular friendſhip is neceſſarily ſuppoſed, they who value their characters will, if poſſible, connect themſelves with thoſe only, who are well eſteemed, or at leaſt, under no remarkable reproach.</p>
            <p>In thoſe voluntary aſſociations which are formed only for the pleaſures of ſociety, the caſe is very different. Theſe always preſuppoſe a certain agreement in taſte, ſentiment and way of life, as the only foundation, and cement of ſuch connexions. The idle and the buſy, the ſober and intemperate, the chaſte and the impure, the ſerious and profane are too much unlike, to be habitual companions. Should ſuch happen to be connected, the diverſity of their inclinations and manner of life, muſt neceſſarily render them ſo unpleaſant to each other, as to prevent a durable friendſhip, and intercourſe. Theſe principles are ſo univerſally acknowledged, that men do not heſitate to pronounce, that "a man is ſuch as the company he frequents."</p>
            <p>If your aſſociates therefore, are perſons of known ſobriety and virtue, it will be judged that you poſſeſs the ſame qualities. If they are looſe, diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated and profane, you will be conſidered as the ſame ſort of perſons. And though aware of this, you ſhould endeavor to keep up appearances, for ſake of your character or intereſt; you will certainly be ſuſpected of conforming to their vices, at leaſt,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:046207_0030_1020F8CFC2615060"/>
while you are in their company, and cannot hope to eſcape the notice of thoſe, whoſe good opinion you would wiſh to gain, or preſerve. And every man who has a juſt regard for his reputation, though he ſhould be influenced by no higher principle, will cautiouſly ſhun the company of men of ill characters, leſt his own ſhould fall under ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>A good name is ſo ſatisfactory in itſelf, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſo many advantages, that he who is careleſs about it, muſt be equally deſtitute of an ingenuous ſpirit, and a regard to his preſent good. More than this, he is inſenſible to the moſt powerful incitement to a juſt and laudable conduct, next to religion itſelf. And indeed, to be indifferent about the opinion of the world, eſpecially of the worthy and virtuous part of it, is to be in the highway to diſhonor, vice and ruin. Take away the reſtraints which ariſe from a regard to commendation and eſteem, and there is nothing left, but the fear of puniſhment, by which human depravity can be deterred from the groſſeſt enormities.</p>
            <p>Be careful then, to preſerve at all times, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the good opinion of others, next to a reverence for your conſciences and the authority of God. Never hazard your characters, for any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification you can find in the company and friendſhip of diſſipated perſons; whatever figure they may make in the world; or by whatever arts or elegance their vices may be garniſhed.</p>
            <p>You will illy forfeit the eſteem of the worthy and virtuous, for the flaſhy and dangerous entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of diſſolute company. And let me particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly remind you, that with all the other evils to which bad connexions will expoſe you, by the loſs of your characters, they will be a bar in the way of your advancing hereafter to diſtinction and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:046207_0031_1020F88C8AD8E2D0"/>
importance in ſociety. If your firſt connexions are with idle and vicious perſons, though you ſhould be happy enough to ſee your error, and forſake them, you will not eaſily gain the confidence of thoſe who know your former way of life, and with whom it was ſpent. It will juſtly be concluded, that you will require time to correct the bad prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and habits you contracted from your company. Every one will be ſhy and backward to truſt you, in any thing of importance, till you have given ſatisfactory proofs that you are fixed in new habits, and in reputable and virtuous ſociety.</p>
            <p>It has frequently happened, that a young man by the error of aſſociating with diſreputable company, at his firſt appearance in the world, has loſt the moſt favorable proſpects of buſineſs, intereſt and promotion, which he has never, by any exertion, been able to recover.</p>
            <p>And certainly, the higheſt pleaſures that can be enjoyed in diſſolute company, are dearly purchaſed, at the expence of honor and eſteem, influence and uſefulneſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this addreſs with the following directions on the ſubject before us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In forming intimacies and friendſhips, be always cautious and ſlow.</p>
            <p>Haſtineſs is a common error of youth; eſpecially where the entertainments of ſociety are concerned. Unacquainted with mankind, it is apt to be taken with the firſt appearances and profeſſions of good-will; without any apprehenſions that they are generally nothing more than cuſtomary forms of civility and politneſs; and often the covering of a diſingenuous, and deſigning temper. By this miſtake, it eagerly runs into connexions, which it muſt either break off, with diſappointment and ſhame; or
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:046207_0032_1020F8D150F63960"/>
endanger every thing important to its happineſs. And to expoſe oneſelf to the former, without any proſpect of ſolid advantage, muſt be the height of folly; and to the latter, little leſs than madneſs.</p>
            <p>You cannot, then, be too cautious, in ſo intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a caſe. Inform yourſelves, as particularly as may be, of the principles, habits and characters, of thoſe with whom you may be induced, to form an intimacy or friendſhip. And leſt you ſhould be deceived and miſled, by truſting to your own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and prudence, be careful to adviſe with thoſe, on whoſe friendſhip and knowledge you can depend. Eſpecially, if you have parents, or guardians, make them your firſt counſellors. This you are bound to do, not only out of reſpect to them; but, for ſake of your own ſafety. They are not only better judges of mankind, than you can be ſuppoſed to be, but, it may juſtly be concluded, that they have too great a regard to your happineſs, either to debar you of any reaſonable enjoyment; or not to warn you of apparent danger.</p>
            <p>By ſuch a precaution, you may ſave your honor, your virtue, and your peace of mind. By raſhly following the impulſes of your own inclination, you may loſe them all.</p>
            <p>Should you be ruined by confidence in your own prudence and virtue, you will forever lie under the reproach of being your own deſtroyer.</p>
            <p>Should you be deceived, after all the precautions you can make uſe of, you will eſcape the greateſt of miſeries, that of being obliged to accuſe yourſelves, as the authors of your unhappineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Should you form connexions dangerous to your virtue and happineſs, I adviſe you immediately to diſengage yourſelves. I have already touched on the difficulties of ſuch a taſk, and you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:046207_0033_1020F88E15E38018"/>
find it as hard, on experiment, as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, if not much more ſo. This I mention, not to diſcourage you, but to prepare you to act with the more firmneſs and deciſion, when you come to the trial.</p>
            <p>To warn you is to arm you. Whatever obſtacles may be in the way, from your own inclinations, or the enticements of your companions, from the entertainment and pleaſure they have afforded you, from any reſpect you may ſuppoſe yourſelves to owe them, from the ſenſe of any favours they have done you, or their power of further ſerving you, whatever figure they may make, or however long they may have been your aſſociates, you are without delay, to make your eſcape. And I urge you to this, the more warmly; becauſe you may ſuppoſe it neceſſary, for ſake of decency, and ſaving appearnces, to do it ſo gradually, as to conceal your deſign, and ſo avoid giving offence, and incur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring unneceſſary reproach.</p>
            <p>Could you fully depend on your reſolution, this might be well enough. But, with moſt, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment would be hazardous, if not entirely fail.</p>
            <p>If after you apprehend your danger, you ſhould allow yourſelves to meet them, at one time, and another, on the ſame terms of freedom and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, you will be in danger of loſing by degrees, your firſt reſolution, till you are again entangled.</p>
            <p>Follow then the firſt dictates of conſciences and duty. To parly with temptation, when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, is deliberately to expoſe yourſelves to guilt, and miſery, which will be ſo much the greater as you have run into it; with your eyes open.</p>
            <p>Fear no ſlight, ridicule, or reproach, you may be likely to ſuffer, by ſo neceſſary a reſolution. The eſteem of good men, the approbation of your own
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:046207_0034_1020F8D5046C33C0"/>
conſciences, and the favor of God, will infinitely outweigh all the inconveniencies it can poſſibly ſubject <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> you to. Finally, in your common inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with others, and in your particular intimacies and friendſhips, make it your ſteady aim and concern, to improve in the knowledge of mankind, and in thoſe generous and benevolent affections which are neceſſary for your acting your parts well in ſociety here, that you may be prepared for the ſociety of the bleſſed hereafter.</p>
            <p>This undoubtedly was the ultimate deſign of God, in enduing us with the ſocial affections, and this is their higheſt excellence. Should you therefore, be miſſed by them, into error and vice, you will not only defeat, as I may ſay, this wiſe and gracious deſign of your creator; but the great purpoſe of the goſpel of Chriſt, which is, "to redeem you from the vain converſation of the wicked," and form you for an everlaſting union with himſelf, and his redeemed family.</p>
            <p>In a virtuous commerce and friendſhip with others, on the amiable and divine principles by which all his followers are to be governed, you will not only enjoy the higheſt pleaſures that this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate can afford; but you will be advanced at laſt, "to an innumerable company of angels, to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt born, which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and to Jeſus the mediator of the new covenant," where friendſhip and love ſhall be ripened into perfection. If on the contrary, you ſhould be ſo loſt to a juſt ſenſe of your duty and happineſs, as to form your principal connexions, with vicious and ungodly men, you muſt expect to be joined to them at laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:046207_0035_1020F89170DC8798"/>Then all the kind and pleaſurable affections of your nature, will be turned into hatred and malice; and they who have been aſſociates in ſin here, will mutually reproach and torment each other, in everlaſting miſery.</p>
            <p>It is an eſtabliſhed law of the goſpel, that "neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the kingdom of God." —And if they can make no part of that ſociety, they are certainly unfit to be the aſſociates of thoſe who would wiſh and hope to be joined to it.</p>
            <p>You ſee then, my dear youth, that every thing important to you depends on the company you keep; your own honor and that of your neareſt friends and relations, your virtue, your uſefulneſs, your peace of mind, and your eternal happineſs, are concerned.</p>
            <p>By all theſe then, and by the love of God, and his ſon Jeſus Chriſt who died to ſave you, I affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately pray you, ſhun the ſociety of wicked men, and form only ſuch intimacies as are founded on virtue and piety, that each of you may be able to ſay, "I am a companion of all them that fear God and keep his precepts."</p>
            <p>The remaining ſubjects within my plan will be conſidered in my next diſcourſe. In the mean time, conſider ſeriouſly, and faithfully, what has been ſaid in this; and you will be prepared to hear me again, I flatter myſelf, with laſting advantage.</p>

            <p>IF my former diſcourſe made any impreſſion on your minds, ſuitable to the importance of the ſubjects it treated of; I ſhall the more certainly obtain your ſerious attention to this.</p>
            <p>The advantages of early religion, of an early application to uſeful employment, and the neceſſity of a prudent choice of company, have been already conſidered and recommended to your ſerious regard.</p>
            <p>The ſubjects of this addreſs are, the government of the temper and paſſions, the evils of an exceſſive attachment to pleaſure, and the great rule by which your hearts and lives are to be governed.</p>
            <p>Each of theſe articles might well employ a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſcourſe, but the limits which I have aſſigned myſelf, oblige me to diſpatch the whole of them in this. I ſhall therefore attempt, under each, to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the moſt important particulars, and enforce them upon you, by ſuitable arguments.</p>
            <p>Of the paſſions or affections in general, it is proper to remark to you, that, ſo far as they are original parts of the human conſtitution, and in any degree lawful, as the principles or ſprings of all our actions and under the government of reaſon and religion, they are highly conducive to our own good, and that of others. On the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:046207_0037_1020F8D8D68DF4D0"/>
that are the conſequences of the diſorder and depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of our nature, and ſo in every degree unlawful; or thoſe that, though lawful in themſelves, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged beyond their juſt and natural bounds, become highly injurious; either to ourſelves only, or to others and ourſeves, at the ſame time. It is the latter ſort, I mean now to conſider. Of theſe I intend pride, envy, ambition, anger, malice and revenge. Theſe are all founded in immoderate ſelf-love; and, except the firſt, are directly of a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent and vicious nature.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to pride—without conſidering whether it be ſtrictly ranked among the paſſions, or not, I obſerve, that it is not only as unreaſonable, as the worſt of them, being in all reſpects, moſt unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a fallen and miſerable creature, but is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of pernicious effects, both on the individual who is the ſubject of it, and on others.</p>
            <p>It is unjuſt in itſelf, as all the advantages of fortune, body, and mind, which one man can poſſeſs above another, are to be aſcribed to the bounty of God, independent of any merit in himſelf, as the procuring cauſe of them. "For who maketh thee to differ; and what haſt thou, that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doſt thou glory, as if thou hadſt not received it?"</p>
            <p>It is injurious to the poſſeſſor, as it renders him always uneaſy, leſt he ſhould not be treated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his importance in his own eyes, makes him ſuſpicious of offences, where none have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, impatient of controul, reſentful, liable to ſtudied ſlights and inſults from others, and eſpecially, offenſive to God, "before whom, every one that is proud in heart is an abomination." As to its effects on others, beſides indifference, haughtineſs and contempt, which to moſt men are unpleaſant
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:046207_0038_1020F898938D6AB8"/>
and provoking, it often prompts to cruelty, injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and revenge, which the proud ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves entitled to practiſe, in conſideration of their ſuperior importance</p>
            <p>In all reſpects, it is a mean and contemptible paſſion; a ſure indication of want of knowledge, and ſolid worth, and which as certainly as any other vice, is one way or another, puniſhed even in this world.</p>
            <p>Humility, on the contrary, is ever ſure of being reſpected, and always gains the moſt, where it claims the leaſt. And what is infinitely more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than all, the honor and reſpect it can gain from man; it is ever of the higheſt eſtimation in the ſight of God. For thus ſaith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe name is holy; I dwell in the high and holy place; with him alſo that is of an humble and contrite ſpirit; to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the ſpirit of the contrite ones." "It is therefore, better to be of an humble ſpirit with the lowly, than to divide the ſpoil with the great."</p>
            <p n="2">2. Envy.—It has been ſaid that this is the firſt of the injurious paſſions that operates in the mind. Whatever be the order in which it makes its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, it is in every degree criminal, and moſt oppoſite to all the principles of benevolence, and the conſtitution of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>The object of envy is always the good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of others, whether it be their eaſe, wealth, reputation, influence, or any other circumſtance of enjoyment—And it has this peculiar malignancy in its nature, to wiſh to leſſen that happineſs, though it ſhould not, by that means, make any addition to its own. It even ſeems to be uneaſy that there ſhould be any happineſs in the world, but that
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:046207_0039_1020F89A1F171B40"/>
which falls to itſelf, ſince they who are under its influence, are diſſatisfied with their ſuperiors, for being in better, circumſtances, with their equals, for being as happy as themſelves, and with their inferiors, for ſeeming contented and happy in their condition, and eſpecially, if in the way of improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to an equality with their own. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſo malevolent a temper is, that wherever they look, they diſcover objects to offend and diſquiet them. They are therefore, habitually fretful, gloomy and diſcontented; and ſo incapable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying what they poſſeſs, however ſufficient for their happineſs. Their ſecret diſquietude and anguiſh, like a ſlow poiſon on the vitals, preys upon their ſpirits, and gradually conſumes the powers of enjoyment, till their life becomes inſipid and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſome.<note n="*" place="bottom">There have been inſtances of perſons being ſo affected by this paſſion, as to fall into lingering and incurable diſeaſe.</note> Solomon has therefore forcibly deſcribed it, in this view, as "the rotteneſs of the bones." And while it thus affects the envious themſelves, it prompts to ſubtle and malicious methods of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the happineſs and proſperity of thoſe who are envied, to unprovoked reſentments, defamation, injuſtice, and other injuries, equally diſhonorable and criminal.</p>
            <p>There is nothing indeed within the bounds of human malevolence which this vicious paſſion cannot perpetrate, when it has got full poſſeſſion of the heart. And therefore, the wiſe man obſerves— "Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous, but who is able to ſtand before envy." Through envy Cain killed his brother Abel, "becauſe his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:046207_0040_1020F89BCD503BD0"/>
Joſeph's brethren envying him for the particular affection of his parents, and the honor and reſpect which he had dreamed would be paid him, by all his family, ſold him to the Medianites, to be carried into Egypt, as a ſervant forever. Saul envying David the glory he obtained by his victory over Goliah, purſued him with inveterate hatred, and hunted him for his life. And to name no other inſtance, becauſe none greater can be named, moved with envy, at the miracles, authority and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, the rulers of the Jews perſecuted him with unrelenting malice; and at laſt, delivered him to the Romans, to be put to death. So great an evil is envy, and ſo neceſſary to be excluded from the breaſts of all who would wiſh to preſerve the peace of their own minds, and be clear of the guilt of deſtroying that of others!</p>
            <p>In order to this, conſider, that as far as ſome may be ſuperior to you in any of the means of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you may be ſuperior to others, and that the ſame righteous providence which hath given you the particular advantages you enjoy, hath given to others, thoſe which place them above you. There is therefore, no more reaſon why you ſhould be diſſatisfied with others, for their enjoyments, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, than that others ſhould be diſſatisfied with you, for yours.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo, that to envy others the happineſs that God hath given them, is to find fault with the diſtribution he hath made of his favors, which is highly criminal in his ſight, "who giveth no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any of his matters."</p>
            <p>Endeavor to be contented with your lot, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſadvantages may attend it. There is nothing will make you eaſier, in the moſt unfavorable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſo effectually prevent all the motions
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:046207_0041_1020F8DB5E938F78"/>
of envy, and its attendant diſquietudes, as this. Should you have no more than the mere ſupports of life, remember that the beſt of men have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been deſtitute even of theſe—"both naked and without any certain dwelling place."</p>
            <p>Conſider how certainly an envious temper will render you incapable of enjoying the advantages that are in your poſſeſſion; and diſqualify you for thoſe habits of benevolence which are neceſſary for you, both as men and chriſtians, and for that ſtate of happineſs hereafter, from which envy and competition will be utterly excluded. Cultivate a vigorous good will to all men, and inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining at their happineſs, you will make it an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of increaſing your own. With ſuch a temper, if others weep, you will weep with them, and your ſympathy will be repaid with ſubſtantial plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure—If others rejoice, you will rejoice with them, and ſo your enjoyment will be doubled.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Ambition is alſo a turbulent and dangerous paſſion, againſt which it will be neceſſary for you to be much on your guard.</p>
            <p>This is ſometimes called emulation; which in a qualified ſenſe, is an argument of a generous ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and under proper regulations, highly uſeful both to individuals and ſociety.</p>
            <p>It gives animation and vigour both to the body and mind; and often produceth excellence in knowledge, art, and enterprize, which without it, would never have appeared. It is however too commonly accompanied with envy, by which it is at leaſt, hurtful to thoſe who poſſeſs it. Ambition in its cuſtomary acceptation, is generally attended with malevolence, in a leſs or greater degree, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the objects to which it aſpires. When it aims at diſtinction in wealth and figure, in fame of valor and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:046207_0042_1020F89F6E9C3488"/>
conqueſt, in authority and dominion; and eſpecially when it is intenſe and violent, it occaſions more diſorder in the mind, and greater evils to ſociety, than any other paſſion. There is nothing, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mean and criminal in itſelf, or injurious to others, that it does not employ in its ſervice. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, flattery and falſhood, bribery, injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and cruelty, faction and tumult, bloodſhed and deſolation, are often made ſubſervient to its purpoſes. Nor are the ties of friendſhip or even of nature ſtrong enough to reſtrain it, when it is neceſſary to its views, that they ſhould be broken.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the greateſt part of the hiſtory of the world is made up of horrid details of war, cruelty and maſſacre, produced by the phrenzy and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ambition.</p>
            <p>But, happy for mankind, there are few in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to admit of proſpects ſufficient to excite it to that ferocity, which equally deſtroys, without heſitation or remorſe, the rights and peace of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, and nations.</p>
            <p>In the bulk of men, it aims at nothing more than to gain ſome trifling advantage in name or appearance, above thoſe who are in the ſame way, or condition of life, or to make a ſhow of dignity and importance, above their real merit and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
            <p>The following are the more common inſtances of it; and therefore, moſt deſerving of our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It prompts ſome to make a figure in dreſs, equipage and manner of living, which they have not ability to ſupport. By this unreaſonable vanity, they often exhauſt, in a little time, the fund they ſet out upon; and which with more moderate views, might have ſupported them with comfort, decency and credit. The conſequence of which is, that
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:046207_0043_1020F8DCE7F36EA8"/>
they are obliged to fall back, with mortification and diſhonor, into circumſtances which they before deſpiſed; and there perhaps, to continue. And it often happens, that they who have innocently contributed to its gratification, are involved in the ruin that follows it.—The hireling and mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic are defrauded of the reward of their labors, the merchant of the value of his goods, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the orphan of his portion and dependance.</p>
            <p>It puts others upon wild and extravagant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which, if practicable at all, coſt more in the execution, than they are afterwards worth; yet, when ſuch men have ſet out in a favorite en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, they will continue in their error, to the detriment, if not ruin of their eſtates and families; rather than be thought deſtitute of ſpirit and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance; or weak enough to attempt that, which they could not effect.</p>
            <p>By the ſame vanity, others engage in employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſet up for offices, for which they have no competent qualifications—And the conſequence is, that if they do not bring upon themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; they are at leaſt, not entitled to reſpect— whereas, with a juſt eſtimate of their talents and merit, in other occupations, or departments, they might not only have benefited ſociety, but perhaps have acquired diſtinguiſhed reputation.</p>
            <p>In theſe inſtances, if ambition be not attended with envy and ill will of others; it at leaſt perverts the reaſon, and deſtroys the peace and enjoyment of the ambitious, and interrupts that order which is neceſſary for the good of ſociety.</p>
            <p>To guard againſt this diſquieting and injurious paſſion, conſider, how little figure and diſtinction in the eyes of the world, will avail to real happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while your minds are in a ſtate incapable of
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:046207_0044_1020F8A2F9974940"/>
enjoying it. If you had all the notice and reſpect that were ever gained by wealth, power, and office, it would be impoſſible for you to be happy, while you are ſo diſcontented in your preſent ſituation, as to be continually aiming at new honors, and pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. It is the nature of ambition to grow more reſtleſs and importunate, by every new attainment. Succeſs in its purſuits is but new fuel thrown into the flame that is already too ſtrong, and which muſt at length, conſume the breaſt where it is kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled. If it were even poſſible for the objects of ambition to afford their poſſeſſors all that they wiſh for, yet, how ſoon muſt they vaniſh away, and be no more to them, than they were to others a thouſand years before!</p>
            <p>Affliction will render you inſenſible to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and death will deſtroy the remembrance of them forever.</p>
            <p>Diſtinction is at an end in the grave. "The honorable man and the counſellor, and the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning artificer, and the eloquent orator," lie on the ſame level with thoſe who died unhonored and unnoticed.</p>
            <p>Moderate your fondneſs for every thing that has no other good, but that which depends on opinion and caprice. "The world paſſeth away; and the luſt thereof; but he that doth the will of God abideth forever."</p>
            <p>In the ſame degree as you aim at the things of another world, you will be cured of a paſſionate fondneſs for the imaginary advantages of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Endeavor to excel in virtue, in which there can be neither injury, nor exceſs; and in which, to be ſuperior to others, is only to be more honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the ſight of God, and more happy in yourſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:046207_0045_1020F8DFF5174F00"/>This is diſtinction worthy of a rational and immortal being; and will give you, in the moſt obſcure condition of life, a pleaſure infinitely more ſolid and permanent, than any you can derive from the exterior advantages of the world; though you poſſeſſed them in the higheſt degree, that human vanity has ever aſpired to.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Anger or reſentment.</p>
            <p>Under proper reſtraints, this is not only lawful; but uſeful and neceſſary. It is, however a matter, of no ſmall difficulty to moderate it, ſo as not to go beyond the bounds of its natural and intended uſe.</p>
            <p>Apt to be excited on ſudden, and unexpected occaſions, it is leſs ſubject to the controul of reaſon, and ſooner runs to exceſs, than moſt of the other paſſions. It is for this reaſon, that even in perſons of an habitual good temper, it often riſes to great exceſs, before there is time to conſider its tendency, and call in the aids of reaſon or religion, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract it.</p>
            <p>On the body, when exceſſive, ſome of its effects are, hurry and agitation of the ſpirits, trembling, weakneſs; and in ſome conſtitutions pain, apoplexy, and ſudden death. On the mind, confuſion of thought and reaſon, ſometimes diſtraction, and always violent determinations. In conſequence of theſe, abuſive language, and other injuries far above the provocation which excited them. There is nothing indeed, which in theſe circumſtances, it cannot perpetrate. The innocent as well as the guilty, friend as well as foe, are at theſe times, equally expoſed to its fury. Even life itſelf has often been ſacrificed to its impetuoſity, in violation of the tendereſt ties of friendſhip, and natural rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; friend has haſtily murdered friend, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſtroyed brother. Thus "Wrath is cruel,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:046207_0046_1020F8A4900A00B8"/>
and anger outrageous," and "reſteth in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of fools."</p>
            <p>To indulge it, after there is time for recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and reſiſtance, is as great a mark of folly and weakneſs, as it is criminal and hurtful. A wiſe man will endeavor to moderate it, where there is a juſt reaſon for expreſſing it, to ſuppreſs the firſt motions of it, where there is danger of its riſing to exceſs, or entirely to prevent it, by avoiding, if poſſible, thoſe occaſions that would be apt to excite it.</p>
            <p>There are few indeed, ſo happy in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves, as to be able to do any of theſe as duty or prudence would point out—But, it is certainly incumbent on every one, for ſake of his own peace of mind, and that of others, reſolutely to attempt them; and there are few of ſo irritable and reſentful a temper, who might not, by habitual care and vigilance, acquire the aſcendancy over it.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, conſider where it may be proper to indulge your anger at all, and if proper, to what degree. Conſider how liable you are to miſtake the nature of offences, and to over-rate the degree of their guilt; and alſo, in how many inſtances, for faults of your own, you may ſtand in need of the patience and good nature of others; and eſpecially, of the forbearance of God, "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom, if he ſhould mark iniquity, who ſhall ſtand?" This latter conſideration, if duly attended to, will produce the happieſt effects.</p>
            <p>Under an habitual ſenſe of your daily offences againſt God, you will think leſs of thoſe committed againſt yourſelves, and be more ready to treat them with lenity.</p>
            <p>It will be often prudent and neceſſary for you, entirely to overlook the faults of thoſe who are
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:046207_0047_1020F8E2988465D0"/>
under your management and authority. This will ſave you a great deal of uſeleſs vexation, and your reſentment, when it muſt be expreſſed, will have the better effect. By finding fault with every thing you ſee amiſs, and ſuffering it to put you out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, you will acquire an habit of fretfulneſs and anger, that will keep you conſtantly four and unhappy.</p>
            <p>When your anger has by any cauſe been excited, endeavor, as ſoon as poſſible, to recover your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity. Though the greateſt danger is generally, from the firſt tranſports of this paſſion; yet, when it is cheriſhed, for any length of time, after the occaſion which produced it, there is great danger of its rankling into malice and revenge. And it is worthy of your notice, that this is more apt to be its effect, in thoſe who are ſlow and phlegmatic in their temper, than in the quick and fiery.</p>
            <p>The latter are to be dreaded, only in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their rage, the others moſt, after you would ſuppoſe them to have cooled, and forgiven the provocation.</p>
            <p>It is an excellent precept of the apoſtle, "Let not the ſun go down upon thy wrath." The force of which might probably depend on this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that during the night, the mind being unemployed by thoſe objects which entertain it, through the day, is more apt to dwell upon, and to magnify real or ſuppoſed injuries; and to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate meaſures of revenge. Or it might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the time of the evening ſacrifice, which was about ſunſet; and which required that all animoſities and differences ſhould be ſettled, before the ſolemnity could be properly attended. "If thou bringeſt thy gift to the altar, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membereſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee;
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:046207_0048_1020F8A7A1E5B818"/>
leave there thy gift before the altar; and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy brother; and then come and offer thy gift." This is certainly the ſtrongeſt poſſible argument againſt continued anger and animoſities, becauſe it implies, that while our minds are diſcompoſed and fretted with reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, our religious offerings will not be accepted. Beſides, he who lies down with anger and ill will, has not only been unfit for the devotions of the evening; but will moſt probably riſe with the ſame temper, and be unfit for thoſe of the morning alſo, a caſe certainly, of equal guilt and danger to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>In the management of this paſſion, it will greatly aſſiſt you to conſider often the evils that attend it, the diſquietude, fury and raſhneſs it occaſions, the ſhame it will often put you to, and the repentance and ſelf reproach, you muſt exerciſe, if you would hope to be pardoned even by men. Make it a part of your daily devotions, to pray for a ſuitable temper towards others, under all provocations and offences. This will bring you into an habit of watching over your hearts; till you will acquire by degrees, at leaſt, ſo far, the government of this impetuous paſſion, as not to deſtroy your own peace, or be injurious to others.</p>
            <p>And I particularly urge you, to endeavor to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due it, now while you are young; and your minds leſs liable to be ruffled and vexed, than they will probably be hereafter. Increaſing cares, diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and infirmities, may render you more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of injuries, and induce an habit of fretfulneſs and intemperate reſentments, that will make you not only contemptible, but wretched. "He that is ſlow to anger, is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his ſpirit, than he that taketh a city." We come now to conſider.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:046207_0049_1020F8E54EA74438"/>5. Malice and revenge.</p>
            <p>I have put theſe together, becauſe the one almoſt unavoidably runs into the other.</p>
            <p>Malice is properly continued anger, accompanied with hatred and ill will. It is a black and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant paſſion, which will allow no merit, or good qualities, to thoſe who are its objects. It diſpoſes to miſrepreſent their beſt intentions, words and actions, and will make no allowance for their failings, however innocent and pardonable.</p>
            <p>It prevents thoſe good wiſhes and ſervices, which all men owe to one another, and without which, the bonds of ſociety muſt neceſſarily be diſſolved. And what is ſtill worſe, it prompts to violent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal injuries; and takes pleaſure to inflict them, however diſtreſſing to thoſe who ſuffer them. When this is done, by way of ſatisfaction for injuries, real or ſuppoſed, it is properly revenge—And when I name this, I name almoſt the higheſt effort of a depraved and abandoned heart. It is the more vile and criminal, as it is deliberate, ſubtle, and determined in its meaſures, and therefore cannot plead, haſtineſs of impulſe, which may often be allowed as an apology for the violence of anger.</p>
            <p>There is nothing indeed, too black for ſuch a temper; and no caution or vigilance can ſecure thoſe who are its objects, from falling a prey to it.</p>
            <p>From this view of theſe worſt of paſſions, you will at once ſee the neceſſity of preventing them, if poſſible, from ever obtaining a place in your breaſts. They are in themſelves ſo deformed, and ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually deſtroy thoſe benevolent affections which form the dignity of the ſoul; and render it ſo unlike the ſtandard of love and goodneſs, that you cannot treat them with ſufficient abhorrence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:046207_0050_1020F90D27C58C90"/>There is no injury you can receive, by whatever circumſtances it may be aggravated, ſufficient to juſtity you in repaying the authors of it, with malice and revenge.</p>
            <p>Where it is your duty to obtain redreſs of any wrongs you may have ſuſtained, in your property, perſon, or reputation; purſue your meaſures with calmneſs and moderation of temper; free from that ſpirit of revenge which, in ſuch caſes, too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly prevails, even where men act agreeably to the order which the public authority has preſcribed. To proſecute thoſe who have injured you, with a view to gratify your reſentment, is as inconſiſtent with true benevolence, as it is contrary to the expreſs ſtatutes of the goſpel. And yet, how common is it, for evil minded men, to put one another to unneceſſary coſt and trouble, at law, chiefly with a view to gratify a ſplenetic and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful temper, while they juſtify themſelves, and ſtifle the reproaches of conſcience, by the pretext of acting according to the preſcribed forms of the community they belong to? Thus "they flatter themſelves in their own eyes, 'till their iniquity be found to be hateful." And ſo it will be at laſt, with this and every other vicious principle, however diſguiſed, for the preſent, by plauſible appearances.</p>
            <p>Let me particularly caution you, againſt that falſe ſenſe of honor, which is ſo faſhionable in the world; and which, under a fair name, perpetrates the worſt of crimes, that a malicious and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpirit can occaſion. This is ſo far from that true honor which originates in generoſity and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind; that it is nothing but violent ſelf-love and pride, producing impatience of the ſlighteſt injuries, and affronts, and prompting to furious reſentment, that can often be ſatisfied with nothing leſs than the life of the offender.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:046207_0051_1020F8E8125D2FE8"/>It is entirely in this that the practice of duelling is founded, than which, there is nothing more mean, criminal and cruel, that has ever been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in civilized and chriſtian ſocieties; and nothing more deſerving of being baniſhed from all good governments, by the heavieſt penalties.</p>
            <p>Let me beſeech you, never to think it neceſſary for your honor, as it certainly never can be, to ſacrifice to it, either your own life, or that of another, in this faſhionable, but moſt guilty way of murder. Should you fall in ſuch a conflict, you would fall without hope—Or ſhould you deſtroy your adverſary, you would bring upon your ſouls, the guilt of diſpatching him, as a victim to your pride and reſentment, with all his ſins upon him, into the eternal world. And unleſs you ſhould ſuffer the anguiſh of repentance, proportioned to ſo enormous a crime; and his blood be waſhed from your conſcience, by that of the great atonement; you muſt bear it on your ſoul to the bar of God, where you would meet the revengeful ſpirit of your adverſary, to accuſe you; and ſuffer with it, the judgement "of him, to whom vengeance belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth." Cultivate that true honor which is founded in virtue and religion; and it will put you far above the meanneſs and cruelty, of revenging your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at the expence of all that can be dear to your fellow creatures.</p>
            <p>Finally conſider, that while a malicious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful temper will deſtroy the peace of your own minds, and render you the moſt dangerous members of ſociety; it will entirely unfit you for the ſervices of religion, and the enjoyment of God.</p>
            <p>"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourſelves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, vengeance is mine; I will repay, ſaith the Lord.

Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, give him drink, for in ſo doing, thou ſhalt heap coals of fire on his head." If your kindneſs ſhould even ſail of melting him into good will and love; it will at leaſt juſtify you to your conſciences and to God; and you muſt leave your adverſary to "bear his judgment."</p>
            <p>On the whole, as to the government of your temper and paſſions, in general, conſider, that, in the ſame degree as, under the direction of reaſon and conſcience, they will greatly conduce to your happineſs; while they are moved by the impulſe of preſent objects, without regard to the ends they were intended to anſwer, in your conſtitution, they will be the occaſions of innumerable errors and diſquietudes, to your unſpeakable miſery.</p>
            <p>Habits of good nature, moderation and patience, will place every thing around you, in a pleaſant and agreeable light, while envy and pride, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, anger and malice, or any one of them, or any other untoward and irregular paſſion, will render you incapable of enjoying the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous condition.</p>
            <p>The due government of your temper and paſſions will not only qualify you to enjoy the comforts that a bounteous providence may afford you, with chearfulneſs and delight, but, it will enable you to bear the afflictions that may befall you, with evenneſs and fortitude.</p>
            <p>Such an happy ſtate of mind will alſo diſpoſe you to thoſe offices of good will to others, which form ſo great a part of your duties, and from which ariſe ſome of the moſt ſolid and delicate pleaſures, that human nature is capable of enjoying.</p>
            <p>Accuſtom yourſelves, early to diſcipline your paſſions, and as you advance in years, you may
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:046207_0053_1020F8EAE6EDF140"/>
expect the labor and pain of doing it, will gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally leſſen.</p>
            <p>Remember, that in the ſame degree, as the government of your hearts is neceſſary for your happineſs in this world, it is alſo, for that of the world to come. It is impoſſible, in the nature of things, that ſuch a diſorderly and turbulent ſtate of the ſoul, as renders it unfit for the enjoyment of God here, ſhould be capable of enjoying him hereafter, in that ſtate, where complete happineſs depends on the unvarying order of all its powers.</p>
            <p>Keep always before you, the precepts and example of the ſon of God, in whoſe life, you will find the moſt ſhining inſtances of love, patience and moderation. The more you attend to theſe, and the more you imbibe of thoſe divine principles which influenced his conduct, the more certainly you will ſucceed, in every amiable and virtuous diſpoſition, till love to mankind will be your governing principle, next to that of love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God.</p>
            <p>And to inſure you all the comforts and advantages of ſubduing your paſſions, I recommend it to you, above all, to commit yourſelves to the tuition and conduct of the ſpirit of God. After all the efforts of your own reaſon and reſolution, this muſt be your main reſource and dependance. "Lean not to your own underſtanding," you are carefully to employ it, but not to make it your truſt.</p>
            <p>"It is God who worketh in us, to will and to do of his own good pleaſure." And this, after every experiment, you will find to be your only hope. "Keep thy heart, with all diligence; for out of it are the iſſues of life."</p>
            <p>"Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil-ſpeaking, be put away from you,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:046207_0054_1020F91541F6D2A8"/>
with all malice, and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted; forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake, hath forgiven you."</p>
            <p>We come now to conſider the evils of an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive attachment to pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Pleaſure is the idol of all ages of life, and all conditions of mankind and while there is a capacity of enjoying it, no one can be indifferent to its impreſſions.</p>
            <p>But, it is in the ſeaſon of youth, when health and vigor of body eaſe and chearfulneſs of mind, and quickneſs of ſenſibility, peculiarly qualify for the enjoyment of it, that it is moſt intenſely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; and as it is then, that the heart is moſt under its impreſſion; it is then alſo, that it is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to its votaries Before I go farther it will be proper to mention, that I am not conſidering pleaſure in the largeſt meaning of the word. Thoſe refined enjoyments which ariſe from the purſuit and acquiſition of knowledge; from taſte and ſentiment; from friendſhip and religion, can never be deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of blame, as they cannot be purſued to exceſs. I intend thoſe only which ariſe from the gratification of our animal deſires and appetites; and the love of amuſement.</p>
            <p>The principal evils of pleaſure, in this view, are</p>
            <p n="1">1. It impairs the animal powers and capacities.</p>
            <p>Theſe are fitted by the conſtitution of God, for a certain degree of exertion, or excitement; and it is only within this degree, that they can either yield their proper ſatisfactions; or be preſerved in their natural ſtrength.</p>
            <p>However firm and vigorous the conſtitution, exceſſive gratification of the appetites, eſpecially
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:046207_0055_1020F8ECC9EBCB80"/>
when habitual, will, by degrees, impair and deſtroy the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>It occaſions weakneſs, obſtructions, pain and diſeaſe, which, if they do not immediately ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in death; will certainly incapacitate the body, for its proper enjoyments and ſervices.</p>
            <p>It is thus, that multitudes of young men fitted by their conſtitutions, for a courſe of vigorous action, for toil, hardſhip and enterprize, are early reduced to the infirmities of old age; to bear an inſipid and weariſome life, in a ſtate uſeleſs to themſelves and others.</p>
            <p>Some, indeed, by reaſon of extraordinary ſtrength, are able to hold out in a courſe of habitual intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, to a conſiderable advance in years. But, for one ſuch, a thouſand are deſtroyed, before they have "lived out half their days." And of thoſe who ſurvive their exceſſes, beyond middle life; there is ſcarcely one, who does not dearly pay for them, with a complication of bodily miſeries.</p>
            <p>Not only is the body injured, by exceſs in the lower and groſſer gratifications of animal nature, but alſo, by an intenſe purſuit of thoſe pleaſures which ariſe from various ſorts of amuſement. Of theſe, there are ſome that immediately affect it, by exciting to violent or long continued exerciſe, that waſtes the animal ſpirits, and impairs the ſtrength. There are others, that affect the body, indirectly, by throwing the mind into diſquietude, vexation, and other irregular emotions, that gradually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the health and conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Among the former, the moſt uſual in this part of the country is hunting, which however innocent and uſeful, when moderately purſued, is very pernicious, by being too frequently practiſed, and
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:046207_0056_1020F9172879EC58"/>
often continued, till the ſtrength and ſpirits are fairly exhauſted.<note n="*" place="bottom">The great quantity of under-growth and boggy ground, in this country, render this exerciſe very laborious; and being often purſued in very hot wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, breaks down many good conſtitutions.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Among the latter, gaming is very pernicious, being always attended with anxiety, and often producing violent anger, and the vexations of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, which cannot fail of diſturbing the order and regularity of the animal functions. It is alſo injurious, by being often practiſed, at thoſe hours of the night, when the body ought to enjoy the refreſhment of reſt and ſleep. Its injuries to the health, are not, indeed, uſually, as ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or, as violent as thoſe of many other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; but, they are equally certain, in one degree or another; and eſpecially to perſons of weak and delicate conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>They who purſue them, in theſe circumſtances, are ſo much the more blameable, as they are the more liable to be affected by them. And even they whoſe ſtrength of conſtitution renders them leſs ſenſible of immediate injury, ought to conſider, that to impair their health, in any meaſure, by unprofitable purſuits, is to incur the guilt of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing ſolid good, without the hope of equivalent compenſation.</p>
            <p>On the whole, wherever men purſue their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as the main object of their purſuits; in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are placed, health and vigour of body are eaſily ſacrificed to them. Every inſtance of exceſs is, in a leſs, or greater degree, injurious, and the oftener it is repeated, the more certainly it is deſtructive. A good conſtitution may bear it
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:046207_0057_1020F8F083F30068"/>
for a time; but, ſooner or later, it will ſink under it.</p>
            <p>Beſides the injuries which an immoderate love of pleaſure occaſions to the body, it is alſo hurtful to the preſent intereſts of men, in the affairs and buſineſs of the world. "The drunkard and the glutton ſhall come to poverty, and drowſineſs ſhall cover a man with rags."</p>
            <p>It is univerſally true, that when it is intenſely purſued, buſineſs muſt neceſſarily be neglected. Care and uſeful employment can be regarded only as things of ſecondary moment, while the appetites muſt be gratified, at any expence.</p>
            <p>And, while this is the caſe, honor and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt alſo be made a ſacrifice. It is thus, that many who have ſet out in the world, with the beſt advantages, have gradually, perhaps in a very little time, ſunk into reproach and diſgrace, from which they have never recovered. "He that loveth pleaſure ſhall be a poor man, he that loveth wine and oil, ſhall not be rich."</p>
            <p>No expenſe indeed, is equal to the wants of men devoted to their pleaſures.</p>
            <p>They can ſoon exhauſt the largeſt eſtate, where they are called upon, by the importunacy of a pleaſurable diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>It is a conſuming fire, which, the more you throw into it, the more intenſely it burns, till it waſtes all within its reach.</p>
            <p>And while it deſtroys all the intereſts of the body, and the reputation, which is ſtill more valuable— it is alſo</p>
            <p n="2">2. Injurious to the acquiſition of knowledge; and deſtructive of moral and religious ſentiments.</p>
            <p>It is hardly to be expected, that he who is intent on his pleaſures ſhould be anxious for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:046207_0058_1020F919D66EB4D0"/>
of his mind. Theſe objects are ſo different, that the one muſt unavoidably claſh with the other. And therefore it uſually happens, that men devoted to their pleaſures, ſeldom attain to diſtinction in uſeful and important knowledge. This requires, not only elegance of taſte; but retirement from the world, and ſteadineſs of application; neither of which can be expected, where the love of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is the reigning diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Animal gratification, and trifling amuſements, debaſe the inclinations, and create an averſion from thoſe objects, in attention to which the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is enlarged and ſtrengthened. The beſt natural genius muſt fall a ſacrifice, where the mind is in love with pleaſure, as its principal object. And ſo it has happened that young men of the moſt promiſing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, have ſunk, after raiſing the higheſt expectations, into a diſreliſh of every valuable purſuit and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; till ſcarce a trace of their genius and abilities has remained. It has even been the caſe, that the beſt capacity for knowledge, has ſometimes been ſo impaired, by the love of pleaſure, as to be reduced to a ſtate little better than idiotiſm itſelf.</p>
            <p>This, if there were nothing more, is ſad deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great and excellent powers of the ſoul. But, the effects of pleaſure are ſtill more formidable. It deſtroys moral and religious ſentiments. Theſe are the higheſt order of our endowments, and qualify us for enjoyments, as much ſuperior to thoſe which depend on our intellectual powers, as the latter are to the higheſt animal ſenſation. It is by theſe we are capable of acting from a ſenſe of the authority of God; and with a view to his approbation, and the rewards of piety and obedience. This ſenſe is the great rule by which our conduct, motives and enjoyments, are to be governed, in reference to the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:046207_0059_1020F8F314D3E4D8"/>
laſt and higheſt purpoſes of our being—And ſo far as it maintains its due authority in the ſoul, we ſhall be influenced to live "ſoberly," in the uſe of our appetiies and paſſions, "righteouſly," in regard to the demands which others have upon us, and "godly," in the practice of thoſe duties which we immediately owe to God himſelf.</p>
            <p>Yet, great and important as this principle is, both for our conduct and happineſs; an exceſſive attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pleaſure has a direct tendency to render it entirely ineffectual for the ends it was intended to anſwer. And this is more certainly the caſe, where it is purſued in the gratification of the animal appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites. There is ſo great a difference between the principles of the fleſh and the ſpirit, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in the preſent ſtate of human nature, they can be equally regarded. Where one is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the other muſt be proportionably undervalued and neglected. "If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die: but, if ye through the ſpirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live." The purſuit of ſenſual indulgence as the principal care and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of life, argues, that a ſenſe of the authority of God, and a regard to his favor, as the higheſt good of a reaſonable and immortal being, are over-ruled by the intereſts and demands of the body; and that the ſoul, as to its higheſt and moſt important exerciſes and enjoyments, is in a ſtate of death. The apoſtle has therefore expreſsly declared, that "to be carnally minded is death." And we accordingly find, that, where the love of pleaſure, in whatever it be placed, is the reigning principle of men: if they do not run into the groſſeſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities; they at leaſt diſcover a diſlike to the moſt important duties of morality and religion, which evidently proves them to be "dead in ſin."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:046207_0060_1020F920ACF76210"/>The pernicious and deſtructive effects of exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive pleaſure are ſtill farther manifeſt, by this, that it often prompts men, for the relief of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and for purſuing their favorite object, with as little reſtraint and remorſe as poſſible, to reaſon themſelves out of the belief of a providence in this world, and a ſtate of retribution in the next.</p>
            <p>And therefore it uſually happens, that your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed advocates for ſenſual pleaſures, are either profeſſed infidels; or approach as near to it, as a regard to decency and their characters will allow them.</p>
            <p>It muſt ſtill be granted, that an exceſſive love of pleaſure may be compatible with juſt ſentiments of religion. But, this conceſſion is ſo far from weakening my argument, that it abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it. For, how ruinous muſt be that paſſion, which is ſtrong enough to out face the ſolemn teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of reaſon and conſcience, reclaiming againſt it! Let men think ever ſo juſtly, on the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and advantages of religion; while they are enſlaved to this, or any other paſſion, the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their knowledge ſerves only to illuſtrate the power of the principal that rules them.</p>
            <p>They are in the ſame caſe with thoſe of whom the apoſtle ſpeaks, "who knowing the judgment of God, that they who do ſuch things are worthy of death; not only do the ſame, but have pleaſure in them that do them."</p>
            <p>Finally, it follows from the premiſes, that a life of ſenſuality and pleaſure, whether it be purſued in a coarſer or more refined way, is utterly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with thoſe pure and ſpiritual affections which are eſſential to piety and devotion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:046207_0061_1020F8F725026938"/>While the heart is engroſſed by thoſe objects which are adapted only to the body, or ſerve to gratify the vanity of the mind; it is impoſſible it ſhould take pleaſure in the contemplation of the holineſs of God, or thoſe truths of revelation which are deſigned to mortify our love of this "pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" or in thoſe ſolemn and humbling approaches to the moſt Holy One, which ſerve to prepare the ſoul for the exerciſes and enjoyments of his immediate preſence. Acts of devotion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with ſuch a ſtate of the affections, are ſo far from being a matter of choice and delight; that they are ever attended with reluctance, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt and pain. From this it evidently follows, that habits of intemperate ſenſuality, and of vain amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are as inconſiſtent with the character of a true chriſtian as it is impoſſible, at once, to "mind the things of the fleſh," and "the things of the ſpirit" to be "enmity againſt God," and "ſubject to the law of God" or that the ſoul ſhould be ſpiritually alive, and dead, at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>It was one great deſign of Chriſt, in "giving himſelf for us, that he might reedeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himſelf, a peculiar people zealous or good works."</p>
            <p>And it is an eſſential part in the character of every true chriſtian, that he is "waſhed ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus and by the ſpirit of our God"—which can never be ſaid of thoſe who are "deceived, ſerving divers luſts and vanities," without contradicting the whoſe tenor of the goſpel. "So then, they that are in the fleſh, under the tyranny of corrupt and ſenſual affections, cannot pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>In addreſſing you on this ſubject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the ſtrong prejudices I have to oppoſe, of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:046207_0062_1020F9223A8264C0"/>
the warmth, and impetuoſity of youthful inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the difficulty of convincing you, that what you have already judged to be your higheſt good, is, of all things, moſt dangerous to your happineſs Should you doubt the truth of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions I have made, I appeal for proof of them, to facts, many of which moſt of you muſt have had opportunity of obſerving. Look almoſt where you will, in city or country, in the higheſt, in the middle, and in the loweſt ranks of life, you may ſee the lamentable ruins of exceſſive pleaſure. You may ſee ruined conſtitutions, ruined characters and ruined eſtates and families. You may ſee idleneſs, debauchery, and neglect, if not avowed contempt of ſeriouſneſs and the means of ſalvation, and you may ſee untimely deaths, and deſpairing death beds, all in the diſmal catalogue of its evils. Theſe are all obvious to the eye. And could you look into the breaſts of intemperate ſenſualiſts, you would ſee raging and inſatiate deſires, ſharp and torturing remorſe, hatred of God, of Chriſt, and of the goſpel; and as the conſequence of theſe, often times, inſupportable dread, and foreboding of the "wrath to come."</p>
            <p>If the fruits of a life of pleaſure were only thoſe that have now been mentioned, how unworthy is it of the name, and how much to be dreaded! But theſe are not all. "The end of theſe things is death." All the miſeries that can attend it, in this life, though often ſo great, as to render men quite inſupportable to themſelves, and impatient to terminate their wretched exiſtence, will bear no compariſon with thoſe which are to follow, when the fugitive delights for which they ſacrificed the ſolid pleaſures of reaſon and religion, will be forever out of their reach; and every capacity

of the ſoul filled with exquiſite and everlaſting anguiſh.</p>
            <p>Tell me, then, I beſeech you, what there is in the moſt exquiſite pleaſures of ſenſe, of amuſement and gaiety, that is worthy to be purchaſed at the expence of your ſouls?</p>
            <p>Were they even to be perfect, for the longeſt duration you can hope for, upon earth, or were they with the imperfections, viciſſitudes, and pains that attend them, to continue for ages; in either caſe, they could never be a compenſation for only the hazard of being miſerable at laſt. But, ſince they certainly lead to final and irretrievable ruin, it is nothing leſs than madneſs to purſue them.</p>
            <p>I will diſmiſs the ſubject after giving you the following directions.</p>
            <p>Endeavor to inform yourſelves of the true boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, and uſe of thoſe enjoyments which depend on the ſenſes. They are intended for important purpoſes, which they can anſwer, only when uſed in ſubordination to thoſe which ariſe from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, virtue and piety. And their ſubſerviency to theſe is the rule by which they are to be judged of, as innocent and allowable.</p>
            <p>And by the ſame rule, you are to judge of the lawfulneſs or expediency of any amuſements to which you may be inclined. The deſign of theſe ſhould always be to relieve the mind from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of our cares, with a view to purſue them again with alacrity and vigour. In any other view, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> waſte of time, and diſſipation of thought, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſame degree as they divert the mind from the proſecution of our ſerious and indiſpenſible duties.</p>
            <p>Young men in health can ſeldom need amuſements; eſpecially where their employments are neither
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:046207_0064_1020F9246A244CB0"/>
confining, nor require ſevere application of the mind. The buſineſs of planters in this part of the country, where few take any ſhare in the labor, is little more than an agreeable amuſment. To fill up the intervals of leiſure from theſe cares, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you the reading of uſeful books. This will, at the ſame time, improve you in knowledge and taſte; and fit you for acting a more reſpectable and uſeful part in the community. Should it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer no other end, it may at leaſt, ſave you from the temptation of adopting expedients to paſs off your leiſure hours, that may end in the ruin of your morals, and the peace of your minds.</p>
            <p>Avoid all habits of indulgence that are not directly favorable to all the purpoſes of your being.</p>
            <p>Whatever in the leaſt degree interferes with thefe, is not only unlawful, but pernicious. Should you fall into habits of ſenſuality, in the time of your youth, you will probably continue in them, 'till the time of age, or what is much more probable, they will cut you off "in the midſt of your days."</p>
            <p>Let me particularly caution you againſt indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the entertainments of the table; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the early uſe of ſpirituous drink.<note n="*" place="bottom">I recommend to your peruſal Dr. Ramſay's diſſertation on the health of the inhabitants of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſton, and the adjacent low country.</note> Youth in general has not the leaſt occaſion of ſuch a ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, and ſhould therefore, entirely decline it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the time of ſickneſs, and indiſpoſition, till the natural decays of the conſtitution.</p>

moderation. The effects of exceſs in this article are ſo formidable, that it ſhould be guarded againſt, with the utmoſt reſolution. It ſo inflames the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and paſſions, and ſo impairs the reaſon, that it prepares the way to "confuſion and every evil work." Health, buſineſs, eſtate, reputation and the ſoul, are all deſtoyed before it.</p>
            <p>Multitudes, of promiſing talents, who might have been happy themſelves, and bleſſings to ſociety, have fallen and are daily falling, untimely victims to this general deſtroyer of mankind.</p>
            <p>Be conſtantly then on your guard againſt this greateſt enemy to the body and the ſoul. Shun all amuſements, and aſſociations that would tempt you into this way of ruin. Obſerve with attention the evils that attend thoſe who are given to this exceſs; and though you ſhould be influenced by no higher conſiderations, theſe alone can hardly fail of keeping you at the greateſt diſtance from it.</p>
            <p>Finally, cultivate a love for thoſe pleaſures which ariſe from the offices of benevolence to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the practice of piety towards God. In the latter eſpecially, you will find the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed enjoyment, and ſuch as will never cloy or diſappoint you—The more you enjoy of theſe, the more you will diſregard the pleaſures of ſenſe; which muſt ever grow weaker, the more frequently they are repeated. The contemplation of the perfections, works and word of God, and the other exerciſes of devotion by which the heart is improved in preparation for another and nobler ſtate of being, will give you that peace of mind, and thoſe chearful hopes of future and eternal feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that are worth being purchaſed, for one hour, by the higheſt enjoyments of ſenſe, for a whole age.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:046207_0066_1020F92871CEE290"/>Nor need you deſpiſe any even of the inferior enjoyments of your nature, which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you, and allowed you to uſe.</p>
            <p>But, it is only within the bounds which he hath preſcribed, that they can be lawful, reaſonable, or ſafe. With the words of Solomon on a particular caſe of intemperate pleaſure, I conclude the ſubject, to which they may be univerſally applied.</p>
            <p>"Let not thine heart decline to her ways; go not aſtray in her paths. For ſhe hath caſt down many wounded; yea, many ſtrong men have been ſlain by her. Her houſe is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death."</p>
            <p n="1">I am now come, much later than was at firſt intended, to conſider—</p>
            <p n="2">II. The great rule by which your hearts and lives are to be governed. And becauſe I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, perhaps, exceeded the meaſure of your patience will compriſe what is neceſſary at preſent, to be ſaid on the ſubject, in as narrow a compaſs, as its importance to your happineſs will admit of. This rule is the word of God, of which in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of its excellence, the apoſtle ſaith— "All the ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God; and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed unto all good works;" and it certainly anſwers in all reſpects, to this incomparable character. It gives as full an account of the characters of God, and his diſpenſations to mankind, as is neceſſary for us to know, at preſent.</p>
            <p>It alſo contains a plain and full account of our duties, and the principles on which they are to be performed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:046207_0067_1020F8FE350D7F48"/>As the firſt and higheſt of theſe, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the reſt, it enjoins the belief of one God, that "he is to be worſhipped in ſpirit and in truth," that we are to love him with all the heart, that is unfeignedly and ſupremely, to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence his name; to obey all his commands; to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit with humility, to all his diſpenſations; to truſt in his mercy, power and faithfulneſs; to pray to him, for what we need; to praiſe him, for all we receive; to confeſs to him our ſins; to ſeek his favor, as our ſafety and happineſs, here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; and to refer all we enjoy, ſuffer and do, to his will, as the ſtandard, and to his glory, as the end of them all.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to mankind it directs us "to love our neighbour, as ourſelves;" and whatſoever we would "that others ſhould do to us, to do even the ſame to them." To entertain a ſincere affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good will to all mankind; and to act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, in all caſes, as we would think right for them to act towards us, were we in their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and they in ours—A rule intelligible to all capacities, and adapted to all the relations of mankind to one another It includes all thoſe acts of good will, mercy and juſtice, patience and condeſcenſion, which we ſtand in need of, from one another; and which form, as ſo many links, the great chain which binds men together, in a ſtate of ſociety.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to our own happineſs, it directs us to a ſober and temperate uſe of our appetites and paſſions, in the enjoyment of preſent good, to be contented with our lot, without murmuring or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing anxiety, in the moſt unpleaſant and trying circumſtances, and to ſet our principal affections "on the things that are above," and make it out
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:046207_0068_1020ECA698922558"/>
main care and concern to ſecure theſe, as our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at laſt. All theſe directions are delivered in various places, in plain, conciſe, and authoritative language. And in order to engage us to the ſteady practice of our duties, it alſo propoſeth the moſt important and affecting motives. The amount of theſe is, the promiſe of the ſpecial favor, protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and counſel of God, through the whole of life, ſupport in afflictions, and the ſanctified uſe of them, for the advancement of our ſpiritual good and comfort, and our preparation for another world, together with as much of the periſhable goods of this life, as God ſhall ſee beſt for us; and a certain and everlaſting happineſs in the next. With reſpect to the encouragements to obedience, you will obſerve a material difference between thoſe of the Old Teſtament and the New. In the former, they were immediately the advantages of the preſent life, though they no doubt, ultimately pointed to the next. In the latter, there are no ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of worldly proſperity, but of what is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more valuable, ſpiritual and everlaſting bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. Indeed, the ſpirit of the two diſpenſations is ſo different, that in the ſame degree, as we hope for the ſpecial bleſſings of the goſpel, we muſt be indifferent to the mere advantages of the preſent world. The ſame obſervation may be made, with reſpect to the threatenings againſt the diſobedient. In the former, they are preſent judgments, and calamities; in the latter, they point to the "ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment" of the final retribution. Theſe obſervations are made with a view to guard you againſt the miſtake of applying to yourſelves the promiſes that were made to the Jewiſh nation, and which ceaſed on the coming of Chriſt, and the diſcovery of "a better inheritance," than was made known to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:046207_0069_1020F9015923DE08"/>The ſpecial encouragements to faith in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the profeſſion of this faith, and obedience to his commands, "through good report, and through evil report," are the promiſes of the pardon of ſin, the ſanctification of our natures, and an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable union with him, as the means of obtaining all neceſſary ſpiritual benefits, and the ſure pledge of our being admitted at laſt, to "be with him, where he is, to behold his glory."</p>
            <p>The ſcriptures alſo point out to us the true way of ſalvation. They inform us, that "Chriſt died, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God."</p>
            <p>And that the benefits of his atonement are to be obtained only by faith in his merits, obedience to his laws, and the imitation of his example, in holineſs of heart and life.</p>
            <p>The goſpel is founded entirely on theſe principles, which are plainly and forcibly laid down in the ſcriptures—That in conſequence of ſin, all men are liable to the pains of eternal death, that no repentance on the part of the ſinner, is meritorious for his reprieve from the ſentence paſſed againſt him, and that he has no power of himſelf, either to change the natural ſtate of his heart; or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any ſervice acceptable to God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the atonement of Chriſt was neceſſary, both for his pardon and ſanctification, as the only way of his deliverance.</p>
            <p>The importance of ſuch a revelation to mankind will appear in the ſtrongeſt light, by the following undeniable propoſitions—1. That the wiſeſt and beſt of men who ever appeared in the world, with only the advantages of natural reaſon, were never able to diſcover, with certainty, the ſtate of men after death, or even that they would exiſt at all,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:046207_0070_1020F92CD3D57BF0"/>
nor the way of worſhipping God, ſuitably to his true character; nor even juſt and rational ideas of his perfections and providence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That no man previous to his embracing the goſpel, either exerciſeth true repentance for his ſins, or expects the favor of God, as a mere act of mercy, or deſires ſuch an happineſs in another life, as proceeds only from ſpiritual and holy affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in this. So true is it, that "the natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſcerned:" and that only through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of the goſpel revelation.</p>
            <p>If any thing therefore, can ſet forth the ſupreme excellence of the ſcriptures, and effectually recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to the eſteem and veneration of mankind, it is, that they contain every thing neceſſary to be known, and practiſed, in order to our preſent and future happineſs, and that they are the ſole ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard by which our religious opinions, our temper, our conduct and hopes, are to be judged of as good or bad.</p>
            <p>To this view of them, I might add, that they contain a faithful and moſt intereſting hiſtory of the moſt important events that have ever happened. The creation of the world, the fall, the deluge, the re-peopling the world; after that memorable calamity, the diviſion of the firſt language, the calling of Abraham, with whom the covenant of grace was firſt formally made, the deliverance of the Iſraelites from Egypt, the giving the moral law, written by the finger of God on two tables of ſtone, the eſtabliſhment of the church and polity of the Jews, by the expreſs appointment of God himſelf, and his conduct towards that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by extraordinary interpoſitions, till within
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:046207_0071_1020F9055D55EB10"/>
about four hundred years before the Meſſias, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the records of the characters of the moſt remarkable perſons, in the courſe of this hiſtory, patriarchs, judges, kings, prophets, and the various prophecies, of the perſon, character, and kingdom of Chriſt, theſe are all to be found in the Old Teſtament. After that follows an account of the birth of the ſon of God, with the moſt minute detail of time, place and other circumſtances to atteſt its truth, then his doctrines, miracles and ſufferings, during the time of his public miniſtry, then his death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion; after that the public miracle of the gift of the holy ſpirit to his diſciples, on the day of Pentecoſt, then the preaching, journies, ſufferings and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the apoſtles, till the finiſhing of the ſacred canon, in the revelation made to the apoſtle John. All this vaſt hiſtory including nearly the time of four thouſand one hundred years is related in the moſt ſimple and affecting language; and its authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity undiſputed by all men of true learning, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and piety. And I will venture to ſay, that for every thing great and intereſting in narrative, as well as for ſublimity of ſentiment, and purity and excellence of morality, it is infinitely ſuperior to every thing produced by the mere wit of man.</p>
            <p>And were it to be read, only with a view to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, there is certainly no other book that can equally ſurprize and delight the mind, or move and affect the heart.</p>
            <p>But, I hope, the ſhort view I have given of its contents and importance, will induce you to peruſe and ſtudy it, from an higher motive, namely, to be inſtructed in your duty, in order to be happy in the favor and likeneſs of God, its adorable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:046207_0072_1020F92E6050A0F8"/>Make it a part of your daily buſineſs to read this divine book, with attention, and ſeriouſneſs, ſuitable to its own dignity, and your intereſt in it.</p>
            <p>In the hiſtorical part, pay the moſt attention to thoſe facts which moſt illuſtrate the providence of God, in the puniſhment of diſobedience and vice, and the rewards of virtue and piety, which moſt clearly evince his truth and faithfulneſs, in the fulfilment of his promiſes and threatenings, and to thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which ſeem moſt clearly to refer to the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer of the world, and have a direct part in the accompliſhment of the promiſes and prophecies that concerned him.</p>

               </gap> of theſe indeed are attended with ſome obſcurity, but this will generally be cleared up, by one part or another of his doctrines, or life. The Old Teſtament is an introduction or prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the new, while this is a full vindication, and illuſtration of that.</p>
            <p>The book of Pſalms is an excellent collection of devotional exerciſes, adapted to almoſt every ſtate of the heart, and every circumſtance of the life. In reading of theſe, it will be neceſſary for you to conſider the different ſpirit of the diſpenſation, under which the authors of them wrote, from that of the mild and forgiving temper of the goſpel. Of praiſe, adoration, confeſſion and penitential ſorrow, of truſt and confidence in God, you will find in them the moſt excellent examples, which cannot fail to affect and aſſiſt you, in all your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious exerciſes.</p>
            <p>In the book of Proverbs, you will find moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent maxims of wiſdom and prudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the conduct of life, in almoſt all the relations you can ſuſtain. To treaſure up theſe in your memory, to
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:046207_0073_1020F906ED1A0D10"/>
have them always in readineſs for uſe, according to your circumſtances, will be of great importance.</p>
            <p>But, it is particularly in the New Teſtament, that I would have you to be moſt intimately verſed. The doctrines of Chriſt are "the words of eternal life," his conduct a perfect example of benevolence and piety, and his ſufferings and promiſes, the foundation and ſupport of your hopes. What he taught is largely enforced and explained by the apoſtles, in their different letters to the churches, and diſcourſes on particular occaſions—And all his excellencies that are intended for the imitation of his followers, his love, diligence, patience, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and piety, are beautifully exemplified in their lives.</p>
            <p>Of the doctrines of the ſcriptures, be moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to inform yourſelves in thoſe which lie at the foundation of the goſpel, and are neceſſary for the faith and practice of all chriſtians. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to theſe, allow me to give you one caution, and that is, never think of rejecting any of them, becauſe you cannot entirely comprehend it, or ſolve all the difficulties that may ſeem to ariſe from it. Thoſe very things which the pride and perverſeneſs of our reaſon have laid hold of, as objections againſt the whole of the revelation, are the higheſt and moſt infallible proofs of its authenticity. It is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally one character of the works of God that they cannot be fully comprehended by the human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. If every thing were perfectly intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ſcripture, it would ſeem to want one eſſential mark of its divine original. You will find every thing neceſſary for you to know, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently clear and intelligible. And while you have enough both for your duty and happineſs, you ought chearfully to ſubmit your faith to the reſt,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:046207_0074_1020F93335ABA790"/>
and think it ſufficiently happy for you, to have a good hope, that if it ſhould be neceſſary, in ſome future period of your being, God will reveal to you even theſe things.</p>
            <p>"All things are poſſible to him that believeth." With ſuch a faith in Chriſt as will purify your hearts, and overcome the world, you will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount all the weakneſſes, errors, and corruptions, that now attend you; and by following the ſacred light which he hath ſhed upon the world by his word and ſpirit, you will be daily growing wiſer and better, till you ſhall "ſee him as he is, and know even as you are known."</p>
            <p>To have ſuch a bleſſedneſs in expectation, on the true grounds of the goſpel, is an "hope that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not aſhamed." The world will ever diſappoint and ſhame you—Riches and power will diſappoint you, honors and pleaſures will diſappoint you; wherever you look, you will ſee nothing but diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and ſorrow, "vanity and vexation of ſpirit." But, with the oracles of eternal wiſdom in your hands, and the divine ſpirit in your hearts; with your deſires and hopes fixed on Heaven, and your labors and cares ultimately directed thither, you will find every thing turn to your good; and you will be fixed on a rock that will ſtand unmoved, when "the faſhion of the world ſhall have alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether paſſed away, and all theſe things ſhall have been diſſolved." I have now finiſhed my deſign, and for the preſent, take my leave of you; not without a hope, that I ſhall ſhare with ſome of you, in that bleſſedneſs, to the poſſeſſion of which it was the view of this addreſs to lead you.</p>

               <hi>APPENDIX.</hi> An extract from a Sermon preached at Wappetaw, 1ſt day of January <hi>1790.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>"THERE is nothing in which we are more deceived, than the eſtimate we uſually make of the few years of our duration upon earth, and the miſtake ſeems to ariſe from the manner of our viewing it.</p>
            <p>From the preſent time we commonly look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to any definite period, taking the intermediate ſpace in the groſs, without regarding the diviſions which compoſe it, and the haſtineſs with which the ſmaller run into the greater, till the whole is ſpent.</p>
            <p>By this ſuperficial way of reckoning a few years, or months, or even a ſingle one of them, appears to us in proſpect, much longer than it is; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of much more buſineſs and enjoyment, than we ever find realized. And eſpecially, by this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, the uſual boundary of life appears to youth, at a very diſtant remove; and that, ſuppoſing they ſhould reach it, which almoſt every one expects, they will have had ſufficient time for accompliſhing all the ſchemes they have projected.</p>
            <p>But how different is the view, when we take our time, as it were to pieces, allowing to the ſeveral ways of paſſing it, their reſpective portions, and reckoning only upon that which can be employed in the main buſineſs that engages our attention!</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe that eight hours in the twenty-four are paſſed in bed, which is probably the caſe with a great part of mankind, that two are ſpent at the table; which is perhaps one leſs, than is taken by thoſe who are in affluent, or eaſy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and that only two more are ſpent in relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and occaſional pauſes from our main pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:046207_0076_1020F936EB98B0B8"/>By this computation, one half of life whether longer or ſhorter, is taken up with the neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments of the body, and reliefs of the mind.</p>
            <p>Let us allow farther, the firſt ſeven years of our time, before we begin to think of any ſerious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and nine more for making preparation for the part we are to act. We will then ſay, that at ſixteen we ſet out in the courſe of action that is to employ the remainder of our life, and that half of this is unavoidably loſt from it. Out of a life of ſixty years, it leaves but twenty-two; of one of fifty, but ſeventeen; and of one of forty, but twelve years, for ſerious employment—If to this we ſhould add the time that is loſt by infirmity, ſickneſs, and other interruptions; how ſmall a portion of life is employed in uſeful purſuits, and how little is it to be wondered at, that ſo few of mankind attain to eminence, either in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the mind, or the uſual works of human induſtry!</p>
            <p>This ſerves to ſhow us the importance of care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improving that ſmall pittance of our time which the weakneſs of our nature allows for uſeful application.</p>
            <p>Could the whole of our life be employed to the higheſt purpoſes of our being, without any of the interruptions we now ſuffer, or were its duration many times longer than it is, or the buſineſs of it of no more conſequence than to eat, ſleep, amuſe our minds, and conſult our eaſe and gratification, we might in either caſe, be ſomewhat excuſeable for that indolent and trifling way in which ſo much of it is waſted.</p>
            <p>But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſidering how much there is to be done, how ſhort a ſpace is allowed for doing it, and that our immortal duration muſt be happy or miſerable,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:046207_0077_1020F90B5A505FB8"/>
according as this ſpace is filled up with uſeful, or trifled away in uprofitable purſuits—to ſay nothing more it is inexcuſable folly to ſpend it in ſupineneſs or diſſipation.</p>
            <p>If the moſt ſerious and diligent ſee reaſon, at the cloſe of life, to regret the loſs of much unimproved time, how ſad a review muſt they have, whoſe years are exhauſted, before they have found out their value; or have done, or thought of doing any thing above the purpoſes of a merely animal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence!</p>
            <p>The preceding eſtimate of life ſuggeſts alſo to youth, the great importance of entering as early as may be, on a courſe of uſeful employment; and of improving their time with that ſcrupulous economy, that its ſhortneſs, and its reference to eternity, juſtly call for.</p>
            <p>They may have many years before them, they may have but very few—And, as the latter is, for many reaſons, the moſt probable, it ought always to be ſuppoſed. Juſt as long as our life appears to be in proſpect, it will appear to have been ſhort, in review, and as unimportant as it appears in the former caſe, it will appear valuable, in the latter; when ſuch a view of it can only ſerve to ſhew the folly, and exaſperate the miſery of having neglected it. They who live well, be it ever ſo ſhort, will have lived long enough; and they who live illy, be it ever ſo long, will die too ſoon."</p>
