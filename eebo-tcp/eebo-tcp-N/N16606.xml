            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the courſe of divine providence, I am, this day, called, my dear friends, to bid you <hi>farewell</hi>— You are, this day, to hear my parting addreſs. To bid you farewell (if it is any thing more than mere compliment; if there is any ſignificancy in the phraſe) implies a ſincere wiſh that you may be truly happy; happy in time, and happy through eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:021351_0003_0FB31A71EB4214D8"/>But you never can be happy; you cannot fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in the preſent world, much leſs can you farewell in the world to come without the knowledge and practice or thoſe things, which he, upon whom all your temporal and eternal welfare entirely depends, has commanded you to know and obſerve. If you are diligent in obtaining the knowledge, and faithful in purſuing the practice of thoſe important truths, which the God of nature and the God of grace has revealed in his works and in his word, then I can not only bid you farewell (i. e. ſincerely <hi>wiſh</hi> your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare) but alſo aſſure you that you <hi>actually</hi> will forev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er farewell. That you will farewell while travelling through this vale of tears. That you will farewell when paſſing through the valley of the ſhadow of death. That you will farewell in your intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſtate: That you will farewell in the morning of the reſurrection. That you will farewell in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn proceſs of the laſt great deciſive day: That you will farewell through the revolution of numberleſs millions of ages: That you will farewell amidſt all the new, ſurprizing, and infinitely various ſcenes that even a whole eternity can produce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> Theſe words were ſpoken by the benevolent Jeſus, juſt before his crucifixion, to his diſciples. See the context, <hi>ver.</hi> 1—12.</p>
            <p>IN the proſecution of the preſent ſubject we ſhall, through divine aſſiſtance, attempt to exhibit a brief view of the <hi>doctrines</hi> you muſt know, and the <hi>duties</hi> you muſt do, in order that you may be happy; that you may farewell.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not pretend in this diſcourſe, to give a complete methodical ſyſtem of all the doctrines and duties of religion: but ſhall only mention ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, eſſential things, which if you know, happy are you if you do them. It is propoſed,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To exhibit a brief view of the doctrines which you muſt know.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5"

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>That peculiar kind of exiſtence which we call KNOWLEDGE, and which is no where to be found but only in the mind of a thinking, intelligent being, always has truth for its object.</p>
            <p>So happily are things conſtituted by the great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of nature; the ſupreme ſource of all intelligence —That it is impoſſible that any thing which is not <hi>really true,</hi> ſhould be <hi>certainly known</hi> to be true: admitting this principle, then it neceſſarily follows, That whatever is <hi>certainly known</hi> to be true, is <hi>really true.</hi> Hence it is evident, That if five, ten, twenty, an hundred or a thouſand perſons (be the number greater or leſs) know any thing to be true, then they will, in this reſpect, not only all agree with <hi>each other,</hi> but they will alſo all agree, or harmonize with the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>knowledge.</hi> This being the caſe, there is a foundation for complete happineſs in the intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al world. Let all the individuals of the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent ſyſtem, according to their reſpective capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>know</hi> the truth, and all <hi>embrace</hi> the truth they know, then there will not only be a harmony between the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and the <hi>heart</hi> in each individual, conſidered by himſelf, and a harmony among all the individuals conſidered with relation to each other, but alſo each individual <hi>ſeparately,</hi> and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals <hi>collectively,</hi> will harmonize with one <hi>common object</hi>; all their views and affections will have one <hi>common center.</hi> They will conſequently all be happy, —they will all farewell.</p>
            <p>If any number of perſons certainly know any thing to be true, then theſe perſons do, in this reſpect, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agree together in their ideas; and not only ſo, but alſo the ideas of each individual, perfectly agree with the object of knowledge. There is, therefore, in this caſe, a perfect harmony of ſentiment: a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony founded in immutable truth, and the eternal nature of things. Hence it is evident, that all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and difference of ſentiment originate in the <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> of one or both of the contending parties. For as has been already intimated, knowledge univerſally
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021351_0005_0FB31A7566D32DB0"/>
implies an agreement in ſentiment, difference in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore, univerſally proceeds from ignorance.</p>
            <p>Should any one be ſo bold as to aſſert,—"That there is no ſuch thing as truth:" or (ſuppoſing that there is truth) "that there is no ſuch thing as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:" I ſhould think myſelf authorized to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually bold to tell ſuch a perſon, in reply, that there was no <hi>truth</hi> in his aſſertion: or, at leaſt, that he was <hi>ignorant</hi> of what he ſaid. For any one to ſay "That it is <hi>true</hi> there is no ſuch thing as <hi>truth</hi>:" or, "That he <hi>knows</hi> there is no ſuch thing as <hi>knowledge,</hi>" is to ſay that which is ſelf-contradictory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore utterly unworthy of any regard. No one can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the exiſtence of truth, without appearing in the character of a complete <hi>liar.</hi> For he that adopts the principle, "That there is no ſuch thing as truth:" can claim no right to the character of a man of truth, ſincerity, or honeſty. He can claim no right to be regarded as being <hi>true</hi> in any of his <hi>words</hi> or <hi>actions.</hi> Neither can any one deny the exiſtence of knowledge, without appearing in the character of a perfect <hi>fool.</hi> For he that adopts the principle "that there is no ſuch thing as knowledge," never can, conſiſtently, pretend to be a man of any knowledge or good ſenſe. All, therefore, who would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the character of perfect <hi>knaves</hi> or <hi>fools</hi> muſt neceſſarily admit that there is in nature <hi>immutable truth</hi> and <hi>infallible knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truth is the foundation of knowledge, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the foundation of practice. In the knowledge and practice of truth; or in other words expreſſive of the ſame idea, in a complete harmony of ſentiments and actions, all having relation to one common ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, conſiſts the perfection of the whole intelligent ſyſtem, and of all the individuals of which the whole ſyſtem is compoſed. In the knowledge and practice of thoſe things, which the great author of your nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure has injoined, and in this way only, you may obtain happineſs: happineſs which has a foundation
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021351_0006_0FB31A776E416288"/>
as extenſive as univerſal truth, and laſting as your immortal ſouls.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now, as was propoſed, immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to exhibit a brief view of ſome important eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial doctrines, which, in order that you may be happy, you muſt know.</p>
            <p>Without entering on a long detail of particulars, we ſhall only juſt mention ſome things relative to the being and perfections of God; the nature of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law, the beauty of holineſs; the deformity of ſin; the neceſſity of regeneration; the death of the body; the immortality of the ſoul; the general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; the final judgment; the eternal ſtates of rewards and puniſhments.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not attempt, at preſent, to give a formal proof, nor enter on a curious and critical demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſhall only briefly remind you of theſe things, taking it for granted that you know them already: Or to uſe the language of the Apoſtle Peter, <hi>To put you in remembrance of theſe things though ye know them, and be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THAT THERE IS A GOD, "all nature cries aloud through all her works." <hi>The inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.</hi>

            <p>The exiſtence of the deity is ſo evident that it nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can with any pretence of reaſon be denied. It nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has, and never will be ſaid by any but <hi>fools,</hi> "that there is no God." There can be no <hi>effect</hi> without a <hi>cauſe.</hi> Nor can there be any <hi>particular,</hi> ſecondary cauſe, without a <hi>univerſal</hi> firſt cauſe. If, therefore,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021351_0007_0FB31A7858A5FF60"/>
there is no God, that is, no <hi>creator,</hi> then there are no <hi>creatures,</hi> and, conſequently, no beings to affirm or deny the exiſtence of a God. Therefore, if there are any beings to affirm or deny the exiſtence of a God, then a God exiſts. To ſay "there is no God," is the ſame as to ſay "there is no truth," and to ſay, "there is no truth" <hi>is a lie.</hi>

            <p>God is that awful and glorious Being, who immut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and eternally poſſeſſes, in the higheſt degree, all poſſible perfection. His proper name is JEHOVAH: which ſignifies an eternal ſelf-exiſtent being: or, as it is expreſſed in the Revelation of St. John, a being <hi>who was is, and is to come.</hi> God is a ſpirit, infinite, eternal, immutable, ſelf-exiſtent, ſelf-ſufficient, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, omniſcient: poſſeſſing unſearchable wiſdom, boundleſs goodneſs, immaculate holineſs, impartial juſtice, and infallible truth. There are three perſons in the divine nature. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Theſe three perſons are ONE GOD. All the ſacred Three are engaged in the redemption of fallen man. We are to conceive of this glorious redemption as being <hi>contrived</hi> by the Father, <hi>executed</hi> by the Son, and <hi>applied</hi> by the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>THE DIVINE LAW is, like its author, abſolutely perfect; being holy, juſt and good; requiring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete uninterrupted, perpetual obedience of every intelligent moral agent in the univerſe. It is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in the following words: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi>

            <p>Rational beings, by being made capable of <hi>moral action,</hi> become the proper ſubjects of the <hi>moral law,</hi> and are rendered accountable to the <hi>moral governor</hi> of the world.

HOLINESS. Holineſs is, in its own nature, moſt excellent, beautiful, and amiable, and diſplays, to every unprejudiced mind, the moſt captivating charms. It is the very image of the Deity.</p>
            <p>The other ſpecies of moral action, viz. that which is not conformable to the moral law, is called SIN. Sin is of a moſt deformed and hateful nature— it is a horrid monſter, pregnant with wo—it is the fruitful ſource of all the confuſion and miſery that ever has, or ever will take place in Jehovah's dominions.

            <p>Man is a moral agent. His firſt moral actions, in his primeval ſtate, were perfectly conformable to the unerring rule that was given him by his Maker. But he ſoon tranſgreſs'd the bounds that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, and thereby ſubjected himſelf to the curſe of his holy law. <hi>For it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</hi>

            <p>Let me remind you, that it is of infinite impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that you be really ſincere in your profeſſion— that your lips and <hi>hearts</hi> agree: For the heart ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God will receive none to his favour, but only thoſe who are actually and perſonally intereſted in the merits of his Son.</p>
            <p>Often have I endeavoured to warn you of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and point out the fatal conſequences of reſting in the outward form of godlineſs, without feeling its inward power. Let me intreat you to remember, as far as you are able, what has been ſaid upon this, and all other important and intereſting ſubjects, which I have, in times paſt, attempted to ſuggeſt to your minds—for now my paſtoral relation to you, my dear brethren, is diſſolved.</p>
            <p>After various concurring circumſtances had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a ſeparation unavoidable, I frequently antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated the affecting ſcene—but never felt, I muſt confeſs, before it actually took place, the full weight of the ſolemn tranſaction—a tranſaction, which, tho' it really is, at leaſt in my view, attended with many melancholy circumſtances, yet is what I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and do ſtill conceive, all things conſidered, to have been neceſſary.</p>
            <p>I now leave you, my dear brethren, in a ſituation, which is, in ſome reſpects, very diſagreeable. It affords me, however, an animating proſpect to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that I leave you under the indulgent care of an infinitely powerful, wiſe, and kind PROVIDENCE. May the God of all grace and conſolation comfort and ſupport you under every trial; relieve you in

every difficulty; direct and aſſiſt you in every duty. May he ſupply you with a Paſtor more worthy than myſelf, and better qualified for the important cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter—One in whom you may all be happily united. and under whoſe miniſtry you may be greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and edified; and long enjoy, in love and peace, the precious ordinances of the bleſſed goſpel.</p>
            <p>I am now, my dear brethren, ſeparated from you; but we ſhall certainly meet again on a future day— and where ſhall we meet—?</p>
            <p>Though by ſome, perhaps, I may be thought to tranſgreſs the bounds of modeſty, yet I will venture to make the declaration, That I humbly hope in divine mercy, through the merits of the Saviour, to find a happy ſeat on the right hand of my final Judge—and God grant that you may be my joy and crown of rejoicing in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming.<note n="(r)" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. ii.19.</note> May the ſupreme Diſpenſer of every bleſſing, by his efficacious influence and heavenly grace, prepare both you and me to meet together in that glorious world, where all tears will be wiped from every eye, and where holineſs and happineſs will reign in full perfection for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Permit me now, my dear friends, to make an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to you ALL who have been the people of MY CHARGE.</p>
            <p>Some of you, during the courſe of my miniſtry here, have been peculiarly kind; and I hope I may ever retain on my mind, the grateful impreſſion that has been made by your friendly regard. The real welfare of you <hi>all</hi> is the object of my ſincere deſire. If there are any of you whom I have injured, I now aſk your forgiveneſs—and thoſe, who have either <hi>done</hi> or <hi>meant</hi> an injury to me, I heartily forgive.</p>
            <p>From the time of my ſettlement in the town, you have known my manner of life.</p>
            <p>I have ever been as far from the <hi>inclination,</hi> as the

You are my witneſſes, that I have never wiſhed, at leaſt, that I have never deſired of you, any thing more than a comfortable ſubſiſtence; or ſuch means of ſupport as might enable me to apear and conduct with a decency and dignity becoming the <hi>character</hi> I ſuſtained—and this, you muſt be ſenſible, was not an unreaſonable demand.</p>
            <p>With regard to the <hi>complaint</hi> that ſome have made, of my being "too much <hi>reſerved</hi> in converſation," <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

I do not mean, however, to wholly juſtify myſelf in this reſpect. We are <hi>all</hi> liable to err—ſome on the right hand, and ſome on the left—ſome uſe their tongues too <hi>little,</hi> and ſome too <hi>much.—In many things we all offend.

            <p>My circumſtances have been, in various reſpects, peculiarly difficult.

            <p>As to my <hi>ſentiments</hi>; though I have not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to ſay that I have, in every inſtance, been abſolutely free from <hi>error</hi> (for I pretend not to infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility) yet this I can ſay, that through the whole courſe of my preaching, I always endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver ſuch doctrines, as I did then, and do now,

ſolemnly believe to be <hi>true:</hi> doctrines, which, being clearly viewed by the underſtanding, ſincerely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced in the heart, and conſequently practiſed in the life, imply the eternal ſalvation of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>I conſider myſelf as being accountable to God for the doctrines which I have embraced myſelf, and which I have delivered to you. And if I have deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to you the truth, then you are accountable, not only for what you actually <hi>have,</hi> but alſo, for what you <hi>might have</hi> heard.</p>
            <p>In the former part of this diſcourſe, I mentioned ſome important things, which it is neceſſary for you to KNOW, and which, if you do know, happy are you if you DO them. Happy are you if the <hi>exerciſes</hi> of your <hi>hearts</hi> correſpond to the dictates of a well regulated underſtanding. Would you be truly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in <hi>this</hi> world or the <hi>next</hi>—would you FARE WELL in <hi>time</hi> and through <hi>eternity</hi>—then</p>
            <p>Be ſincere friends to the God that made you— Learn to contemplate, with increaſing wonder and delight, his glorious perfections— Fear, love, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, adore and praiſe him —Make application to the Father, in the name of the Son, for the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Holy Spirit—Conſtantly attend to <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>family</hi> prayer—Attentively obſerve, and carefully improve, the various diſpenſations of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence —Study the divine law, and make it the only rule of all your conduct—With diligence and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, ſearch the ſacred ſcriptures—Follow after holineſs—Strive againſt ſin—Be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind—exerciſe repentance toward God, and faith toward the Lord Jeſus Chriſt—Ever feel your infinite obligations to God; your conſtant and entire dependence upon him; and the neceſſity of your having the ſpecial influences of his Holy Spirit— Be not anxious in providing for your <hi>bodies,</hi> which muſt ſhortly return to the duſt; but attend to the one thing needful— Take care of the infinitely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant concerns of your <hi>ſouls,</hi> which muſt exiſt for

ever. Perſevere in a courſe of holy obedience to the divine will—always depending entirely on the grace and mercy of God, through the merits of his Son, for the acceptance of your perſons and performances.</p>
            <p>In <hi>this way,</hi> and in this way <hi>only,</hi> you may be eternally happy. On condition that you do, <hi>in reality,</hi> purſue the courſe that is <hi>here</hi> recommended, and on <hi>this</hi> condition <hi>only,</hi> I  with the greateſt confidence aſſure you, that you <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Let me intreat you all, my dear friends, to attend to the things that belong to your eternal peace, even NOW, without any delay. It is infinitely dangerous to <hi>procraſtinate</hi> or put off to a future time.</p>
