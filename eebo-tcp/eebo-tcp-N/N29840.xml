            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE Reader.</head>
            <p>TO Pray to God is a Duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on every man in the World. An <hi>External</hi> as well as an Internal <hi>Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is due to him, on the account of his being our <hi>Creator.</hi> Psal. 95.6. <hi>O come let us worship &amp; bow down; Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true concerning Unregenerate men, that they sin in their Prayers. Nevertheless, Prayer is their Duty. They sin because they do not Pray from a right Principle, nor for a right End, nor after a right manner; yet the <hi>Act</hi> is not a sin but a duty. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> who was a very wicked man, was bid to <hi>pray God if perhaps the thought of his heart might be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And the Gracious God does sometimes so far regard the Prayers
<pb facs="unknown:039677_0003_10143A698816FBE0"/>
of Ungodly men, as to remove Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Afflictions and Judgments upon their Praying to him; as we ſee in <hi>Ahab, Rehoboam,</hi> and in the Men of <hi>Niniveh.</hi> Notwithſtanding which, there are many Prayerleſs Ones in the World. It were well if there were none ſuch in <hi>New-England.</hi> They will have their doom with the Workers of Iniquity at the Laſt Day. Pſal. 14.4. <hi>Have the Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity no knowledge, they call not on the Lord.</hi> A <hi>Prayerleſs</hi> man is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly</hi> man. Pſal. 32.6. <hi>Every one that is godly will pray.</hi> A man does no ſooner begin to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Christian, but it will be ſaid of him, <hi>Behold he prays,</hi> Acts 9.11. Yet it is reported there are many Prayerleſs Families. There was a time when there were few ſuch Families in <hi>New-England.</hi> Whether there are any ſuch in the Town where this Sermon was Preached, the Lord knows. If there are ſuch, this Word will be a Witneſs againſt them another day. And there is a Scripture which may ſtrike Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror into the heart of every Prayerleſs Maſter of a Family; It is that, Jer 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb facs="unknown:039677_0004_10143A6D6628E008"/>
that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not on thy Name.</hi> Such Families, altho' they may call themſelves Chriſtians, are no better than Heathen. Nay, they are leſs Religious. For the Heathen had their <hi>Penates,</hi> their Houſhold Gods.</p>
            <p>Prayer is always a duty, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a time of Affliction. Some that never Prayed before, when Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and danger has attended them, have betaken themſelves to their Prayers. Hence it has been a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial ſaying, <hi>Qui neſcit orare, diſcat Navigare.</hi> 'Tis noted of <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, that when they were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being Caſt away, they Cried every one to his God, and ſaid to <hi>Jonah, Call upon thy God, if ſo be God will think upon us, that we periſh not.</hi> It argues great ſtupidity and hardneſs of heart, when it can be ſaid of any, <hi>the People turn not to him that ſmiles them, neither do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Iſa. 9.13.</p>
            <p>To Excite and Direct Afflicted Ones in Prayer to God, is the Pious Deſign of the Author of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
<pb facs="unknown:039677_0005_10143A6F18832580"/>
His Modeſty made him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to grant a Copy of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for Publication; but the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the principal of his Hearers, has at laſt obtained it from him, who has alſo deſired my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal of it. I find a ſerious Spirit in it, &amp; a godly deſign to promote the Intereſt of Religion, and the good of Souls, and hope it will prove beneficial not only to thoſe that heard it, but to others likewiſe.</p>
            <p>It was a ſignal Favour of God to his People, that <hi>he raiſed up of their Sons for Prophets, and of their Young men for Nazarites.</hi> This has he done for his <hi>New-England</hi> People, whereof the Writer of this Sermon is an encouraging Inſtance.</p>
            <p>I am leaving the World, having been a very Unprofitable Servant therein, and an unworthy Preacher of the Goſpel, for the ſpace of Threeſcore Years. Moſt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſters in <hi>New England,</hi> have come into the World ſince that; Many of them, (and this Author in particular) were once under my
<pb facs="unknown:039677_0006_10143A70A3999DF0"/>
Inſpection and Praeſidentſhip. If the Words of one that is (ſo far as I can underſtand) the Oldeſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter now alive in <hi>New-England,</hi> may be of any regard, I would ſay to the Younger Miniſters, Be <hi>Stedfaſt</hi> in the Profeſſion and Practice of that <hi>Faith and Order of the Goſpel,</hi> which your now Glorified Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors have left as a Legacy to their Poſterity.</p>

            <p>AT the ſeventh verſe forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Apoſtle exhorts the Chriſtians to whom he wrote this Epiſtle, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them, all the Saints and People of God, in all Succeeding. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Generations, to be patient under the Sufferings it ſhould pleaſe their Sovereign Lord and Maſter, to exerciſe them with. <hi>Be patient Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>—As tho' the Apoſtle had ſaid, bear up with Chriſtian Courage and Fortitude, under all the ſore and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Trials; undergo the moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Calamity, with a firmneſs and
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:039677_0008_10143A779792CE28"/>
ſtayedneſs of mind, becoming the Character of Chriſt's Servants: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt any uneaſineſs under the Croſs, or impatience under any affliction which is unbecoming the Relation you ſtand in to the meek and lowly Jeſus; and the Profeſſion you have made of taking up the Croſs, and following him: <hi>Of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more at the things that are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen &amp; Eternal, then at viſible, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or ſenſible things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to quicken them thus to be patient until the Coming of their Lord, which he alſo in the ſame verſe adviſeth them of; he further tells them in the next verſe, <hi>That the time was drawing on apace, when their Lord and Head, who at preſent ſympathizes with them, will appear the ſecond time without Sin unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when he will deliver them out of all their Diſtreſſes, wipe all tears from their Eyes; take away the Body of Sin, as well as the burden of Sorrow; and make them Everlaſtingly Bleſſed and Happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, He endeavours further to fortifie their minds againſt all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, by the Example of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:039677_0009_10143A7940905920"/>
the holy Prophets, which have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Name of the Lord, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. who though they were very dear to God, were yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding maligned, traduced and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by men; and are Exemplary for their unfainting perſeverance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt grievous Sufferings from the tongues and hands of men.
<hi>Take the Prophets—for an Example of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering affliction and patience</hi>; they are ſet forth as Examples of both; <q>that if Chriſtians ſuffer the ſame things, they may ſuffer with the ſame minds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, He Encourages them by the Conſideration of the preſent, as well as future Happineſs, that doth accrue to Chriſtians by their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; eſpecially by their patience under them, <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Behold we count them happy which endure.</hi> Which Aſſertion, he Exemplifies in the Caſe of afflicted patient <hi>Job; Ye have heard of the patience of</hi> Job, <hi>and have ſeen the end of the Lord.</hi>
               <q>The good iſſue that God gave to all his troubles, in reſtoring him to his former State, and doubling his Proſperity.</q>
Which inſtance of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039677_0010_10143A7ACD1BDD90"/>
Goodneſs &amp; Mercy, (for it is God here aſcribed to his merciful Nature) ſhould Encourage his People to truſt in him, (<hi>being the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever</hi>) to expect and hope for a good end to all their troubles, whatever they be, and therefore to wait with patience for it.</p>
            <p>Now our Text comes in as a word of Advice, under the foregoing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, wherein the Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects Chriſtians under Afflictions, what method to take to obtain Grace whereby to Glorify God, and carry it becomingly under them; and that is by believing fervent Prayer, as you may see by comparing the Text and Context.—<hi>Is any among you afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? let him Pray.</hi> Where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſuppoſeth there might be thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that were afflicted: And this he might well, ſince the People of God eſpecially are liable to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this World. Is any among you Chriſtians, Profeſſors of the Name of Chriſt, the Servants of the true and living God, afflicted Perſonally, or Relatively, by inward or outward Trouble? This Queſtion implies a ſtrong affirmation, that as ſuch are
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039677_0011_10143A7D13183EA0"/>
liable to, ſo they may be under Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; they may be Exerciſed as well as others, with Sickneſs, Poverty, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; with the loſs of dear Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the like. Now in this Caſe, what method ſhall a Chriſtian take, what shall he do, when afflicted in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe, or any other Regard? The Apoſtle anſwers in the next words: <hi>Let him pray,</hi> as though the Apoſtle had ſaid, let him ſeek unto God, &amp; commit his Cauſe unto him, <hi>who doth great things, and unſearchable, marvellous things without number; who ſetteth up on high thoſe that be low, that thoſe which mourn may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to ſafety.</hi> Job 5.8, 9.11, 15. <hi>Let him Pray.</hi> It is expreſt in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Mood, and denotes duty; this is a Chriſtian's duty, and very ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at ſuch a time. When a Chriſtian is under the Smiles of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, then it is ſuitable for him to Rejoyce. <hi>Is any merry, let him ſing Pſalms?</hi> and thereby expreſs and give vent to his Spiritual and Religious Joy. But when he is under a dark Cloud, (like one of thoſe, which in Winter days intercepts the Beams of the Sun) that deprives him of all

preſent Comfort; it becomes him then the caſt himſelf down &amp; Worſhip God (as <hi>Job</hi> did.) Then he ſhould ſpeak out of the Ground, and his Speech should be low out of the duſt, as the Prophet ſpeaks. The Doctrine which the words afford, is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That Prayer is a Duty very ſuitable and neceſſary in a time of Affliction.</p>
            <p>This is a Duty ſuitable &amp; neceſſary at all times; for the Light of Nature teacheth it, as well as Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Enforceth it. The Fundamental Reaſons of which flow from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections and Excellencies, and that Relation we ſtand in to God, as our Creator, Preſerver &amp; Benefactor; which ſtrongly Infer an indiſpenſible Obligation lying upon us, to Worship Him. Hence the very <hi>Heathens,</hi> who had only the dim Light of Nature to Guide them, paid a Natural Homage unto him (tho' in a blind manner;) and ſince we have the ſuper-added Light of Revelation (which they had not) we can be no ways Excuſed in the neglect of a duty, which is ſo
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039677_0013_10143A8171C04460"/>
ſtrongly Enforced therein. But tho' this Duty be ſo ſuitable and neceſſary at all times, yet it is peculiarly ſo in a time of Affliction; then God calls us to it more eſpecially, and our own neceſſities put us upon it. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine may be Explained and Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under two Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>As Namely,</p>
            <p>Propoſition I. <hi>That Chriſtians are liable to, and do often meet with Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Propoſition II <hi>Prayer is a Duty ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuitable and neceſſary in a time of Affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Propoſition I. <hi>Chriſtians are liable to, and do often meet with Affliction in this World.</hi> This is the ſettled Portion and Inheritance of all men in this Life: <hi>Who are born unto trouble, as the Sparks flie upward.</hi> Tho' man's life in this World, be but of few days, yet it's full of trouble. And the beſt men in the World meet with ſo much as may juſtly cauſe them to cry out with the Wiſe man, <hi>Vanity of Vanities, all is vanity and vexation of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039677_0014_10143A851059FD48"/>
Spirit.</hi> The Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>That the afflictions of the Righteous are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> Pſal. 34.19. And we many inſtance in ſome of them. As namely,</p>
            <p>Firſt, in Poverty, which the Godly have no more ſecurity againſt, than any others: But they as often fall into low, mean, abject Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as any other men. Many that are rich in Faith, are however the poor of this World, <hi>James</hi> 2, 5. And this Condition has great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation accompanying it, as well as a full and plentiful Eſtate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Agur</hi> deprecates them both, leſt being full he ſhould deny God; or being poor, he ſhould be tempted to take indirect ways to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his; and ſo take the name of God in vain. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8, 9.</p>
            <p>Again, Bodily Sickneſs is another Worldly Trouble, which they are not freed from by Chriſt, but are as liable to as others: It being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all men once to die, and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being Death's Harbinger, or Forerunner. Yea, many times, they are Exerciſed with lingring, pining Sickneſs, with conſtant and ſtrong pain all their Lives, which take away
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039677_0015_10143A8921111680"/>
the Comfort of Life. It's the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many Godly Perſons to have this thorn in the fleſh. Thus it was with <hi>Gaius,</hi> who had a healthy Soul in a weakly Body. 3 <hi>Epiſt. Joh. v.</hi>2. And on this account, they may ſay, that they are in deaths oft.</p>
            <p>Further, God ſometimes ſuffers them to be afflicted with Reproaches and Diſgrace: Who have been more vilifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contemned, than the Servants of God? Whoſe Names have been more loaden with contumely or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, than theirs? and as this is a great trial, (<hi>Reproach hath broken my heart,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.20.) ſo it is a great aggravation of it, when they have given their Enemies too much cauſe to Reproach them, by their imprudent or ſinful Carriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Every man has a tender Regard to the honour of his Name. A Good One is rather to be choſen than Great Riches; yea, it is next to life, and when that is touch't, a man is touch't in a very tender part. And tho' a man's Innocency is a good ſupport to him, and the hope that ſome time or other, it will be clear'd up to the World; that this Good Name will be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039677_0016_10143A8B7342CD80"/>
taken out of the dirt, and be win'd clean; yet in the mean time, a man can't but be uneaſie under this ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trial.</p>
            <p>Once more, God ſometimes Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his Children (and that very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) with the loſs of dear Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or with their miſcarriages, which is near as bad; God ſometimes afflicts his People with the Death of dear Relations. And tho' there be thoſe Conſiderations to be fetch't from the Word and Covenant of God, which ſhould ſtill and quiet them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch trials; as that it's the Will of God it ſhould be ſo; and that as to godly Deceas'd Friends, it's better for them to be abſent from the Body, and to be preſent with Chriſt; their Death being an out-let to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of this World, and an in-let to the Joys of the next: Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when the parting time comes, it's a great trial to them, a ſore fight of affliction. The Natural Affections and Paſſions will have vent, they will take their turn as well as Grace. Patient <hi>Job</hi> could not help giving vent to his grief and ſorrow of heart, at the Death of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:039677_0017_10143A8CF745DF30"/>
he rent his Mantle, and ſhaved his Head; which actions were tokens of grief in uſe amongſt thoſe <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations.</p>
            <p>Next to this Trial by the Death of Relations, is that other; when thoſe that are dear to them, take up with a licentious courſe of Life, and give up themſelves to commit all Iniquity with greedineſs, eſpecially when they are irreclaimable; ſo that the Advice, Reproofs or Counſels of Friends, or any means that can be uſed with them will not do, to prevent their running head-long to deſtruction. This cuts them to the quick, and makes their very Souls bleed within them. This is in ſome ſort more grievous than to bury them; for hereby they are continued as living Croſſes, and they are mourned for every day.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The Godly ſometimes meet with inward as well as ouward Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. God ſometimes hides his face from them, and they are troubled, as it was with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.7. Sometimes they ſuffer his terrours, as <hi>Heman</hi> did; who ſays, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.15, 16. <hi>I am afflicted, and ready to die from my youth up; while I ſuffer thy
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:039677_0018_1014177029FCB010"/>
terrours, I am diſtracted.</hi> This the Godly are liable to, and do meet with more or leſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They have their ups and downs, in reſpect of Inward Spiritual Peace and Comfort; their Spring and Fall, Summer and Winter. This is their ſtate of probation, and therefore not their Reſt: God ſees it beſt ſometimes thus to Exerciſe them, to bring them to a more immediate Dependance upon himſelf, in whom all their ſprings are. And this they muſt not think ſtrange of, nor think it hard dealing, ſince it is agreeable to the tenour of the New-Covenant of Grace, and no ways inconſiſtent with the faithfulneſs of God, who tho' he will and does Correct them when there is need of it; Yea, ſometimes to ſhow his Sovereignty: <hi>Yet he will not ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail, nor alter the thing that is gone out of his mouth, Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32, 33.</p>
            <p>Prop. II. <hi>That Prayer is a Duty very ſuitable and neceſſary in a time of Affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we may ſhew two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Prayer is very ſuitable and neceſſary in time of Affliction. And,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:039677_0019_10143A9590DA21F8"/>2. How the Duty muſt be then managed; or how Afflicted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt Pray.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to ſhow, That Prayer is a very ſuitable and neceſſary Duty in Affliction. Afflicted Chriſtians ſhould then go to God by Prayer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe God is the Author of Affliction. <hi>I make Peace, I Create E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> (ſays God) <hi>Is there Evil in the City, and the Lord has not done it? Ames</hi> 3.6. Which is not to be meant of the Evil of Sin, for that's an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, which the perfectly infinitely Holy God can never be the Author of; But it's meant of the Evil of Puniſhment, or Affliction; for of this God is the Author. Affliction, (let the immediate Cauſes be what they will) is from the Hand of God. Some look upon afflictions as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Natural Cauſes, or as Caſualties, or as the Effects of the diſpleaſure or injuſtice of men: If they are Sick, they are ready to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to the Heat, or Cold; if a Loſs comes in their Eſtates, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it to the careleſsneſs or falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Servants, but they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlook the Hand of God. Now to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039677_0020_10143A97139058B8"/>
whom ſhould Chriſtians have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, for relief and help under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, but to the Author of their troubles; for he that ſends trouble, can remove it again. That hand that ſtrikes, can cauſe it ſelf to ceaſe from ſtriking. <hi>Remove thy ſtroke from me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am conſumed by the blow of thy hand. Pſal.</hi> 39.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe this is one end God aims at in afflicting his, that they may be thereby ſtirr'd up to this Duty; they ſhould therefore pray and ſeek his face at ſuch a time, in compliance with his deſign therein. Many times when his Children grow remiſs or negligent in this duty, he afflicts 'em for it; it may be they are viſited with Sickneſs, or with ſome loſs in their Estates; their Outward Affairs don't proſper tho' managed with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much prudence; or they may be deprived of deſirable Relations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the peculiar intent of God in thoſe afflictions and troubles, which light upon careleſs and ſlothful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, is to humble them, for their neglects, and to quicken them to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Agreeably, ſays God, <hi>I will go, &amp; return to my place,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>withdraw
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039677_0021_10143A98A085F168"/>
my gracious Preſence, or carry it in my Providence towards them, as though I had: till they</hi> (my People) <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their offence, and ſeek my face; in their affliction they will ſeek me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Hoſ. 5.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe their own benefit and intereſt obliges them to it. In this way only can they expect ſupport under, a ſanctify'd improvement of, and deliverance out of their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for God only can do this for them, and for this he will be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of to do it for them. God only is able to ſupport a Chriſtian under affliction: The leaſt Evil being too heavy for him to bear up chearfully under, unleſs the Everlaſting Arms be underneath him; Otherwiſe a Chriſtian will ſoon grow impatient and diſontented, or ſink under diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. How little a thing made <hi>Jonah</hi> angry, and wiſh to die, when his Spirit was out of frame. <hi>Jon.</hi> 4.9. But what will a Chriſtian do when he comes into the ſwellings of <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan?</hi> When he meets with great and ſore Trials, which he muſt expect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his hands be made ſtrong by the hands of the Mighty God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Surely God's Grace only is ſufficient
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039677_0022_10143A9B680792E8"/>
for him, and therefore he muſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to God for his help, that he may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlight his hand, nor faint under his rebukes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5.</p>
            <p>Again, God only can and will make the Affliction turn to our Benefit, thro' Prayer and the ſupply of the Spirit; whatever affliction a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an meets with, the Almighty deſigns it for good and advantage to him. The Fathers of our fleſh correct us many times for their pleaſure only; but whom the Lord corrects, he does it for our benefit, <hi>that we may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Holineſs,</hi> Heb. 12.10. He hath promiſed, <hi>that all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God, Rom.</hi> 8.28. and afflictions are ſome of thoſe things; they will not alone do us any good, 'tis not ſo much from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny natural property, or inherent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that they do us good, as from the ſanctifying Grace of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chriſtians are under God's afflicting hand, they ſhould pray for a ſanctified Improvement thereof.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, God only can deliver the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Chriſtian out of his troubles: This God aſſumes to himſelf, as his Prerogative. <hi>I kill and I make alive,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:039677_0023_10143A9E758A6BC0"/>
(says God) <hi>I wound and I heal; neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God the Lord, belong the iſſues from death.</hi> Pſal. 68 20. <hi>He knoweth how to deliver the Godly out of temptations.</hi> 2 Pet. 2 9. <hi>Many are the afflictions of the Righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all.</hi> Pſal. 34.19. But this he will be ſought unto for; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we may and ſhould pray for deliverance. As we may deprecate afflictions, ſo we may pray to have them removed. So the Pſalmiſt prays to God, to remove his ſtroke away from him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.10. The Apoſtle pray'd that the trouble he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which was a <hi>Thorn</hi> in the fleſh, might be removed. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. God expects that ſuch ſhould call upon him in the day of trouble, and has promiſed he will deliver them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe God has ſo expreſly required, that Chriſtians ſhould pray to him, as at other times, ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in time of Affliction. <hi>Is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among you afflicted? Let him Pray in their affliction, they will ſeek me early.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:039677_0024_10143A9FF8CC5C08"/>2. We come to ſhew how afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtians ſhould pray. And here I would ſay.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They muſt pray in the Name of Chriſt, relying on his Oblation and Interceſſion for a gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Prayer for all they ask a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to the Will of God; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for ſupport under, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from, and a ſanctified improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their afflictions; it is only in the Name of Chriſt, that God will be ſought unto. <hi>Whatever ye do in word or deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus; giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</hi> Col. 3.17. So we muſt pray to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by him; and our bleſſed Lord has told us, <hi>that whatſoever we ask the Father in his Name, believing, we ſhall receive.</hi> Joh. 16.33, 34. If we would pray in a time of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or indeed at any other time, ſo as to be heard and anſwered; we muſt pray with Faith in the Name of Chriſt. We can be heard in no other Name, nor in his Name ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we believe. <hi>If any man lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God,—but
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:039677_0025_10143AA360C6F5F0"/>
but let him ask in faith.</hi> Jam. 1.5, 6. The holy Spirit of God muſt help our Infirmities, and make Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us, with groanings that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be uttered, who know not what to pray for as we ought. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Afflicted Chriſtians muſt pray with Fervency. <hi>The fervent effectual Prayer of the Righteous man availeth much. v.</hi> 16. <hi>Context.</hi> But then this Fervency muſt be more, than a meer natural earneſtneſs of Expreſſion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vehemency of Spiritual Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; an earneſtneſs ſpringing from a ſenſe of a perſons need, and the worth of the Mercies he is praying for. One that is ſenſible of theſe, will be earneſt indeed; will wreſtle with God as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, and not give over till he hath obtained the Bleſſing. Cold and dead Prayers argue indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, and tempt God to deny; but fervent prayers argue perſons to be in good earneſt; they will turn to account. It's the Fervent Prayer that is Effectual.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Perſons at ſuch a time, muſt pray with Frequency and Conſtancy.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:039677_0026_10143AA5B479EA08"/>
Their troubles ſhould ſend them often to the Throne of Grace. Our Lord Jeſus return'd upon his Father, he pray'd thrice that the Cup might paſs. And the Apoſtle, that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that affliction he was under. And as they ſhould be frequent, ſo they ſhould be conſtant in Prayer; <hi>Praying always,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Pray without ceaſing.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.17. Where the Apoſtle don't intend, that Chriſtians ſhould ſpend their whole time in this Duty; there being other Duties of great Conſequence alſo to be attended: Some time muſt be ſpent in Reading, Hearing, Meditating; &amp; not only our General, but our Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Calling muſt be attended in their ſeaſon. One Duty muſt not juſtle with, or thruſt out another. The Apoſtle therefore intends only this, that Chriſtians ſhould perſevere in Prayer, be frequent and conſtant therein. In this ſenſe the Pſalmiſt is to be underſtood, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>4. <hi>I give my ſelf unto prayer.</hi> As tho' he Devoted himſelf wholly to it. But he means no more, than that he did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in this duty. He pray'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times in a day: Evening, Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:039677_0027_10143AA73AA732A0"/>
and Noon will I pray. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.17. As he was a man of many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, ſo he was a man of many Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Our Bleſſed Lord ſpake a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this end, <hi>that men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</hi> Luke 18.1. There is the ſame reaſon they ſhould perſevere in Prayer, as engage in it at firſt; and that is becauſe God is our Sovereign Lord; <hi>he is thy God, and worſhip thou him.</hi> This is the way to ſpeed; <hi>in due time ye ſhall reap, if ye do not faint.</hi> It is indeed a great trial to a Chriſtians faith and patience, to have the anſwer deferr'd; yea, to be treated by God, as though he did not hear or regard him in his affliction; this is a temptation to him to give over the duty: But this ſhould make a Chriſtian the more earneſt; and if thro' the help of Divine Grace, he holds out and perſeveres, and obtains, it will be infinite Mercy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Afflicted Chriſtians ſhould pray will all prayer. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Praying always, with all prayer,</hi> (i. e.) with all the kinds, and with all the parts of Prayer. They ſhould pray with Publick, Private, Secret, and Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:039677_0028_10143AAA61647A28"/>
Prayer; with others, &amp; alone. Prayer is more powerful, when many joyn and unite together in it. In ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Prayer, a perſon may be more free in opening his Caſe to God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.26. <hi>I have declared my ways, and thou heardeſt me.</hi> A perſon may by Ejaculatory Prayer, or prayer in the heart, dart up his deſires to God many times in a day; yea, in the midſt of his Worldly Buſineſs, or in Company. <hi>Hannah</hi> thus eaſed her mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. Again, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt Confeſs his Sins at ſuch a time, as well as Petition for Mercy; and this is the way to obtain it. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his ſins, ſhall not proſper; but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall find mercy.</hi> And as he ſhould confeſs his Sins, ſo give God thanks for his Mercies, which he remembers in Judgment. There is no Chriſtian ſo low and mean of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

He muſt alſo leave it to him, when and how to deliver him; wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for deliverance in God's time and way: Then it's likely to come in Mercy.

               <p>Uſe I. Of Information in two Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
               <p>Inference I. Hence we Learn, that it's Unſuitable; yea, ſinful to neglect Prayer in a time of Affliction; ſo it is indeed at any time: But to do it in Affliction, is an aggravation of the Crime. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> blames <hi>Job,</hi> because (as he ſuppoſed) he neglected this duty, when he was ſo ſorely afflicted. <hi>Chap</hi> 15.4. <hi>Yea, thou caſteſt off fear, and reſtraineſt prayer before God.</hi> To neglect Prayer, when God is Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting a Perſon or a People to ſtir up a Spirit of Devotion in them, and to quicken them in their Addreſſes to God; it's very criminal. It's a ſad thing, when afflictions find us in the neglect of this Duty, when we don't meet them, as our Lord did his, in a praying poſture; but it's more ſad and awful for them to leave us, as they found us; as negligent of our Duty, as regardleſs of God, and our Souls, as we were before; it's a ſign, that either the Chriſtian is not duly humbled; for if he were, he would be brought down to God's foot; it's a ſign that God's Rod has been ſpent in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:039677_0031_10143AB30C870800"/>
vain, as on his People of old; whoſe afflictions ſerv'd only to diſcover their pride and obſtinacy, whilſt they did not return to him, nor ſeek him after all. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.10. Or it's a ſign that the Chriſtian is over pow'rd with Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Diſcouragement, which is as great an Evil on the other hand, &amp; will as effectually take him off from his duty; therefore the Apoſtle cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt both. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>Deſpiſe not thou the Chaſtening,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Infer. II. Hence we learn the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Divine Grace, which can cauſe Afflictions (that are part of the Curſe) to turn to our benefit. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Afflictions are Paenal Evils, part of the Curſe which Sin has ſubjected Mankind unto. But tho' they be, and are not deſirable in themſelves, but are Evils to be deprecated; yet by the Grace of God, they may turn to our benefit. Indeed, (as has been hinted already) they can do us no good in themſelves, but as they are improved by God's Grace for this end. We ſee many Wicked men that are emptied from veſſel to veſſel, and harraſſed with all ſorts of afflictions, continue as bad as ever; it may be
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:039677_0032_10143AB491756FC8"/>
whilſt God's Chaſtening was upon them, they promiſed fair, and pour'd out a Prayer to God. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.16. But when the affliction is removed, they are as regardleſs of God as ever, and thereby evidence that they flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongues. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78 34, 36. But when the Sanctifying Grace of God co-operates with Afflictions, they then turn to the Benefit of thoſe that are Exerciſed with them. The Grace of God can bring meat out of this Eater, extract treacle out of this poyſon; and turn the very Curſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Bleſſing. When the affliction is ſanctified, it makes perſons more humble, holy, watchful, prayerful, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now I have learnt to keep thy Commandments.</hi> Pſal. 119.67. <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Uſe II. Of Conviction, and Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening, to thoſe that do not Pray, when under Affliction; or are remiſs &amp; negligent in this Duty. Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this ſhews a very ſtubborn and incorrigible frame of Heart: When God corrects a Chriſtian, he ſtands over him (as it were) as a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:039677_0033_10143AB7F4CDA788"/>
Parent over a diſobedient Child, &amp; ſays, ask my Pardon, and confeſs your fault, and I will ſpare you, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth his Son. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. <hi>Like as a Father pitieth his Children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</hi> Mal. 3.17. <hi>And I will ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him.</hi> And they that are negligent of this Duty, under affliction, they do (as it were) ſay, they will not beg, they will not pray tho' they die &amp; periſh; as ſome ſtubborn Children will ſay when they are Corrected. <hi>The Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thro' the pride of his Countenance will not ſeek after God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, That this is high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God; not only of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but his Power and Juſtice: By neglecting Prayer, perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn God's Authority in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; by neglecting it in affliction, they contemn his Juſtice and Power alſo; for hereby they dare him to do his worſt: hereby they run upon the point of his Sword, charge upon the the thick boſſes of his buckler. What horrid Contempt is this? <hi>Wherefore ſhould the Wicked contemn God? Are they ſtronger than He?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:039677_0034_10143ABB8F31B1B8"/>3. Conſider, That this is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to him. It's very provoking to Parents, when their Children ſlight their authority, and contemn the rod of Correction. But how much more provoking muſt it needs be, for God's Children or People to contemn His Authority, Juſtice &amp; Power: as they do, when they are not humbled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, or brought on their Knees by his Afflicting Hand? There is a Woe denounced againſt ſuch in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.1, 2. which denotes God's Anger. <hi>Wo to her that is filthy and polluted— ſhe obeyed not the voice</hi> (i e.) <hi>the voice of God in affliction; ſhe truſted not in the Lord; ſhe drew not near to her God.</hi> Hereby God will be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to do one of theſe two things; either to Correct ſuch the more, or to leave off Correcting of them. If the ſtill <hi>walk contrary to God, he will walk contrary to them, and puniſh them yet more.</hi> Lev. 26.21. If not, he will ceaſe Correcting of them. <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more?</hi> Iſa. 1.5. And tho' this may be pleaſing to ſuch (eaſe being what they deſire) yet nothing can be more fatal to them; for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are given over to a reprobate

mind, and vile affections to go on undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed in their Sins, which is the greateſt Judgment in this World: 'tis better to be afflicted, yea with the greateſt Soul Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, for theſe may iſſue in Converſion and Salvation; but the other is a black mark of Reprobation.</p>
               <p>Uſe 3. Of Examination or Trial in two Reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the End of God in Affliction. <hi>Affliction cometh not out of the duſt, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the ground</hi>: But it is ordered by an Infinitely Wiſe God, and therefore for ſome wiſe End. Let Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Chriſtians Examine what the End of God therein may be. <hi>Shew me ſays</hi> Job, <hi>wherefore thou comendeſt with me?</hi> Ch. 9, 10. So let Chriſtians Enquire, what it is that God aims at in afflicting them; whether it be to ſcourge them for their Sins, or to try them; ſometimes God afflicts to try the Grace of his Children, as in the Caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> tho' his Friends tho't otherwiſe, &amp; he himſelf could not well tell what to make of his afflictions at firſt. But moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he does it to ſcourge and chaſtiſe them for their ſins. Let us then Examine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Afflictions we have been under by the Waſting Sickneſs that has been in this place, &amp; by the Death of ſo many amongſt us, eſpecially of Leading and Principal Men: <note place="bottom">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:039677_0036_10143ABF75C3B7B8"/>
the Wilderneſs ſheathed in its Scabbard, but a juſt and holy God hath drawn the Sword of Peſtlilence againſt us, whereby poſſibly many more perſons have been cut off, than by the late War; yea, than by all the Calamities that have been in this place many years:) Now has God done this meerly to try us, how we could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and ſtoop to his Sovereignty, &amp; bear his Afflicting Hand? Or has he not done it alſo and chiefly, to humble us for our Sins? And what Sins hath God thus Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us for? May we not conclude, that he has herein been avenging the Quarrel of his Covenant, according to <hi>Rev.</hi> 26.25. That our abuſe of Goſpel Mercies, our ſlighting God's Inſtituted Worſhip, our Neglect of Prayer in our Families, and Cloſets, and our Lukewarmneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency in the things of God; have had a peculiar hand (as the meritorious Cauſe) in bringing this ſore Calamity upon us, which we ſhould never forget<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (nor the mixture of Mercy with the Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) And when we remember the Wormwood and the Gall, our Souls ſhould be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled within us: We have been often warned for theſe and our other Sins, from the Word of God, (I truſt with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs) for theſe God has been doubtleſs

Correcting us. Let us therefore <hi>ſearch and try our ways, and turn unto the Lord. Lam.</hi> 3.40</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let it put us upon Trying our ſelves, as to our Carriage under, &amp; the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have made of Affliction, that we may know whether God's End hath been attained. And this we may know by theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When Affliction ſerves to Embitter Sin to a Chriſtian, &amp; to Mortifie his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. There is a tendency in Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to do this, as it ſhews the Evil Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sin, in the ill Effects; &amp; if mens Eyes were opened to ſee this, they would hate Sin more than ever they loved it: There is nothing like ſanctified afflictions to Mortifie Sin, and to Crucify the Fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the corrupt affections and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Is Sin embittered to us? Are our Luſts mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by our Afflictions?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Have they ſerved to humble us under God's mighty Hand? This is another ſign of their being beneficial: Mens hearts are apt to riſe againſt God, when he Corrects them by his afflicting Hand; when it's ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only at their firſt meeting with affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, (for then there may be too little difference between the Saint and Sinner) but in their parting with it, it's a ſign that the Affliction don't work kindly; but when it ſerves to bring the Chriſtian to the foot of God, and to purge out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining rebellion and ſtubornneſs of the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:039677_0038_10143AC38F473D58"/>
heart, then it works kindly indeed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Grace be Excited, and a Chriſtian thereby quickened to Duty. Afflictions tend to quicken Grace, to draw it forth into Exerciſe. Tribulation works patience, patience experience, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5. If there be any Grace in the heart, it will be diſcovered at ſuch a time, as well as Corruption. Have your Afflictions, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ſtirr'd up &amp; exerciſed your Grace? Have they alſo quickened you to Duty, in which you might be remiſs or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent? Have you made one Prayer the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>? Or have you pray'd at all? Have you pray'd more earneſtly, &amp; conſtantly? If it hath been thus, it's to be hop'd that Affliction hath been ſanctified, and God's People have not been Corrected in vain.</p>
               <p>Uſe IV. Of Exhortation to the Afflicted to Pray. Farther, to quicken to Prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider the Relation you ſtand in to God. The Rod is in the Hand of a Father. It's your Heavenly Father, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that Corrects you. Whatever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is made uſe of, it is God that orders it. He makes uſe of it to Correct you; and he does it out of Love and Compaſſion to your Souls. <hi>Whom the Lord oves he chaſtens, and corrects every ſon whom he receives.</hi> He Corrects them to prevent their Everlaſting Ruine; therefore ſays the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. <hi>But when we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the Word.</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:039677_0039_10143AC698015708"/>
Be not diſcouraged therefore by the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; but let them rather quicken and encourage you to go to God by Prayer, with all holy Reverence and Confidence, as Children to a Father, able and ready to help you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, That Chriſt hath merited for you all you need, he Offers your Prayers with the Incenſe of his Merit; yea, he ever lives to make Interceſſion. Chriſt hath not only Redeemed you from the Curſe, by being made a Curſe for you, but hath purchaſed Grace, Glory, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good thing for Believers: all that is needful to carry them well through this World, and to Crown them in the next. So that you may go boldly to the Throne of Grace, and ask for all the fruits of Chriſt's purchaſe; for tho' you are not worthy, Chriſt is; and in the virtue of his own merit he preſents your Addreſſes, and intercedes with the Father, to grant your Petitions: He is therefore repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as ſtanding at the Golden Altar with much Incenſe, to offer it with the Prayers of the Saints; <hi>And the ſmoke of the Incenſe, which came up with the Prayers of the Saints aſcended up before God.</hi> Rev. 8.3, 4. Having therefore Brethren, boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt, by the Blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way, which he hath Conſecrated for us, through the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is to ſay his fleſh; and having an High Prieſt over the Houſe of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:039677_0040_10143AC81AA94970"/>
let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of Faith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 19—22.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider the Advantage and Benefit of Prayer in a time of Affliction, to get &amp; keep a good frame of heart, to ſtrengthen Faith and Patience to bear the burden of it. It's beneficial,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To get and keep a good frame of heart, even a humble, reſigned, compoſed frame. This frame of heart is needful for all Chriſtians, when under Afflictions. This brings Glory to God, and makes the Croſs ſit eaſy. Now Prayer tends to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and keep up this frame, by bringing the Soul to God's preſence, and awing it with his Sovereign Power, Wiſdom and Authority. It's meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born Chaſtiſement; this makes the will ſubmit, and the tumultuous paſſions are kept under a due regulation. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it's made ſenſible of its own vileneſs, and ill deſerts, which ſtop the mouth of Complaint. <hi>Shall a living man complain? Man for the puniſhment of his Sin?</hi> Nay by Prayer the Soul breaths out its troubles. <hi>Griefs</hi> (as one ſays) <hi>are eaſed by Groans: The heart is cooled and disburthened by Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Evaporations.</hi> The Mind is by this means made and kept calm and eaſie. There is an Halcyon Calm within, many times, when it's all ſtormy and tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous round about.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Prayer is needful to ſtrengthen Faith and Patience: To ſtrengthen Faith.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:039677_0041_10143AC9A17B3A60"/>
Faith is the Souls prop under Affliction. <hi>I had fainted unleſs I had believed,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.13. This will buoy up the Soul, when the breaking Billows of Affliction go over its head, ready to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it up. <hi>Unleſs thy Law had been my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, I ſhould then have periſhed in mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</hi> Pſal. 119.92. The meaning is, That if he had not believed in, and laid hold of God's gracious Promiſes, which were his comfort and delight, he could not have been carried thro' his Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now Prayer ſerves to ſtrengthen Faith in Chriſt, and the precious Promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that are <hi>Yea</hi> in him, &amp; in him <hi>Amen</hi>; hereby new ſtrength and vigour is derived from the Fountain to the Soul. Thus doubtleſs it was, with reſpect to <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith upon our Lord's Praying for him, <hi>that his Faith might not fail.</hi> Luke 22.31, 32. Tho' he fell, his faith did not utterly fail. Thus <hi>Paul</hi>'s Prayer in his affliction, brought new and freſh ſupplies of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' he had not preſent ſpeedy deliverance, yet he had ſupport, ſtrengthening Grace, which was better. <hi>My Grace ſhall be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for thee.</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9.</p>
               <p>Again, Prayer is neceſſary to ſtrengthen and increaſe a Chriſtian's Patience. This is alſo a very uſeful Grace under Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: This makes a Chriſtian eaſie in his mind, even when God's hand preſſeth him fore. Impatient, diſcontented perſons, they are ſo far from being eaſie, that their

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th verſe. <hi>If any of you lack Wiſdom? Let him ask it of God:</hi> Where (as one ſays upon the place) <hi>Wiſdom is to be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the Circumſtances of the Text, and taken for wiſdom or skill to bear Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo. as to Rejoice in them.</hi> Our Lord prefaces his Sufferings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with Prayer, to ſhow us the benefit and neceſſity of it in Affliction: and who ſo patient, meek, &amp; lamb-like as He: Go then, (thou poor afflicted Chriſtian, go) to God in the Name of Chriſt, and tell him, how hard thou art put to it, what a grievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den lieth upon thee, how weak thou art in thy ſelf; that thou doſt not deſire eaſe &amp; a releaſe, ſo much as Faith and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to bear what he is pleas'd to lay up. on thee; and wait thus upon him, and ſurely it will not be in vain.</p>
               <p>Uſe V. Of Conſolation, to thoſe under Affliction; who are thereby quickened to Prayer; that find on experience, that their hearts go out to God, for his Preſence and Grace, as well as for deliverance; for faith &amp; patience to bear his Afflicting Hand, as well as for eaſe and relief under it; who
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:039677_0043_10143ACF09251C38"/>
pray more earneſtly, conſtantly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly, than ever. This is matter of Comfort to you: In that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. You have therein a good evidence, a ſure token that God is with you, and will never leave nor forſake you. It is the fruit of his Gracious Preſence to quicken your hearts to, and in this Duty. If then you feel your hearts begin to move God-ward, and Chriſt-ward in the way of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or to move more livelily than ever: If your troubles cauſe you to look up in good earneſt, to the Throne of Grace, 'tis a ſign that God is preſent with you by his Grace, and what a comfortable Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is this. We count it a great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to have our Friends near us when we are Sick, or under any other Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but what is this to the having GOD preſent with us, at ſuch a time, enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, quickening and comforting us? As 'tis a great aggravation of trouble, for the Lord to withdraw the comfortable ſenſe of his Preſence and Love: This puts an edge upon Affliction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So on the contrary, his favourable, gracious, comforting, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Preſence, is a great alleviation thereof. Therefore the Pſalmiſt prays God not to be far off, becauſe trouble was near. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.11. Now this is a good Token that he is preſent with ſuch, when their hearts are quickened by his Grace; And it ſhould be a Comfort to ſuch. This was the Pſalmiſt's Comfort in his Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:039677_0044_10143AD16C0C9C80"/>
That God's Word had quickened him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.50. And as this is a ſign that God is with ſuch, ſo that he will never leave them, nor forſake them utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Indeed he may hide his face from them, or forſake them for a moment, as he ſpeaks. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.7, 8. But with great Mercies will he gather them. <hi>In a little wrath I hid my face,—But with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs will I have mercy on thee, &amp;c.</hi> So that God will not leave ſuch ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, and ſo he hath expreſly engaged. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. And this is evident from their ſanctified afflictions, wherein they may read their Heavenly Father's Love. And thoſe whom he once loves, he always loves. The gifts &amp; calling of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Repentance. What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort may this juſtly be, to an Afflicted Soul! Well may a Chriſtian ſay. <hi>Though God afflicts me, yet he will not forſake me, nor caſt me off for ever; and as long as I am ſure of this, I can the better bear what he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to lay upon me.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. This is a ſign that their Afflictions ſhall do them good, and end well. The chief thing that gracious Souls ſhould look at under Affliction is, that they may Glorify God, and get good by it. And they ſhould be afraid of nothing ſo much, as the contrary. Now when they ſee the preſent fruits, in a humble reſigned frame of Spirit in a Soul quickened to Duty: Why, this gives them comfortable encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging

grounds to hope, that it ſhall turn to their benefit. Yea, this ſhows them that it is ſo already. Now what a Comfort is this, to an afflicted Chriſtian; who may be ready ſometimes under temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to fear and ſay, as <hi>Job</hi> did, in his Calamities, <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thy face, and holdeſt me for thine Enemy?</hi> Job 13.24. They may be ready to fear that God is puniſhing as a <hi>Judge,</hi> and not correcting as a <hi>Father</hi>; and indeed if a Chriſtian were to bear Affliction only as the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his Sins, or the beginning of it, and were to receive no benefit by it; this were a killing Conſideration: But this no humble prayerful Soul has any reaſon to fear. He has no reaſon to look thus upon his Afflictions, how grievous ſoever; but as a Rod in the hand of a Father, who is ſeeking his benefit, &amp; not his ruine: Who does not willingly grieve the Children of men, much leſs his own; and who, when he does it, aims at their profit, that they may be partakers of his Holineſs: And the afflicted Chriſtan finds the truth of this, in God's cauſing Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to work for his good already, and not afflicting him in vain.</p>
               <p>And ſuch Afflictions will end happily. How grievous ſoever they are at preſent, they will in the end, yield the quiet and peaceable fruits of Righteouſneſs to them which are Exerciſed thereby. They that sow in tears, ſhall reap in joy: Weeping

Though none can tell how long God may pleaſe to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the Chriſtian with this or that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, yet the Scripture aſſures us, that the troubles of God's People ſhall End happily: And this light Affliction which is but for a moment, ſhall work out a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.
