            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE UPON THE PUBLIC WORSHIP OF GOD.</head>
            <p>AS it is the profeſſed buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the preſent ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to DEDICATE THIS HOUSE to the honor and Service of the Everlaſting GOD—a cuſtom ſanction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the friends of piety, from the earlieſt ages of the Church—And to thoſe who engage in it, with ſuitable views of the Object, and a proper
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024283_0004_0FC5E928ABF5A1B0"/>
temper of mind, it will yield a moſt rational and ſublime pleaſure—A croud of the moſt auguſt and tranſporting ideas ruſh upon the ſoul, at the very mention of a houſe on earth, wherein the God of heaven will deign to hear the prayers, and give anſwers of peace to mortal men.</p>
            <p>HENCE we find, when God made known his gracious intention of having an houſe built, wherein he might record his name and manifeſt his glory to his people, the king's, David and Solomon, were filled with pleaſing aſtoniſhment—and, like the three diſciples on the mount of transfiguration, they ſcarce knew in which regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were, whether in heaven or on earth.</p>
            <p>WHEN Solomon had completed the temple, and was about to invoke the Divine Preſence and bleſſing, the greatneſs of ſuch an honor and favor, nearly overwhelmed his pious mind; he ſtaggered at the promiſe—In the entrance of his prayer, he heſitates—After he had ſaid, O God of Iſrael, let thy word, I pray thee, which thou ſpakedſt unto thy ſervant David, of dwelling in this houſe, be verified! Here he checks himſelf—But will GOD, in very deed, dwell on earth!
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024283_0005_0FC5E92A2A9CA160"/>
The Heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee! much leſs this houſe!</p>
            <p>THE manifeſtation of the Divine perfections and preſence, is, to the pious, the dawn of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. This is the principal ſource of happineſs to angels in heaven, and men on earth.</p>
            <p>To exhibit the glory of God to mankind, and render them happy in it, is one grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of all the religious inſtitutions of God in our world. The Jewish oeconomy, with all its expenſive ſacrifices—the incarnation of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt—the promulgation and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of his religion—all concur to carry into effect this gracious deſign.</p>
            <p>AND the temple, the houſe of God, and the church, meaning, in general, but one thing, is the peculiar place, in which he has, hitherto, made the fulleſt diſplay of this glory.</p>
            <p>AND what, my hearers, was your profeſſed object, in erecting this elegant houſe, wherein you are now aſſembled? Was it not for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and to promote the preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs of yourſelves and children? If ſincere, it is an honorable intention. This is to be co-workers with Chriſt. This is well-doing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:024283_0006_0FC5E9315D3831B0"/>
BUT all is not yet done. This houſe cannot ſave us. In vain did the people of Iſrael cry, The temple of the Lord, while they pretended to worſhip God in that temple, without ſuitable views of him or themſelves.</p>
            <p>WHAT pity, that they ſhould loſe their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, loſe the bleſſing, and the temple, and loſe their own ſouls, by not worſhipping in a ſuitable manner, in the houſe built for that very purpoſe!</p>
            <p>IF we would avoid their unhappy fate, we muſt avoid that temper, expunge that leaven of hypocriſy that foamed in their worſhip.</p>
            <p>IF we have built this houſe for the glory of God, and to prepare ourſelves and children for heavenly happineſs, let us carefully purſue theſe important objects.</p>
            <p>AND, bleſſed be God, he has pointed out the way by which we may aſſuredly obtain them.</p>
            <p>KING DAVID, who firſt ſuggeſted the idea of building an houſe to the Lord, has alſo given particular directions how to behave in it, ſo as to accompliſh the purpoſes above hinted at.</p>
            <p>THAT method of worſhip is recorded in the ninety-ſixth Pſalm and ninth verſe, and Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in Letters of Gold, conſpicuouſly placed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024283_0007_0FC5E9332F924C88"/>
over our heads,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Directly over the Pulpit window, is placed the inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in golden capitals.</hi>
               </note>always to remind us, when we enter GOD's houſe, how he is to be worſhipped,
<q>
                  <l>O WORSHIP THE LORD IN THE BEAUTY OF HOLINESS.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>LET us conform to this, and the deſign of erecting this houſe will be accompliſhed, to our unſpeakable gain; and will be a better dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, than the offering of thouſands of oxen and rivers of oil.</p>
            <p>THE deeper to impreſs them upon our minds, they ſhall be the ſubject of our preſent diſcourſe, From which I ſhall
<list>
                  <item>I. MAKE ſome obſervations upon the act of public worſhip:</item>
                  <item>II. SHEW what may be implied in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Lord in the beauty of holineſs:</item>
                  <item>III. BY way of Improvement, mention ſome arguments to engage our compliance with the direction.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:024283_0008_0FC5E934A9D56D48"/>
I am firſt to make ſome obſervations upon the act of public worſhip: and this conſiſts of ſeveral parts: &amp; praiſe may be firſt mentioned.</p>
            <p>I. PRAISE has reference to God as the ſource of being, perfection and bleſſedneſs; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Beſtower of all favors, and as having already communicated his goodneſs. So fully are his eternal power and greatneſs exhibited in the works of nature and providence, that the very heathen, unaſſiſted by the light of divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, are inexcuſably guilty, if they neglect to ſee and glorify him. And if they are inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable in neglecting to pay this tribute of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, much more criminal muſt thoſe be, to whom are committed the lively oracles of God, and yet neglect this duty of praiſe, when thus doubly enforced.</p>
            <p>WE find the wiſeſt of men, when dedicating the temple, founding the firſt exerciſe of its worſhip upon this well-known principle. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the heaven and the heaven of heavens can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contain thee: and, there is no God like unto thee, who keepeſt covenant and mercy for thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants—And the angels in heaven, that world
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024283_0009_0FC5E93797F73930"/>
of viſion, perform their conſtant worſhip upon the ſame principle. Hence we are informed, that all the heavenly hoſts join, with one accord, "Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, juſt and true are thy ways, thou King of ſaints." And a multitude of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly hoſts praiſed God, at the Saviour's birth. The mercy and good-will of God, made known thereby, gave occaſion for new and nobler ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents to their angelic hallelujahs.</p>
            <p>So, praiſing God, in his houſe, is the neareſt approach men on earth can make, to the temper' the employment, and the pleaſure that now cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates round the hearts of the happy millions in heaven, while tuning their harps to the ſong of Moſes and the Lamb.</p>
            <p>SINGING the praiſes of God has a powerful tendency to ſoften, ſmooth and poliſh the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er feelings of our nature—it animates every part of worſhip; it creates, and leaves on the mind a reliſh for the ſacred employment, and gives a heavenly turn and elevation to the whole ſoul.</p>
            <p>LET the well-ſkilled muſical band glory in acting well their part, as ſuch important and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024283_0010_0FC5E93F013B4EC0"/>
effects attend the grace and power of their muſick.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER part of publick worſhip is, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Prayer. The foundation of prayer, is' our entire dependence upon God, his infinite fulneſs and ſufficiency, and our poverty and want. It is the making known our deſires to him in the name of Chriſt for things agreeable to his will. He has ſtiled himſelf a prayer hearing God. And has graciouſly proclaimed himſelf the Parent and Saviour of mankind. And that he has all poſſible bleſſings on hand—we need either for body or ſoul, time or eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>AND be it remembered,</p>
            <p>HE has alſo proclaimed, that he will be ſought unto, by his creatures for the beſtowment of theſe bleſſings. What a privilege! That ſuch indigent feeble creatures, who are ſurrounded all the way through life with numberleſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and attacked with complicated afflictions, every moment expoſed to the inſatiable ravages of death and the grave and the miſeries of hell. What a privilege, that we may warrantably
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024283_0011_0FC5E9424C9D7E00"/>
come to the houſe of God, and pray with the greateſt proſpect of ſucceſs, deliverance from ſome, ſupport under others; and that all may ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate together to purge off the dregs of ſin, and ſo work out for us an exceeding and eternal weight of glory! None ſhall ſeek the Lord in vain.</p>
            <p>AND Solomon's prayer, made at the dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the temple greatly corroborates this ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It may be conſidered as a propheſy of what God would do for his ſincere worſhippers in all ages.</p>
            <p>THE eyes of the Lord are open toward his houſe, night and day, where his name is, that he may hear the prayers and ſupplications made in it by all people; and he will hear and forgive—This, then, is the place more eſpecially pointed out to obtain relief under all common difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. When our land is invaded by enemies, and we are ſmitten before them, to the houſe of God may we repair, confeſſing our ſins, and praying, When heaven is ſhut up, and there is no rain, this is the place to obtain relief—if pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, for want of bread—if peſtilence, blaſting
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024283_0012_0FC5E943B6451100"/>
and mildew—in a word, if any plague or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs diſtreſs us, and cauſe mourning, the houſe of God and prayer, are the appointed reſort for relief.</p>
            <p>AND, as under the darker diſpenſation, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er might be made by all manner of people for all temporal bleſſings, with the greateſt proſpect of ſucceſs, if properly qualified: So under the more glorious diſpenſation of the goſpel, the greateſt ſpiritual and everlaſting bleſſings may be prayed for with equal probability of ſucceſs. Aſk, and ye ſhall receive, knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you, ſeek, and ye ſhall find. Where two or three are met together in my name there am I in the midſt of them!</p>
            <p>AND with more readineſs than the fond parent will give a morſel of bread to the hungry child that aſketh it, will I give the holy ſpirit to them who ſeek his aid. And in our preſent mode of exiſtence. We can neither aſk or receive a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bleſſing. If we obtain and poſſeſs this, we virtually poſſeſs all things in life and death, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſpirit that came forth from the living God, we ſhall infallibly be led finally to a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024283_0013_OFC5E9452AD40CEO"/>
with Deity. This is as great a bleſſing as can be enjoyed, and greater than can be comprehended—was not bought with corruptible things, ſuch as ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood of the Son of God. Kings and Emperors can grant no ſuch favors; all they can give, all they poſſeſs, is traſh, compared to this. It is not, however, to be expected, but by waiting upon the Author and Beſtower of every good and perfect gift in prayer.—<hi>Then</hi> the Lord o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the underſtandings of the diſciples; even when they were met together. True indeed he is not confined to this mountain, nor Jeruſalem, nor any particular place. But as yet in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom, he hath not ſeen fit to <hi>fill</hi> any place on earth with his glory, except his temple, his houſe. Here his ſaving power hath been ſeen and felt.</p>
            <p>THE houſe and worſhip of God are the ſchool and nurſery, where we and our children may more eſpecially be taught the language, the temper and employment of heaven. We ſhall not begin to love these devotional exerciſes, in that ſtate of perfection. The beginning muſt

be made in the lower ſchool, in God's earthly court. Our prayers, indeed, will ceaſe in heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, becauſe our dangers will be at an end, and our wants be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p n="3">3. ANOTHER exerciſe, is, preaching &amp; hearing the word of God. Hereby the duties men owe to their Creator, to each other, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are made known, and enforced. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conſequences of ſin, the danger, folly and miſery of it, evinced.—Life and immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſet before us, with the conditions and motives, by which we may all become partakers of the heavenly inheritance; and the work of grace, be perfected in the hearts of the penitent, unto the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>BUT then it muſt be the word of God, quick, and powerful, ſharper than any two edged ſword, piercing to the dividing aſunder the ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joints and marrow, a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. For in vain, ſaith the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, do men worſhip me, teaching for doctrines, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper, are alſo parts of worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:024283_0015_0FC5E94CA83DD1A0"/>
BY the one, we are initiated into the viſible kingdom of Chriſt—declared to be members of his family—Candidates for heaven. And our feeble helpleſs offspring committed to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Shepherd's care.</p>
            <p>BY the other, we ſhew forth the Lord's death; until he come the ſecond time, and receive an earneſt of the paradiſe of God. Theſe are the ſeveral parts which conſtitute the general act of public worſhip.</p>
            <p>BUT as the form profiteth but little, without the power—this worſhip muſt be performed in the beauty of holineſs. This is the direction of the text—and the qualification of its acceptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity—and is now to be attended to under the ſecond general head.</p>
            <p>II. To worſhip the Lord in the beauty of holineſs, undoubtedly has reference both to the <hi>object</hi>
and <hi>ſubjects</hi> of worſhip.</p>
            <p>I. As to the object, it is the Lord in the <hi>beauty</hi> of <hi>holineſs</hi>—Or God manifeſt in and by Jeſus Chriſt.—The bleſſed God poſſeſſes all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible perfection: nor are there any new excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies derived to him, from any of his works or creatures, through their infinite variety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:024283_0016_0FC5E950A00A54E0"/>
But theſe uncreated excellencies and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, may not all be exhibited at one time, or in one work.</p>
            <p>HENCE, it is ſaid, his eternal power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head are clearly ſeen by the things that are made, plainly implying that other divine perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are more fully exhibited elſewhere.</p>
            <p>His juſtice—faithfulneſs—goodneſs—his love to the human race—and his averſion from ſin, are manifeſted to us in the method of redemption.</p>
            <p>The beauty of holineſs and the glory of the Load are ſynonimous terms. God has declared that his glory conſiſteth in his being the Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger, and abundant in goodneſs Keeping mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for thouſands, and yet by no means clearing the guilty—waiting upon ſinners in order to be gracious to them—taking delight in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing happineſs upon thoſe whom juſtice had ſentenced to miſery—giving life to thoſe whom the law had condemned to death. God appears beautiful in holineſs, in being infinitely remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from every ſpecies of iniquity—in being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capale of admitting an unclean thing into his
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024283_0017_0FC5E952B0DCE940"/>
preſence: And yet, through the mediation of his Son, admitting the moſt unworthy of penitent ſinners, to a participation of his own holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And this in a way, ſo far from being derogatory to his juſtice and truth, that the higheſt glory ſhall accrue to God from this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act: for, while this heavenly peace and good-will are exerciſed toward men, in this way, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is given to God in the higheſt degree.</p>
            <p>Now, as the righteouſneſs, truth and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of God—his infinite abhorrence of ſin, are awfully displayed, and fully vindicated by the mediation of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from miſery, pardon of ſin, a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the divine nature, and endleſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, can be freely granted to men, through the ſame medium, and all this be confirmed, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and ſealed to believers by the oath of God and the blood of Chriſt, and God more ready to perform all this for us than we are to ſeek, and receive it—<hi>This</hi> may be termed the <hi>beauty of holineſs.</hi> But this illuſtrious and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent diſplay God makes of himſelf more eſpecially in his temple, in his earthly court.—
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024283_0018_0FC5E9555F02C820"/>
So that if the awful ſplendors of inflexible and eternal juſtice, the majeſty of invariable truth, united and myſteriouſly blending and mingling with the meaſureleſs ocean of redeeming love and mercy, may be called the beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the glory of the Divine character—Then to have this view of God, in his houſe, in the ſeveral parts of worſhip, is to worſhip him in the beauty of holineſs. This is one important qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of worſhipping God, as <hi>above</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is this view of the Lord that fills the breaſts of millions of ſaints and angels with admiration and joy. It was this VIEW OF THE LORD made David cry out, "how amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hoſts." This view of God it was, made the Sabbath and ſanctuary ſo welcome to his ſoul. To Contemplate, to love to praiſe and pray to a being thus glorious in holineſs, made his pious ſoul faint with longing to go up to the court of the Lord—"Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe they will be ſtill praiſing thee."</p>
            <p>THIS ſame beauty of holineſs, was, of old, ſhadowed forth in the ſanctuary. The ark was
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024283_0019_0FC5E9566C3F0AA8"/>
the token of the Divine Majeſty, containing the law. The mercy-ſeat entirely covered the ark. On this mercy-ſeat, God promiſed to meet Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and commune with him, and be intreated by him. At each end of this mercy-ſeat, a che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim ſtood with out-ſtretched wings, looking at each other, and looking upon the mercy-ſeat, admiring and aſtoniſhed—<hi>Exod.</hi> xxv. 17, 22.—This mercy-ſeat repreſented, and the benevolent cherubims ſaw, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who, by his atonement, covered our ſins, and bore the curſe of the law, for our ſakes, that God might look on the law through him, as fullfilled on our behalf: By whom God is reconcilling and uniting a loſt world to himſelf; in whom he will meet us, and commune with us, "through whom we may come boldly to the throne of grace, aſk mercy, and find grace to help us in every need."</p>
            <p>THIS is the glory! this the beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in which the Divine Being exhibiteth himſelf to us as the object of worſhip.</p>
            <p>But to worſhip God in the beauty of holineſs, has reference to the temper and views of the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024283_0020_0FC5E95B9D1B4B40"/>
               <hi>ſubject,</hi> as well as to the excellencies of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>"God is a ſpirit, and thoſe who worſhip him, muſt do it in ſpirit, and with the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
            <p>OUR temper and views, will, undoubtedly, be right in all parts of worſhip, when in union with the divine character as above deſcribed.—And this will be worſhipping in the beauty of holineſs.</p>
            <p>BUT this includes ſeveral particulars: As</p>
            <p>I. Submiſſion to the Divine Being.</p>
            <p>THE public worſhip of God, is a duty made known and enforced by divine Revelation; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the example of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. At Mount Sinai, it was appointed by a poſitive, moral and perpetual commandment of God. And in <hi>Heb.</hi> x. 25, it is recommended, "forſake not the aſſembling of yourſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether." In ſhort, it is a part of the law of God, ſo deeply engraven on the natural table of the human heart, that while almoſt every other divine impreſſion is eraſed, by the general defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this remaineth legible. Hence may be
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024283_0021_0FC5E95CDD624720"/>
ſeen, in every part of the world, among all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, certain places and times ſet apart for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip.</p>
            <p>It is evidently the mind and command of God.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE to worſhip him in the beauty of holineſs, muſt be from reſpect to his authority; becauſe it is his pleaſure, that we aſſemble our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together for this purpose: Making his command the rule of our conduct in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. That ſervant cannot be called obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent one, who does the very thing the maſter commands, unleſs he performs it in obedience to the command: He may do the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, for other reaſons.</p>
            <p>MANY people, formerly among the Jews, and doubtleſs among us, attend the place of public worſhip, not from reſpect to God, or his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but for other reaſons; and neglect the worſhip of God alſo for the ſame reaſons. Not becauſe God has forbidden it, I hope—not pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an intended affront to Deity: It is becauſe they chuſe ſo to do. But when it happens to be the good pleaſure of ſuch people to repair to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024283_0022_0FC5E95F94F7DBE78"/>
the houſe of worſhip, can they, in any ſenſe, be ſaid to worſhip God in the beauty of holineſs? If they are inattentive to his command, they certainly ſee no comelineſs in him, that they ſhould deſire and praiſe him; and ſo are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the firſt qualification, as it relates to a right view of the object; and of the ſecond, becauſe not in obedience to his requiſition.</p>
            <p>IF, then, we are deſirous of worſhipping God in the beauty of holineſs, let his ſacred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand have its proper influence upon us. Let us ſhew reſpect to, and honour his command, by waiting upon him in his houſe: And ſee to it, that we are right in the firſt particular.</p>
            <p>HE that honoreth me, I will honor.</p>
            <p>THIS is binding upon all charcters. The firſt ſtep in duty. And the man who neglects to pay this tribute of public homage to the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtands convicted of moſt deſpicable diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity. He proclaims himſelf deſtitute of the fear of God—of a ſuitable reſpect for ſocity, and is unawed by his own conſcience, or is blinded by the God of this world.</p>
            <p>ORDER is beautiful. God is a God of order. The order of his houſe and worſhip is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024283_0023_0FC5E961D8FBB4C8"/>
Here is a proper place; but I ſhall ſay nothing about coming in ſeaſon, at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hour of worſhip, or reſpecting decency of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour while in the houſe. There is certainly no beauty in levity—in gazing or drowſineſs; paſſing over theſe, I would obſerve, that a</p>
            <p>SECOND qualification of acceptable worſhip is, that our hearts be poſſeſſed with a ſolemn ſenſe of the greatneſs and majeſty of the Being with whom we have to do.</p>
            <p>IN the ſeveral parts of worſhip, we as really miniſter before God, as the Angels who abide in his preſence. We ſhould behave, at leaſt, with as much reverence and fear, as if we were in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the immediate preſence of God, in the midſt of all the bleſſed Angels, thoſe ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand who ſtand before him.</p>
            <p>HERE God meets us, as he did Moſes of old, on the mercy-ſeat—he communes with us—he ſees and knows our hearts, as perfectly as he ſees the Angels in heaven. Hence he requires us to worſhip him in the ſpirit, and with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. God and Angels are witneſſes of our temper and conduct; it is an affair in which life
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024283_0024_0FC5E966AC34A680"/>
or death is pending. No wonder good old Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob ſhould ſay, "How dreadful is this place! It is the houſe of God, the gate of heaven."—And holy Job, "Shall not his dread, or the dread of him, fall upon us?"</p>
            <p>GOD told the prophet, when thou ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the people, "thou ſhalt be as my mouth." And the apoſtle ſaid, "we beſeech you in God's ſtead." And even the heathen king of Moab, was impreſſed in ſuch a manner, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet told him he had a meſſage from the Lord, "he roſe up out of his ſeat," to ſhew his rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the Deity. In great kindneſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, has our Saviour Commanded, "Take heed how ye hear." Our very life dependeth upon it. "Hear, and your ſoul ſhall live."</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt diſengage ourſelves from the world. It's cares must be laid aſide. "Two maſters cannot be ſerved at the ſame time."—"Put thy ſhoes off thy feet," was God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to Moſes, "for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt, is holy ground." Our hearts may not bring their coveteouſneſs, nor worldly embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments with them, into the worſhip of God:
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024283_0025_0FC5E96AC0F3C258"/>
Theſe will obſtruct the entrance of his word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart, "by which we muſt be begotten to a lively hope."</p>
            <p>WHEN Abraham was about to offer ſacrifice, before he arrived at the appointed ſpot, he made a pauſe; and ſaid to his ſervants, "tarry ye here, while I go yonder and worſhip." So, when we come to worſhip, all worldly anxieties muſt be left behind; the beſt temporal things are but ſervants to men, as men ſhould be to God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT muſt be performed in the exerciſe of ſaith.—"He that cometh to God, to worſhip, muſt believe that he <hi>is,</hi> and that he is the reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them who diligently ſeek him." And our reward will be in proportion to the degree of our faith. The Roman captain, when he ſent to Chriſt, entreating help for his ſick ſervant' believed him poſſeſſed with <hi>divine</hi> power and willingneſs, to hear and relieve the miſerable; and he alſo felt his own unworthineſs to receive a viſit from him. Penetrated with the divine condeſcenſion and readineſs our Saviour exhibited in promiſing, even before he is requeſted,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024283_0026_0FC5E96C324727A0"/>
to go and heal him: The centurion, unable to ſuppreſs the grateful emotion of his ſoul, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, "Lord, I am not worthy that thou ſhouldeſt come under my roof, ſpeak the word only, and my ſervant ſhall be healed—and he was healed from that hour."</p>
            <p>With ſuch a faith, in the power, willingneſs and condeſcenſion of the Lord, to hear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ourſelves, and thoſe for whom we pray, ſhould public worſhip be performed. This is honoring the Lord.</p>
            <p>'DOES the fond parent, who is evil, readily give a morſel of bread to the beloved child—and will not the Lord, who is good, more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give ſpiritual bleſſings, even eternal life, to thoſe who aſk? Suppoſe it is the reward of ſeeking, it is not of debt, but of grace.</p>
            <p>'THIS is the faith in which the parts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould be performed. This is according to truth, and is beautiful. But, deſtitute of this faith, our worſhip will be deformed—the Lord viewed as an "hard and auſtere maſter, reaping where he has not ſtrewed." This is not beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. Faith, then, in the prevalency of Chriſt's
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024283_0027_0FC5E96F1DC6FC60"/>
interceſſion, in his all-ſufficiency, and readineſs to help, as being the day's man, between hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, is an important qualification of worſhip.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is alſo implied, that we have a ſupreme love to the object, and to the ſervice itself, for the ſake of the object.</p>
            <p>THOSE whoſe thoughts are wandering from thing to thing, to the utmoſt boundaries of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, while in the houſe of God, cannot be ſaid to worſhip him. But love will properly fix the mind. Love readily and naturally ponders and muſes upon its object. It will engage us in every part of worship, and render the whole pleaſant &amp; delightful. Love is deaf, and blind to all but its own object. God is the great object of worship; while addreſſing him; other objects ſhould be forgotten. It is the delight of ſuch perſons, to meditate in the law of the Lord.—Its diſcoveries allure their feet to the worſhip of God, and ſweetly detain them in the ſanctuary. The pſalmiſt was, no doubt, in a ſuitable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for worſhipping God; and it was the very language of love, when he ſaid; "I was glad
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024283_0028_0FC5E97508ACFA50"/>
when they ſaid unto me, come, let us go unto the houſe of the Lord." It was love that tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the harp of that ſweet ſinger of Israel. It was love induced him to ſay, that a day ſpent in the houſe of his God, was better than thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands elſewhere. It was love made him prefer the office of a door-keeper, to a dwelling in the tents of wickedneſs. This is the frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit requiſite to worſhip God in the beauty of holineſs. David loved the object—ſo muſt we; ſo muſt every one elſe, to worſhip as he did.—To ſuch ſouls, all the parts of worſhip, as means of intercourſe with God, yield a moſt delightful entertainment. The Throne of Grace is the very porch of heaven. Here we are allowed, without the imputation of preſumption, to plead with God, for the good of our ſouls, and the beſt of favours. Here we may wait, and here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his bleſſing.</p>
            <p>No doubt, the heavenly inhabitants worſhip in the beauty of holineſs; but what is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal qualification? What the temper which animates the worſhip of thoſe happy ſpirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove? It is love.—It is a ſervent unabating
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024283_0029_0FC5E97A2E433F18"/>
love to the adorable object. And as the object of our worſhip is the ſame in this houſe as in heaven, the ſame muſt be our love, at leaſt in kind.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The laſt qualification I ſhall mention, is, harmony and union among ourſelves. It muſt be performed in the exerciſe of brotherly kindneſs. All angry, tumultuous, and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſions, must be ſuppreſſed, huſhed into ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. This is enjoined by our Saviour, as a neceſſary duty. If we have aught againſt a brother, acceptable ſacrifice cannot be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until the means HE has preſcribed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, be firſt uſed. And the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, "Be kindly affectioned one to another. Put on kindneſs and charity." This is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Lord in the unity of the ſpirit, and in the bond of peace—In the ſpirit of Chriſt, by whom we are united to God, and one another. It is abundantly evident, that one important qualification in ſocial worſhip, is benevolence and harmony among ourſelves.</p>
            <p>THE king's daughter is all glorious within—and thus arrayed, Zion is the beauty of the whole earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:024283_0030_0FC5E97B28DB3E68"/>
THUS have I endeavored to ſhew, what views we muſt have of God—and what muſt be the temper of our minds, in order to worſhip the Lord in the beauty of holineſs.</p>
            <p>THE method of diſcourſe, renders it needleſs to ſay any thing to prove the divine character altogether excellent and beautiful; or that it is exhibited with a peculiar beauty of holineſs "in the face of Jeſus Chriſt." This is, no doubt, the view the Pſalmiſt had, of both, which exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that devout emotion of ſoul, emphatically expreſſed by the interjection O!</p>
            <p>FROM a contemplative view of the majeſty of God—the greatneſs of his ſalvation—and the ſolemnity of that all-important day, in which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs, the royal Preacher's ſoul, being warmed and dilated with the divine fire of inſpiration, generated ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments too inſtantaneous for particular utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; at <hi>once</hi> he brings them all forth.—<hi>O worſhip, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OF the many arguments, which might, with advantage, be urged on this occaſion, couched in this one letter, O! I ſhall mention but a few,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024283_0031_0FC5E97CCA2B2A28"/>
to perſuade us to worſhip the Lord as above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is reaſonable, correſponding to our nature. We were made for this buſineſs. It is a peculiar honor, indeed, God has conferred on mankind, in making them capable of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch worſhip. It is reaſonable that we have a right view of the divine character, as poſſeſſing the right of command; that we view ourſelves as his ſervants. If our exiſtence, and all our comforts are derived from, and he poſſeſſes the only right and power to diſpoſe of us, and has commanded us to worſhip him, it is reaſonable we perform that worſhip, as a public teſtimony, that we are the Lord's, and his ſervants.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour has informed us, that upon our compliance with even all his requiſitions, we are to view ourſelves as unprofitable ſervants. In a word, whenever, or wherever, people build ſuch a public houſe, they practically declare their obligations to worſhip God.—It is a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deeply interwoven with our very frame. The conduct of all nations and ages, in agreeing
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024283_0032_0FC5E98452EC5088"/>
to ſet apart ſome place or houſe for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, fully evinces it.</p>
            <p>IT requires but little reaſon to ſee even the dim light of nature teacheth the propriety of worſhipping God in the manner above deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. If he is infinitely great, and good, and merciful, and juſt, and all our help is in and from him, it is reaſonable, that we ſee and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it—That we apply to him for help. And thoſe who neglect to worſhip God, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after they have built an houſe for that very purpoſe, are guilty of ſelf-contradiction; they condemn their own conduct, at leaſt one part of it. They uſe all the means—ſuſtain all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and expenſe neceſſary to obtain a good end, and neglect it. That man would act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably, who ſhould be at the expenſe of buying, fencing, plowing, planting, hoeing and tending his field, with a view to a crop, if he ſhould totally neglect to gather in the full ripe corn, and ſuffer it to rot on the ground, while himſelf and family muſt periſh for want of bread.</p>
            <p>To what end have you been at the expenſe and labour of building this houſe? Was it not
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024283_0033_0FC5E98780301498"/>
that you might here worſhip the Lord God of your fathers?—form an acquaintance with his character, and your own; that you might here aſk mercy for yourſelves and children: That both you and they might be nouriſhed with the milk of the goſpel; that the bread of life might be broken to you; that you might grow in grace, to the ſtature of perfect men in Chriſt, and ſo be prepared for an admiſſion into the temple of God above in heaven? This is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; it is a glorious end; but it is not yet obtained.—Would you obtain it? There is a certain way.—O worſhip the Lord in the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of holineſs—and, as certain as there is a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, you will be received into it.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER this is the reaſonable ſervice God has required of us; this is the part aſſigned to man's performance on the ſtage of life. The heavens, and the earth, the ſea, and all creatures, are called upon, and they do worſhip God, but not in the beauty of holineſs; they are unable to ſee the harmony of the divine perfections in the method of redemption; much leſs can they learn to exerciſe and imitate them. But, as we
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024283_0034_0FC5E988AA130EA0"/>
alone, of all God's creatures on earth, can do both, let us play the man; act our part, while all nature around us is acting her's.</p>
            <p>AND, as the whole creation was made to groan in bondage, by our folly, has ſhe not a claim upon us? Does ſhe not demand our aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in prayer to God, and in praiſe for poſſible relief? Let us then, as the head and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the natural world, be the medium, and this houſe the place, where the feebler homage of the inferior creation, may be offered to the Lord. As Christ is the head of the moral, and medium through which our ſincere worſhip com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up before God; and as by our diſobedience to the command of God, the curſe was inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the earth, let us make the effort to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the creature from that vanity and bondage to which our folly has ſubjected it; and now do as much for her liberty, as we have done to rob her of that jewel, and ſubject it to bondage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. O worship the Lord in the manner here enjoined, becauſe every thing, ſhort of this, is inſufficient and unavailing, and will leave us deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of all part in the bleſſings connected with
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024283_0035_0FC5E98A59BD10C8"/>
true religion. The bleſſed God, in requiring us to worſhip in this manner, exhibiteth as much of his wiſdom and benevolence, as of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. He can no ſooner approve of, or be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with worſhipping him in any other way, than he can approve of, or be pleaſed with our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the bleſſing of eternal happineſs. If it is his will, pleaſure and delight, that all ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth, taſte the ſweet, the honey of religion, and partake of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; and if this is the only view of God; or manner of worſhip, that will not leave us deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of, but inſure theſe bleſſings, how can he approve of any other? Muſt not every other way be as offenſive and diſpleaſing to God, as it is dangerous and deſtructive to ourſelves.—His diſpleaſure againſt every other way, muſt be in proportion to the degree of its tendency, to our injury or miſery, which is the conſequence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left deſtitute of all the bleſſings connected with true religion; and of not having right views of God and ourſelves.—Therefore, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to worſhip God, without proper views of his character, without regard to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024283_0036_0FC5E992E91D8EF8"/>
ignorant of, and unaffected with our own ill-deſert and danger, without repentance and faith, without love to him, and deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him: In a word—Not "knowing the plague of our own hearts"—to pretend, I ſay, to worſhip God without <hi>either</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>And as to thoſe who are ignorant of the object of worſhip, and ſo deſtitute of every qualification, I would adviſe them to the ſame means the Pſalmiſt formerly uſed in a caſe ſomething ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar. He went into the ſanctuary of God, there he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood things of which before he was ignorant, reſpecting God's government. Let ignorant ſinners do likewiſe.</hi>
               </note>of these qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, is deluſive and vain. And however we may flatter ourſelves with peace and ſafety, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and miſery are in all ways unapproved of God.</p>
            <p>BENEVOLENT is that ſeemingly ſevere inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of Jehovah, deſigned to correct ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal a miſtake, and prevent the inevitable deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion connected with it. Who hath required this at your hands? Bring no more vain obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As I live, ſaith the Lord, my ſoul hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, nor with any method, though a religious name be tacked
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024283_0037_0FC5E994AE4A3840"/>
to it, by which they are ignorantly going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>KNOWING the propenſity of human nature to deceive itſelf, with the appearance and ſhadow of reality and good, eſpecially in matters rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to God, and its own eternal ſalvation, the pious and benevolent ſoul of the Pſalmiſt was moved. His piety, benevolence, pity and fear, burſt from his heart in the energetic language of the text, O! worſhip the Lord, &amp;c.—As if he had ſaid, Beware of the ſin of neglecting to worſhip God—beware of the danger of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in a careleſs, irreverent, hypocritical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: And eſpecially beware of doing it by way of atonement for daring wickedneſs, and with a view of obtaining a liberty of perſiſting in it. For God cannot be deceived, nor will he be mocked; nor will he hold that ſoul guiltleſs, that taketh his name in vain: All which is aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully evinced from the ſignal and inſtant deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many who have adventured in unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ways—and which, no doubt, are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our warning. The two ſons of Aaron, for neglect of order, for their careleſs, irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024283_0038_0FC5E9962C4782A0"/>
behaviour, were deſtroyed by fire from the Lord. Uzzah, for his too officious uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded touch of the ark, was ſtruck with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant death.</p>
            <p>AND if, with a deviation from the appointed way of worſhip, under thoſe carnal ordinances, ſuch bodily calamities were connected, no doubt, under the more heavenly mode of worſhip, which now obtain ſpiritual diſeaſe and death, are connected with, every way, excepting by Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>the</hi> way, the truth and the life.—</p>
            <p>HENCE the Apoſtle expreſsly ſays, That for not diſcerning the Lord's body, i. e. not having right views of the object, nor a proper temper in that part of worſhip, "ſome were ſick, and ſome dead."</p>
            <p>WE ought, therefore, to be cautious how we worſhip, how we hear, &amp;c.—ſince there is but one commanded ſafe way, even the name of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the beauty of holineſs.—This is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, ſafe and pleaſant—and all others are dangerous as difficult. Our Saviour, ſpeaking of the attempts of ſinners to approach God in other ways than by the <hi>door,</hi> connects climbing and danger, and criminality together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:024283_0039_0FC5E997AA801C98"/>
THOSE who neglect and refuſe to enter in by the door, ſhall be counted thieves and robbers: To ſinners out of Chriſt, "God is a conſuming fire."</p>
            <p>IT appears the Pſalmiſt directs to the only ſafe method of worſhip. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is the only pleaſant and delightful way. To thoſe who attend public worſhip with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe views of God's goodneſs and mercy and holineſs—without a view of the neceſſity and ſufficiency of the Redeemer's atonement and righteouſneſs—without love—without a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to reſemble him, and be with him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, how heavily does the hour of worſhip hang upon ſuch people? how ſmall an obſtacle will prevent their attendance! how ſeldom do they come! how late when they do! how drowſy while here! Nothing but the addreſs, novelty or variety of the ſpeaker, can gain their attention. Divine truth, the beauty of holineſs, is inſipid to them; Chriſt has no charms—the ſeals and pledges of his love—the very blood of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they count as nothing—they long to have the worship over—and the Sabbath gone. Honey itſelf is not ſweet to their taſte—light it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024283_0040_0FC5E9A0612D9B48"/>
is to them darkneſs. Such people loſe not only the firſt fruits of heaven, but all the coſt and pains they are at in building a houſe, and maintaining the worſhip of God, is loſt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though not to the cauſe, for the earth ſhall ſupport the woman. And they will alſo loſe heaven itſelf.</p>
            <p>But however dull and inſipid the worſhip of God may be to a carnal mind, this is for want of a right view of the object, and a ſuitable temper towards it: For nothing can be more pleaſant, nothing more animating to a ſoul ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of its own importance and danger, than the view of thoſe thouſands of mercies and bleſſings God is keeping for all thoſe who come to him through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Is there any thing on earth—can all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, pleaſures, and honors of this world, and all the gay ſcenes of nature, ſuppoſing them all to fall to the ſhare of one man, can they all put ſuch joy and gladneſs into the ſoul, as the light of God's reconciling countenance, ſhining upon it through the medium of his word and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in his houſe? Here is the place where God and Chriſt are wont to make themſelves
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024283_0041_0FC5E9A229FD15A0"/>
known to thoſe who ſeek. It was when the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were met together, the Lord opened their underſtandings, to ſee the glory and beauty of the divine perfection ſhining in the plan of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: And GOD himſelf condeſcending to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech ſinners to accept of pardon and eternal life; this is reaſon enough, not only to remove all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing fear, but to awaken, nay, to fill the ſoul with a joy that is unſpeakable and full of glory. To ſuch a ſoul, prayer, hearing the word read and explained, and praiſe, the worſhip of God is above all things, the moſt entertaining. Theſe views of the excellency of the God of Jacob, would make David forget that he was the hero, the king of Iſrael, and the three diſciples, that they belonged to this world. In an extaſy of delight, the one crieth out, "How amiable are thy taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, O Lord of Hoſts, my ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord, my heart and my fleſh cry out for the living God. Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy houſe, they will be ſtill praiſing thee. A day in thy courts, is better than a thouſand elſewhere. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a door-keeper in the houſe of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedneſs." And
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024283_0042_0FC5E9A3F80A0220"/>
the other, It is good for us to be here. This is the pleaſure—this the delight of worſhipping God in the beauty of holineſs. And as the Pſalmiſt wiſhes every ſoul to taſte and ſee that the Lord is gracious; he exhorts, O, come wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord in the beauty of holineſs.</p>
            <p>A 4th Reaſon. It is the only method to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us to aſſociate with ſaints and angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—to fit us for thoſe exalted employments—that reſt which remaineth for the people of God. Nothing on earth ſo nearly reſembles heaven, as an aſſembly worſhipping God, united in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekneſs, faith and charity. No wonder the diſciples ſhould ſay, it is good for us to be here. Thoſe who ſincerely love the gates of Zion, the worſhip and the order, are candidates for heaven, making conſtant advances toward that happy region. And when they are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the temple above, will naturally and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily join in that employment, for which they have been fitting in the houſe of God on earth.</p>
            <p>ARE theſe the principal motives that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced you patiently and chearfully to ſupport the expenſe of time and property in building this houſe? That you might publicly honor
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024283_0043_0FC5E9A6AA330A20"/>
God—ſecure an intereſt in his favour—taſte the ſweetneſs of redeeming love, and be preparing for the bleſſed ſociety in heaven; and that your children alſo, might become partakers of the ſame heavenly benefits? Were theſe your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, in erecting and beautifying, and now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating this houſe to the Lord? And has not God favored your undertaking, in a general good underſtanding among yourſelves? Has not almoſt every man voluntarily and repeatedly come forward, and exerted himſelf in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing this good work? Not a life loſt, nor a limb broken—Health, ſafety and plenty, have been granted you, all which have tended to lighten the burden, and facilitate the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>THE houſe is finiſhed to mutual ſatiſfaction.</p>
            <p>HERE you are aſſembled together, with your children, preſenting yourſelves before the Lord. Solemn and pleaſing proſpect!</p>
            <p>THIS, then, is the only thing that remains unfiniſhed. Do but <hi>this,</hi> and all will be happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compleated.</p>
            <p>NEED any thing further be added, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you to reap the fruit of your exertions?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:024283_0044_0FC5E9AD40B6A1E8"/>
DOES not every circumſtance of this meeting, call upon us, and urge our inſtant compliance with the king's directions? Does not yonder houſe, though dying, ſilently ſpeak to us—does it not remind us of the certain and ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and diſſolution of our clayey tabernacles, our natural bodies? and the neceſſity of ſecuring, in ſeaſon, a new and better habitation for our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſouls!</p>
            <p>WAS it not prudent to prepare and build this more commodious Houſe before <hi>that</hi> was totally worn out? And will it not be more wiſe, to look further forward, and be preparing, by a right conduct in this houſe, to enter the far more glorious courts of heaven?</p>
            <p>THE unanimity and public ſpirit, exhibited in erecting this houſe, ſeem gently to whiſper and urge the propriety of harmony in worſhipping.</p>
            <p>AND the houſe itſelf, from every corner, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choes the ſame language.—The proportion of its parts, its ſimplicity and neatneſs, point to the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>HARK! Do I not hear a voice! Does the houſe ſpeak? or a beam from the wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me? Liſten!

            </p>
            <p>THIS is the way.—walk ye in it. This voice is from heaven.</p>
            <p>LET it be engraven upon our hearts. It will then be our paſſport into the Aſſembly of the firſt-born of God in the heavens.</p>
            <p>THUS have I endeavored to illuſtrate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the text to the preſent occaſion, as was propoſed.</p>
            <p>A WORD ſhall cloſe.</p>
            <p>IF the object of worſhip is glorious in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—if the qualifications of the ſubject are beautiful—if the act is reaſonable, ſafe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant—the motives generous, and the end happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—if the circumſtances of the preſent ſolemnity, the decays of the old houſe, and the beauties of the new—if all theſe call upon us, let their united influence animate our endeavors, that our future conduct correſpond to their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral voice.—And that our worſhip in this houſe, be as much more ſpiritual, and our chriſtian temper ſhine forth as much more conſpicuous than formerly, as the new houſe excelleth the old in convenience and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. Let us, by a forgiving temper, by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024283_0046_0FC5E9B06A6D8AB0"/>
kind offices, by a ſincere conformity to the precepts and example of the divine Author of our religion: By this, I ſay, let us convince each other, and our neighbours, that we have new and better hearts to <hi>ſerve</hi> God, as well as a new and better houſe to the <hi>name</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>HAVE we forſaken the former houſe? is it conſigned over to oblivion? Let us alſo forſake and conſign to the ſame bottomleſs pit, all the old leaven of hypocriſy, ſtupidity, biggotry, ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ill-will and revenge. In a word—with the old houſe, let us all put off the old man, with his corrupt deeds; and, with the new houſe, let us put on the new man, which, after God, is created in knowledge, righteouſneſs, and true holineſs.</p>
            <p>IN this new houſe, let us, as new-born babes, deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that we may grow thereby to the ſtature of perfect men in Chriſt Jeſus, that when theſe earthly tabernacles ſhall be diſſolved, we and our children may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into that houſe built without hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the heavens. God of his infinite mercy grant this to each ſoul, for Jeſus' ſake.</p>
